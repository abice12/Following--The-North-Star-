only act as an incentive with parties
to communicate the best influence vvher
they do occur set out right wit

f or two simple yet supporting truth
for them to fall back upon as afford
ing relief lor the present and solace
for the future a on will instantly per
ceive that  allude in the first place
to the duty of impressing them strongly
with the conviction that they are not

that he will one day bring out those
that are hound with chains and
place the solitary in families speak
to them of the sun of righteousness
jet them know that it is shining more
and more deeply into the hearts of
men and setting in a far clemer light
than it appeared a few years ago the
w ickedness of calling them the absolute
property of their masters tell them
tin vou ought to do so t no man upon
earth or woman either should he igno
rant of the great truth that he or she
belongs to himself or herself and that
they have a right to their personal
liberty even if they choose wickedly
to abuse it by throwing themselves
over the first precipice they came to
but teach them at the same time that
there must be no violence to establish
this right inspire them with an invig
orating reliance in the goodness of their
cause and with gratitude for the efforts
of those who are so zealously labour
ing to promote its success let slaves
be taught that which all men ought to
know that the principle of good must
finally triumph over the principle of
evil for that our creator is in sympa
thy with us when we practically enforce
the former and that we are drawn
aside by our own bad passions and
desires when we follow after the
latter let slaves be taught what if
their masters had learnt they would
never have been slaves that a gospel
liati been preached in the world which
forbids violence which forbids the in
jurious treatment of any man teach
the slaves to obey this gospel though
their masters have disobeyed it the
enslaved through means of a system
vitiated and rotten to its very core
are iu a state of unjust subjection to
their earthly masters hut the enslaver
is in a state of direct rebellion to his
heavenly master for no man can make
a of another man without a
shameless an impudent defiance ofi
that vrorldcompelb precept anew
commandment  gtv unto you that ye
love one another
one idea it would appear of the
highest importance to communicate to
slaves  was one day conversing with
a highly gifted and benevolent friend
on antislavery subjects and made use
of the teim dtgraxitil as applicable to 
the slave my friend objected to it
saying that he greatly preferred us
ing the term injured as nothing could
degrade a man he lie who or what lie
might but voluntary sin should not
selfrespect he instilled into the mind of
the slave on this very ground and
should he no he taught that if he per
forms his allotted task well and his
master is either brutal or licentious j
he is the really degraded being lie is
really the slave for ins is the bondage
ot iniquity the desire the hope
tlie expectation of freedom should
constantly kept up while every feel
ingot resentment against their masters j
in the nitiitls of slaves should he as
const anti v kept down the expecta
tion would give an elevation to their
thoughts which would tend to fit them
fin that freedom wdicli the good time 
coming has certainly iu store for
them while the absence ot resentment
would justify the assertion to the truth
of which no one more readily assents j
to than myself that the african race
are admirably qualified by the gentle
ness of their disposition to exhibit to
the world a bright manifestation of i
the milder virtues of the true christian j
chaiacter how happy an illustraj

our own w est india slaves upon their
emancipation and how cheering is it
to read the numerous and well support
ed proofs of the kind politeness and
religious sensibility which the culti
vated african so very generally mani
fests that iod is no respecter of
persons is a solemn bible truth and
it their masters object to its being
taught to slaves they ought in one
instant to perceive that they are car
rying on a system wholly at variance
with bible truth the great apostle of
the gentiles has declared that in
christ there is neither male nor femule
bond or free but that all are one in
him and if any one objects to his
slave being made a recipient of this
truth let him ask himself the reason
win the same apostle lias said
remember those in bonds hs bound
with them if tins passage too is to
be cautiously concealed from the slate
may not the reason why be because
the master fears that uti intelligent
slave may discover the true meaning
of tiiis exhortation does it not mean
as spoken to the just man to the
philosophical christian and to the de
voted philanthropist of the year 
if ye remember those in bonds as
bound with them break these bonds
since ye do all prefer fieedom to slave
ry but ce to it that ye use no other
means tor this purpose than those
which god himself has put mtn your
hands namely a vigorous intellect a
resolute purpose a determined will

an internal slavetrade is the neces
sary consequence of slavery wherever
it exists ayhen men become merch
antable commodites or property as it
is impinush termed they are subject
to all its incidents to the degrada
tion of sale and bequest and to the
cruelty of separation from kindred and
friends in the united states it is re
ported that hltmmt slaves change hands
every year and in other slaveholding
countries it is probable that a pro
portionate number suffer the same sad
fate but though in some of its fea
tures nothing can exceed the revolt
ing character of this traffic it yields
in the sum of its horrors to the foreign
african slavetradp which is carried on
chiefly to supply brazil and the spanish
colonies with slaves
it is impossible to arrive with ac
curacy at the number of slaves exported
from africa since threat britain under
the influence of humane and
feeling was led to abolish it through

we go to the place where the pad

slave is tied up by tbe hands and down
by the feet and we were particular
ly informed of the privileges which lie
enjoyed though the master may
punish the slave as much as he choos
es before he enters the sugar house
yet if on account of irritation or in
sult he should thoughtlessly strike the
slave after lie has reached the house
and before he is tied hand and foot
and his limbs stretched to their utmost
tension by a pulley to make the sufler
mg more acute if the master st likes
him previous to this he is find a huu

while the punishment is proceeding
the slave has the privilege which it is
said he estimates very highly of speak

words of saving what he pleases
without the risk of being punished
nipre than the regular twenty lashes
cm that day
from the whipping room we pass
to the place of confinement where
there are but few slaves kept as the
master does not wish to lose their ser
vices for any length of time but here
in solitary confinement from one to
six months the negro is kept and not
only as in the philadelphia prison are
they not allowed to see or speak to the
public but without the garden which
is attached to the cells of the latter
prison they are deprived of any oppor
tunity of hearing the voice of a chap

the aversion of the slaveholders to
the use of the whip seems to be more

douglass and liis english
friends
i began this letter simply intending
to tell you about a visit we bad lately
from frederick douglass and bis eng
lisb friends and to make a tew remarks
on the disgraceful treatment they ex
perienced at the hands of the aptain
and passenger on board the alidu
corning down from albany to new
york if  have not kept to my story
you must attribute it to the fact that 
urn a womanand you know the cele
brated dr potts of st louis says that
we have no power of connected rea
soning and indeed very little solid
intelleect of any sort and hence i could
not keep to the point lie did say that
we could write letters but lie must
have meant short paragraphs made up
of odds and ends and pretty sentiments
consequent on the extreme amiability
be attributed to us not i think he said
a little lower than the angels the
compliment is antiquated ive no
doubt but isaac said the same to re
becca when be lifted her oft tbe camel
but you would still advise gratitude
would you not
well of douglass and the ladies 
would observe to begin with that the
latter are warm friends of frederick
who in europe felt honored by his ac
quaintance and delighted to extend to
him the hospitality of their home they
are educated accomplished women
having not only a genuine selfrespect
but the additional strength and calm
unquestioning sense of the right to in
dependence which a superior position
in society in england always ensures
they have been lately traveling on tbe
continent in austria germany fete
and are now making a tour of pleasure
in the united slates judge then my
friend of what their first impressions
were on reaching the model republic
as the elder of the two described to
ine m a most graphic and simple
manner then journey across the ocean
and first introduction to american
prejudice in tbe franklin house in
new yoi k i cannot do better than give
you a brief sketch of the same only re
gretting that i have it not in my pow er
to convey at the same lime the ap
propriate gesture and varying tones of
voice in which this and to them extra
ordinary experience was related
the captain then of the sarah
sands was a delightful man juat the
one to make the passengers forget the
length of the voyage which was as
you may remember very long from
the fact that a cylinder hurst and they
had no duplicate they were two
weeks behind time the sateen cabin
passengerswith their cheerful captain
had what we call grand times not
withstanding the delay and laid many
plans for social reuntoukc when they
should have reached port one gen
uqnab mr peuglu md
w
admired turn vastly so out friend
were enabled to talk over the event
and exchange opinions as we sis
love to do whetv we meet others woi
appreciate those whom we delight t
honor reform both in church am
state was discussed in council during
the voyage all went on swimingly
and long before the ship reached new
ork it was decided thru they sboulc
all put up at the same hotel it was
an undeiuood thing tiiat mr d was tc
meet the ladies on tlh arrival of the
steamer hut her tardy arrival disarran
ged plans and two or three days elap
sed before they met the mutual in
terest felt in the character of doug
lass made him to a certain extent the
theme of friendly conversation when
lo it reached refined american eaia
that a colored man oh shocking to re
latei was expected lo call on some of
the boarders in that hitherto unpolluted
house there were side looks and
whispers doubtless long before out
unsuspicious friends became aware of
the fact for they all uninspired as they
werelabored under the impresses they
should never realize any thing of this
vulgar prejudice which they had heard
of by letter and newspaper it did no
doubt exist in some other and lower
sphere but theytheir position was
well known and as to mr douglass
he ranked far above the boarders at
the franklin houselie was a man of
genius one of natures noblemenat
last a faint rumor reached them cau
tiously and timidly expressed that it
would not do herethat it was a
question ifmr douglass would he ad
mitted into the house that certainly he
would not be permitted to take a meal
at the table it was considered very
much out of the way see you see
they did not treat the matter after the
manner of the n y express at first
hut were very tender and as i said
cautious milk for babes you know
w hen they had been in the country
six months they would view things very
differently said old english friends
whom they sought in their perplexity
no insinuation could be more insulting
than this as if six months in the model
republic was sufficient to divest them
ot common sense and common human
ity oh but they persisted we
had no more idea of the thing than you
have when first we came we invited
mr a most gentlemanly person
to our house very frequently he was
a most gentlemanly and intelligent per
son buthad be swindled his host jui
of hia property o no lut they had
gotten over all that felt quite other
wiseit would not do as lie was colo
red in this country the darkness
was becoming visible the fellow
passengers who had entreated lengthy
visits the delightful captain who had
been a father to them became by de
grees inoculated with the diseae or
ratherinstead ofpresenting a bold front
yielded to the american chimera called
puplic opinion on board the steamer
such views would have been ridiculed
hut now they insinuatedin a hesitating
apologetic tone reallymy dear
madamloh i think it inexplicable
but then i assure you that ismv
dear friend the people here have most
peculiar prejudices xe very well
our friends answered we will change
our boaidng house to where we can
receive our guest in ihe wealthy
and populous city of new ork
such is the subserviency to the prejtij
dice against color that was no easy
matter meanwhile douglass ariived
and was allowed to meet his friends
not in the public parlor w herein they
directed tie should he ushered hut in a
private parlor which nevertheless was
not private since two individuals were
stationed there to report on the extia
ordinary event of three friends meeting
one of them being some shades darker
than the others
our english friends were not leaning
persons to bend with the breeze tuey
liver ihtough it ami improved m health
alter the new york anniversaries
they accompanied douglass lo u
home and reluming to ihiladeljdiia
where d was called to deliver an ad
dress they found themselves on board
the alula on the ringing of the din
ner hell they descended and seated
themselves at the table soon murmurs
of disapprobation filled the cabin soinei
southerners weie on board to whom
the proximity of a dark skm is on all oc
castons peculiarly obnoxious the
stew aid ordered douglass to leave the
table he asked for authority ami af
ter considerable insolence thefapain
male and others came lushing down
using foul language and declaring
they would have no niggers eating
with the white people on that boat
resistance was in ram the ladies
were indignant in the extreme and
when douglas was refused a hearing
the elder of the two stepped forw aul
and aked will a lady he permitted
to speakthere was a pause and
she continued  have long heard of the
chivalry and courtesy of the americans
with some incredulity but now  am
satisfied of the truth of it since you
have even carried it so far as to deprive
two english strangers of a meal
 may not have given the words but
barely the sentiment conveyed they
then left the cabin for of course thev
would not remain if their friend was ex
cluded and on their leiviug the vul
gar crowd gave three cheers for them
they had then to remain without food
from early dawn fill night the toward
even refusing them a cup of coffee and
the bar tender refusing to sell them the
smallest biscuit the ladies weie
suffering from exhauxtation and with
shame be it said not one passenger
on board that boat had the humanity or

wish to speak himself hut the people wished
to heat the other candidates mr turner
continued half an hour longer during hi
remarks he read the article from mr lays
paper which was the cause of the citizen ol
i aington tearing down ins press
after mr turner had concluded his re
marks mr lay asked mr chenault wht
was about taking the stand to permit him ti
make an explanation which he did
mr clay remarked that the article spoktr
of was not written by himself that it appear
ed m his paper w hile he was lying dangerous
iv ill that it was written by a southen
slaveholder as lie thought for the sole pur
pose of having his press destroyed majoi

mr smith lives m a common white house
about two miles distant from the village of
peterboro there are no luxurious sofas to
lounge upon no costly carpets to tread upon
 no magnificent mirrors in which to admire your

mgly furnished the carpets chairs tables j
beds c are more useful than ornamental i
found mr smith to be an accessible sociable j
pleasant man thoroughly familiar w ith the his
tory of the reformers and the reformatory
movements of the day it is well known that
this distinguished man stands at the head ol
the most radical class of reformers jle stands
out so far in front of his age that slowmoving
i conservatives cannot appteciate the man nor
i his motives he denounces rum patronizing
and proslavery churches consequently all
the anathema raaranathas of unsympathising
and unsanclified professors of religion are hurl

at his table night and morning he lays the sa
crifice of a broken and contrite spirit on the
altar of family worship every day he careful
ly studies the scriptures and what is of more
importance he show s by a godly life and con
versation that lie is not unacquainted with ex
perimental heavenborn christianity
few men have done more than he to assist
the poor to clothe the naked to feed the hun
gry to reform the drunkard and liberate the
bondman the hotels owned by him in differ

esq of new k oik after noticing the abun

hardships which must bo undergone to secure
it thus
any sober industrious prudent man
can in my judgement realize at an ounce per
day besides his board and this i assure
you will not more than pay for the toil and
pnvation he is forced to endure for it he la
irors upon the rivers and streams he must
stand with lus feet in the water every mo

in aelouii of dust and no man can distinguish
his best friend by the color of ids skin ihe

of good food and rest but that is out of the
question he must cook his own food ot go
without it
i have seen men living w ithout any other
food than flour mixed with water formednn
tn a kind of dough and baked in the hot ashes
this kind of living forces them to the tavern
and the diggins abound with them where
they pay from four to twelve shillings for a
glass of liquor a halfbox of sardines or
food of that kind is purchased at from 
to  per box which manv will eat at one
meal the result is that living in this way
produces sickness and disease and many

dear readers prostration by a severe
illnessof more tlian ten daysstanding and
from the effects of which i have not yet re
covered has hindered my writing for the
north star as well as detained mo for the
presentfrom the further prosecution of my
antislavery tom in the west on arriv
ing at detroit the ild july in full hope of
having a successful series of meetings in that
city commencing on the memorable th july
i was stricken upon the threshold with an
illness that completely thwarted my hopes
i was seized with a burning fever violent
headache and excruiating pains in all my
limbs which at once brought me to my bed
my illness continued unabated during three
days on the fourth day i was somewhat re
lieved and the heat being intense at detroit
my friends caused me to be removed from that
place to windsor on the canada side where
they hoped that the cooler and puier atmos
phere would act favorably to my
 remained at windsor four days wilh little
amendment and became satisfied by my ex
perience there that my health would not be
equal to the fulfilment of my appointments
i the kind friends travelling with me and my
fiiends in detroit generally counseled my
return to the east as the best thing l could
do in the circumstances allconcuired in the
opinion that considering my debility it would
be dangerous forme to visit those regions
where cholera prevails uniting with their
opinion as soon as i was able i took the
hendrick hudson from detroit to buffalo
and came immediately thence to niagara
falls where i am now enjoying the refresh
ing breezes and invigorating atmosphere in
separable from this locality  am happy to
be able to state that much of the disappoint

several towns where i am announced to speak

meetings of my esteemed friend and co
worker charles lenox remond his well
known eloquence and ability makes it un
necessary for rne to commend him to the
consideration and regard of those to whom lie
may come he has kindly consented to go
foiward with our common appointments and
to lav before the public the claims of the
north siar  predict that ins efforts among
i the colored people of the west will awaken
among them a deepei feeling a more intelli

and nobler aspirations than they have hither
to felt or known may ins strength be equal
to the magnitude of the work be lure him is
the prayer of his sincere and de voted fellow
laborer
 deeply regretted my inability to see
the colored citizens of detroit at large
i had heard much of them and aidently
desired to grasp their friendly hands but
this pleasure was denied me  saw but few
of them but such as i did see left a most
favorable impression upon my mind they are
from all  can learn a really intelligent enter
prizing and industrious people and in charac
ter and conduct they reflect great credit upon
the oppressed and plundered class with whom
they are identified their presence in any
j community of whites must act as a killing
confutation of the various slanders common
ly preferred against the colored man
 shall long remember with sincere and
heartfelt gratitude the cordiality and kindness
i of mr anu mrs robert banks w ho cheer
i fully welcomed me to the hospitality of their
home during my slay in detroit and perform
ed many offices uf kindness for me while
an invalid under their roof nor shall i soon
 forget the friendly attentions paid me by
messrs de baptist and fiarret during my illness
 leel uuder great obligations to these gen
tlemen and leturn them my thanks in the
name and on behalf of the perishing slave
these gentlemen all belong to the oppress
ed class ot this community to be appreciated
by them and such as they are is compensa
tion full for all the hardships and privations
to which  am subjected in the advocacy of
their cause i should have mentioned that
the conduct of the steward on board the
hendrick hudson duung my passage from
detroit to buffalo was in every respect
kind and gentlemanly he caused every at
tention to be paid and the waiters all
appeared to vie with each oilier in their friend
ly solicitude for my comfort one of them
made his bed by my side and kindly watched
with me a night i remember them all
with gratitude they all friends in 
needand therefore friends indeed
 hare omitted to tate the facts and incident
of my journey from budaln to detroit one
or two of them  may mention eun at this late
dateon the evening of the d of july in
company with friend remond and two others i
i took passage on board the steamer atlantic
for detroit and immediately paid my fare tor
first cabin passage and supposing that tins
ticket pave me clear right to the comfort
enjoyed by other first class passengers 
went into the saloon and seated myself with
others i was however soon informed by the
steward that  could not remain there but
must go forward i obeyed the order but not
until i had seen the clerk and remonstrated
against the palpable injustice of compelling
me to pay an equal fare with white persons
while he denied to me equal privileges he
evidently felt the injustice and wrong dune i
me and said for himself he had no objec
tor to ray going into the saloon but that
such were the rules and he was compelled to
submit
 asked for the presentation of the rules j
and was frankly toll by the clerk that there
were none such in existence but that they
acted upon a common understanding and 
presume  hat such is the case in every in
stance i have neve been able yet to see a
rule whereby a colored man is compelled to
pay an equal fare and to share unequal
privileges vulgar and shameless as are the
owners and conductors of steam packets
there is not one of them who would not be
ashamed to publish over his own signature a
rule so mean and villanous as thatand yet
they will practice with all boldness in ac
cordance with that insulting ruleon the
next day i received an invitation from a large
number of passengers the captain himself
consenting to deliver an address on the sub
ject of american slavery w ith which i com
plied but instead of treating them to an ex
posure of southern slavery i called their
attention to the oppressive customs of the
north generally and those adopted on that
boat particularly which at once commanded
the attention of the ships company as well
as passengersafter my remarks mr re
mond being called upon responded in one of
his happiest efforts recommending the north
star to the patronage of every friend of
freedom on hoard at the close of his speech
five gentlemen came forward and subscribed
for the paper the meeting altogether was
a highly satisfactory one and evidently
wrought a change in the feeling of all on
hoard one of the officers and owners of the
vessel subscribed for the paper and kindly
gave me a free ticket to chicago but which
has been rendered useless by my illness
there was much discussion on board after
the meeting and i doubt not that the effects
of it will be useful and permanent hop
ing soon to be able again to resume my lec
turing duties  am ever yours faithfully

dive the bible to the slavegive
i him himself and a spellingbook
the new york tribune publishes a report
of the proceedings of a tneeiing of the liber
ty party held in cazenovia n y at which
amongst the resolutions passed was one
affirming that instead of sending bibles to the
slaves it would be infinitely better to supply
them with pocket compasses and a pistol
the one to point out to them the land of free
domthe other for selfdefence on their jour
ney thither the compass would doubtless be
useful of what use the pistol would be ex
cept to shoot himself when the dogs were at
his heels and further llight impiacticable
some may not be able to discover in this
respect the pistol might be useful also for
die he may if he cannot live a man assent
into the world by god he ought not to live a
brute in contravention of his creators will
at the bidding of man but the part of the
resolution which at present is nrincipall in
teresting is the opinion expressed therein
that tt is inexpedient to send the bible to the
slave against this resolution some seven
members iwotesied they thought it was
right that the slaves should have the bible
the majority of them it is true say they
cannot read but what of that give them
the bible if you were to offer them the
adventures of baron munchausenand call it
the life of christ and they would not know
the difference what of that give them the
bible  if in their ignorance and trusting to it
as the means of their souls salvation
they worship it as a kind of fetish or charm
what of that give them the bible if
they should be told that it is the word of
god and their pious masters and mistresses
take it and read to them out of it as they
well know how to do such passages as
 servants obey your masters c and
thereby lead them to believe that it is the will
of god that they must be slaves and ought
to be contented in their slaverywhat of
that  give them the bible if moreover
their masters dont want them to have the
bible and if given them at all it must be
given secreily and kept secretly and stowed
away out of sight like a sort of rachels idol
musty and motheaten what of that
i give them the bible if besides all this it
j is rather a dangerous as well as unprofitable
occupation to go into the slavestates and
distribute bibles amongst the slaves and not
one of all those who are zealous that they
should make the very indispensable and to
them soul saving acquisition of a book the
first word of which they cant begin to read
is bold enough notwithstanding his loud
speaking zeal to carry those bibles to the
slaveswhat of that  give them the bible
i give them the bible how let it drop
down from the clouds l sow it in the cotton
held  lok for a miracle to happen  take
the wild beasts and birds into your service
and commission them to carry the bible to the
slaves  if not in some such way asthis
how are they to get it  when they get the
bible what good will it do them  it wi  be
worse than useless to the slave until he
learns to read it before he can learn to read
it in one out of ten thousand instances he
must be a freeman this talk about giving
the bible to the slaves is the
veriest waste of breath and energy which
might be usefully expended in asserting the
slaves right to freedom those who advooate
the measure no doubt amongst the un
thinking get the credit of having a very h gh
regard and reverence for the bible at the
same time that tt gives them the oportf nity
of bestowing upon those who do not see the
propriety importance or prrticmbihty of tire
scheme the epithets of infidel irreligi
ousheretic ac and this is about all
that it does or will do the affair will end
as it has begun in smoke and bluster it
will doubtless succeed for tune in getting
up a feeling amongst the bigotted and unrea
soning against the true friends of the slave

meanness of the freest nation on the
globe
the utter and despicable meanness ot which
this nation can be guilty it would seem has
not yet been told when they were found j
clinging at the bidding ot the slave power
and making compromise upon compromise it
was thought that surely the cup ot degrada
tion was full when again at the bidding i
of that power thev elected a slaveholding j
blood stained warrior to the office of chief
magistrate it was thought that they had
drank up to the dregs their cup of shame j
but there are still other and lower depths of
infamy to which the cringing north must
kneel if she would preserve the friendship
and deserve the confidence of her brave
chivalrous masters the pennsylvania free
man publishes a document from which it ap
pears that the slaveholding executive in
great regard for the weliare and the honor oi
of this glorious republic have taken upon
them to decide who shall and who shall not
be considerd citizens and freemen not con
tent with the declaration of new york oi
massachusetts or pennsylvania that these
several states acknowledge their ow n citizens
and by thus acknowledging give them a right
to all the privileges and immunities connected
with citizenship the officers of government
step forward and saylt is not enough for
you to decide this matter we have also a
right to give our judgment and you j must a
bide by our dictum
it appeal from the freeman that applica
tion was made to the secretary of state on
behalf of a certain mana native american
named henry hainbleton for a passport
this passpoit  understand to mean the
usual certificate furnished to sailors that they
are natives of this country the possession of
which gives them in times of danger a right 
to the protection of the american flag this
man hambleton is a citizen of this country
probably of pennsylvaniafor john m clay
ton returns his certificate of nativity
but john m clayton denies him a passport
what had he done to forfeit his right had
he committed murder was he a traitor
to his country was he a swindler thief
or highwayman was he flying from justice
no none of these things he waswell his
offence was too inhuman to relate such horri
ble things are fit only be spoken at the dead
of night and in a whisperhe wasoh

a day oi fasting
a hiroinmrndation hy the president of tin
united states
at a season when the providence ot god
has manifested itself in the visitation of a
fearful pestilence which is spieading its
ravages throughout the land it is fitting that
a people whose reliance has ever been on his
protection should humble themselves before
his throne and while acknowledging past
transgressions ask a continuance of divine
mercy
it  therefore earnestly recommended that
the first friday in august be observed
throughout the united states as a day of fast
ing humiliation and prayer all business
will be suspended in the various branches of
the public service on that day and it is
recommended to persons of ail religious de
nominations to abstain as far as practicable
from secular occupations ad to assemble in
their respective places of public worship to
acknowledge the infinite goodness which has
watched over our existence as a nation and
so long crowned us wiih manifold blessings
and to implore the almighty in his own good
time to stay the destroying hand which is
now lifted up against us
washington julyjj  z taylor
the following postscript has since been
added
and as it is further fitting that a con
trasting godfeaiing people should know
what is the nature of the fast which will be
acceptable to the almkhty the following
words of an old writer are earnestly recom
mended to be read with prayer and careful
ness
behold in the day of your fast you find
pleasure and exact all your labors behold
ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with
the fist of wickedness ye shall not fast as yc
do this day to make your voice to be heard on
high
is it such a fast that i have chosen a day
for a man to afflict his soul  is it to bow
down his head as a bulrush and to spread
sackcloth and ashes under him  wilt thou call
this a fast and an acceptable day to the
lord
is not this the fast that i have chosen  to
loose the bands of wickedness to undo the
heavy burdens and to let the ojpressed go
free and that ye break every voke 
is it not to deal thy biead to the hungry
and that thou bring the poor that are cast out
to thy house  w hen thou seest the naked that
 thou coveifhnn artd that thou hide not thyself
from thine own flesh i
then shall thy light break forth as the
morning and thy health shall spriug forth
speedily and fhy righteousness shall go before
thee the glory of the ixrd shall be thy rere
wared
then shalt thou call and the lord shall
answer thou shall cry and he shall say
here i arn if thou take away from the midst
of thee the yoke the putting forth of the fin
ger and speaking vanity and u thou draw
out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the
afflicted soul then shall thy light rtae in
obscurity and thv darkness be as the noon
day
and ihe lord shall guide thee continually
and satisfy thy soul in drought and make fat
thy bones and thou shall be like a watered
garden and like a spring of water w hose wa
ters fail not
and as this nation hare greiouly sinned
in that the have held three millions of their
brethren in bonds to show that we are sin
cere in our repentant for this our sin it is
also earnestly recommended in accordance
with the just views of the writer above that
we break every yoke let the oppressed go
free and undo the heavy burdens and asj
it becomes the chief magistrate of this nation
to show such an exunple of repentance i
zachary i ayloi will on the day appointed
namely the first friday in august release
from their bonds cm slaves whom with
shame and deep sorrow i confess  have
held in unlawful and unchristian bondage
and in accordance with the promise of heav
en that if the wicked shall turn from all his
sins that he hath committed and do that
which is lawful and right he shall surely
live he shall not die i trust and believe that
the destroying hand which ia now lifted up
against us will be stayed
a great inine at brag
brave little south carolina noble palmetio
state your sistpr states can talk but their
talk when compared w ith youis is like the
common conversation of an ordinary person
set against the vollubility of a billingsgate

water with the full flood of niagara you out
herod herod you set all competition at de
fiance you certainly win the day at the
national game of brag and are clearly
entitled to all the honor or profit accruing
therefrom but with all the bluster of south
carolinaher honestv is commendable there
is no sneaking under provisoes and guaran
tiesm ihe direct language of her son  they
speak out what they mean and that in very
square english the charleston mercury
contains an account of a glorious celebration
of the glorious fourth at orangeburg in
the calhoun state the politicians met on
that day set apart for the celebration of am
erican independence in a slate of smallbeer
explosiveness after dinner the cork was
drawn and forthwith such a volley of froth and
fury came pouring out it was well that
independence day came at the time it did
if it had been but one or two days later it is
impossible to say what might have happened
the pentup steam not finding any outlet
would doubtless have distended the enclosing
vessel most enormously the least mischief
which it could have done certainly must have
been that many a panting spouter would
have found himselt like a fish out ot water
gasping for its native elementif not like the
frog whichjfancied itself as big as a bull
actually burst with longcontinued continence
of its own wind brave windbags its a
pity you have not a better cause but in the
midst of it all you said some good things
more perhaps than you were yourselves
aware of at least with very immateria
amendments your gasconading resolutions
may be turned to good account and made tc
mean very direct and honest truth
the constitution of the united states des
igned by its framers to secure equal bight
to the members of the confederacy it has
been rendered to the south an instrument o
oppresssion and a curse
the members confederacywhe
are they if from the confederacy were
meant to be the colored inhabitants
of this country most undoubtedly the eflect
has been whatever the design was to secure
to all its members equal rights to rob crush
plunder and oppress the negroamerican
a large portion of the compact is expressly
framed to make such oppression legal and to
bind all parties to its inviolable preservation
that it has also been rendered an instrument
of oppression and a curse to a very large
proportion of the inhabitants of the south
ir very apparenttor at thus moment up
wards ol three millions of the southern popu
lation are kept under its deep
and intolerable slavery
the unton in its purity we would cling
to it with filial devotion as now corrupted
it is not worth preserving
abolitionists have been accused of holding
opinions very much in accordance with those
of the south carolinians but some of them
will be surprised to find so many points of
agreement as there are between them the
above assertion is most true the union 
now corrupted is not worth preserving
nay more it ought not to be preserved
cemented as it is by the blood and tears
and agonies of the perishing slave it ought
to be shattered it is a most unholy alliance
on which the curse of heaven does and must
rest take youiselves away say we rake
with you your slavery and your shame con
tinue if you can by yourselves to buy and
sell and bruise the downtrodden image of
god but for us we wish to have no part
nor lot in that matter the sin of it is rank
and smells to heaven we wash our
hands of it we leave you if you choose it
so revelling in your filth and disgiace we
would gladly that you should stay with us
and share in the advantages of our growing in
telligence and morality but if you will not
 if you w ill continue to hold slaves we w ant
no share of the profit we are determined
to share no longer any of the shame and
disgrace if you can by your own power
keep three millions of human beings in bonds
do it if you cannot you alone must bear the
i fearful retribution which awaits those who do
i wickedly
i by general i f jarnison the orator of
the hay the surth and the south iet the
issue between them lie made at once if the
union is jeopardied thereby we care not so
the south be safe
we cannot swallow this sentiment with
out some slight amendment some at the
 north do not consider the jeopardizing of the
union a matter of very great importance
they can even see some cause of rejoicing
to the world when it is jeopardized but as
both the north and the south in so far as
they support the wrong are deserving of
i condemnation and as all they can do jointly
and separately cannot prevent the final prev
alence of justice a slight amendment at the
end of this sentiment seems desirable name

in consequence
the orator of the day made a speech about
the causes in operation in the northern
states destined to prove fatal to free institn
lions the superior adapledne of southern
institutions to preserve under a republican
form of government a well regulated liberty
the gradual progress of the slavery question
and the utter hopeless and universal ruin
which must overtake the south if it be nut
arrested c all of which was doubtless
intended to be understood ironically instead
of free read slave and how true is his
assertion for there is a moral sentiment now
in progress in these northern states which
as surely as there is power in truth will
overthrow the slave institutions of this coun
try instead of liberty if we read sla
very again how true the assertion is
how well southern institutions are adapted
to preserve a well regulated slavery 
every regulation in town and country is made
with a view to this paramount object every
thing else is made subservient to it no diffi
culty is too greatno danger too terrificno
shame too infamous to be encountered by the
south for the preservation of her darling
slave system and then the universal ruin
which must overtake the south if the
slavery question be not arrestedoh the
keen irony of the speech must have been irre
sistible f course the orator meant to make
an abolition address lie knows that south
carolina is becoming depopulated of all but
slaveholders and slaves he sees that the few
free whites who remain there are gradually
sinking into deep ignorance and barbarism
he is well aware that the lands throughout
the slave states are rapidly losing their fer
tility and that ere many years of the present
improvident mode of culture have passed over
they will be utterly exhausted lie hears the
voice of the civilised world lifted up against
slavery he feels in his own conscience that it
is vvtong that the blasting curse of heaven is
upon the slave states he can appreciate all
this and therefore the speech quoted from
clothed in irony it is true but none the less
forcible on that account if he did not mean
it to be understood thusif he meant it to be
understood just as it reads with all its glaring
absurdities sticking out of it we can but sav
of hirn and his windy compatriots that they
afford an admirable confirmation of the truth
of the old roman saying that whom the
gods wish to destroy they first make mad

a colony of the spanish crown and
isolated from the parent country several thou
sand miles in the cairibeean sea stands the
island of tuba it is true that this island
stands rather contiguous to and not more
than fortyeight hours sail of a good steamer
from the american coast but she is also
contiguous to and surrounded by the innumer
able antilles or other west india island
each of which is well peopled w ith descen
dants of the african and indian race all of
whom are save the danish colonies who are
partially so in the full enjoyment of equal
rights and privileges and in many instances
forming the main force strength safety and
dependence of these colonies offices of
profit trust and honor and the executive
chair in many of these colonies are now filled
by this class of the inhabitants who of course
will form no trivial opposition against the
attempt on the part of the oppressors in the
united states to lend their aid to the oppres
sors of cuba
the revenue derived by the spanish gov
ernment from this colony is immense twelve
millions of dollars per annum chiefly derived
from the commerce in slavesa certain per
centage upon the valuation of each victim
sold at the barracoons with an additional
siun per head for each slave held and
worked on the plantations i he slave trade
is enhanced in proportion to the efficiency of
the viceroy or governor of the island r lo
this end he is allowed the extraordinary per
quisites in addition to a fixed salary by law
besides perhaps other emoluments of ten
dollars per head on each slave imported
i into the island whether or not such slaves
are detained there hence the great policy of
making cuba the great western slave depot
here it will be observed that on the impor
tation of five hundred slaves the large sum
of five thousand dollars are realised by the
executive of the island  of course the in
terested party such as the governor and all
either directly or indirectly under the patro
nage of the government will maintain its
alliance to spain with unerring tenacity and
fidelity and this party may be accounted by
far the majority of the whites in cuba
from the foregoing it is evident that the
government or adhering party must be very
strong and it might reasonably be inquired
into how the suspicion ever arose or the
expression found vent of a desire on the part
of any portion of the inhabitants of cuba to
annex to the united states the w hole popu
lation of cuba is one million two hundred
and fifty thousand two fifths of whom are
whites and of these there are probably fifty
thousand either belonging to or formerly resi
dents of the united states add to this the
fact that citizens of the united states hold
interests to the amount of forty millions of
dollarsthese will at once explain the origin
of the annexation party in cuba these fif
ty thousand americans are the source and
origin of all dissatisfaction that has arisen
against spain and in flavor of a separation from
the parent country though f by far the min
ority as such and totally unable to accom
plish their object yet this american party
is sufficiently strong and influential to keep
up an effective division and disuhion among
the white inhabitants of the islahd and an
eternal hostility in sentiment apd feeling to
ward each other the designed negociation
on the part of the united states for the pay
ment of the spanish debt to england in se
curity for which a mortgage on cuba was to
be obtained as proposed by president polk
is abandoned us a futile measure from its im
practicabilitythe debt of spain to england
being ascertained on investigation to be the
enormous sum of three hundred and forty
millions of dollars the interest of which
alone at six per cent would amount to the
sum of two millions one hundred thousand
dollars a sum so great that the free and free
domloving working people of the nonslave
bolding states would resist it to the last  his
there need be no fears but they would oppose
because it touches in the right placetlieii
intrust it feels in their pockets but for this
we should place no reliance on their opposition
to the nefarious project but were cuba an
nexed to the united states knowing us they
do that it must be effected for the interest ol
slaveholders and that the slave slates art
already a burden to the free of course the
project will be exposed to an effectual defeat
however much the slave party may desire it
this is now a settled point at present the
project of the annexation of cuba to the
i united states must fail though this pro
ject fails as it may now be considered a cer
taiuty still the strife will continue and tlx
dissatisfaction theie increase

these asiatic or fongoban slates in the no
lle citj of hanna ths number throughout
the island is considerable as well as the
number of yucatecnea and other indians
these mongols and indians like the afri
cans are obtained from their native country
by kidnapping and purchase as prisoners of
war
ilut one fifth of the population being

ple the sustenance of the colony and its
loyalty to spain are dependant upon the
colored subjects and the military the main
stay of the law the protector and defender
of the captain general and his authority is
composed of this class both bond and iree
the slave of cuba has a right unknown to
the american slave he has a right to pur
chase himself whenever he so desires and
the slaveholder is obliged to grant him the
time whenever he requests it to make the
money w ith which to purchase his freedom
hence the slave is continually obtaining his
freedom and only remains in slavery there
in consequence of his ignorance of his right
in that respect by law hereout of a popu
lation of one million and upwards there are
nearly eight hundred thousand of the oppres
sed nearly two hundred thousand of whom
are freethe others a hardy race of natives
from the coast of africa asia and centra
americamen whose spirit is unsubdued
and whose souls have not yet lost the panting
aspirations of freedomwhose ma jestic forms
and manly necks have not yet yielded to the
degrading conditions of slaveryand others
of like character still coming by importation
this is the material ere long that shall
form the unyielding timber in the political
machinery of that countrys structure and
henceforth become the master spirits of the
island we thank god that the asiatic
and indian have been brought to share the
miseries of the african in cuba it must be
a design of heaven let them now make com
mon cause a oneness of interest harmony
of sentiment concentration of purpose
means mind and talent and concert of action
only well devise these and but one stroke
of their ponderous arm will lay the island in
travail a fearful lamentationa terrible
retribution a waits the oppressor at the bands
of the outraged colored inhabitants of that
misruled colony
should it be argued that the w hole force
of the white population backed by the milita
ry of spain would bo brought against the
blacks in the event of a revolution we answer
that tins can never prove effectual since an
oppoitunity would at once be sought on the
pait of the annexationists to take every ad
vantage of the issue and knowing this as
the government and loyalists do the spanish
crown as has already been expressed by an
otgan of that sovereign located in the city of
new york for the purpose of sustaining the
spanish claims to cuba would rather see
the island fall into the hands of the blacks
than annnexed to the united states or in
other words that rather than cuba should
fall into the bands of the americans the
slaves shall be armed and the island laid in
destruction and blood this is the deter
mination of spain backed by all the loyalists
every officer of whom holding positions in
cuba is from the parent conntiy hence their
continual watchfulness trustworthiness and
fidelity to the home government there is
indisputably an irreeoncileable division exist
ing aiming the whites of cuba a breach of
earthquake portentionan obstruction as im
movable as the limeaged and valleydeep
glaciers that fill the vast depths in the moun

sed of cubathe experiences of others have
taught them a different lesson the emper

having decreed the slaves of st homingo

wild and distracted attempt to reduce them
back to their former condition but to his
utter astonishment and dismay they resisted
to the knifethe knife to the death n ith

martial cohorts of france united with spain
and directed by the skill of the man ol

j whatever ability he possessed as a military
chieftain and director of armies certainly
betrayed great ignorance of the philosophy
of human nature indeed we have always
conceivedin the history of this great warrior
 this to be the most defective trait in his char
acter napoleon received far more credit in
this respect than he ever merited there are
instances recorded of great sagacity deep
penetration and seeming great and unerring
knowledge in this respect but it was noi
derived from a thorough and searching know
ledge of human nature but simply from a
knowledge of individuals or classes of indi

farther napoleons great power was ic

success in the policy ol eternal vigilance

napoleon was from lime to time consul

of the french and could not have ruled
over any other people or nation and not
even over these had it not been for his con
tinual political revolutionsthe changes ol
policy in his government napoleon was a
soldier but not a civiliana general but not s
magistrate power and skill may make a
general but it requires talents and ability
judgment and decision deliberaton and
more than a slight know ledge of human na

was the scene of a universal jubilee and now
calls loudly upon all nations and people to

the powers of despotism in this america
is dishonest and hypocritical she does not

entirely these and sees clearly at a distance
the oppression of the white race
let the colored races look well to their

this we have determined ever to do tlitee
millions of our brethren and kinsmen groan
in servitude in the united states of america
in bondage and degradation unsurpassed by
any that ever disgraced the world and out

moral agents now at work by which means
we shall hope and trust for success and by
whom we shall ever stand and never yield

them bv the balm of moral consolation until
every fetter shall he riven and every shackle
shall be shattered and the bondman of am

oppressed of cuba have not this moral conso

directly for them they must take there cause
in their own hands and use the means ade

of henry christophe one of the oppressed ol

noble determination and conclusion and the

story of ellen craft
in a city about nine hundred mile
tooth of mason dixons line ellen
lrafts wai held a a slave because
ivc find her in this degrading condition
let it not he understood that she is a
negro ellen rafts though a slave
is white or rather to he strictly cor
rect a brunette she is now about
nineteen or twenty years of age and
w ill readily pasg in any circle as a dark
coiored white girlgirls dark as
ellen are as often met with as those
of fairer skm we are not describing
the chief attraction of a ballroom but
something more when we say that
firmness intelligence and persever
ance aie distinctly and impressively
marked upon her countenance her
hair is long straight and dark colored
l nose prominent eyes dark large and
i expressive wc are thus particular to
show her connection with the anglo
saxon and to show how little there is
j of any feature by which the enslaved
race is so readily recognized
in the citv from which ellen tied
she acted os body servant or slave to
another young woman possibly her
i sister for our knowledge of the pat
riarchal institution leads readily and
naturally to that inference
while in this situation she married
it is lor the profit of the master that
early marriages should be a law o
custom the union contracted by
ellen proved to a a happy one the
husband williamslaves have no
right to other numes has proved him
self to be every w ay w orthy of her by
his industry and by turning night into
day he contrived to procure enough
money to purchase n portion of his
time from the man who claimed to own
hun it cost william all he had but
it procur ed him privileges which enabled
j him by assiduous application to lay
by another storea larger portion o
which the lions share went to swell
the masters illgotten gainslor new
and dearbought privileges
by dint of saving and starving
william contrived to accumulate for
himself and wife enough to purchase
j for each many tittle coinlorts and priv
ileges tliev were thus enabled to
ameliorate their condition and weto
for a lime happy though not permitted
i to see each other oftener than once a
i week tlrev had many sccict mcet
i
mgs
i thesd stolen interviews were sweet
and precious ere they not ye who
love the wife of your affections
i thoughts of their condition their hard
lot mingled with unavailing regrets
without doubt were the principal ones
exchanged between them but this con
dition they were constrained to endure
almost joyfully in view of the greater
deprivation and sufferings of their fel
low slaves
privileges like these however were
destined to bear their rich harvest
thoughts of liberty are never long ab
i sent lrom a slave or prisoner hope
beckons forever even through sorest
ills this was the great subject be
tween ellen and william in the long
j lone hours of the night that w ere but
ushering in to them another day ol
bondage the spirit of liberty visited
them not inappropriate to their con
dition is the exclamation of david
jas the hart pantetli after the water
brooks so pantetli my soul alter thee
o god
it is quite certain that they could
have escaped from the city in which
they were but whither could they
flee r without a place without means
of support hunted by every slave
catcher like the partridge upon the
mountains surrounded by enemies
j their capture was certain and stripes
separation accumulated woes would
be their lot
these considerations filled theii
hearts with sadness but liberty ever
bright and fair bid them to hope on
for many weeks they thought over
j every plan of escape which promised
success but could find none
j they had heard vaguely of the abo
j litionists ofthe north but they had beer
represented to them as monsters more
to be dreaded than the slavedrivei
i himself and their hopes led them nol
that way still they would inquire
concerning them and one day sutbcieni
j was learned to determine their course
they would tlec to the abolitionists
their star in the east had indeed
risen but how could they follow iti
glorious path the nearest city te
them was philadelphia u distance o
iou miles a weary way for fugitive
from slavery but the determinatior
once formed every obstacle was to b
overcome accordingly tindr sleeping
and w aking thoughts were given to tint
out the way to the spot w here liberty
dwelt
j lie first obstacle to be overcome
was to secure the necessary funds foi
the proposed flight by double toil in
a more than miserly saving a suflicien
i sum was acquired they w ere foi
slaves really rich and now freedom 
death rather than slavery was then
joint language
the plan adopted displays a degret
of ingenuity which could not have beet
acquired under the ordinary circutn
stances of life solitary confinement 
a life of perpetual bondage are the on
ly incentives which bring out all the
latent ingenuity of the man the
thoughts ol the captive are upon on
point the whole energy and streugtl
ot his mind ate duected to one aim
eel such an one sec but the slighter
probability ol success though it be bui
the faintest glimmer and that faith
which overcomes mountains lifts the
into the paradise he would gain
flint lamh secures the boon
it was decided that ellen sboulc
personate an invalid young man anc
that illiain lould represent the ser
vant j he plan proposed involved a
isijje expenditure since young mer
who travel wah their servants ure sup
posed to bo rich but it secured this
great this abounding advantage by
this disguise they could take he public
highway and the most rapid convey
ances besides the very boldness
the originality ol the plan ws designee
to be their greatest safeguard for t wht
would look for u fugitive from slavery
under the hat o p pol
yotda pursuing ins way nohh in quest
of health attendedj by a serving man
so for the plan its execution was
now the great point cnuld disguise
impenetrable to the slave catchers
whose scent is like the bloodhound s
and with the bloodhound be pro
cured over tins vital question fallen
and william pondered day and night
with palpitating hearts but that
genius which gave the bold scheme
birth was vet fertile in resources i he
first idea was a prestige of us lull ac
complishment
there w as no point however minute
in the habiliments of a young man that
was not studied with as much care as
ever newton or herschell studied the
heavens this was necessary for a
young woman who first attempts mo
apparel of a boy is sure to he discover
ed at the first glance by an accirate
observer hence ellen practiced
nightly in her new garb until she had
become thoroughly trained
but to the dress itself a slave can
not purchase a suit unquestioned as
another person may therefore ex
treme caution became necessaiy else
the cherished scheme of months would
have been discovered and overthrown
then they must die for it hope he
dead why seek to live
william was the purchaser at
various places and different times un
der numerous pretexts lie bought the
required articles the hat was a very
high bell crowned or as he stated it
a double story hat next lie bought
a sack which on being pot on proved
a world to wide but ellen thought
that was no objection ns sacks never
lit the vest proved to be a very long
one reaching below the hips hut tash
ionablv cut and as it was all the go
was adopted without demur especially
as the sack could he buttoned over and
hide the disproportion ot its size
then the pantaloons were oi most liberal
dimensions and boots more easily ob
tained completed this part ol the ward
robe a pair of green glasses were
j procured for the purpose ot making
ellen look older lor when fitted out in
her new rig she looked exceedingly
j young besides her features might be
recognized by any person whom they
j misfit meet that knew them while up
onthelr journey
 these preparations having been
made a day was appointed for their
flight that day io fraught with all
their wildest hopes arrived nothing
had been omitted two trunks were
obtained sufficiently ponderous for the
baggage of a young man on his travels
 nothing had been forgotten as it be
i came necessary to register names al
j hotels and sign a certificate for the
slave the servant who accoinpaniei
young master a bandage and a sling
for ellens right arm was thought ol
why she could not read or write
impertinent travellers might scan the
young ida s face too closely a con
venient swelling which required poul
ticing enveloped her checks as vol
uble and inquisitive persons might b
too particular in their inquiries sick
ness fatigue of travelling and the svvel
i ling would be sufficient excuse agams
rudeness for not answering
thus equipped william having
nerved his courage up w ent boldly t
the ticket office and purchased i
through ticket for young master
and myselt to filadelfy no ques
tiors were asked and the tickets w r er
obtained
next morning the fearful and danger
 ous passage was commenced at the
depot ellen was not recognized sc
i complete was her disguise a portei
there one of her early suitors addres
sed her as young master she kind
ly bestowed upon him a small trifle ft
encourage him in politeness
along the road at the various stop
ping places the sickly youth receiv

i ty in rewarding any slight service
their custom was to put up at the firs

hairbreadth scapes but not once dii
ellens courage fail or her inimitable
i and unapproachable endurance am
perseverance give way during all i licit
k journey through the slave states aft
er the cars left baltimore for philadel
phia william wearied with anxiety
j and watching laid himself down t
sleep in the jim crow car when
he invariably rode for a slave eouh
not presume to ride with his master ji
was iii invariable practice to rur
i nervously back at every stopping phicr
to see that young insier was safe
tor this affectionate attention ht
f received the approbation of many pas
sengers and was rewarded w ith severa
k present and from w ashinpton ti
baltimore his devotedness to ins mas
iters health was pointed out to severa
j northern gentlemen as an evidence o
the close bonds of affection subsisting
between master and slave
we led william sleeping in the
jim crow car at havre tie grace
where the kerry is crossed wilhanr
remained sleeping ellen was caileti
upon with other passengers to changt
cars but where was her husband
her courage began to fail and des
pair to seize upon her she dreader
the worst a woful disappointment sc
gear the goal of their desires she
could be comforted until the bag
gage master ri  her by rudely
waking the black lasca ht

she was relieved from her tears
they arrived in philadelphia on

good old time of the heptarchy ol dirty

to preface annual or biennial ceremo

leged few were wont to fortify them
selves for the important tour of inspec

consolidated commission eschews all
such extravagancies and serves the
public without fee or least about the
expediency of which proceeding we
have a misgiving or two for we confess
to a prejudice in favor ot paid officials
but be this as it may the breakfast
under the old sy stem was a right good
one and as satisfactory a preparation
as could be desired tor our descent into
the realms of darkness but the break
fast was not by any means the only
preparation required of us there
was a toilet to be made by the help of
certain strange raltts chumltre and
certain vestments to be put on which
would have effectually disguised an
irish rebel thick leggings of felt
greased leathern boots reaching to the
middle of the thigh a mackintosh ol
ample dimensions and a slouched hat
were the chief items of the costume
down there we dived till we splashed
into the waters of the farfamed tributa
ry and on we toiled with the black
stream above our knees erect under
the substantial arch of brick work
lighted with fragments of candles
there was something very striking in
this world of brick and mortar stretch

resounding with the shouts of the pre
