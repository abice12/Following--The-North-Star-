argument
of charles sumner esq against the con
stitutionality of sepw ate colored schools
in the case of sarah c roberts vs th
ctty of boston before the supreme court
of mass dec  
may it please your honors
can any discrimination on account
of color or race be made under the
constitution and laws of massachu
setts among the children entitled to the
benefit of our public schools this is
the question which the court is now to
hear to consider and to decide
or stating the question with more
detail and with a more particular appli
tion to the facts of the present case are
the committee having the superinten
dence of the public schools of boston
entrusted with the power under the con
stitution and laws of massachusetts to
exclude colored children from these
schools and to compel them to resort
for their education to separate schools
set apart for colored children only at
distances from the homes less conven
ient than those open to white children
this important question arises in an
action by a colored child only five
years old who by heriext friend sues
the city of boston for damages on ac
count of a refusal to receive her into
one of the public schools
it would be difficult to imagine any
case which could appeal more strongly
to your best judgment whether you re
gard the parties or the subject on
the one side is the city of boston strong
in its wealth in its influence in its
character on the other side is a little
child of a degraded color of humble
parents still within the period oi natu
ral infancy but strong from her very
weakness and from the irrepressible
sympathies of good men which by a
divine compensation come to succor
the weak this little child asks at your
hands her personal rights so doing
she calls upon you to decide a question
which concerns the personal rights of
other colored children which concerns
the constitution and laws of the com
monwealth which concerns that pecu
liar institution of new england the
common schools which concerns the
fundamental principles of human rights
which concerns the christian character
of this community such parties and
such interests so grand and various
may justly challenge your most earnest
attention
though this discussion is now for the
first time brought before a judicial tri
bunal it is no stranger to the public
for five years it has been an occasion
of discord to the school committee
no less than four different reports two
majority reports and two minority re
ports forming pamphlets of solid di
mensionsdevoted to this question
have been made to this committee and
afterwards published the opinions of
learned counsel have been enlisted in
the cause the controversy leaving
these regular channels has overflowed
the newspaper press and numerous ar
ticles have appeared espousing oppo
site aides at last it has rsached this
tribunal it is in your power to cause
it to subside for ever
forgetting many of the topics and
all of the heats which have heretofore
mingled with the controversy i shall
strive to present the question in its ju
ridical light as becomes the habits of
this tribunal it is a question of juris
prudence on which you are to give
judgment but  cannot forget that the
principles of moral and of natural jus
tice ue at the foundation of all jurispru
dence nor can any reference to these
be inappropriate in a discussion before
this court
the great principle which is involved
in this case i shall first exhibit in the
constitution of massachusetts next in
right is gf no sextruth is of no color
the legislation and then in the judicial
decisions i shall then consider the
special circumstances of this case aao
show the violation of the constitution
and laws by the school committee ol
boston answering before i close souk
of the grounds on which their conduct
has been vindicated
i i begin with tho principle that
according to the spirit of american in
stitutions and especially of the consti
tution of massachusetts all men nl
rmt distinction of color ot mice ere equal
before the law
i might perhaps leave this proposi
tion without one word of comment
the equality of men will not be direct
ly denied on this occasion and yet it
has been so often assailed of late that
trust i shall not seem to occupy your
time superfluously in endeavoring to
show what is understood by this term
when used in laws or constitutions or
other political instruments mr cal
houn in the senate of the united states
and lord brougham in his recent work
on political philosophy part  chap
 have characterized equality as im
possible and absurd if they had cho
sen to comprehend the true extent and
application of the term as employed on
such occasions something if not all ol
the force of their objections would have
been removed that we may better
appreciate its character and its limita
tions let me develop with some care the
origin and growth of this sentiment
until it finally ripened into a formula of
civil and political right
the sentiment of equality among men
was early cherished by generous souls
it showed itself in the dreams of ancient
philosophy it was declared by sene
ca when writing to a friend a letter ol
consolation on death he said prinui
emim pars equitatis tst equalitas
epist  the first part of equity
is equality but it was enunciated
with persuasive force in the truths o
the christian religion here we learn
that god is no respecter of persons
that he is tie father of all and that we
are all his children aui brethren to
each other when the saviour taught
the lords prayer he taught the bub
lime doctrine of hr motherhood of
mankind enfolding quality of men
slowly did this sentiment enter the
state the whole oiislitution of gov
ernment in modern times was inconsist
ent with it an hereditary monarchy
an order of nobility and the complex
ranks of superiors and inferiors estab
lished by the feudal system all declar
ed not the equality but the inequality
of men and they all conspired to per
petuate this inequality every infant
of royal blood every noble every vas
sal was a present example that what
ever might be the truths of religion oi
the sentiments of the heart men living
under these institutions were not born
equal
the boldest political reformers ol
early times did not venture to proclaim
this truth nor did they truly perceive
it cromwell beheaded his king but
caused the supreme power to be secur
ed in hereditary succession to his eldest
son it was left to john milton in po
etic vision to be entranced
w ith fair equality fraternal atale
sidney who perished a martyr to libe
ral sentiments drew his inspiration
from the classic and not from the chris
tian fountains the examples of greece
and rome fed his soul the revolu
tion of  partly by force and partly
by the popular voice brought a foreign
er to the crown of great britain and
the establishment according to the
boast of loyal englishmen of the free
dom of the land but the bill of righu
did not declare nor did the genius ol
somers or maynard conceive the polit
ical axiom that all men are born equal
it may find acceptance in our day from
individuals in england but it is disown
ed by english institutions
it is to france that we must pass for
the earliest development of this idea
for it amplest illustration and for its
most complete accurate and logical
expression in the middle of the lasi
century appeared the renowned ency
clopedic edited by dalembert and
diderot this remarkable production
where science religion and govern
ment were all discussed with a revolu
tionary freedom contains an article on
equality which was published in 
here we find the boldest expression
which had then been given to this sen
timent natural equality says the
encyclopedia is that which exists be
tween all men by the constitution oi
their nature only this equality is the
principle and the foundation of liberty
natural or moral equality is then found
ed upon the constitution of human na
ture common to all men who are born
grow subsist and die in the same man
ner since human nature finds itsell
the same in all men it is clear that ac
cording to natures law each ought to
esteem and treat the others as beings
who are naturally equal to himself that
is to say who are men as well ss him
self it is then remarked that politi
cal and civil slavery is in violation of
this equality and yet there is a recog
nition of the inequalities of nobility in
the state alluding to these it is sim
l ly said that those who are mast eleva
ted above others ought to treat their
inferiors at being naturally their equals
shunning all outrage and demaoding
nothing btyond what is due and de
manding with humanity that which is
moit incontestably their due
when we consider the period et
which this article was written we shell
be astonished less at its incompleteness
and vagueness than by its bravery and
generosity the dissolute despotism of
louis xv overshadowed france
rochester n y friday february  
selfish nobles and fawning courtier
filled the royal antechambers th
councils of government were controlle
by royal mistresses only a few year
before in  the king bad founded
in defiance of the principles of equalit
but in entire harmony with the con
duct of the school committee in bos
tona military school for nobles only
carrying into education the distinctioi
of caste at such n fwam sbwdknsy
etopedie did wetl in utnfrfng such tm
port ant and effective truth the senli
tnent of eqeality was here fully declared
nor could it be expected at that earl
day that it should adequately perceive
or if it perceived that it should dare tc
utter our axiom of liberty that all mei
are born equal in civil and political
rights
it is thus with the history of all moral
and political ideas first appearing
merely as a sentiment they animate
those who receive them with a nobit
impulse filling them with generous
sympathies and encouraging them to
congenial efforts slowly recognized
they fihally pass into a formula to be
acted upon to be applied to be defend
ed in tho concerns of life
almost contemporaneously with this
article in the encyclopedia our atten
tion is arrested by a solitary person
poor of humble extraction born in
geneva in switzerland of irregulai
education and life a wanderer from hi
birthplace enjoying a temporary home
in france a man of audacious genius
who set at naught the received opinions
of mankind jean jacques rousseau
his earliest appearance before the pub
lic was by an eccentric essay on the
origin of inequality among men in
which he sustained the irrational para
dox that men are happier in a state of
nature than under the laws of civiliza
tion this was followed by a later
work the contrat social in both of
ihese productions the sentiment of fi
nality was invoked against many of the
abuses of society and language wa
employed going far beyond equality in
ivil and political rights the conspic
uous position that has been awarded to
he speculations of rousseau and the
nfluence which they have exerted in
jiffusing this sentimeut make it proper
o refer to them on this occasion but
he absence of precision in his proposi
ions renders him an uncertain guide
the french revolution was now at
land this great movement for en
vanchisement was the expression of
his sentiment here it received a dis
inct and authoritative enunciation
n the constitutions of government
vhich were successively adopted
imidst the throes of bloody struggles
he equality oi men was constantly pro
claimed king nobles and all distinc
ions passed away before this mighty
md triumphant truth
look at these constitutions and see
it once the grandeur of the principle
md the manner in which it was explain
ed and illustrated the constitution
if  declares in its first article as
ollows men are born and continue
ree and equal in their rights in its
lixth article it says the law is the
expression of the general will it ought
o be the same for all whether it pro
ects or punishes all citizens being
qual in its eyes are equally admissabu
o all dignities places and public em
iloyments according to their capacity
md uiithout other distinctions than their
irtues and talents at the close of
he declaration of rights there is this
urther explanation of it the nation
il assembly wisning to establish the
french constitution on principles which
t has just acknowledged and declared
ibolishes irrevocably the institutions which
founded liberty and equality of rights
there is no longer neither nobility
lor peeragenor hereditary distinctions
lor distinction of order nor feudal rule
tor patrimonial justices nor any titles
lenominations and prerogatives which
vere then derived nor anv order of
chivalry nor any corporations or deco
rations for which proofs of nobility are
required or which supposed distinc
ions of birth nor any other superiority
han that of public functionaries in the
discharge of their functions
there is no longer for any part of the
nation nor for any individual any priv
ilege or exception to the law common to
nil frenchmen monsieur  mo

in fitful mood another declaration of
rights was brought forward by con
dorcet feb  here also are
fresh inculcations of the equality of
men article ist places equality
among the natural civil and political
rights of man article th declares
equality consists in this that each can
enjoy the same rights article bth
the law ought to be equal for all
whether it recompense or punish or
repress article th all citizens
are admissable to all public places em
ployments and functions free people
cannot know other motives of preference
than talents and virtues article d
instruction is the need of all and so
ciety owes it equally to all its members
article d there is oppression
when the law violates the natural civil
and political rights which it ought to
guarantee there ie oppression when
a law is violated by public functiona
ries in its application to individual
facta monsieur  mo 
next came the cooetitutien of june
 this announces in its second
article that the natural and imprescrip
tible rights of men are equality lib
erty eafety property and in the
next article it shows what is meant by
equality it save all men are equal
by nature and bsfot the law mon
iteur  mo  here we first
meet this form of dentition at a late
day after france bad passed througl
an unprecedented series of political vi
eissitudes in iorae of which the i ighti
of equality had been trampled undei
foot when at the revolution of 
louis philippe eras called to a thron
surrounded by republican institutions
tire brtet wllteh y then promulga
be their titles or ranks
while recognizing this peculiar
enunciation of the equality of men as
more specific and satisfactory than the
naked statement that all men are born
equal it is impossible not to be remind
ed that this form of speech finds its pro
totype in the ancient greek language
in the history of herodotus we are
told that the government of the man
lias the most beautiful name of isono
miaor equality before the law book
  thus this remarkable lan
guage by its comprehensiveness and
flexibility in an age when equality be
fore the law was practically unknown
nevertheless supplied a single word
which is not to be found in modern
tongues to express an idea which has
been practically recognized only in
modern times such a word in our
own language as a substitute for e
quality might have superseded some of
the criticism to which this political doc
trine has been exposed
after this review the way is now
prepared to consider the nature of e
quality as secured by the constitution
of massachusetts the declaration of
independence which was put forth af
ter the french encyclopedia and the
political writings of rousseau places
among selfevident truths this proposi
tion that all men are created equal
and that they are endowed by the cre
ator with certain unalienable rights
that among these are life liberty and
the pursuit of happiness the con
stitution of massachusetts repeats the
same idea in a different form in the
first article it says all men are bom
ree and equal and have certain natural
essential and unalienable rights among
which may be reckoned the right of en
oying and defending their lives and
iberties the sixth section further
xplaltis the doctrine of equality it
lays jvb man nor corporation or
issociation of men have any other title lo
tbtaiu advantages or particular and ex
tusire privileges distinct from those of
he community than what arises from the
otmderatian of services rendered to the
mblic and this title being in nature
leither hereditary nor transmissahle to
hildren or descendants or relations
y blood the idea of a man being horn
i magistrate lawgiver or judge is
ibsurd and unnatural the language
lere employed in its natural insignifi
ance condemns every form of inequal
ty in civil and political institutions
though these declarations preceded
n point of time the ampler declarations
if france they may if necessary be
mnstrued in the light of the latter it
s evident that they aim to declare sub
stantially the same things they are
leclarations of rights and the language
imployed though general in its char
icter is obviously to be restrained to
hose matters which are within the de
ign and sphere of a declaration of
lights it is a childish sophism to ad
luce in argnment against them the phy
sical or mental inequalities by which
nen are characterized
it is a palpable truth that men are
lot born equal in physical strength or
n mental capacities in beauty of form
r health of body diversity or ine
juality in these respects is the law of
reation from this difference springs
livine harmony but this inequality is
n no particular inconsistent with the
nost complete civil and political equal
ty
the equality which was declared by
ur fathers in  and which was
nade the fundamental law of massa
chusetts in  was equality before the
aw its object was to efface all politi
cal or civil distinctions and to abolish
ill institutions founded upon birth all
nen are created equal says the dec
aration of independence all men
ire om free and equal says the maa
ischusetts bill of rights these are
not vain words within the sphere of
heir influence no person can be crea
ted no person can be om with civil
ur political privileges not enjoyed e
jually by all his fellowcitizens nor
can any institution be esablished re
cognizing any distinctions of birth
this is the great charter of every per

and whoever may be his parents he
may be poor weak humble blackhe
may be of caucasian of jewish of in

nor english nor irish he is a man
the equal of all his fellow men he
is one of the children of the state
which ike an impartial parent re

pacities but it welcomes all to its equal
hospitable board the state imitating

god is the father of us all and all we are brethren
ish every form of discrimination foun
i ded on birth
quamvig ill  nigei juamvu tu candidu cue
 i now pass to the second stage
of this argument and ask attention tc
this proposition the legislature ol
massachusetts in entire harmony with
the constitution has made no discrim
nation of color or race in the establish
ment of public schools
if discrimination were made by the
laws they would be unconstitutional
and void but the legislature of mass
achusetts has been too just and gener
ous too mindful of the bill of rights
to establish any such privilege of birth
the language of the statutes is gener
al and applies epually to all children
of whatever color or race
the provisions of the law regulating
this subject are entitled of the public
schools revised statutes chap 
it is to these that we must look in or
der to ascertain what constitutes a pub
lic school none can be legally such
which are not established in conformity
with the law they may in point ol
fact be more or less public yet ii
they do not come within the terms ol
the law they do not form a part of the
beautiful system of our public schools
they are not public schools
it is important then to examine
these terms the first section provides
that in every town containing fifty
families or householders there shall
be kept in each year at the charge el
the town by a teacher or teachers ol
competent ability and good morals one
school for the instruction of children in
orthography reading writing eng
lish grammar geography arithmetic
and good behavior for the term of six
months or two or more such schools
for the terms of time that shall together
be equivalent to six months the d
d and th sections provide for the
number of such schools to be kept in
other tov ns having more thpn five hun
dred inhabitants the language here
employed does not recognize any dis
crimination of color or race thus in
every town whether there be one or
more schools they are all to be
schools for the instruction of children
generallynot children of auy particu
lar class or color or raee but chil
dren meaning the children of the
town where the schools are
the sth and th sections provided
for the establishment in certain cases
of a school in which additional studies
ure to be pursued which shall be
kept for the benefit of all the inhabitants
of the town here the language not
only does not recognize any discrimi
nation among the children but seems
directly to exclude it
in conformity with these sections is
the peculiar phraseology of the me
morable law of the colonies in 
founding public schools tothe end
that learning be not buried in the
graves of our forefateers this law
obliged towns having fifty families
forthwith to appoint one within the
limits to teach all such children as
ihall resort to him to write and read
ancient charters 
it is on this legislation that the pub
lic schools of massachusetts have been
reared the clause of the revised
statutes chap  and the statute
 chap  appropriating small
urns in the nature of a contribution
out of the school fund for the support
of common schools among the indians
do not interfere with this system these
partake of the anomalous character of
all the legislation with regard to the in
dians of this commonwealth it does
not appear however that any separate
schools are established by law among
the indians nor that the indians are in
any way excluded from the public
schools in their neighborhood
i conclude from this examination
that there is but one kind of public
school established by the laws of mas
sachusetts this is the general public
school free to all the inhabitants
t ere is nothing in these laws estab
lishing any exclusive or separate school
for any particular class whether rich
or poor whether catholic or protest
ant whether white or black in the
eye of the law there is but one class in
which all interests opinions conditions
and colors commingle in harmony
excluding none comprehending all
from the legislation ofthe common
wealth i pass to the adjudication of
the courts

i from the national eti
new york and slavery ex
tension
governor fish of new york dr
votes a large portion of bis messag
to the discussion of the slavery que
tion he lays down some siund prin
ciples and shows ample reasons foi
resistance to the extension of slavery
but after a careful search we cpi
find no distinct recognition of tb
power and duty of congress to prohibii
by positive enactment slavery in itu
territories he insists that the ter
ritories are reethat the mexican jae
excluding slavery therefrom is still in
forcethat new york cannot give hei
assent and congress ought not to give
its sanction to the extension of slavery
into themand that california having
organized a state government inter
dicting slavery ought to be admitted
into the union these positions em
brace the entire practical ground taken
by governor fish which is de
fined in hia own language
the people of california have re
cently taken initial steps toward ad
mission into the union as a sovereign
state by the constitution which they
have adopted they have embodied in
their organic law the prohibition o
slavery or involuntary servitude and
a petition was presented to congress
during the past winter in behalf of a
portion of the people of new mexico
asking for the establishment of a ter
ritorial government which should pro
tect them against the institution ol
domestic slavery the voice of the
people of california has thus been ex
pressed in favor of freedom and there
is little room for doubt that new mex
ico sympathizes in sentiment with
california congress cannot without
a transgression of its constitutional
powers estoblish slavery within this
territory nor can it without the viol
ation of the principles of justice and
an utter disregard of the wishes of the
people and of the protection which it
is bound to extend over the territory to
which it has acquired the title refuse
admission to the new state or coun
tenance or sanction in any way the
introduction of slavery within the ter
ritory and without the sanction and
the assent of congress these newly
acquired territories are secured to
freedom and must remain as they
now are exempt from the institution of
slavery the emphatic voice of the
legislature of the state of new york
expressed in the resolutions passed al
their last two sessions and the nearly
unanimous sentiment of the people ol
our state have declared that under
no circumstances will their assent be
given to the extension of slavery into
these territories from which it is now
excluded
examine carefully these paragraphs
and you find no affirmation or recogni
tion of the right and duty of congress
to interdict slavery the burthen of
them is that these territories are
already secured to freedom and that
congress cannot without a transgres
sion of its constitutional powers sanc
tion or countenance in any way the
introduction of slavery therein
wellthis is the ground of general
cassthe ground of nonintervention
nothing more nothing less the
slaveholders have no dispute with
governor fish for they do not ask
that congress sanction or countenance
the introduction of slavery into the
territoriesall they demand is that it
abstain from any positive interdiction
and this the governor does not claim
or even allude to as right or expedient
the resolutions proposed in the
senate of new york by mr geddes
the able and faithful whig senator
from onondaga as the tribune styles
him are marked by the same fatal de
fect the first recognises the duty of
congress to pass a law to suppress the
slave trade in the district of columbia
the second recognises the duty not of
sitive interdiction of slavery in the
erritories but merely of resistance
to its extension by all constitutional
measure without specifying whether
the constitution authorizes positive
prohibitionand instructs the new
york senators in congressnot to
vote for the wilmot proviso or to uee
their efforts to procure the passage of
a law prohibiting slavery in the terri
toritories butmerely to resist all at
tempts to yield to slavery any part of
the territories however small and by
whateaer pretence of compromise
mr dickinson would be greatly re
lieved by the passage of such a reso
lution he coaid pursue precisely the
course he has always pursued without
his instructions he could
vote against the introduction of the
wilmiot proviso in any territorial bill
without transgressing one jot or tittle
of his instructions in fact this se
cond resolution may receive the sup
port of every hunker in the legislature
without thereby subjecting himself to
the charge of inconsistency
we regard the resolutions as inten
tionally evasive and cannot believe
that a majority of the members will
countenance such an attempt to impose
sound for substance upon the people

mr cobden and the aus

mr cobden has addressed the fol
lowing letter to dr alexander bach
the austrian minister of home affairs
sir i address you not as a member
of the austrian government but as a
man whose enlightened and liberal sen
timents made a lasting impression on
me when i had the pleasure of your ac
quaintance at vienna you will find an
excuse for this step in the fact of my ta
king it in the interest of those princi
ples of humanity and civilization which
in those days were cherished  by you
as well as me mindful of the views
which in  recomended me to your
kind notice i cannot induce myself to
believe that these views will find in you
a less energetic advocate at the pres
ent than you were in the days to which
i allude
sir the public opinion of my country
is shocked by the coldblooded cruelties
which are being practised against the
fallen ehiefs of the hungarians this
feeling is not confined to one class or to
to one party no there is not a single
man in england who by word or letter
would defend the conduct of the aus
trian government in hungaiy the
sense of the civilized nations of the
continent of europe on this question
must already have reached you nor
will the judgement of america fail to
make itself known in vienna you
are too enlightened to be ignorant oftho
fact the unanimous verdict of our con
temporaries is likewise that of posterity
but did it ever strike you that history
will not accuse the brutal soldierthe
tool of crueltybut the ministers who
are responsible for that soldiers crimes
 scorn to appeal to lower motives than
those of an honorable ambition but i
must ask you die it ever strike you
what dangers surround your present ca
reer you who are so well read in
english history ought to reirember
that four years after jeffreys  bloody
assizes both he and his royal master
were compelled most wretchedly to fly
from the avenging hand of justice or
do you think our time allows the pub
lic conscience to be scorned with impu
nity is it not on the contrary th pe
culiar feature of our time that reaction
follows at the heels of any violence no
matter whether it proceeds from the na

breaking up at the slave trade
the december number of the maryland
colonisaiion journal haa a very interesting
article which aeta out with the formal an
nouncement of a fact which haa otherwiaeand
lars suihoralively been made publicto wit
that the famous slave mart so long known and
held in execration under th name oi gallinas
haa at last been effectively broken up by the
persevering blockade of the british cruisers
the traders there have de i olihed ibe barra
eoons or slave pens given up all the slaves in
their possessions to the british comntodore
and nude arrangements for their own removal
and that ol their properly to sieira leone
so far then the crowning workof slavt
trad extinction at leaai on this part of tlu
african coast has haen effected the danger
remains that galhnas may again become a
slave marl when the system of cruizing anu
blockading shall be abandoned by the british
government as will probably be the case be
fore any long time shall have elapsed and the
only efficient safeguard against this danger it
the aqulsition of the territory by the republic
of liberia either through purchase or con
quest
the whole coast through an extent of 
 miles from the gambia to cape palmas
was in former years doited with slave marls
or stations but galliuas taking its name
from a river at the mouth of which it lies
was the principal and most atetive this dis
tincuon it owed mainly to the peculiar frcii
ities afforded by its situation the post being
in fact a cluster of small islands giving ample
opportunities tor escape and hiding in time oi
need aud the bv at the mouth of the mei
m king it difficult and dangerous fur cruisers
to enter and in the rainy season being almisi
impassable it lias bean eaiiraaied hat for
years some ten thousand slaves per annum
were shipped from this marl alone
the principal manager of this business
for there were several merchants or factors a
gallmaawaa a spaniard don pedro blan
co he was a man of intelligence and edu
cation possessed ot great ealih gentleman
ly in his manners humane uud generous a
bis calling would allow him to be and exer
cised an almost unbounded influence among
the native
he lived in a semibarbarous manner ai
mice as a private gentlemen and an african
prince he maintained several establish
ments one on an island near the rivers mouth
which was his place of business or of trade
with foreign vessels that came lo gallinas to
dispose of merchandise on another island
mure remote was his dwelling house where
he kept hia ptvate office his books dined
took his siesta slept c ou a third s
hia seraglio of native wives each in her seve
ral dwelling aferthe manner of native chiefs
independent of all these were his barracuont
of slaes of greater or less extent as circum
stances required
as an illustration both of his authority and
of the determination wnh which it was exer
cised it is related of him that being on one
occasion at a point on the btach some distance
from gsllmas where his person was mu
known he approached the hut ol a native aim
required the owner who was sitting at tin
door to briqg him a light for his segar tin
man refused on which bianco drew back
took a a carbine from one of his attendants
and laid the native dead at his leei to hi
alaves howeverhis human merchandize
he waa uniformly humane and kind taking
good cate ofilieui in sickness supplying them
with abundant and wholesome loud smelly
prohibiting improper intercourse between hie
subordinate and the females and never allow
iog any to be flogged or utbetwise misused
tbe first peculiarity noticed by visitors to
gallinas was an arrangement of numerous
lookouts or watch staimus consisting oi lof
ty seats fifty or a hundred feel above the
ground either among the branches of tall
trees or on the tops of high poles whence
aotiuels were always scanning the horizon
with good glasses as well to descry the ap
proach of traders in want of slaves as to give
warning of a visit f rom a hostile cruizer
auoot a mile from the rivers mouth was a
cluster of islands on each of w hich was loca
ted uie factory ot some particular slave mer
chant the buildings generally consisted
a business ro in with warehouse attached
filled with merchandize and provisions and a
barracoon lor the slaves the whole built by
cuing rough stakes or small trees into the
ground these being wauled together with
withes and covered with thatch that con
taining the slaves was much the strongest
sod generally surronnded byor connected with
a yard iu w hich the slaves were permuted to
exercise daily there were some ten or
twelve of these establisnmnms each contain
ing iforn  to  slaves one contained
sear  which it was expected would be
shipped daily each banacoon waa in charge
of from two to four while men spanish oi
portaguese
they bad all suffered more or less from the
fever were very weak much emaciated oi
swollen by dropsy or diseased spleens and
dmie of them particularly clean the slaves
were as well taken care of as could be expec
ted when provisions were plentiful in the
countrybut in scarcity they suffered severely
many instances have occurred wherein whole
barracoon of slave have been let loose tbi
want of food and it may well be
their owner would allow them to suffer sc
verely beloie giving them up for this rea
son and because they can be stowed moft
closely in a vessel children are generally
preferred to adults another peculiar feaiuu
of the place was the collection of long canoes
and boats all kept ready for the dispatch ol
claves the moment an opportunity should oc
cur probably one thousand slaves could be
shipped in tour hours ail things tavoiable in
case the coast is dear of armed vessels and a
slaver appeals in the offing her signal is at
once recognized she is signalized in return
to e me in and if she is watered and piovis
ioned for the voyage and decklaid which l
usually the case she does not even come to
anchor but stands close in the bar whete
she is met by the whole fleet of canoes and
boats the contents ot which are speedily pui
on board she then stands off or up the coast
again the canoes return to the barracoon fin c
more staves again to meet outside the bar as
before sometimes however ihey are not ao
fortunate even when not molested by a man
ofwar the bar at the rivers mouth is not 
unfrequently dangerous even in the dry sea
son soar in the anxiety to ship the slaves
they run great hazards and many a boat load
of poor w retches becomes food for sharks
which often follow such boats and canoes in s
great cumbers c
in the liberator of last wtek we find an
eloquent account of the boston bazaar from
which we extract the following
mrs thomas mjss carpenter as mr
rick aids again enriched the llzaar by then
very beautiful drawings in w ater colors and

that elicited the liveliest expressions of won

west of ißoglsnd this was the work and
gift of mr mitchell and miss ames of bris

nothing iljwtrttee better the timid and
elfish material of which the northern preaa
od northern politicians ate composed and
the keen sagacity of slaveholders than the
effect usually produced by threatening the
dissolution of the american union this
threat has ever been the chosen instrumeo
in the hands of the south to bumble sub
dee and alarm the north into n compliance
with the most unjust dishonorable and scan
dalous behests of slavery we must give
the slaveholders credit for profound skill in
the use of this mode of assault they have
resorted to it only when all others have
failed and have never allowed the public
mind to become so familiar with it as to des
troy the terror with which it is contemplated
they have thereby been able to use it all
the mote successfully in sueh emergencies as
have demanded its exercise we would not
imply that this hune bugbear has lost none of
his power for such is far from being the
case many there are who once trembled at
the thought of dissolving the union who
can now read of and hear the proposition
beiog urged no matter how vehemently
w ith the utmost composure in fact there
are petsons of much intelligence who are
situated in positions altogether favorable to
forming a correct judgment wbo pronounce
all the threats of disunion from the south as
the most unmitigated of shams we are not
certain but that this is a correct estimate oi
the character of such threats as they drop
from the lips of southern politicians we
have no ides that with their knowledge ol
the exposed condition of the south from
foes withinfrom foes without any one ol
 them would be willing to reduce his rainbow
views of disunion to the stern teality oi
practical operation with them it is the
long gun without powder or balla mere
cloud without rain they well know the
hazardous position which the isolated south
would then occupy and we are persuaded
that the blindnesa they now evince is more
seeming than real we apprehend there
fore no danger to the union from southern
politicians the only source at the south
whence danger to the union may be ration
ally apprehended is that by familiarizing
he masses with the ides of disunion as the
remedy for fancied evils the latter may in
the blindness of their ignorance produce a
tide in favor of disunion so violent that even
the statesmen of the south may not be able
successfully to resist it the case now sup
posed would not be without a parallel and
yet we have no hopes of a dissolution of the
union even from that source for there is not
a slaveholder of any intelligence in the land
j w ho does not know that the american union
is the most powerful bulwark that protect
slavery in the south to dissolve the union
would be to exclude the southern siatei
from the sympathy and respect of the civil
ized world they wou d be shut up within
the limits of their own horrid slave prisons
and left alone to grapple with the strong
arms of their sable bondmen woe to the
slaveholder when the union is dissolved
whither can he look for succor when hit
dominion shall be disparted by his
victim the spirit of the agethe move
ments of the world are tending mutually in
the establishment of liberty and justice among
mankind ever year adds its fearful lesson
written in characters of blood to startle and
to stun the tyrant and the oppressor into a
sense of their guilt and to lead them to re
pentance it is no time now for slavery to
isolate itself to stand alone is to stand
where the accumulated bolts of worlds
public opinion may descend and exterminate
the system for ever
we did not propose to speculate as to the
probabilities of a dissolution of the union
in the present remarks but we desired to
call attention to an article in the rochester
daily american of monday last as a speci
men of the success of southern bluster in
alarming that paper into apprehensions for
the safety of this union a mure frothy
shallow puerile and contemptible piece of
servility we hive seldom of iste seen in a
northern paper and certainly never in a
paper of this peculiarly free and liberal city
it seems that the writer has been spending
two years in the state of georgia where he
has become quite enamored of the peculiar
institution how such a creature could ever
be thought a fit person to edit the rochester
american is too mysterious for oar ken
he would have answered perhaps pretty
well for that post fifteen years ago be is
certainly not up to the spirit of these times
and may be deemed far behind ue present
age tbia new editor of the american
treats his readers to the following dish of
editorial twaddle
knowing how much whig and whig
journals have suffered by resisting fanatic
and fanaticism at the south  cannot but
hope that their political friends at the north
wiu nut render their eflutts to preserve the
i integrity of the unon utterly fruitless if
i any great good was expected to accrue from
all this popular agitation from one extreme
of the empire to the other this hope of good
might be something like sn offset to much
positive evil but it has put off the begin
ning of emancipation in kentucky at least
quarter of a century and paisaed the
tongues and pens of every friend of the mea
sure in the fifteen slavelioldtng states in
calculable injury has been done to the slaves
and so far as  can discover no benefits
have come to freemen anywhere
here yon have it the sufferings oj
the whig journals to preserve the inte
grity of the union t this dear whig editor
would alleviate the sufferings of the whig
journals calm the troubled waves of po ulsr
agitation and preserve the integrity of the
union illuttriogg patriot he sees no
good itr this agitationthis opposition to the
extension of slaverythis demand for the
abolition of slavery and the accursed slave
trade in the district of columbiais all this
he sees naught but positive evil pity

that this agitation has pot off the beginning
f emancipation in kentucky at least a quar
ter of a century and paralyzed the tongues

wish this editor could make the slaveholder
believe that the heat way to pat off emanci
pation to unite with the abolitioniata sup
port their papers hoy their books pay their
lecturers help them to bold conventions and
and by every means of agitation put off
the day of emancipation it would teem
that our worthy editor differs somewhat to
compare a little man with a great one from
i calhoun who is a man of admitted
hiewdneas and foresight the latter thinks
if this agitation is permitted to go on it will
in the nature of things pervade the land
and destroy slavery but then mr lee has
spent two years in georgia and his opinion
must be taken as good against that of cal
houn he says that incalculable injury haa
ben done to the slaves and aa far aa he can
discover no benefits have come to freemen
anywhere now we have not a very light
opinion of this gjmuemans powers of disco
very he is able to discover incalculable
injuries to slaves in simply asserting iheir
right to be free why will not our cotetn
porary point out to us a few of these incal
culable injuries f give us facts brother
editor instead of your vain and stupid ima
ginings
the following is another chip from the
same rotten block
i submit that something is due from the
friends of the union at the north to those
southern men of both parties who cheer
fully make no inconsiderable petsonal sacri
fices to prevent civil war and bloodshed
fur as the louisville journal truly remarks
the federal government never will be sev
eied till sectional antipathies which alone
can cause a separation must lead to long and
sanguinaty hostilities
something is due from the north
will our brother tell us what is due
what has hot the north sacrificed for the
preservation of this unhallowed union it
haa bartered sway its conscience to swearing
to return the fugitive slave to bondage and
to put down slave insurrections it has ex
pended nearly thirty millions in an infernal
slave hunt in the everglades of florida to
preserve the uniou it has annexed texas
and has uniformly voted for slaveholders and
their mean abettors to fill tne highest offices
of honor and profit in the gift of the nation 
to preserve the union what mure would
this whig editor ask something is due
come try your hand and tell us uhat it is
we give another splash from the pen of
this tenderhearted editor
few appreciate how much pain the hare
discussion of such a topic in the lamily circle
at the south causes in female bosoms whose
only fault is that they were born to an
inheruance which the bad policy not great
as the oompositor made me say iu a previous
letter has lastened on their country
how his gnxious heart xpjpitaies aa jte
thinks of the pain and shuddering experi
enced by the white alavehojding ladiea of the
south when the subject of slavery is men
tioned l his sympathies are easily excited
for these but the hideous howls and piteous
cries of black women under the bloody lash
of an obdurate slaveholder awaken no in
dignation excite no sympathy in the breast
of this worse than northern doughfacd
the only fault of these slaveholding lamts
that they are born to an inheritance of human
flesh aa their property how much are they
to be commiserated and ia he not an ob
durate and coldblooded man who can witness
the agitation of those anxious female bo
sad nut be moved to compassionate
their unfortunate predicament
we do c w marvel that those wicked white
women of who have no more sense
of justice mn o veb their equal sisters of
their hard earnings who have no mote tee
ing than to cause them to be driven to the
field under a drivers lash who have no
better idea of than to breed
children for the slave market in utter disre
gard of the marriage tiewe say we do not
marvel that such hardened and guilty crea
tures should be agitated when their dark and
damning crimes are subjected to exposure
the remainder of this remaikable article ia
similar to what we have quoted we give it
entite without further note or comment it
speaks for itse fr d
if li e people of tbs slsveholding states
could be permitted to humanise and elevate
the negro race without the assistant j of citi
zens in the free slates the existing laws
against teaching slaves to read and write
would anon become t dead letter if thev
were not geneiallt repealed now those
that would gladlv see them rise in the scale
of intelligence comfort and freedom cannot
lift a fi iger to ameliorate their condition
without exciting suspicions which jeopard
i heir wu and result in anything but
good to toe slave it is the nonslavebtdders
many of whom cannot raud that do not care
to see negroes educated better than them
selves an intelligent servant being worth
twice as much as a stupid one why should a
well informed slaveholder oppose the en
lightenment of persons whom he is proud to
call my people
the nonslaveholders have this whole
matter in their own hands and they diffei
entirely ftom the providence journal which
stated a few days stnee that it is for the in
terests of those who hold no slaves to abolish
the institution among the h unde reds of
intelligent and not intelligent men not slave
holders with whom i have poavetaed on this
subject during a residence of over two years
in georgia i never found one who would
consent to the liberation of slaves on any
terms and permit them to remain in the
state there may be northern states
whose people would rejoice to have aa many
georgia slaves citizens among them ss there
are white peri mis but i doubt the fact at
all events before five hundred thousand are
imported the friends of the measure had
belter reside a year or two ia a community
where persona of african descent outnumber
all others as no man hg more than one

my deae friend i lately
hesrd s popular preacher who opened hit
sermon with the axiom hat christianity
was the religion of a gentlemanand he ad
mirably maintained his proposition by tbs
teachings and the deportment of its founder
and its early votaries well then if the
above proposition be e truth in what cate
gory are we to place the arrogant and the
rude both incompatible with the attributes
of a gentleman and consequently with those
of a christian
it is a striking fact that the almighty
made choice of men remarkable for meekness
to be the founders of the two great religious
systems anterior to christianitythe pain
srchal and the levittcal how beautifully is
this attribute displayed in abrahams conduct
towards lot in surrendering to him the right
of choice of land
the meekness of moses has become a pro
verb in one memorable instance it forsook
nim of the cowardly mal
treatment of a child of bondage by his op
pressor he had looked upon the burdens u
hta enslaved brethren and the miseries ot
their condition caused his meekness to be in
abeyance during a moment of indignation
ihe whole life of the saviour was a per
sonification of this virtue superficial ob
servers have confounded meekness with
pusillanimity was the exposer of the pha
risees the purger of the temple ever pusill
animous never by ittm meekness was
elevated to an elegant refinement a dignified
complacency and the raeek will commonly
be tuund to possess the fortitcr in re as well
as the suaviter in modo
it is seen in the majority of instances that
those persons who have suddenly risen from
a low station in society to a higher are more
arrogant and assuming than those who are
born in the higher spheres of the community
and the uutted suites seetn to exhibit na
tionally the characteristics that the lowbred
manifest individually
wby will the americans by their coarse
rudeness remind a stranger that their exist
ence among civilized nations is of a recent
date
m guizot has said that france is the only
country in a perfectly civilized state either
bia assertion ia untrue or christianity is not
an instrument in civilization lor in france
vainglory and arrugance are much more con
spicuous than humility and meekness
outward polish is plearing and the observ
ance of conventional forms convenient but
to deport oneself as a complete gentleman te
quires something more these are mere
outward displays of good breeding but a
gentleman acta from a sentiment and an in
ward perception of propriety he will so
demeau himself in his intercourse with those
of an inferior grade to himself ss to cause in
them a cheerful acquiescence in the ine
qualitya conviction that it is fur the well
being of society that it should be so
how beautiful would be the social inter
course of christian principles were innate
and christian precepts carried out chris
tianity supplies rules for all conditions all
circumstances and all contingencies but
alas the votaries of false religions often by
their conduct put selfstyled christiana to
ahame
contrast the recent acts of lbs mussulman
towards the hungarian the polish and the
italian refugees with the bloodthirstiness of
the russian and the austrian christianity
the contrast almost palliates the spostscy of
a bern and his ninety comrades
jtumil there be on earth peace and good
will to men the adaptation of benign
christianity to restore a fallen world will not
be seen the extinction of war and slavery
will be the precursor of the suppression oi
all other ills
in mentioning slavery contrast the feelings
of lawrence sterne with those of the citi
zens of the united states ignatius sauchn
who was an emancipated slave resident in
london wrote to sterne his gratitude for
sternes denunciation of slavery thanking
him for advocating the cause of his african
brethren sterne in reply says my dear

diar sir i perceive by a report of a
meeting held by the american colonisation
society at the seat of the general govern
ment that you still seriously entertain the
idea of expatiiating a large pertion of the
american people and forcing them by might
ol oppression and discouragement at home to
settle on a distant and foreign shore
ou will pardon me as one of those whom
it is ptoposed to benefit by the scheme
for addressing you ray views in relation to
ibe justice expediency or practicability of
the proposed measure of which you are the
distinguished head and exponent and al
though not apecialiy deputedto represent the
views of those with whom i am identified
yet l hazatd the opinion mat i express but
the views of one generation of that much
abused injured and underestimated portion
of the american public
i take pleasure in addressing this to your
consideration because of your jevotioo to
the cause of humanity and justice made
manifest in yotr eloquent appeals in behalf
of the oppressed of europe the greeks
the poles the irish the hungarians and to
doubt that your philanthropy ia as broad as
the race of man would be to doubt your
democracyto doubt your chiiiuanity to
doubt your sincerity in those appeals that
were responded to by the friends of freedom
every where which it is far from my pur
pose to do in this communication
v e will first consider the proposed expatri
ation as relates to its justice simultaneous
with the landing of the pilgrim fathers on
plymouth rockthose founders of civil and
religious libertythose mighty men of
whom every american in whose bu m throbs
a heart of flesh must be proudthose wondei
ful men the admiration of an impartial world
who far lrom their and trienda perse
vered amidst dangers and privations until
history points to them as the founders of a
vast empire and a nation stands as a monu
ment hearing record of their greatness aim
ulwneous with their landing landed the
shackled cargo of a slave ahip upon the
virgin aoil of your own native virginia
proud mother of states and statesmen long
before her washington her henry her
jefferson or her clay had enterad upon the
stage of existence or into the imagination ol
their ancestersthe hardy pilgrims of toil
the meek and wronged forefathers of those
it is proposed to rudely tear from their homes
and reoutrage by similarly against their
might forcing them to a repassage of the
mighty deep to a shore as foreign to them as
was virginia to their ancestors and as the
sons of the northern pilgrims have by their
perseverance and skill rendered the vast
wilderness the nigged hills of new england
into cities towns and villages teeming with
industry enterprise and intelligence filled
her waters with whitened sails and groaning
hulls so have the sons of those s rathein
pilgrims by their lab their sweat and
their blood tilled watered and fertilized the
south whilst your norman ancestry fur
nished the skill and capital and if the south
te leas beautiful less prosperous less con
venient comparatively than the east it is not
that they have been idle but because the
oil has been cursed by wrongs that it
they have not been permitted to acquire that
intelligence and skill by mental culture and
honorable incentive aa to enable labor to pro

preached that whosoever hateth hie biotlier

whom you do not sec if that god be the
author of the prejudice that dogs the track of
the free colored man but which is giving
way before the enlightenment of the age
and the ptogress of the race of men ot is
the growth of seed sown by slavery and
injustice and fostered and cultivated by the
american colonisation society  beg speedy
answers to these questions as upon them
depends the removal or confirmation of im
pressions which if wrong ought to be re
moved
secondly we will consider the expediency
of the proposed measure although art hum
ble foliuwer ot that school who believe
that right is at all times expedientduty in
terest yet we will endeavor to consider it in
accordance with the generally accepted rule
that it is not always expedient to do right or
safe to do duty for convenience  will sub
divide this into three minor propositions capa
city policy and interest lt as to capaci
ty the united states embraced according
to malle btun woodbridge and others pre
vious to the annexation of texas and the
acquisitions of california and new mexico
two millions of square miles by those ac
quisitions eight hundred andfifty one thou
sand five bundled square miles have been
added it is estimated that this extent of
territory is capable of maintaining four times
the present population of the globe the
south though she would promote her inter
est by changing the relation existing be
tween capital and labor
by urging on from love of rub
rather than forcing by thr lash
yet she cannot afford to lose a class of
laborer who from long nsage of toil and
hardship are preeminently calculated to cul
tivate cotton rice sugar and tobaccoher
ample products not that europeans could not
cultivate them but it wbuld take much time
and hardship tu prepare them for their suc
cessful culture beside there is an abundant
field for the industry of all who may seek an
asylum here wiihout supplanting those ac
climated and useful laborers there is
room for all to work on harmoniously for
the developement of those great resources
embosomed in our extensive dominion each
oonuibuling in his own sphere to the nation
al wealth prosperity and glory and to the
advancement of purely liberal iostitutions
such as were contemplated by the founders
of our common country
sjly as to the policy of our country
the fundamental principle of our country is
that government derive powers ftoro the con
sent of the governed that when laws are op
pressive it is the right and tbe duty of the
people to repeal them through their represen
tatives it contemplates that all ahall actively
assent to or dissent from laws existing or
proposed it contemplate a tecogniuon of
all menno matter what institutions they
were fitei subject to or what sky their eyes
firrt beheld if they but declare their prefer
ment and attest their allegiance as citizens it
proclaims to open its doors to the oppressed
of all nations it contemplates at some fu
ture period the world ot mankind enjoying
its institutions and by general consent uni
ted in one vast republic one brotherhood one
great pelitical family then how impolitic to
advise an inoffetiaive a highly useful and pa
triotic people whose toil and blood and bones
are linked as indissolubly with the soil as
plymouth rock and whose identity with the
country for weal or woe and they have had
their share of the latter are of as long dura
tion as the memorable pilgrims who landed
upoi that base of amerinan greatness 
would humply ask if such a proposition is
consistent with american policy does it
flnd an advocate in the eloquent defender of
the cauee of liberty in europethe em
bodiment of that system which has for its
moto the encouragement of home indus
try an impartial yet ignoiant observer
would suppose we had a redundant popula
t on and the question was who can we
best afford to part with
dly of what interest would it be to this
country to get rid of tome four of five mil
lions of iu native pipulaiion who have by
two hundred years labor assisted in enriching
her firtfds sod ad ninistering to the ease and
comfort of it ettiasns who side by side with
other of their countrymen have bieasted the
stonn of bullets and borne triumphant aloft
the stripes and stars the fellow soldier of

private aid to many of the heroea in the
mexican war who have become interwoven
with american aong and literature and who
with the indian f nn the basis of a purely
amermao literature w hat crime have they
committed that they mutt away to the con
vict ships and be transported from the bones
ef their forefathers i their crime only the
color ef their kio or are they who have made
this cob the badge of meanness a pretext
for insult reproach and hatred  would ask
whether those who have enacted that the
color ef a negro or mulatto is prima foot evi
dence that be ist sieve bate not violated the
constitution of their country which provides
that no bill of attainder ahall he panned

a grecian philosopher once asked ih
question whom do we hate most nd
t after several ineffectual attempts to answer it
d from his cotemporariea answered tbost
s we have most injured perhaps this ma
enable colonieatronists to discover that their
i victims ate not so dangerous as they appre
head that it is their own hatred that ha unu
their imaginations and like the ghost of the

had you been in new york or new
england in  and seen with what erif hu
siaam the majority of the colored voterswent
for the antiannexation candidates you would
have thought them perhaps a too forgiving
instead of a dangerous population
the third and last proposition is the prac
ticability of the colonotation scheme it ap
pears to me that the most sanguine advocate
of negro expatriation should by this time be
convinced of the impossibility by any means
of removing the four or five millions of par
tial descendants of africans from this coun
try we are here and here we mean to
remain we cant be coaxed cheated hit sed
or kicked out of our country we look vith
unmitigated disapprobation upon all such pro
positions and heartily scorn and despise the
means by which it is sought to be attained
vi exclusion special and oppressive higi
lstion and the fostering of an unnatural pre
judice such as the american colomzatioi i so
ciety has essayed to do and charged upon
tbe author of our existence by its tail c ol
impassable gulfs natural repugnance and
such choice epithets in the same inconsisaam
harrangeis in which they hove claimed par
excellence our dear devoted distinguished
friends we hail with pleasute the grow ing
sense of justice east west noith and sot rlh
and balieve there is love of liberty and
christiautiy enough in the american people
of all sections to yet do us justice and
above all that the great ruler of the uni
verse hath ordained it we mean neve i to
cease demanding it but with the cessatio n ol
ourhearta vibration we mean logo where you
go die where you die and be buried ir the
place of your burial and finally if the en
lightenment of the american people will
permit them to annihilate us by foul naenns
they shall consummate the darkenedmoosti ous
deed and appear before the supreme judge
of men and natiois andwith stained ha nds
and souls
in conclusion permit me to subscribe my

fredrick being a contributor to the
anti slavery fair which closed last evening
my name and presence will doubtless be
used as endorsing the entire proceedings i
am not ashamed to identify myself with the
cause of the slave but i believe it need not
necessarily follow that i must approve every
thing done professedly in his behalf or lor
emancipation
allow me to say then that i regret that
them is so much of the fanciful and so mule
of th e useful presented t our antislavery
bazaars while abo lionisis are reasonably
expected to he economical in furnishing their
dwellings and in their manner of livingnot
only for the preservation of health and
strength the better to furlher the causo of
freedom but to afford better facilities in time
and money for the diffusion of aniislui ery
truths they ought to carefully avoid an en
couragement of extravagance abolitionists
too should be enough couversiant with the
laws of health and longevity to avoid late
suppers especially of the character of the
one got up on this occasion another thing
i did not like the lottery system in both
morally aud legally wrong yet tickets
were sold to the value of the articles designa
ted when but one draws the prize tv be
sure the proceeds are used for the benefit ol
tbe oppressed instead of enriching one at the
expense of many still if this system is
used for certain purposes however good does
it not encourage ns use for another purpose
not quite as good and so on till we uray soon
find it doing its former evil work
 am glad that the north star like its an
titype or its original in the blue vault of the
heavens continues to shine and that the pros

we here give our readers the promised
rentalks ot wra llovd garrison on the
character of the chronoiype a paper recent
ly discontinued in boston they are full of
instruction to all who engage in the work of
reform f d
the boston ckroaotype
this paper has been discontinued tor lack
of patronage it was edited with industry
tact and ability but was sadly deficient in
dignity consistency and principle the time
has been when we entertained for its editor
the warmest affection and the highest esteem
and at that period he deserved both for
the first half a dozen years after his espousal
of the amiallvery cause he was conspicuous
for his zeal courage selfsacrifice uncom
promising spirit indefatigable labors in its be
half and had he endured to the endhad hr
not identified himself with the tieacherous
seceders from the american antislavery
society and become as malignant to it as be
fore he had been faithfulhad he not made
shipwreck of principle and ridiculed the idea
of a standard of absolute justice and right
had he not thrown away all selfrespect all
regard for fairness and truthhe mighthave
won for himself a solid and permanent repu
tation and continued a burning and a shining
light alter his defection he became the
editor of the massachusetts abolitionist a
paper started with the hope of crushing the
massachusetts antislavery society and
strongly characterized by personal malevo
lence aud abuse by misrepresentation and
falsehood falling of success in ilm un
gracious business he subsequently gave him
self wholly to the fabulous for a livingi
other words to the translation and publication
of la foluaitus fablet but this did not
pay and finally the coronotype was launch
ed on the uea of adveuture not exactly for
piratical purposes but with a variety of flag
to be used deceptively according to the exi
gencice of the case without much scrupto as
to the kind of freight taken on board and
having no eeruis destination it has now
gone down but not at all tuthe detruneat of
lawful and honorable commerce
from its commencement to its extinction
the chronotypt was a catchpenny sheet
havieg two special objects in view first a
bitter sod unmitigated fowtiuty to old organ
med aboiluomaot end secondly a superficial
support of various teforntatoiy movements
so as to catch the putnmegeof all who reason
sad foe superfisially is regard to thaae mat
ter it nunl an air of independence and
oldnea yet was accomodating adroit and
rickish aaan end waa to be gained it was
iot without its merits and published much
useful and valuable matter yet its advocacy
f any cause so fat as the editor was coo
terned was generally in such s trifling un
jiguified manner at to afford it no substantial
itd at times it was scurrilous in the extreme
i could not therefore make any moral im
resssion upon the community men read it
mbe amused not instructed as tbey read
ihe boston or new york herald it waa
flippant it was smart it waa puguacioua it
vas unscrupulous why then did it not
succeed because nobody could safely trust
it because it said enough on the subject ol
efoimto lose the countenance of conservat
ism and equivocated and diluted too much to
win the hearty support of radicalism lf it
had told less truth in its life says the editor
in his valediction it would not be lying here
in death this is not certain at almost
any time while it was living it might have
been said of ithere lies the chronotype
or it was not veracious it was the chosen
medium through which apostates from the
intislavery cause sent their poisoned arrows
at its uncompromising and conscientious ad
vocates its moral philosophy was of the
paley type it ridiculed consistency and
made a mock of conscience witness its
course respecting the disunion position ol ihe
american amislavery society it satirized
and denounoed that society for recognising
any proslavety guaranties in the united
slates constitution roundly denied that
there were any such in that instrument and
hen gave its support to the free soil paity
which not only acknowledges all the compro
mises alluded to but equally with the whig
and democratic parties is ready to stand by
them witness its plastering over the pro
si iverv character of martin van buren and
the new york barnburners witness its
mphialica untruthful billingsgate defence ol
father mathewto shield that craven heail
ed two faced reformer from condemnation
every position has seemed more agreeable
to its taste and morality than an erect one
and it very perceptibly giew weak in its tone
and lax in its moral requirements as it ad
vanced in years its editor is not deficient in
mental acuteness or in ready talent but tiia
past career has shown that he is not s relia
ble man
there is great need in this as in other cities
if a daily journal that shall be broadly re
formatory in iis object divested of ail person
al malevolence dignified in its course clear
m the perception and steadfast in the main
tenance of principle edited with tact and
ibility and ht the same time equal to any
other as a newspaper containing the general
intelligence of the limea such a journal
we believe might be made to live but it
must have a very different urn at the helm
fro ii the editor of the chronotype to whom
we wish better success with more honesty
and selfrespect in his next undertaking
doings in congress
in senate
the following debate which took place
n the united state senate on thursday the
th tnst shows the deteimination of the
slaveholders to persist in their demand upon
the north in behalf of kidnapping the flying
fugitiveand evidences the very awkward
position of a liberty party man when sworn
to support the constitution of the united
states it will be seen by the remarks ol
mr chase of k ohio when charged with
voting for a resolution which nullifies the
clause of the constitution relating to fugitive
slaves that he merely discusses that part of
the constitution which speaksofmental reser
vationthat he leaves the impression upon
southern men that he is opposed to the reso
lution emirs to this complexion we have
always felt certain that liberty party men
how brace soever out of office must come
when once brought face to lace in office with
slaveholders does mr chase intend to re
gard the fugitive clause in the constitution
it he do why not come out and say so in
plain language if he do not so intend he
ought to declare his views explicitly that the
noiih may be in fpossession of correct infor
mation respecting his positionr d
capture or fuuitive slaves
the senate in committee of the whole
proceeded to the consideration of the special
ordeithe bill pinvidmg the mure effectual
execution of the provision of the constitution
telaiing to the recapture of fugitive slaves
mr butler addressed the senate in sup
port of the bill stating its object tnfl ex
plaining the necessities which in his opinion
required us immediate adoption in the course
of his reiuatks stating that the loss to the
south by the escape of slaves amounted
annually to at least  he must in
candor confess that lie had no very great con
fidence that the bill would effect to any con
siderable extent the required object because
the federal government had but lhtle authori
ty to enforce the recognition and fulfilment
of the requirements of the spirit of the con
sniuiiun the good faith and integrity ol
the people must be relied on in a great mea
sure for he support of the constitution and
if that would not preserve it inviolate little
dependence could be placed upon statutory
provisions to effect that object he referred
to the legislation of the various northern

mr chase l never offered such a resolu

mr butler said ibe resolution was im
puted to the seustor in a newspaper para

mr base thought that when the senator
made such charges he should be careful to
have better authority for them than newspaper
pangraphs
mr butler said that the senator from
ohm presented the resolution in propria per
sona at an antislavery convention he
was glad to hear that the statement was un
irue mr butler stated further that those
of the northern states which had not passed
laws evading the constitutional provision had
failed to take eny measures to assist the
south as they were bound in good faith to
do at to any congressional action on the
subject he was well aware that the north
baa the majority end that the only hope of
the south was in the wisdom honor and for
bearance of that majority they asked that
a constitutional provision for their protection
be carried out that they might enjoy the
imtection for which they had stipulated in its
adoption in oordoding hit remarks
mr butlks made some incidental allusions

mr caxsi row to address the senate he
did not know why any one senator should be
singled out aa be had been on one or two
occasions unletn it was that a senator not
belonging to either of the great parties was a
safer object of attack than one who was sup
ported by a powerful party in a lew remaikfr
he should briefly say that he favored no con
cealment of purpose or principles no mental
reservation or hesitation to avow what he be
lieved to be the truth as to the resolutioi

mr mason inquired whether mr chasi

of which he was a member he was one ol

work in directing the moral sentiment of
england against american slaveryr d
american slavery
the numerously attended meetings which
have taken place in ihe lecturehall in this
city during the present week lor the purpose
of nearing addresses on the subject of amer
ican slavery have been ot a nature very grati
fying to the philanthropist as showing the
strong feeling which exists in the minds of
our fellowcitizens agsmstt the barbarous
traffic in human flesh mr brown who ad
dressed the meetings with great talent and
fluency is a colored negrowho has succeer ed
in effecting his escape from the lash of h s
cruel taskmasters thomas carlisle has laid
down the dociriue that the negro population
have not the capacity for being educated but
here we have an instance in addition to n nu
merable others which might he cited if a
slave realising a great amount of knowhdge
and the tower of imparting it to others with
facility in a far greater degree than the vast
majority of the white population can boost
mr brown states that he acquired the sit ol
reading from some children with whom he
had brief and secret interviews si nights m a
garret he afterwards became a talented ad
vocate in behalf of his colored brethern and
ultimately was appointed a delegate for bw
ton to the peace congress at pans his
statements the results of persona i experience
and personal observation exhibit a picture
the horrors of slavery in a professedly free
country that ought to raise the blush ot
shame on the countenance ole very american
the severe laws against parties who harbour
slaves who have escaped or who give them
food to prevent them perishing from hunger
the punishment inflicted upon those who teach
slaves to read or who impart any amount ot
education to t ierathe inconsistent conduct
of a large poition of professing christians
who are the owners of slavesmd the traffic
in slaves for the benefit even f doctors of di
vinity end theological institutioneli theee
facts are disgraceful to the character of the
american and a foul blot upon the national
we trust that mr brown will pursue hit
mission until every city and town in this
country hae reciprocated the resolution pasted
by the citiwn of york that the inhabitants
of the united states have no right whatever
to me the wordiiberty so long as slavery
exists within their dominions the tinsni

hanchen of udorf
near the hamlet of udorf on the
banks of the rhine nqt far from bonn
there yet stands the mil which was the
seene of the following adventure
one sunday morning the miller and
his family set out as usual to attend
church at the nearest church in the
village ol heasel leaving the mill to
which the dwelling house was attach
ed in charge of his servant maid
hanchen a boldhearted girl who
bad been some time in his service the
youngest child w ho was still too little
to go to church remained also under
her care
as hanchen was busily engaged
preparing dinner for the family she
was interrupted by a visit from her
admirer heinrich battlehen he was
an idle graceless fellow and her mas
ter who knew his character well had
forbidden him the house but hanchen
could not believe all the stories she
had heard against her lover and was j
sincerely attached to him on thixco
casion she greeted him kindly and not
ouiy got him something to eat at once
but iound time in the midst ot her busi
ness to sit down and have a gossip with
biro while be did justice to the fare set
before him as he was eating he let j
fall hit knife which he askrd her to j
pick up for him she playfully remon
strated telling biin she feared from
all she heard he did little enough work
and ought at least to wait on himself
in the end however she stooped down
to pick up the knife when the treach
erous villain drew a dagger from under
his coat and caught her by the nape of
the neck griping her throat firmly with
his fingers to prevent her screaming
then with an oath he desired her to
tell him where her master kept his
money threatening to kill her if she
did not comply with his demand the
surprised and terrified girl in vain at
tempted to parley with him he sill
held her tightly in his choking grasp
leering her no other choice but to die
or betray her muter she saw there
i was do hope of softening him or chang
ing his purpose and with a full con
viction of bis treachery all her native
courage woke in her bosom affect
ing however to yield to what was in
evitable she answered him in a re
signed tone that what must be must be
only if he carried oft her masters gold
he must take her with him too for she
could never stay to hear thiir suspicions
and reproaches entreating him at the
same time to relax his grasp of her
throat for she could hardly speak
much less do what he bid her while he
held her so tight at length he was
induced to quit bis hold on her re
minding him that he must lose no time
or the family would be returning from
church she then led the way to her
masters bedroom and showed him
the coffer where he kept his money
here she said reaching to him
an axe which lay in a corner of the
room you can open it with this while
 run up stairs to put all my thmga to
gether besides the money i have saved
i since i have been here
j completely deceived by her apparent
readiness to enter into his plans he
allowed her to leave the room only
exhorting her to be ns quick as possi
ble and was immediately absorbed in
his own operations first opening the
box and then disposing of the money
about his person in the meanwhile
hanchen instead of going up stairs to
her own room crept softly along sev
eral passages till she again reached her
masters chamber it was the work ol
a moment to shut and bolt the door
upon him and this done she rushed to
the outer door of the mill to give the
alarm the only being in sight was
her masters little boy a child of five
years old to him she called with all
her might run run to meet your fa
ther as he comes from church tell
him we shall all be murdered if he does
not come back the frightened child
did as she bid hiui and set off running
on the road she pointed out
somewhat relieved by seeing that
the child understood her and would
make her case known she sat down foi
a moment on the stone seat before the
door and full of conflicting emotions
of grief and thankfulness for her es
cape she burst into tears but at this
moment a shrill whistle aroused her
attention it was from her prisonei
heinrich who opening the grated win
dow above her head shouted to some
accomplice without to catch the child
that was running away so fast and tc
kill the girl hanchen lookejl around
in great alarm but saw no one the
child still continued to run with all hit
might and she hoped that it was but e
false alarm to excite and overcome hei
resolution when just as the chile
reached a hollow in the next field a
channel of a natural drain she saw a
ruffian start up from the bed of the
drain and snatching up the child in
his arms hasten with him towards th
j mill in accordance with the direction
j of his accomplice in a moment sht
perceived the full extent of her danger
and formed her plan for escaping it
retreating into the mill she double
looked nnd bolted the lour the only
apparent entrance into the building
every other means of obvious accesi
being prevented by strong iron grat
ings fixed up against all the windows
and then took post at the upper case
ment determined to await patiently hei
masters return and her consequent de
livery from that dangerous position 
her own death if indeed inevitable
for she was fully resolved to enter into
no terms and that nothing should in
duce her to give up her masters pro
perty into the robbers handsshe
had hardly time to secure hersell in her
retreat when the ruffian holding the
screaming child in his arms and
brandishing a knife in one hand came
up and bid her open the door or he
would break it down adding many aw
ful oaths and threats to which her only
answer was that she put her trust in
god heinrich who from his window
wa witness of this colloquy now called
out to cut the childs throat before her
eyes if she still persisted in her refusal
poor hanchens heart quailed at this
horrible threat but only for a moment
the death of the child could be no
gain to them while her own death was
i certain if she admitted the assailant
and her master too would be robbed
she had no reason either to suppose
that her compliance would save the life
of the child it was to risk all agniast
nothing and she resolved to hold out
to the last though the villain from
without renewed his threats saying
that if she would not open the door to
him he would kill the child and then
set fire to the mill over her head i
put my trust in god was still the
poor girls answer
in the meanwhile the ruffian set
down the child for a moment to look
about for combustibles to carry out his
threat in this search he discovered a
mode of entering the mill unthought of
by hanchen it was a large aperture
i in the wall communicating with the
great wheel and the other machinery of
the mill and it was a point entirely un
protected for it had never been con
templated that any one would seek to
enter by so dangerous an inlet trium
phant at this discovery he returned to
tie the hauds and feet of the poor child
to prevent its escape and then stole
back to the aperture by which be in
tended to effect an entrance the situa
tion of the building prevented hanchen
seeing any thing of this but a thought
had inrauwhue struck her it was
sunday when the mill was never at
work if therefore the sails were set
in motion the whole neighborhood
would know that something unusual
was the matter and her master especi
ally hasten home to know the
meaning of anything so strange
beiug all her life accustomed to the
machinery of the mill it was the work
of a moment to set it all in motiona
brisk breeze which sprung up at once
set the sails flying the arms of the
huge engine whirled round with fear
ful rapidity the great wheel slowly
revolved on its axis the smaller gear
turned and creaked and groaned ac
cording as the machinery came into
action the mill ws in full operation
it was at this moment that the ruffian
intruder had succeeded in squeezing
himself through the aperture in the
well and getting himself safely lodged
in the inteior of the great drum wheel
his dismayhowever was indescrib
able when he began to be whirled about
with it rotation and found that all bis j
efforts to put a atop to the powerful
machinery which set it in motion or
extricate himself from this perilous
situation were fruitlessln hi terror
he uttered shrieks and horrible impre
cations astonished at the noise
hanchen went to the spot saw liim
caught like a rat in his own trap from
which it was no part of her plan to
liberate him she knew he would he
more frightened than hurt if he kept
within his rotary prison without any
rash attempts at escape and that even
if he became insensible he could not
fall out of it
in the meane tim the wheel went
raund and round with its steady un
ceasing motion and round and round
he weut with it while sense remained
beseeching hanchen with entreaties
promises and wild impatient threats
which were all equally disregarded
till by degrees feeling and perception
tailed him and he heard and saw no
more he fell senseless at the bottom
of the engine but even then his inani
mate body continued to be whirled
round as before for hanchen did not
dare trust appearances in such a vil
lain and would not venture to suspend
the working of the mill or stop the
mill gear and tackle from running at
their fullest speed
at length she heard a loud knocking
at the door and flew to open it it was
her master and his family accompanied
by several ot his neighbors all in the
utmost consternation and wonder at
seeing the millsail in full swing on a
sunday and still more so when they
found the poor child lying bound on the
grass who however was too terrified
to give any account of what had hap
pened hanciien in a few words told
all and then her spirit which had sus
tained her through such scenes of
terror gave way under the sense ol
safety and relief and she fell fainting
in their arms and was with much dif
ficulty recoveredthe machinery ol
the mill was at once stopped and the
inanimate ruffian dragged from his
dreadful prison heinrich too war
brought foith from the millers cham
ber and both were in a short time sent
bound under a strong escort to bonn
where they soon after met the reward
of their crimes
the story of this extraordinary act of
presence of mind concludes by telling
us that hanchen thus effectually cnred
of her penchant for her unworthy suitor
became eventually the wife of the mil
lers eldest son and thus lived all her
life in the scene ofher imminent danger
and happy deliverance london paper
horrible adventure
 extract of a letter from kirkee near
 ponnallthe writer having been out
shooting ly down to rest under a tree
 when suddenly he was aroused by the
furious haying of his dogs on turn
 mg around  beheld a snake of the
cobra de capclla species directing its
course to a point that would approxi
mate very close upon my position in
an instant  was on my feet the
moment the reptile became aware of
my presence in nautical phraseology
it brought to with expanded hood eyes
sparkling and neck beautifully arched
the head raised nearly two feet from
the ground and oscillating from side to
side in a manner plainly indicative of a
resentful foe  seized the nearest
 weapon a short bamboo left by one
of the beaters and hurled it at my op
 ponents head  was fortunate enough
to hit it beneath the eye the reptile
immediately fell and lay apparently
lifeless
without a moments reflection i
seived it a little below the head hauled
it beneath tiie shelter of the tree and
very coolly sat down to examined the
mouth of the poisoned fangs of which
naturalists speak so much while in
the act of forcing the mouth open with
a stalk i felt the head sliding through
my hand and to my astouishment  be
came aware that i now had to contend
with the most deadly of reptiles in its
full strendth and vigorindeed i was
in a moment convinced of it for as i
tightened my hold on the throat its
body became wreathed around my arm
and neck if the reader is aware of the
universal dread in which the cobra de
capella is held throughout india and
almost instant death which invariably
follows its bile he will in some degree
be able to imagine what my feelings
were at the moment a faint kind of
disgusting sickness pervaded my whole
frame as  felt the cold clammy folds of
the reptile tightening around my neck
i still held the throat but to hold it
much longer would be impossible
immediately beneath my grasp there
was an inward working and creeping
of the skin which seemed to be assisted
by the very firmness with which  held
itmy hand was gloved finding in
defiance of my efforts that my hand
was each instant forced closer to my
face an idea struck me that were it
in my power to transfix the mouth with
some sharp instrument it would pre
vent the reptile from using his fangs
should it escape my hold my gun lay
at ray feet the ramrod appeared the
very thing required which with some
difficulty i succeeded in drawing out
having only one hand disengaged my
right arm was now trembling from over
exertion my hold becoming less firm
when i happily succeeded in passing
the rod through the lower jaw up to its
centre it was not without consider
able hesitation that i let go my hold of
the throat and seised the rod in both
hands at the same time by bringing
them over my head with a sudden jerk
i disengaged the fold from my neck
which had latterly become almost tight
enough to produce strangulation
there was then little difficulty in
freeing uiy right arm and ultimately
to throw the reptile from me to fhe
earth where it continued to twist and
writhe itself into a thousand contortions
of rage and agony to run to a neigh
boring stream to lave my neck hands
and face in its cooling waters was my
first act after despatching my formida
ble enemy this concludes a true
though plainly told tale as a more
it tnay prove that when a man is poe
sessd of determination coolness and
energy combined with reason he will
generally come tq triumph though he
may have to circumvent the subtlety of
the snake or combat the ferocity of the
tiger
effect of stove upon
health
all experience has demonstrated
their debilitating influence upon the
system and nothing is more true than
that the mind sympathises with the
body in all its derangements our old
men remember when the aggregate of
good health was iar above its present
standard when men and women could
endure twice the fatigue that they can
now and when consumption the pre
sent scourge of the north and new
england in particular was almost un
known or existed only as a slow dis
ease that had to battle with life for
many years before its strong victim
succumbed to its power it has been
thought that the bad health and con
stitutions of our farming population
particularly the female portion of farm
ing families are owing to a change of
diet there is no truth in the idea
farmers live as judiciously now as they
did fifty or one hundred years ago in
our mountain towns among the primi
tive hills and pure air of vermont all
over new england in fact the popula
tion are better fed and better clothed
are subjected to less injurious ex
posure and are called to bear less
prostrating fatigue than in those good
old times a hundred years ago yet
where the pure air roves freest where
the dark wings of miasm never come
all along the green mountain ridge
through vermont and massachusetts

all these evils in any thing but the

simple statement of the case is that
the houses are made too close the
rooms are kept too hot and the grand

wickliffe the postmaster general of
the united states under president ty
ler presented the following proposition
to thekentucky conventionon the th
inst we extract from the official re
port to the kentucky statesman
i desire to submit a resolution of en
quiry in relation to free negroes to one
of the committees  think from what
we have expressed here that all aides
would be very gled to get clear of them
from kentucky i have devoted aome
reflection to the subject and to the va
rious expedients suggested to attain
that object as well as its connections
as a state arising under the federal
constitution i propose as a subject
of enquiry for the committee on mis
cellaneous provisions the propriety of
substituting in lieu of the punishments
now imposed on that class of people for
crimes other than murder the penalty
of exportation or of being sold again
into bondagel think it is worthy of
enquiry and it strikes me if it has no
other effect it will at least have a ten
dency of keeping this class of peraoos
out of the state and it may be the
meaae t nf inducing others to leave it
voluntarily it is a subject worthy of
enquiry anq i offer it in that shape
