the preponderant influence of slave
ry in the institutions of our country is
a powerful cause of the result we are
deploring with a population inferior
to that of the free states and rapidly
decreasing it is yet demonstrable thal
slavery has hitherto borne rule in the
nation i saw hut a few days ago a
table of the presidents and all the
chief officers of state in our country
since the adoption oi the constitution
showing that in the highest grades ol
office at least livesixths of the incum
bents have been from the slavcholding
states  laid the record down with
feelings of indignation shame and grief
that  cannot find words to express
indignation that the lordship ol slavery
lias asserted so effectually the lordship
of oiliceshame that we have suffered
it to he sogrief at the discovery that
slavery is the characteristic and the
dominant power of our country it
was no relief to remember that virgin
ia the breeder of slaves a distinction
at once cruel and infamous has also
been the chief breeder ol presidents
as little that the great slave market
of the nationas little nay less that
northern leaders have there conspired
for so many years to stifle the prayer ol
freedom in the halls consecrated tc
equal rights and human liberty o my

slavery being thus predominant in
the politics of our country they have
grown as irresponsible as desti
tute of conscience and remote from
the fear of god as slavery would re
quire the moral deterioration of
which i have complained here at the
north has been visibly due in no
small degree to the assimilating power
of southern influence slavery as
such has no principle it loosens all
the evil passions of human nature its
law human will the style of south
ern politics has accordingly been sig
nalised by irresponsibility from the
first and the south has been steadily
travelling northward bringing its li
cense with it expelling the ancient
time when merit reigned among us
and making us familiar with the law
less spirit of political adventure and
rapacity their evil communications
have corrnpted our good manners till
now the separation of politics from the
fear of god and the constraints of
moral obligation is become national in

that same justice you administerno
rigorous remorseless sanguinary code
but justice in mercy
where as here the crime consists
in the intent of the heart and you can
believe that intent not treasonable or
even doubtful then by the solemn ob

should yield to mercy great sensa

fellle cohpexsatiox
we cut the following from an article
on this subject in the woonsocket pa
triot it is from a statement made by
a gentleman connected with the press in
xew york in reference to prices paid
at the best establishment in that city
it is further staled that there are thirty
thousand females in that city toiling
on night and day for this scanty
living
common cotton shirts and flannel
undershirts six tem t each a good
seamstress can wn up uo of then
krt per def jbl even a swift hand
by working from sunrise to midoight
cannot make more than fibrebeing 
cents per week for the common hand
and   for the swiftest of course
allowing nothing for holidays sickness
accidents being out of work c sec
good cotton thirls with linen bosoms
ntatly stitched are madfor twentyfire
cents apiece a good seamstress will
make one in a day thus earning 
per week by constant labor fine
linen shirts with plaited bosoms which
cannot be made by the very best hands
short of fifteen to eighteen hours
steady work are fifty cents each an
ordinary hand can make a garment of
hi kind in two days trowscrs over
mis drawers underships stc pay a
shilling apiece to the seamstress who
can make one and perhaps two a day
cloth pantaloons vests c pay is to
 cents very seldom the latter price
and a woman makes on an average
about one a day thus not to prolong
tese details it may he stated in a
word that the seamstress who is for
tunate enough to get steady work earns
from  cents to  a week resides
these it is necessary to state that the
dressmakers or at any rate the great
majority of them get absolutely noth
ing for their work the way it is man
aged is this the proprietors of the
large dressmaking establishments re
ceive a great number of apprentices
who remain six months for nothing
boarding themselves the meantime for
the privilege of learning the trade
they can already sew swiftly and well
or they are not accepted to them are
given out the dresses and thw are at
work sewingnot learning anything new
until the very day before their ap
prenticeship expires then a few
hours are spent in giving them some
general directions about cutting a
dress and they are dischargedthere
being no room for journeywomen
on wages in an establishment where all
work is done by apprentices for nothing
as fast as their education is com j
pleted they are replaced by other ap
prentices and so it goes the dashing
proprietress of the establishment grow
ing rich and aristocratic and the poor
girls turned out upon the world to die
of starvation and despair or sell them
selves to infamy
velocity of electricity lt is
net unfrequently a subject of wonder
that the velocity of electricity has been
so accurately measured when its speed
is so incredible and many persons ex
press entire disbelief in the correctness
of any such measurement it has nev
ertheless been accomplished and that
by a contrivance so ingenious and yet
so simple as to he within the under
standing of a child and at the same
time incapable of committing an error
a small mirror one inch long by half
an inch broad is made to revolve on a
pivot and attached to a spring and cog
work which gives it a swift revolution
it is of course perfectly easy to regu
late this velocity to any required num
ber ot revolutions per second coils
of wires of various lengths are provi
ded a coil is taken say for example j
twentyfive miles in length the twoi
ends of this are brought near each other
and fastened on a board on the hat
surface of which is left a break in each
end of the wire so at the passing
electricity shall make a spark as it
crosses each brake a leyden jar is
charged and a spark sent through the
coil to the eve this appears to cross
both breaks at the same instant altho
there are twentyfive miles of wire be
tween the experiment is made in aj
room which has an arched ceiling in a
precise semicircle carefully measured
and divided into sections if then
this board be so placed that the revolv
ing mirror may reflect the spark and
the room of course being darkened
the mirror be put in motion and the
charge sent along the coils of wire the
first break in the wire will be marked
by a reflection of the mirror on the
arch and the spark at the second break
will be a little further along on the
arch thus if the mirror be making
one hundred revolutions per second
and the reflections of the two sparks be
oneeightieth part of the circle distant
from one another it is the
mirror has made oneeightieth part of a
revolution while the electricity was
passing twentyfive miles and the
time occupied is of course oneeight
thousandth pact of a scond which
would give a velocity of  miles
per second
after repeating the experiment with
coils of wire of variqp lengths from
five to a hundred miles and finding the
distance between the reflection on the
arched wall to vary in precisely
the same ratio with the lengths of
wire and the final result to he unvary
ing it is evident that the problem has
been solved and the velocity of elec
tricity ascertained
musicevery woman who has an
aptitude for music or lor singing should
bless god for the gift and cultivate it
with diligence not that she may dazzle
strangers or win applause from a
crowd but that she may bring gladness
to her own fireside the influence of
music in strengthening the affections is
far from being perceived by many of its
admirers a sweet melody i binds all
hearts together as it were with a gold
en cord it makes the pulses beat iu
unison and the heart thrill with sympa
thy rut the music of the fireside must
be simple sod unpretending it does
not require brilliancy of execution but
tenderness of feehug a merry tune for
the younga more subdued strain for
the aged but none of the noisy clap
trap which is s t popular in public it
is a mistake to suppose that to enjoy
music requires great cultivation the
degree of enjoyment will of course
vary with our power of appreciation
but like all other great influences it is
able to attract even the ignorant and

resolutions viz
i resolved that if the sabbath was
made for man then it is to be used for the
benefit of man and if a man be better than
a sheep ami it is right on the sabbath to lift
a sheep out of a pit then it is right on that
day to devise means to deliver the slaves from
their dreadful bondage
 resolved that we believe with john
wesley that slavery is the sum of all vil
lames and with the general assembly of
the presbyterian ffhurch that it is opposed
to the lawsol god and the spirit and precepts
of the gospel and ea sequent i y that the
slaveholder must lx the m of nil villains i
a iraiuplor on the law of god and a despiser
of the spirit and precepts of the gospel
 resolved that a religion which ac
knowledges slaveowners as christians or as
fit to be voted for or united with in a gov
ernment any more than hands of robbers on
the land or hordes of pirates on the sea are
fit for such union is a false religion not fit to
be endured nor safe to be allowed in any
community
 resolved that under tbe constitution
ami union of these states slaveholders are
able to drive tbe cherokees and other indians
out of georgiato butcher and banish the
seinmolcs of floridato purchase at vast
expense to tin north the territories of florida
and louisiana for slave statesto snatch
texas from mexico and annex it to the fnion

mexico and drown her pcoplo in their own
blood ami seize on their lands also for slave
statesto imprison in the jails of washing
ton and elsewhere for life northern men
whose only crime was that they aided men
to escape from bondage worse than deathto
keep arge military forces at enormous ex
pense mainly if not entirely to protect them
selves fiom the aggressiohs of their slaves
ami last and worse than all to degrade and
disgrace our whole nation as the most invet
erate tyrant tin bloodiest deepest and most
deadly and dangerous foe to mankind to be
found among all the nations of the earth
 resolved that all these and other
outrages of a similar character have been
perpetrated by the american government and
sanctioned ami sanctified by american re 
ltgion ami n becomes the friends of freedom
to seek the immediate overthrow of both and
tbe establishment of a new order of tilings

ivillian fcmil obrien
the recent trial conviction and sentence ol
death passed upon this most unhappy man
for the crime of high treason in ireland ha
abided another of those opportunities al
ways eagerly embraced by the american
press and people to vaunt the moral superi
ority larger liberty greater humanity and
higher civilisation of the united states and
to denounce in the moot bitter and unsparing
manner what we are pleased to term the
savage barbarity of foul and bloody old
england such an opportunity as this can
not fail to be used very extensively it will
serve to keep up a vivid impression of our
own excellence as a people as well as to in
crease that always profitable material so use
ful to political demagogue hatred of eng
land this commodity would in all proba
bility become extinct in ume but for the oc
currence of such cases as those of mitchell
mcmanus and obrien it is doubtless de
sirable for a nauan iiho ours drunk on the
blood of three to forget our
own revolting atom in contemplating the
crimes of others misery loves company
and it may not always be proper to deny them
the poor consolation they derive from it but
we cannot think it just at this time to allow
that part of the american mind within our
reach to rest in the iniquitous repose which
results from the common assertion that eng
land with all her boasted benevolence and
philanthropy is more cruel than america
w hile the american mind is so alive to injus
ticeso shocked by barbarous cruelty and is
devoutly thanking the most high god that
christian america is not like unto that hoary
old transgressor across the water it seems
in a prepared and suitable state to con
sider properly certain important and instruct
ive facts connected with our national history
it may be far more pleasant but it can never
be more wise to forget our own sins by re
membering the sins of others it is hardly
necessary to say that we have no desire to
lessen in any mind a just and proper estimate
of the character and institutions of this coun
try or to allay the feeling of horror with
which this dreadful sentence has thrilled all
minds those sentiments are natural and
when rightly directed must always be attend
ed with happy results our pretertsions
however to fiecdom and humanity over
england t have about the same foundation a
the superiority claimed in the temple by the
selfrighteous pharisee over the publican
let us look at home and see if we are in a
condition to pull the mote out of our brothers
eye let us see if we are in a condition to
first cast a stone at her
shall vc scoff at europe king
while freedoms fire is dim with us
and round our countrys altar clings
tlie damning shade of slaverys curse
it is said that this last act of british injus
tice fills to the brim the cup of her abomina
tionsthat she has shocked the moral sense i
outraged the humanity and disgraced the f
civilization of the nineteenth century that a
verdict more unjust and a sentence more
cruel was never presented to the considera
tion of mankindthat its execution will
cause indignalion mingled with intense hor
ror to flash like lightning around our land
that this will be the case we have no doubt
the patriotism heroism and martyrdom ol
mitchell mcmanus and obrien will long
continue the burning theme of american ora
tors and authors the salt tear of american
sympathy must often start from its saddened
fountain as the names of these brave men
are mentioned deep loud and long will be
the curses pronounced against proud bloody
and tyrannical england in the names of
mitchell mcmanus and obrien american
mothers will teach their children to hate
bloodthirsty england probabilities and con
sequences of this character are too grave to
be passed over lightly or disposed of hastily
let us consider of these let us first ex
amine the cause of the sentence passed upon
mitchell and the dreadful fate to which
obrien and mcmanus are doomed and in
the light of our present position and past
history ascertain if we are the people to de
nounce england as a sinner above ourselves j
the crimes of these men are the highest
known to kuman law involving the sub
version of the whole framew ork of human
government and fitting the land with all the
awful horrors of civil war they could only
expect to gain their object by causing the
land to smoke with the w arm blood of slaugh
tered thousands it appeared to be the pur
pose of these men to beget in the minds ol
their fellowcountrymen the highest eont unpi
and most reckless disregard of human life
it is also true that these men weie sane in
telligent beings mitchell was an educated
man so was smith obrien the latter
was also a lawmaker they well understood
the nature of the solemn game which they
undertook to play and the amount of the
stake to be lost or won they have played
they have lost and must pay the forfeiture
they have sown the wind and are reaping
the whirlwind lhey have been pierced by
their own swords and consumed by a fire of
their own kiudhug
we may lament over their misfortune be
wail their sad lot and mourn over their terri
ble doom and it may be proper to do so
but can any american say that the treatment
of these roeu would have been better had they
attempted against the american government
what they attempted against the british
throne ibere is not the slightest reason to
suppose it would our government like that
of england is based oo the sword for its ex
istence aud is no more merciful or less cruel
than the brilish government governments
are governments the world over whether
lliey bo called monarchies aristocracies au
tocracies or democracies they are always
he same bloody and remorseless nwwtten
everywhere their authority is disputed by
force
it may be and doubtless is a great outrage
against humanity to hang smith obuen by
the neck until be is dead and then to sever
his head fnio his body and to divide his body
into four quarters and leave it to the disposal
of ibe queen but is uj vratse or more re
voking oo the part of inland than it was
for america to cause nathaniel turner the
kero of the southampton insurrection to
feet long and at the end of it to fiddle hia
body with a hand red bullets i la it worse for
england to transport mitchell for fourteen
years than it is fur os to impridli drayton
for twentythe former plotting a bloody
revolution and the latter merely by peacea
ble means removing aeventyeeven human
beings from a land of ahvery to a land of lib
erty is it worse fi england to hang
mcmanus alter a lair trial than it was for
america to burn the noble mclntosh in mis
souri without judge or jary and shall a
people who looked on tbat horrid apene with
composure and indifference now affect horror
and hatred of england because of her re
volting crimes william smith obrien at
tempted to achieve for his country political
freedom in the language of thomas jeffer
son nathaniel turner attempted to redress
wrongs worse than ages of that which ame
ricans rose in rebellion to oppose until the
prison doors at washington shall be opened
for the release of drayton and we atone for
torrey and have struck the chains from
millions in our land we may hold our peace
respecting the cruelty of england r d
free ts slave labor
what men wfl got yield to justice they
will concede to selfinterest the unprinci
pled tradesman would not cheat were he
satisfied that an honest and straightforward
course would better forward lis ends par
tisan demagogues are not necessarily liars if
they can better advance the cause of their
patty and their prespecls of preferment by
speaking the truth all men even when they
care nothing about rectitude for its own sake
will do right or endeavor to do right if by so
doing they can either remedy an existing or
prevenf a prospective injustice towards them
selves
surely the time is not far distant when the
free working men of the north who it is to
be hoped are not as a class either unprinci
pled or unscrupulous will bestir themselves
in behalf of their enslaved fellowcitizens
nothing but a want of discernment of their
own interests can have kept them up to the
present time supporting one or other of the
great proslavery political parties who manage
the affairs of this country if the working
man were aware that every time he goes to
the ballotbox and gives his vote in favoi of
a slaveholder or one who yields subserviency
to the slave power he helps to perpetuate and
deepen his own degradation he would long
ere this have severed himself from all conncc
tion with the wicked compact which binds
him to use ail his energies should they be
desired in assisting the slaveholder to sup
press any attempt that might be made by
his victims to regain their godgiven right to
liberty and selfposession slavery degrades
labor the freeman at the south will
scarcely perform any kind of manual labor
he feels himself above it slaves labor and
any one who labors put h nnelf on a level
with them a slave isa degraded and de
pendant being subject to the will of another
his independent existence is destroyed he
lives only as a sort of adjunct to the man who
claims him as his propertydeprived of the
powersf motioneven almost of volition
w ithout his consent it is not to be wondered
at that the freeman shrinks and turns awav
from anything that seems to place him on
a level with the slave it would rather be
matter of w onder did he not try by all means
his power to widen the distance and make
plain the distinction between himself and a
being so abject and miserable however
much in his ignorance and shortsightedness
he may rest satisfied that they are fit for
nothing else he sees with sufficient distinct
ness that he himself came into the world with
an independent existence able to think and
act and free to go and come at his own dis
cretion strange it i  that there should be
any especially workingmen who can deny
that all are not equally entitled with them
selves to the same inalienable birthright of
humanity
it is not only in the slave region that the
atrocious system degrades labor that effect
is also sufficiently obvious upon the free
states of the union it is always found in
spite of every obstruction and discouragement
that where any kind of labor can be done
cheapest and to best advantage there it will
be done unless indeed the wornout expe
dient of a tariff be resorted to for the pro
tection as it is said of hotne industry
which in as for as it has any effect other
than encouraging unproductive enterprise
benefits a few and is a robbery of the many
it is the pnee paid for labor that regulates the
price of the article where labor is cheap
est there of necessity the cost of production
must be lowest and the price paid for labor
there must speedily regulate and become the
standard everywhere else it is nothing but
the inefficiency of slave labor that preserves
the wages of the freeman from being reduced
to the sum that i ik southerner pays to
provide a miserable subsistence for his slave
were the slaves intelligent and were it pos
sible to keep intelligent men and women in
bondage nothing could prevent this result
the south instead of exporting would
speedily manufacture its own produce the
slave might be made to labor as well in
the machineshop or manufactory as on the
cotton or sugar plantations and the labor of
a freeman might be wrung out of him at the
rate of from sixteen to twenty cents per day
i the northern workingman prepared to
come down to this
notwithstanding the ignorance of the slave
his masters have discovered that hta labor
can be made productive in manufactories
the philadelphia daily republic publishes
some facts on this subject from which the
following are extracts these facts sliow
says that paper tbat f
manufactures are practicable safe and
w c ceful in the south slave labor can and
employed ia them and that labor ischeap
er than die labor of the free white man
cheaper than the pauper labor of great
britain
lxst the newspapers stated that
there were thirtytwo cotton factories in oper
ation and in process of construction in geor
gia in which  are invested
from  u  bales of cotton were
consumed last year and the amount of mano
produced was equal ia value to
w 
he most reliable source we learn
there are above  tobacco factories in
kicamond virginia employing from fiftv to
ihrct hundred hands eucn all colored and of
these about  per cent are slaves and 
per cent free colored persons the latter chiefly
women j
that
acdft florida worked by  colored girls
and that another still larger to the same
neighborhood waa about being erected
daring the past two yean as often at
least aa once a fortnight we hare met with
paiagrappe stating the manufacture f ma
chinery m the north to be used in the
sooth
yesterday we republished an item cat
from one of oar exchanges stating that a
company of stockholders residing m ken
fncky indiana arkansas louisiana and
mississippi bate organized themselves for the
purpose of manufacturing cotton at can nel
son about one hundred and twenty miles be
low louisville the capital stock of the
company is half million of which 
 will now be pnt to use and  spin
dles will be started
these are a few of the facts gathered by
accident indicating the rapidly spreading po
licy of manufacturing at the south and ex
hibiting its practicability there
it is true that slaves are inferior laborers
where without motive interest or any feeling
of duty they mnst be left to their discretion
and cannot be overseen aa in small farming
and other solitary occupations but wherever
they can be worked in gangs and superin
tended as in the cotton field the forge fur
nace and large cotton and woollen factories
compulsion can easily be made to supply the
place of zeal and interestat the loom hun
dreds can be watched by a single man as our
own factory children now are their work
can be inspected oth in quality and quantity
and the lash applied to secure thatr industiy
and bring out their skill
now what shall we say to the prospect
which this view of our subject opens before
us here is a competition preparing to dis
pute the market of the world with not only
the free laborer of the north but with the
paupers of europe
it is evident if it be true that the employ
ment of slave labor in manufactures is practi
cable and these facts seem to indicate that it
isthat a reduction of wages must be the re
sult the following extract from an eastern
paper seems to argue that such result is al
ready becoming apparent
reduction of wages at lowell
notice has been given at lowell that a reduc
tion of wages will soon take place it is to
commence on the th of november on one
corporation and probably at the same lime on
the others the reduction is considerable
 to  per cent the speed is to be re
duced artd the girls are to be made to tend
more looms after they get broke in to this
work the speed will no doubt be put at the
old rate
this is one branch of labor others will
soon be tried if this is found successful
leaving out of the question for the present
every dictate of justice and humanity saying
nothing of the feai fully depraving effect of
slavery not only upon its immediate victims
but upon all who come within reach of the
moral miasma that it generates forgetting
the national dishonor and disgrace at
tach to the entire american people in conse
quence of their connection with the atrocious
slave system passing all these byeach of
them a sufficient and allconclusive reason why
justice should be done and the bondman re i
leasedis there not in the prospect here pre
sented an argument that will serve to open
the eyes of the workingman and of all other
men to the fact that the interests of the free
and of the slave laborer are identical de
grade labor and you lower its remuneration
in any portion of a country tedime the la
borer to the condition of a slave and hisniree
fellowcitizens who are laborers must de
scend and descend till they also are slaves in
all but the name this is the way in which
the affairs of the world are directed by its un
erring governor this is the way in which
justice avenges all violations of its im
mutable laws the innocent it is true are
frequently the greatest and even the first suf
ferers at the hand of avenging justice but
it is in only consequence of their connection
wuh and sufferance of those who commit
the crime
it is not the color of the skin that marks
the slave in the eye of the slaveocracy
they do not care whether the slave is
white or black or what may be his com
plexion if they were to have their choice
they would to use the sublime language of a
kentucky slaveholder prefer the white for
white negroes have this advantage over
black negroes they can be converted iuto

there is an article on our outside headed
the laboring men to which the attention
of all of that class is specially directed the

choose preach about the overbearing and in

rope ami they are welcome bat they might
search europe over and fail to find a aris
tocracy onehalf as regardless of the rights of
the laboring man as these american land pi
rates the titled cossack would be ashamed
to use such language ss that which is used by
those republican f f leading whigs and
lights of the democratic party it is
doubtful even or rather it is not doubtful
whether the barbarian tartar chief who lives
by bis sword has not a better appreciation of
what is meant by the rights of man
democrats indeed call a shark a codfish
and eat it and it will be but a slight mis
nomer compared with that of calling those
perkinss and mcduffies democrats let
the laboring man prove even to the saitsfac
faction of beojamin w leigh of virginia
that those who depend upon their daily la
bor for subsistence can and do understand
political affairs and that having learned the
disgrace and the atrocity of the slave system
and the reckless disregard of the rights of la

that hundreds of deserter b from the american

like the banditti of other periods and have
spread themselves all over the country east of
sierra madre a large party of these rob

been seen in the vicinity of melamotas and
it was reported that they intended to enter
the city aftei nightfall and plunder it
guards were placed round the city and the
inhabitants were kept under arms several suc
cessive nights to prevent the robbers from
entering the city these banditti have strong
holds in the wild fastnesses of sierra madre
and in the thickets along the rio grande

government will ever he able to subdue them
unless allied by our government it was

to hear for themselves
through a speech of some three hours in

therefore far below that high stand taken by

the supply of pure water conducted to
the city from its secluded source is not sim j

places but it is conveyed through subterra j
nean passages to the dwelling of every citi
zen and if they dcsiie it to every chamber j
and closet it is not left to be boine by man
ual labor from deep vaults and stagnant cisi
terns but it ascends in obedience to a mys j
terious law of nature to such part of every
mansion as its possessor may direct
to obtain the power of distribution at all
times throughout the elevated parts of the
city it was necessary to erect large reservoirs
at an elevation above tlie sea nearly equal to
that of the original source one of these
situated on tlie nearest neighboring height be
yond the limits of the city is capable of con
taining w ater sufficient for the uses of the city
tor a eriod of two weeks should the supply
be interrupted by any accident for that period
into this reservoir the aqueduct is capable of
discharging more than  gallons ot
water per day flowing by a gentle eimem
traversing the  miles of iu course in

than these can be named in the union some
of our cotemporaries intimate that mr palfrey
lost favor with the cottonocracy ol massachu
setts on account of ins having manumitted cer
tain slaves that fell to him but we cannot
quite believe that but undoubtedly his earn
est and consistent opposition to slavery lies at
the bottom of the opposition to him the
same remark applies to the case of mr gid
dings if the taylor men at the north w ere
really anxious out of certain localities to es
tablish an antislavery reputation there is no
man who ever stood m their ranks who is en
titled to more honor than mr giddings but
he could not lie made to believe that the own
er and worker of  slaves was a fit repre
sentative of free principle hence a rival can
didate now that he is elected however we
observe that lie is reckoned by the taylor pa

lor the following is an extract of a letter
of exgovernor hammond of south carolina
in reply to an invitation to attend a public
meeting after declinin the invitation from
considerations purely private he says
i trust you will see in what i have said
sufficient reasons to justify me in declining
most respectfully your unexpected but sin
cerely appreciated invitation without for a
moment supposing that i wish to shrink from
any responsibility i might incur by accepting
it i have already gone too far  well know
to lose anything by going farther in fact i
have been anxious not to share in the respon
sibility of those southern men who are op
posing gen taylor and have never failed
when a proper opportunity offered distinctly
and decidedly to avow myself in favor of his
election how any slaveholder can hesitate
between him and cass is to tne not only a
matter of special wonder but i think the worst
omen for the south that  have seen in my
time
permit me to offer you my most ardent
wishes for ihe success of your efforts to carry
the vote of our state for this great and good
man and to assure you of the high respect
with which i have the honor to be very sin
cerely your obedient servant

gen cass and the wilmot proviso
jn his nicholson letter gen cass rays
i am opposed to the exercise of any ju
risdiction by congress over this matter and i
am in favor of leaving the people of any ter
ritory w hich may be hereafter acquired the
right to regulate it for themselves under
the general principles of the constitution
because
 i do not see in the constitution any
grant of the requisite power to congress
and i am not disposed to extend a doubtful
precedent beyond its necessitythe establish

at all events we are happy to under

firmly stands upon the ground which he has
taken being applied to formally by a man
or two of rhe wiluaot stamp he declared un
hesitatingly that he adhered to hn nicholson
letter and to the baltimore platform and
that if elected president he should veto the
wilmot proviso
and again it says
general casss clear and palpable mean
ing and we have felt astonished that any other

paper publishes the followh w extract of s
letter from duiutistt dated tui september
on sunday hst between the hours of 
sod  in the afternoon a must strange phen
omenon if it may be o called was observed
here namely the sodden receding of the wa
ter in this harbor to such a frightful extent
that some of the boats grounded at their moor
mgs oo the collars and by a return or flow of
the watei ui a few minutes to a considerable
extent coveting the bedding or floor of the
fishing stages m the place
another extract th september from the
same place says
a most singular occurrence took place
here yesterday sunday th the wind
in the rooming was from uie southward a
light breeze with very heavy rain about
twelve oclock it veerwl suddenly round to
northwest and blew hard one boat had
come in the evening before from the bay
with a load of timber and was at her usual
place all at once the tide ran out of the har
oors so that a person may walk out to the
stage beads
ooe boat lay aground on the collar at
her moorings in about ten minutes more it
ran in again and rose so high that it ran up
walkhaxns brook into the pond and con
tinued rising and fallingaltemately every ten
miuutes or so nearly all the afternoon some
of the old people say it was something as it
was the year lisbon was destroyed i hear
a similar occurrence took place at catalina
and some damage sustained
we understand says the halifax rxorjer
that an equally sudden and unaccountable rise
of the tide was observed to take place in this
harbor on the same day but no damage was
sustained in consequence of it
in  there was opened in coclunchina
a canal  miles long  feet wide and 
feet deep it was begun and finished in six
weeks although carried through large forests
and over extensive marshes mx men

the dead sea expedition
the september number of the south
ern literary messenger contains an
article of profound inter st on this
subject from the pen of lieut m f
maury
lieut maury gives a history of thb
expedition brief but lucid and which
will increase the anxiety of the public
to see the report of lieut lynch whe
has made a successful survey and who
we are glad to learn is expected to re
turn soon to this country
we learn from lieut maurys arti
cle that this expedition was planned by
lieut lynch and authorized by secre
tary mason in the spring of 
lieut lynch first addressed the secre
tary on the subject recommending a
circumnai igation and exploration of the
dead sea and its entire coast statins
that the expense would be trifling a
our ships frequently touched at acre
in syria forty miles from lake tibe
rias or sea of gallilee from which the
river jordan runs and debouches into
the firstnamed sea that the frame ol
a boat with crew and provisions could
he transported from acre to tiberias
and there put together again only
one traveller mr cortigan had ever
circumnavigated the dead sea and he
died at the termination of his voyage
without leaving any journal or notes
behind it was contended also that
independent of the eager curiosity ol
all chi itcndoin in regard to this mys
terious lake this expedition is of value
to the interests of navigation
tiie secretary of the navy received
favorably the proposition of lt lynch
and an opportunity soon occurred by
which it could be conveniently carried
into eitect it was necessary to send a
storeship to the mediterranean squad
ron and as after her arrival she would
have no employment for months the
secretary determined to send lieu
tenant lynch and his party in her so
that after meeting the wants of the
squadron she could proceed up the
levant and land lieut lynch and his
companions
this was done the storeship
supply was provided with two me
tallic boats one ol copper the other ol
iron the former named fanny ma
son and the latter fanny skinner
on their arrival at their destination
their t roubles began and in their march
to lake tiberias their boats had to be
transported over the most formidable
mountain gorges and heights and to he
lowered dow r n precipices with ropes
but these difficulties were surmounted
with true sailor skill and perseverance
and on the bth of april the two  fan
nies each with the american ensign
flying were afloat upon the beautiful
blue waters of the sea of gallilee
emblematic of its master it alone of
all things around them remained the
same just as the apostles saw it
when our saviour said to it peace be
still this little band of rovers now be
held it
the navigation of the jordan was
found to be most diificult and danger
ous from its frequent and fearful rapids
lt lynch solves the secret of the depres
sion between lake tiberias and dead
sea by tlu tortuous course of the jor
dan which in a distanceof it miles
winds through a course of ij miles
within this distance lieut lynch and
his party plunged down no less than 
threatening rapids besides many oth
ers of less descent the difference of
level between the two seas is over a
thousand feet
the water of the jordan was sweet
to within a few hundred yards of its
mouth the waters of the sea were
without smell but hitter salt and nau
seous upon entering it the boats
were encountered by a gale and it
seemed as if the bows so dense was
the water w t ere encountering the
sledgehammers of the titans instead
of the opposing waves of an angry
sea
the party proceeded daily with their
explorations making topographical
sketches as they went until they reach
ed the southern extremity of the sea
where the most wonderful sight that
they had yet seen awaited them
in passing the mountain of uzzont
sodom we unexpectedly and much
to our astonishment says lt lynch
saw a large rounded turretshaped
column facing towards the southeast
which proved to be of solid rocksalt
capped with carbonnate of lime one
mass of ciystalization mr dale took
a sketch of it and dr anderson and
i landed with much difficulty and pro
cured specimens from it
the party circumnavigated the lake
returned to their place of departure
and brought hack their boats in as com
plete order as they received them at
new crk they are all in fine health
this is a specimen of the skill system
and discipline of the american navy
no nation in the world has done such a
service the time is coining when it
ill gle proof of that fact palpable to
the most dull understanding
 hanks to the good management of
lieut lynch the whole eot of this
scientific exploration to the dead sea
except ot course the cost of the equip
ago and the maintenance of the crew
ot the ship was but seven hundred
dollars
from the letters of lieut lynch
quoted by lieut murray we transcribe
he lollowing tacts elicited by the ex
ploration
 o bottom of the northern half of
tiiis sea is almost an entire plain its
tneridianal lines at a short distance
hoin the shore scarce vary iu depth
 ho deepest soundings thus far is iris
fathoms i isi feet near the shore
hi bottom is generally an incrustation
ot salt but the intermediate oo is soft
mud with many rectangular crystals
mostly cubes of pure salt at one
time stella agers lead brought up noth
ing but crystals
i he southern hall of the sea is as
shallow as the northern one is deep 
and for nbout onefourth of its entire
length the depth does not exceed three
fathoms  feet its southern bed
lins presented no crystals but the shore
is lined with incrustations of alt and
when we landd at uzzom in the space
of an hour our lootprints wert coated
with crystalizatton
i
the opposite shores f the penin
sula and the west coast present evident
marks of disruption
there are unquestionably birds and
insects upon the shores and ducks are
sometimes upon the sea for we have
scon thembut cannot detect any liv
ing thin within it although the streams
flow ing into it contain salt fish i feel
sure that the results of this survey will
fully sustain the scriptural account of
the cities of the plain
he thus speaks of jordan the
jordan although rapid and impetuous
is graceful in its windings and fringed
with luxuriance while its waters are
sweet clear cool and refreshing
after the survey of the sea the party
proceeded to determine the height of
the mountains on its shores and to run
a level thence ria jerusalem to the
medeitcrranean they found the sum
mit of the west bank of the dead sea
more than  feet above its surface
and very nearly on a level with the me
i diterranean
it is a curious fact says lieut
maury that the distance from the top
to the bottom of the dead sea should
j measure the height of its banks the
elevation of the mediterranean and the
difference of level between the bottom
of the two seas and that the depth of
the dead should be also an exact
multiple of the height of jerusalem
i above it
another not less singular fact in the
opinion of lieut lynch is that the
bottom of the dead sea forms two sub
i merged plains ah elevated and a de
pressed one the first its southern
part of slimy mud by a shal
low bay the last its northern and
largest portion of mud and incrusta
tions and rectangular crystals of salt
at a great depth with a narrow ravine
running through it corresponding with
the bed of the river jordan at one ex
tremity and the wad el jeib or
wady within a wady at the other
the slimy ooze saystt maury
upon that plain at the bottom of the
dead sea will not fail to remind the
sacred historian of the slime pits in
the vale where we joined in battle four
kings with five
vve have given this condensed view
of lieut maurys instructive article
with its extracts from lieut lynchs
letters believing that the interest of the
subject will excuse us in the eyes of
our readers for abstracting so much
space from politics lieut lynchs
report will be eagerly awaited by the
public

tin hidden treasure a
fa liiv tale
by mrs t p smith
a fairy tale p mother exclaimed
several little voices at once as mrs j
took her scat at the accostomed hour
to tell the children a story now
mother do tell us a fairy tale every
body says they arc the most entertain
ing and you know w hen cousin m sent
i mary howitts fairy tales she said
fairytales were quite fashionable
well said the mother iliad as
lief tell a fairy talc as any other but
first tell me what you think is the mean
ing of fairy one replied a beau
tiful being another did not know
hut the eldest hoy said he thought
fairies wereimaginary beings ta
king that for a definition his mother
then began the fairy tale called
the hidden treasure
one evening as a poor man and his
wife with five or six children were sit
ting at the door of their cottage one of
the children said o father how
poor we are ido wish a good lair
 would come and tell us where we might
find a great treasure i guess i would
not sit all day idle any more and have
so little to cat no sooner said than
donea beautiful woman stood before
them who said little boy i heard
your wish and if you will obey my di
rections you may find a great treas
ure then turning to the man she
said a treasure lies hid in your
grounds if you will seek for it you
trill find and may have it it is not three
feet from the surface either begin to
morrow in dig fur it she then went
away the children clapped their
hands for joy and the man and his wife
could hardly credit their ears that they
had really heard such a thing for they
were very poor indeed though the man
had a large tract of land it was uncul
tivated and yielded nothing barely suf
ficient pasturage for a poor cow which
afiorded them almost the only nourish
ment they had they were poor idle
discontented people and the children
halt starved so to be sure they were
glad enough to hi ar the fairys words
and could hardly wait till the next
morning to legin to dig they were
up with the sun those that could get
shovels dug with themthose that could
not worked with their hands in a
few days they had dug a considerable
of a place over and several times they
thought they had come upon the treas
ure but it was only stones they went
on so for sev ei al weeks but had not
found the treasure
one night as they sat at the door the
fairy again appeared wellsaid she
you haven t tonnd the treasure vet
no matter dig away youll find it some
time or other meantime mrg jodmun
you must not let the litlle ihlks starve
get some corn aud throw into phat
patet you have dug and have feme
corn growing ill come by and
bydig away youll find the leisure
so site wcut away
that a capital idea said the fath
er goodman ill get some corn
and plant there tomorrow so he did
and as they dug for the treure it
pleased them to see how soon the
corn ripened and what a crop they
had and the corn stalks made nice fxd
lor the cow toothe mother dug for
the treasure sometimes and having be
come accustomed to it they all accom
plished together quite a large piece in
a short lime and soon the good fairy
appeared again she said he knew
l lay had nm found the treasure vet but
she was afraid the young children had
become tired of digging and she
thought they had better go into the
woods and wild strawberries
aud put into ttsjp piece they had dug
it was just hmpilce to make straw
berries very large and it would please
tin in but dig on said she jou will cer
tainly jind the treasure yet  the next
day the children went and brought
borne briskets of strawberry roots and
planted a nice bed of them tley then
dug away again for the treasure
one day they dug op a terrible hard
piece of the land and had to pull up
some old treestumps ai stones btc
round a large cherry tree behind the
house and they were very tired that
night a traveller came that wayand had
to stop overnight they lived so tar from
any house aa they had no barn he
tied his horse to this cherry tree and
gave hirn his oats out of a bag he broufht
on his back the traveller went away
next morning but in a few day  they
found that the oats the horse had spilled
and scattered had sprung up in the
nicelydug ground and they had a
little field of oats this pleased mr
goodman very much and when the
good fairy next appeared he told her of
it oh yes she said it would be
a good plan to plant something in each
place as you dig it she said the next
time she came she would bring some
seeds for them so they had another
object for which to dig beside the find
ing of the treasure to see the things
growing
she was as good as her word and
brought the seeds and they had dug so
well they could plant a great many
melons and other nice things which they
had never before seen in their lives
and the soil was so good and had been
so nicely dug and turned over for the
treasure that the plants grew so rapid
ly and ripened so soon that the next
time she came she told them they had
i better stop digging a while just till they
could take care of the oats and straw
berries melons and other things
they had eaten as much of them as
they wanted all the season and sold
some to the nearest houses and now
mr goodman said they would go next
week to the nearest markettow n w ith
the rest so they went the market
people said the strawberries were the
largest they had ever seen and their
melons brought the highest price and
the mother surprised them all by show
ing a cheese she had made from the
milk of their cow which had yielded
twice as innch having better feed the
three youngest children had carried
each two baskets of strawberries the
baskets they made of willow twigs
while the elder ones and their father
were loaded w ith melons pears beans
corn c and when they had sold them
and come out of the town on their way
home a happier family were never
seen they had all a handful of money
they had earned themselves when
they got home they sat round a table
and putting all their money upon it sat
looking in wonder and joy they had
never seen so much in all their lives be
fore they wer so pleased they had
quite forgotten the treasure they had
dug so hard and so long fur till the fai
ry put her head in at the door
how beautiful your farm looks
said she and your cherry tree will
bear bushels of nice cherries next sea
son now you have dug away all those
stones and stumps from the roots see
how it is branching out and what have
you hpre looking on tkc tafek
moncyt silver dollars ah said
she did i not toll you that there was
a hidden treasure in your ground that
you would certainly find if you dug for
it this heap of money is the least
part of the treasure you have found by
digging
look how healthy you have all be
come how industrious and useful your
children have becomehow hopeful
and happy all are look at your
farm now sphere was nothing but
stumps and stones before you dug is
now a garden and fields yes you
have found more than one treasure
and now should you like to know my
name  ain called lndustry or the
poor mans fairy i always know
and tell where a treasure is to all
children even if they will listen to my
voice and words adieu adieu and
she kissed her hands and disappeared
leaving them still looking at the trea
sure they had found
the children thought this was such
a nice fairy tale and called so clamor
ously for another that mrs s told
them she would think of another for the
next evening and if the young folks
who read this like it she will write
the next down for them to read in the
