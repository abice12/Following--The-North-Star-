the fourteenth
national antislavery bazar
another yet the samethe four
teenth return of this holy festival of
freedomsent an impulse of hope and
joy through the hearts of the oppressed
of americathe slaves and the aboli

hopeful and patient the last more
resolute and devoted
god be thanked that the principles
the object and the measures of this com
bination of persons of such various char
acters and conditions being true right
and wise at the begirtriing have con
tinued unchanged for so many years
through every stress of circumstance
trial and temptation to change from
good to evil to fall away from right and
justice is the great sin of man against
humanitywhat a subject then lor
joyful congratulation that these are
constant as tin north ttar
of whose truo lixl ami resting quality
there is no fell nv in the firmament
a mountain of national pretension
has been beaten to dust and blown a
wav like chalf to find a few persons
with heart and head and principle
enough conjoiied to stand by the ever
lasting right together through every
assault of the slaveholding community
around them the calumny of the hos
tile the apathy of the neutral the
rage of the mobthe trait irons thrust
of the coward villany that fawns while
it stabs and clings to its disguises and
pretensions as its best defence the pre
tended disapprobation of the selfish
sivpocrite whose practice belies bis
principles while it tills his pursethe
tselfdisgracing avoidance of
the timid good that hand aloof
dl these pass unrespected by them
and still they re tint in identified with the
enslaved and in opposition to the great
slaveholding majority that vainly brings
its very engine of force ami h and flat
tery and abuse bribery and persecu
tion to bear upon their integrity they
find themselves the chosen representa
tives of the worthiest americans and
they feel that confidence like that re
post in them is the strongest possible
obligation to he to do and to sulier
all that fidelity in such a case com

notwithstanding the severe money
pressure and the detention of the ex
pected box of goods which the devoted
ness and exquisite taste of the bristol
friends have always made so valuable
the receipts of the bazaar were fotfk
thousand thrke hukufeel
dollars and from the amount ol
goods remaining and to arrive we are
justified in the conclusion that before
the cl se of the year the sales contem
plated in various parts of the country
will have enabled the committee of the
bazaar to fulfil their wish of ultimately
placing ten thousand dol
lars at the disposition of the ameri
can society
we are continually defeated in our
purpose of describing the glorious
ten days for the gratification of the
distant friends by the perpetually
thronging crowd of grateful acknowl
edgements for which our hearts de
mand expression
but we will begin however frequent
ly wo must in this manner be inter
rupted how to make ianeuil hall
look beautiful for a festal occasion is a
problem before which even the city
government with all its power of man
ufacturing money and all its freedom
from scruples to use tiie united states
stripes and pennons as ornamental in
signia might well shrink away in des
pair how to clothe with beauty this
barren platform how to screen from
view these hare barracks of galleries
how to fill gracefully th awkwardly
empty area howto hide that enor

spoil that threatens freedom from
above the entrance llow to shut out
the sights of discolored walls and dirty
streets without obscuring the light from
the windows r eureka they
have found itthe hall shall become a
gothic cathedral this work is our
worshipthe most indeed
the only acceptable that americans can
offer to hod since w ithout it nothing
for lack of it all the sabbath solemni
ties of our land are sin as in israel
of old because of oppression so here
in the united states it is iniquity
even the solemn meeting we have i

temple for its exerciseone whose
ascending lines shall carry the soul up

not press it downward for elysium like

their supporting pillarsnot forgetting i
to feather every pillar correspondingly i

the roof that the arches beneath their
lowest boughs may delude the eye by a
counterfeit perspectivedelineate a
trefoil in every arelied screen by 
means of wreaths of evergreen and rep
resent the longitudinal bars more grace
fully than ever yet was done in stone
by erecting a slender tree to represent
each every spire of which shall show
like pencilling against the eastern light

where sunlight shall touch its feathery
green with gold every morning and
gaslight hood it every night and troops
of fairylike children laden w ith their

but as it is neither city or town nor

without feeling also how true the
thought of alcicus that
these constitute a rotate
the union of freemen which is to
supersede the american union of slave
holders began when the american
antislavery society was constituted of
souls like these long may they live
to shame the knavery that know s so
little of the power of high character
that it unwittingly exposes itself by
giving the name of bigotry and intoler
ance to their faithful rebuke of crime
and the weak baseness that flinches
away from the fearless side of the only
practical exponents of its own professed
principles
other eyes than those of their own
countrymen were there to look upon
them we rejoiced to welcome the
gifted and excellent dr nichol and his
highly esteemed countryman the late
editor of the london inquirer mr
hincks to both of whom we owe a
tribute of special gratitude as friends of
our friends and promoters of our cause
but the list of towns represented was
not confined to massachusetts from
the state and city of new york came
effectual aid the representatives of
the friends in western new york were
there with contributions while ohio
friends not personally present w r cre
represented by their beautiful donations
a new and beautiful feature in the
evenings arrangements was the occa
sional introduction of vocal and instru
mental music from members olw h

obliging exertions of mr withington
our thanks are due to mr chicker

factory an admirable piano forte for the
occasion
at the upper end of the hall hung a
subscription list of the new antislavery
paper yye seize this earliest oppor

in western new york to which the
friends of the cause in that w hole region
of country may gather in perfect con
fidence and trustmay he never toler
ate erirne lest he be called a bigot nor
fail to expose iniquity lest he be called
intolerant nor stand aloof from the
good and true lest the vicious and the
foolish call him a partisan nor unite
with evil to avoid the imputation from
the w eak and designing of being quar
relsome nor shrink from giving and
receiving help for fear of being esteem
ed wanting in individuality by those
who have no esteem for the cause nor
be injured by the gift that blindeth
the eyes nor be seduced by party or
sect to purchase popularity at the ex
pense of fidelity nor to increase the
subscription to his paper by diminishing
its antislavery power nordeein it pos
sible to be respected and sustained at
the same time by things so opposite in
iheir nature and moving springs as
liberty party anti liberty league and
that earliest and latest aud purest
antislavery which that party and league
scoff at as garrisonism let him
be as heretofore proof against every
form of temptation and a long and glo

mr garrisons health exhausted by

and his voice was consequently heard
i but for a moment introducing h c
wright to the assembly on the presen
tation of the great remonstrance of
j scottish women published in the lib
erator a few weeks since it was a
sublime sight to see this immense ar
ray of noble namesthe same that have
brightened scottish song and story
from age to agenow illustrating our
nineteenth century by their united tes
timony to liberty the feeblest magi
nation must kindle at the sight as
i in slow procession moves each shadowy file
of the spirits of this gathering forty
thousand to take possession of the
old high places of our liberty the
coldest heart must glow to hear this
sound of the women of scotland rising
in the majesty of their mercy to waken
the slumbering womanhood of america
to the long forgotten claims of freedom
and humanity
god bless the women of scotland
and make the women of america
worthy of their noble companionship in
i a cause so grand and awful they
have not sent us their voices alone
across the atlantic to its aid the ta
bles around arc covered with their valu
able gills from glasgow and edin
burgh and kirkuldy and last not least
in beautiful offerings fair perth
and a multitude of other places the
patons and the welshcs and the wig
hams and the youngs the mortons
and the rcaddics the sineals and their
friends have united to bless and beau
tify this occasion with a taste and mag
nificence incomprehensible to the souls
that have been dwarfed and hardened
by slavery if afe w months of its in
fluence could dry up the springs of
freedom in the hearts of cunningham
and chalmers the representatives to
america of the very church of freedom
what must be its withering effect on a
whole life let us trust hat these and
other precious influences l orn the lajul
of our fathers may at length counteract
the horrid spell that binds our own and
rejoice that every communication we
receive fr in thence is a pledge of the
continuance of the blessing of such
sympathy and aid
going southward with our list of con
tributors we most gratefully acknow
ledge the valued contributions of the
friends in carlisle the carrs the
nicholsons the peiles and others who
have helped us
the name of esther blight of roch
dale who forwards valuable donations
from that place shall be cherished
among slaves and abolitionists as that
of her brother john bright is by the
suffering classes of england
to mrs moore mrs cobden mrs
woolley and others whose energetic
sympathy has done so much in man
chester for the bazaar we can present
but the poor tribute of thanks but it
is in behalf of a land degraded by sla
very that those labors may yet save
in behalf of outraged humanity in bond
agethat we thank them and the
blessing of those that are ready to
perish accompanies our acknowledg
ments
the browns and the trends of
bridgewater with their friends whose
exquisite taste added so much attraction
to the occasion w ill rejoice to hear of
the safe arrival and successful sale of
their donations
an interesting trait of unconquerable
peresverance cornea to mind with the
mention of the box from leeds for
warded by mr lupton a similar one
was sent last year which never reached
its destination though every search
was made for it in the warehouses and
on the books of the steam transjorta
tion company on both sides of the
atlantic undiscouraged by this fail
ure the second box was forwarded by
the same persons and we rejoice to
sav greatlv to the furtherance of the
cause the rare and attractive con
signment of elizabeth pease of dar
lington idso enclosed was admired by
thousands and added much to the
interest of the season
we entreat our britol friends the
carpenter the estlins the james and
numberless ethers whom they repre
sent and to w hom they w ill know how
to make our grateful acknowledgments
acceptable not to regret too deeply the
accident which compelled the return of
their noble donation to cork and there
by prevented its seasonable arrival
for we contemplate a sale as early in
the spring a the state of the money
market wii permit from which we hope
even more favorable results for the
cause than would have ensued from
the timely reception lor the bazaar of
this choice collection
the cause demands of us no common
expression of gratitude to those friends
in in land whose judicious philan
thropy has made one and the same
operation the means of serving the
starving irishman and the imbrued
american slave they have employed
and paid their peasantry in the manu

however respecting the cork table

a large sum for the times though l
no means large in proportion to it
beauty and attractiveness the friend
gathered round it and fifty of them uni
ted to raise that sum for the cause
leaving it to chance which should re
ceive it it fell to the lot of john t

devoted abolitionist and a member o

setts antislavery society from the
earliest days of the cause he it was

dence in its ardent advocate led him
promptly and efficiently to aid wm
lloyd garrison at the commencement
of the liberator those present on
the occasion of garrisons lecture to
the people of color in boston to the m he
first addressed himself w ill never forget
the deep emotion with which they gath
ered round him at its close hailing as
the israelites did the sight of moses
the appearance of one who chose to
suffer affliction with them rather than
to enjoy the rewards of their oppress
ors nor wonder at the liberal joy with
which theyiieiped him to lay the corner

them to build the new edifice of free
dom
this years antislavery bazaar was
marked by an entire new feature and
one that deserves special record and
cordial welcome
but a few weeks before the time ap
pointed for the opening of the bazaar
the boston female antislavery socie
ty held its annual meeting and in view
of the manifestations of friendliness to
our principles and our enterprise which
had been gratefully perceived on the
part of some of the ministers and con
gregations of the city the society re
solved to commend the approaching oci
casion to them as one affording an cx
cellent opportunity to aid the cause i
to this invitation members of the con
gregations of the rev james freeman
clarke and the rev theodore parker
responded so warmly that a table from
each of these congregations was the re
suit both mr parker and mr clarkei
cheering and encouraging the effort
when in after times from every rej
pentant section of the great american
church now so hostile shall come sim
ilar evidences of awakening to th
claims of freedom it shall be remem
bered of these that they did wnat they
could and told as a memorial of them
the liberty bell was thought to be
this year more than ever beneficial to
the cause notwithstanding the great
disappointment felt that the artist
should have been prevented by illness
and domestic calamity from seasonably
completing the engraving of francis
jackson still only a sufficient number
of copies are left to send to our friends
abroad the bulk of the edition having
been disposed of at the bazaar
the table of contents is ulutratcd
by the names of many who are widely
known and beloved both in the literary
and philanthropic world is it not a
shame to america and reason enough
for the existence ot the a a s soci
ety that we may not speak the name of
the distinguished southern gentleman
who is the author of the first article
the insurrection and its hero
lest we endanger his lifer the noble
poem of passion and of power by
elizabeth barrett browning will d

read tne interesting reminiscences of

if you would know w hat the soul and

prosecution of the antislavery enter

garrison and mrs folicu would you
see one of tbe best of them and para

ttie article entitled abolitionism in

notice because it is tbe production of

letters will show the depth ami consist
ency of the philosophy which experi

it is but just we translate from hu
letter that every man no niattei
what his nation should express hi
views ou slaveryfor it is an incarnated
blasphemy against human nature
feel that as a native of poland i havr
a peculiar motive to exercise this right
never would iny country have become
the prey of russia austria and prus
sia if instead oi opposing to these
three powers only a chivalrous nobility
she had marshalled a whole people
but we had in our lands millions of serfs
to whom the word independence was
utterly without significanceand we
succumbed
if a hope now remains to us it is
in the rational reconstitution of eu
rope the example offered by ameri
ca would have hastened the hour of
deliverance to her oppressed nations if
america were not sullied by that mon
strous anomaly which the enemies of
republican institutions point cut with
joy a liberty that is smothered tin
der slavery can never be contagious
speedily then may the day dawn when
abolitionism triumphant shall have de
stroyed the obstacle which prevents the
new world from influencing the old
the leading idea of theodore par

is exactly such a one as the elder abo

before they learned that it was for their

unavoidable evils of slavery in a mas

clergymen help to ring this years bell
we never hear from them that aboli

why not for two reasonsist
they know their brother ministers to the

these articles the one written by sam
uel may jr wiiieh shows the reasons
for much of the opposition the cause
meets idiot era by a backwoods
girl may be considered under the cir
cumstances as an extraordinary pro
duction the bentiful lines of mary
carpenter afford the best illustration
of the spirit in which this joint effort of
british and american abolitionists has
been made
we regret that the lines from the
distinguished traveller j s bucking
ham were received too late for inser
tion in the present number of the li
berty bell
the purpose of this little annual
volume commenced in ibji and now
published for the ninth time is the
promotion of the cause through the pro
mulgation of its principles in an attract
ive form and through the addition of
the receipts of the sale to our treasury
it furnishes us moreover with a suit
able mode of expressing our sense of
services rendered to the cause and of 
conveying our sense of fraternity to
those whose course commands that 
feeling on our part hence it is that 
io mere indifferent literati however in
ilcctually gifted nor any known ene l
nios of the cause or of its advocates 
lave ever been permitted to occupy i
these pages hostility however can
tiously manifested or unwittingly be 
trayed and treachery however loudly 
denied are shut out from this joint 
work of the friends of freedom while
every incidental expression of differ 
ence in opinions and measures in the 
treatment of the subject the natural
result of the native difference in minds
as wines always tcte of the soil which
produces the grape is gladly hailed 
as giving zest and variety and cherish

respect for the rights of opinion

audited and published reports for tho
last sixteen years still there may be
those who desire at this moment a more
specific answer to the question how
do you menu to expend the money tl at
you ask us to help raise wo reply
it shall be spent wholly only ard
directly in awakening informing and
influencing the individuals whose ag
gregate makes up the public mind on
this primarily important question it
shall not be put into the hands of the
political organizations to promote hc
the election of any candidate but in
awakening the love of freedom and the
hatred of slavery in all not in aiding
fugitives to escape bat to save them
that painful and hazardous experiment
by abolishing the system which enslaves
them not in sending them to africa
but in enabling them to become the free
and happy elements of national strength
and prosperity at home
this money will in short be spent
neither in compensation colonization
nor political partizanship but solely hi
propagandism and the result will be
right action in every ramification of
society
we therefore confidently appeal to
all in every land to take part in this
holy cause frail and suffering and
shortlived are all men but a cause

welcome them to suffering but tho
consolation of such a cause is propor

henry clay
this great american statesman and oratr
r l as ttftiin spoken the venerable sage of asl
 land has added another blot to his already to
sullied fame he has again stooped to th
debasing meanness of giving tongue to amc
i rican malignity against the free colored pec
pie he has again exerted his magnificen
oratorical powers again the feeble and help
less and given the signal to their relcntles
persecutors for reviving their senseless preju
dee and opening against us their inferna
batteries now in the name of all that i
just and honorable why is this  why an
we thus pursued  what cause have w
given him against us what can be hi
motive hy is that once firm and clea
voice but now tremulous shaken and sub
dued by the weight of age still uplifte
against us why is that commanding fone
which must soon slumber with its mothe
dust once more thrilled animated and elc
quent in misrepresenting and slandering th
colored people again we ask what evi
have we done him in what have we in
jiired him that he thus while even leaning
over the grave and on the verge of appearin
before the great judge of all the earth seize
a brief moment between life and death ii
which to glower upon us once more
savage and malignant frown oh that w
could remedy the wrong if wrong we hav
donehim and by repenting receive forgive
nessand allow our aged foe to die in peace
hut alas we fear that this is impossible
the consummation so devotedly to be wishe
is beyond our reach and as the leopar
cannot change his sjiots nor the ethiopia
his skin mr clay must leave the world will
liis heart yet bitter with malice and givinj
grim and ghastly signs lo posterity to eon
iauo the bitter and revengeful spirit which
through the american colonization society
he has maintained and cherished toward u
lor more than thirty years denmark
murdered king fresh from sulphurous purga
torial fires was not more importunate am
eloquent in stirring up within the youthfu
bosom of hamlet the murderous feelings o
hate and revenge than is mr clay in rousing
those same feelings in the american hear
against us and now if a vigorous crusade lx
not again revived against us through state
press and pulpit it will only be leeausi
antislavery may opjioso an antidote common
surate with the leperous poison of this speech
w e have just finished perusing this speech
and confess to some excitement we see ii
it a revival of that second enemy of the col
urod people the colonization society which
next to slavery is the deadliest foe to tin
colored man unsettling his plans and im
proveinents by teaching him to feel that thi
is not lis home disheartening and subduing
his enterprise by causing him to feci that al
eflort at selfelevation is in vain that neithci
knowledge temperance patience faith no
virtue can avail him anything m this land
oi examining tins speech we scarce
know what part of it most to condemn it ii
diabolical from beginning to end abounding
in wilfully blind and false assumptions re
specting our character and condition as a
people interwoven with a mock sympathy
and worse than sham philanthropy linked
with plausible statements sophistical reason
ing and absurd conclusions more than splin
td with open blasphemy and the whole so
glistened with the sanctimonious cant ol
pty as to leave it without a rival in the
catalogue of refined and complicated oratorical
wickedness we might safely leave it to
pi ai tor iucif but that silence might be
misinterpreted and set down to a sense ol
inability to reply we shall tlierefore say
a li w words on this great speech and part
with mr clay as he parted with the coloni
zation meeting in washington never exjiect
mg to meet him again
the speech as a whole leaves a much
better impression of mr clays ability as an
orator than di  his great speech at laxing
ton it has none of that cumbrous heaviness
almost the invariable result of too much pre
p liaison w in h weighed down ins great
efliirt but fall the lively and buoyant char
artef of this speech is somewhat owing to hu
cirrwmstanccs which surrounded him hi
i wan one more in die city of washingtoo
i the eipito of the nationthe grand tfaeatn
and sjone of his greatest efforts be was sur
rounded by old friends and admirers an
found hans lf hailed with an enthusiasm wd
f nigh bordering on fancy this stirred hii
aged blood and gave to his wrinkled brow i
vigoau and youthful aspect
y  we regard this speech as the most success
ful we ever heard or read on the subjret o
colonization its chief powr to injure con
sists in its defensive sad conciliatory spirit
e it is amrther exampl of the cat roiled in flou
die wolf in a sheepskin it is amiable
t almost to a fault he give offence to an
b ione l no not for the world to eten th
h
s abolitionists he would nut be denunciatory
i far from it his language is the language o
appeal of admonition delivered w ith all tfs
afttlion of an aged parent to his lieloved bu
u emng children then to the poor despised
injured and maltreated blacks he would no
 j lie harsh but would appear to respect tbei
t feelings and protect their nghts and assutnei
 much more the air of a friend toward them
r than that of an enemy to be sure with al
f his regard for us be would gladlv send ui
when he should never see us more but then
it is for our good that he makes this immenst
t sacrifice dont hurt the dear little kittens
i m y child but take them down to the river
and drown them they will be much bette
t off than now for this is a hard world
i we did not intend to do anything mon
nor le than the establishment of a coloni
upon the coast of africa to which the frei
jieoplc of color of ihcir own voluntary con
sent might go no restraint no coercion
no compulsory process was contemplated t
je employed with respect to them tht
hole was to be submitted to their free an
unconstrained volition
r indeed what a merciful man is mr
by he would not drive the free coloret
ppl b of this country from their hearths am
homes v hat noblo and unexpected mag
j nanimitv is this lie would not force us bu
p leave us to unconstrained volition
 mr la y says he tell them the kind o
country to which tee wish them to go yes
j  us you wish us to go you not onh
j ls h us to go but you tell us you wish us t
go what right have you or anybody else
to tell us you wish us to go it is ai
j insult an insolent and tyrannical assumptioi
on t lb p rt f mr clay or any one else t
j tell us or any part of the colored people o
this country that he wishes us to go anv
 j here w e arc at home here and our stay
here is evidence that we wish to stai
j here and to tell us that he wishes us to go
i is an insult which if offered to mr clay
instead of the despised blacks would subjee
i i the perpetrator of the insult to the indignatior
of the community our right to stay here is
as good as that of mr clay or anv raan
stealer in the land and god helping us wt
will maintain this right before all the world
we wish to assure mr clay and the coloni
zation society wc are not now situated ex
j actl here that society found us twentyfive
years ago we have kept pace with the age
and are now in a position at least in the fret
states where we have our presses and peri
i dicals published and read as far as the eng
lish language is spoken and can tell oui
wishes without his or the assistance of the
colonization society we beseecli this gen
i tletnan to give himself no uneasiness on oui
j account w hen we wish to go to liberia
or elsewhere we can go without his telling
us that he wishes us to go we can di
pense w ith all such arrogant impudence bui
he whole was to be submitted to our un
constrained volition gracious very sup
pose we should go upon mr clays farm and
wish him off from it we presume he would
scarcely answer us with words we think
he is of a mettle which would lead him tc
adopt some very striking method for making
us acquainted with his wishes in return
submitting to his unconstrained volition
would make us little less offensive to him
the great central falsehood of mr clays
speech is the same that has been set forth in
colonization journals and proclaimed by its
lecturers for the last twenty years the
assumption that white and colored people
cannot live together on lerms of equality on
this hangs not only mr cjavs speech but
the whole structure of colonization if we
j demonstrate the absurdity of this bold assump
tion we have shattered the main pillar ol
colonization this grand central idea is in
culcated throughout this most mischievous
speech we will give his views the advan
taye of his language that the reader may see
tho imposture in its first dress
it is in vain to attempt to eradicate the
feelings which keep asunder the two colors
it is in vain for the office cf philosophy of
humanity of benevolence or of any other
office to attempt to establish what is an im
praclihilitythe bringing together of two ra
ces which god himself by the difference of
color and other constitutional circumstan
ces has declared ought to be perhajtt sep
arate

but besides all these considerations
recommending the separation between the
two incompatible and incongruous races
which never can become one harmonious and
homogeneous people there are others

 w hat state of this i t rionif there be
one i have no recollection of itit is possible
it may lie the case in massachusetts in w hat
state cf this union does the black man how
j ever free he may be or from w hatever line of
ancestors he may be descended enjoy political
rights l no where social rights are out of
ihe question in no state of the union in no
city town or handet is the black man regard
ll as standing upon an equal social condition
with the w hite portion of the human race in
this respect the free slates are equally
chargeable with the rigor of the laws as the
slates in which slavery is tolerated your
laws have ineresed in rigor against the black
population of the country

who can drubt that in a similar sense
africa is tlie real home of the black man al
though there has boon an accidental birtha
casual birth of africans upon this continent
there were they placed there were they
found until torn from their land by the hand
of lawless violence here they have been
broughthere they cannot remain ia peace
and contentment  speak of the tree portion
of the race
the foregoing will give oar readers a fair
idea of the main feature of mr clajra speech
and of culo uxation in general
now gran ting mr clays premises to h j
correct which we do not to what do they
pad  why to this that whenever there is
a onununity m which iherc is not perfect so
rial equably among all the membstaof it lb
humbler dam ought either t  be pnifireri a
enslaved w e nr enslaved because mr
clay has no objection to black slaves remaiiurq
mm this land we presume be would fa
their removal a great evil especially thaw
i oo his own plantation lie is pwtkularb
i guarded on this point his portraitures o
misery and wretchedness are all drawn of fret
i colorednot of the slave they of eottrsi
are contented and happv fat and sleek
mr clay might go to boston or to lowell
t and say to the poor factory girls it is u
vain to attempt to end reate the feeling whirl
i keeps the rick and poor asunder it is if
r tain for the office of humanity benevolence
or of any other office to establish what is at
r otter impracticabilitythe bringing togethe
of the rith and the poor now all this ii
sure and certain and seeing that you neve
f have and never can enjoy the socirty of thus
whom god in his allwise providence hai
t blessed with riches i as your friend submi
that it would be far better for you to be eolo
t nixed in some part of the world where yot
i can hve on terms of perfect equality and free
i dom besides your presence here while i
is a great evil to you is also quite an an
i noyance to us your ignorance and degrada
tion are very offensive lo the rich and th
learned of the land who can never recogtiixt
you as equals we therefore wish you tc
go in expressing this our w ish no fore
is contemplated we submit it to your unre
r strained volition
now we wish to inform mr clay thai
the condition of the free colored people has
been steadily improving but the other day
a gentleman of color was regularly admitted
to the bar iu the city of new york and it it
but a few months since while seated bcsid
the governor of massachusetts he iuformcc
i us that he had just conferred the office o
justice of the peace on a colored young mat
in the city of boston we shall have occa

a broader and nobler battle field is ours
the glorious contest to which we are sum

of opinions and prejudices of long duration
 and they confront us armed in the triple stee
of press pulpit and proscription his le

they must be met and vanquished or th

i the slave power is augmenting and the ty

j we say this is no time for delay where
or to whom is the slave to look for relief ii
not to those who know his wrongs and com
prehend his rights but to the hated and de

in the land who do not hold the truth of god
in unrighteousness they cannct look to the
churches of our land with any hope of suc
cess there is ro help in them for the slaves
they have thus far shown themselves the
servants of slavery they have seen the
slave in chains for more than two hundred
i years they have heard with the most heart
less indifference his unceasing pica for liber
ty they have looked out upon the field of
slavery unmoved they have seen men and
women sold like beasts in the marketpa
rents sold from children and husbands from
wivesand have lisped no rebuke in the ear
of the tyrant or spoken a word of sympathy
in the ear of his slaverysmitten victim to
the american churches the slave sonnet look
with any hope of success these bodies are
notexpected to operate but to be operated
upon instead of remembering those in bonds
as being bound with them they seem to re
member the slaveholder as binding with him
they are contented to talk of the souls caring
little about the bodies of men and thereby
show that they care nothing for either
bought up by slavery sold urtosin they send
their sanctimonious minister forth to uphold
crime and defend slavery in the awful name

i was not aware when i noticed the de
mr george b vasiion that he
had  ecn refused e en on examination by the
committee admittance to the bar but sir
this was even so although i am credibly in
formed that his able and distinguished pre
ceptor hon walter forward made every
effort in his behalf but all of no avail the
infernal spirit of proscription and intolerance
fostered among a certain class found full
vent being proven to have been nestled at the
pittslvtgh bar and like the lava bursting
from the crater of hell they headed it forth
i in one damning eruption sending its fire and
smoke hissing and foaming throughout the
neighborhood until a vast portion of w estern
pennsylvania has become tarnished by reason
thereof k cs sir this is true the judge
walter h lowrie esq of the district
court before whom application was made to
sue out a rule of court to show cause why
mr n ashon was not examined assigned as
his reason that chief justice gibson of
pennsylvania had decided against colored
people being citizens therefore he would
never consent thereto this truly was the
decision of judge gibson an insult upon our
manhood which all true men hold in utter
contempt
mr vashon on his tour stopped in the
city of new york and as i learn by a recent
letter was on the eve of an examination be

this probably has been admitted to practice
what a contrast between the smoky iron

dear friends douglass delany
the specimen number of the north star is
just what it should bea beacon light of liber
ty to illuminate the pathway of the bleeding
hunted fugitive of the south and to arouse
our disfranchised fellow countrymen and wo
men of the north who are lulled to sleep by
the syren song of liberty while we are slaves
to all intents purposes and constructions in
any state within this slaveholdivg union
let it be seen and felt that while our breth
ren and sisters of the south are slaves to
individuals we of the north are slaves to
the mass let the whole truth in regard to
our real condition be so clearly shown that
our colored brethren who believe themselves
free may understand that in the united
states of america there are no free colored
menand that there never can be so long
as there is no concert of action and our neu
trality continues to clog the wheels of the
car emancipation on this subject may
the light of the north star be like that of the
inflexible sirius that never waxes nor wanes
until our brethren who arc sleeping in calm
security shall awake to the dangers which
surround them and take such observations
from the beaconlight as shall point them to
the haven where they should be in the full
enjoyment of freedom not slavery rights
not privileges
since yours is a permanent press and the
star shines for all the necessity of the na
tional press called for by the troy con
vention is superseded and until it be
shown that there is a sincere devoted ness
nay a united effort on tlie part of the whole
people to mmtain the most able fret and in
depkmdkirr nwss ever established and con
trolled by colored men in this country the
plea for a national press can be made
only on sectarian grounds and since secta
rianism has made us all ishnaehtes the true
friends of humanity at home oaabroad can
never listen to such a plea
w hen i reflect upon the tremendous influ
ence of the press in freedoms cause since
w m lloyd garrison sounded the first note
for immediate emancipation and consider the
important position you occupy and that the
destiny of enslaved millions depend upon the
existence of a free and independent press and
that every man sod woman w hose complexion
bears the presumptive evidence of slavery is
under a moral obligation to sustain such an
engine in our cause my word to all is let
him who would be a stare refuse to sustain
it
ever yours for human freedom

is however incorrect in his opinion that thin

of first extending its hand of encouragement
to those colored young men aspirants for
legal lore ard in accordance with its de

removed the barrier which in the other states
chills the noble prompting of spirits congenial

to th o editors of the xorth star
gentlemen  promised to inquire how
far are we bound to keep the sabbath under
the christian dispensation or any other day
answering thereto i suppose none will
deny that the jews believe themselves to be
bound to keep the sabbath to the latest gen
eration as well also as they believe them
selves bound to keep the covenant of circum
cision to separate and distinguish them from
oilier nations kxo xxxi id gen
xvn ll lev xii  john vii  acts
x i  st paul said that jesus christ
v hs a minister of the circumcision for the
truth of god to confirm the promises made
nto the fathers and jesus himself said
 am not sent but to the lost sheep of the
house of israel and that there might be
no mistake in so important a matter the
greatest possible care appears to have been
taken in the instructions given by christ to
the apostles both to the seventy and the
twelve that they should not go into the way
of the gentiles nor into any city of the i
samaritans mat x  luke x 
it was not until the personal mission of the
saviour was finished that the command was j
given go ye into all the world and preach
the gospe to every creature thus wesee
as st paul said that jesus christ was a
minister of the circumcision ilis mission
was peculiarly directed to his own people
the jews according to the law of moses i
were bound to listen to him and whatever
alterations or modifications he might make in
the law they were hound to observe them
deut xviii lib it may also be ob
served here that jesus left the ritual law
jerfeetly untouched as far as his personal
ministry was concerned with the exception of
the instructions he gave to his disciples with
regard to the traditionary purifications of the
pharisees matt v  
peter and the rest of the apostles appa
rently kept the law as strictly after the death
ot christ as they hail previously done acts
xi   not excepting st paul we
find nevertheless in pauls epistle to the
hebrews he shows that the high priesthood
bong changed there was of necessity a
change in the law and also minutely points
out that alteration heb vii  the great
mistake in this matter appears to be the
supposition that the whole of the ritual law
was abolished both to jew and gentile
whereas a greater mistake could not well be
made
we have shown that all the apostles
kept the law ls well as all the jewish chris
tiaas after the death of christ which could 
not possibly have happened if they had tin 
rflerstood that the ritual law was abolished
kven st paul while lie preached uncircum
ciston to the gentiles circumcised timothy
because one of his parents was a jew there j
can therefore be no doubt that the jews re
maiiied subject to a part of the ritual law and
although there may be no doubt that they will
acknowledge christ as the messiah before
tbur general return to judea they will yet
nnld the temple and establish the lau r ac
cording to the prophecy of ezekiel
let us now inquire how the gentiles are
afteted m this matter all are aware tliaj
under the mosaic dispensation the gentile
proselytes had to submit to the whole of the
ritual law as a matter of coutsc and the
jcu nji christians who submitted to it could
not easily understand why the gentiles should
not continue to do so acts xv  ist tim
b  this opinion was so prevalent
among t k jews of asia that paul barna
bas ami others were obliged to go up to jeru
salem to c onsult with the rest of the apostles
to decide whether it ought to be so or not
and according to the testimony of the holy
ghost it was decided that the gentiles were
entirely free from the ritual not so w ith the
jew arts xv   rom iii  gal
ni  col ii  notwithstanding this
decision either the apostles themselves did
not thoroughly understand ttieir jkitoiuon or
were not permitted to explain it which at
limes rendered their actions liable to miscon
struction and even caused disagreement among
themselves ist cor xiu til  gal it
 
we have now to bear in mind that paul
was jceeuliarly the apostle of the gen
tiles arid was set apart for that purpose by
the holy ghost from his conversion aet
i j iii  we have therefore to re
member that in his epistles to the gentiles
he naturally identifies himself with the partie
ti whom he is writing and we ought not t
j treat him w orse than me would any other au
i tbor by extending hi dictum beyond th
t point mb intended it to reach it appears fron
 st pauls ejnstle to the galatians that h
i preached seventeen yearn among the gentiles
i without seeing any of the other apostles ex
 eepting peter and james and it eras seven
teen years before any explanation took plao
l between the apostles of tlie circumcision an
j himself as to the difference of their dnetmien
when it was decided as we have intimate
above that paul and bamabaa should go t
the gentiles and tell them that they wen
free from the ritual law gal ii  w
need hardly say more upon this part of th
subject except we rrpeat the message shirt
p paul and barnabas had to deliver to the gen
tiles for it scemcth good to the holt
j ghost and to u to lay upon you no greatei
i burden than these necessary things thai
ve abstain from meats off red to idols ant
from blood and from things strangled ant
from fornication ftom which if you keep
yourselves ye shall do well fare ye well
here then w e have the subject made perfectly
j plain
the jews were the peculiar or chosen
people of god who were to enforce and
spread the law as far as it w  practicable in
such a state of things and the changing ol
the dispensation did not entirely free them
from it but as the church was about to
pass from them to the gentiles at the destruc
tion of jerusalem the law was necessarily
abolished in their case
having now ascertained these important
facts let us inquire what the apostle of the
gentiles says in reference to the sabbath in
the th chapter of the epistle to the ro
mans w c find the following one man es
tecnieth one day above another another es
teemeth every day alike let every man be
fully persuaded in his own mind he that
regardeth the day regardeth it unto the lord
and he that doth not regard a day to the
grd he doth not regard it in speaking
again upon the same subject to the colos
sians he says let no man therefore judge
you in meat or in drink or in respect of an
holy day or of the new moon or of the sab
davs this evidence is quite conclusive up
on the subject on which we are writingthe
sabbath
the gentiles are not bound to keep
it or any other day of the week in its
stead the custom w hich has generally ob
tained among professed christians of keeping
one day in the week partially as the sabbath
no doubt originated from the custom which
some of the early gentile churches adopted
of meeting every first day for the purposes of
exhortation and commemoration of the sa
viours death and there qan be no doubt that
this custom has been highly beneficial to so
ciety and conducive to civilization but it is
the loose and unequal manner of its adoption
w hich has chiefly caused it lo be so beneficial
j if wc had been yoked and hampered like the
jews under the traditions of the pharisees
and as the pharisees of the present day would
have us how could civilization have pro
gressed llow could our ships sail to dis
tant jkirts and mankind spread themselves
over the face of the earth and how could
many other works of necessity be donewhich
require continued application on the other
hand if we had had no periodical restday
no day of recreation and instruction how
would the working part of mankind have at
tained to improvement and civilization
 bus we believe that the custom of a restdav
in each week which has grown tip in imita
tion of the jewish sabbath is a highly ne
cessary and useful custom and ought not to
be lightly abandoned but it is not therefore
necessary that the law should interfere for its
continuance the law never ought to inter
fere unnecessarily to curtail the liberties of
the mass to suit the crotchets of the fanatical
and hypocritical few
this subject may now be safely left to the
consciences and convenience of individuals
mankind cannot be made religious by legisla
tive enactments above all let us remember
that religion does not consist in outward forms
and ritual ordinances st paul says all
the law is fulfilled in one word even in this
i hou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
and again love is the fulfilling of the
law
let us remember also that even under
the mosaic dispensation the saviour said
the sabbath was made for man and not
man for the sabbath in view of all these
lacts and circumstances does our pharisaical
and fanatical church believe that a little un
lawful and unnecessary stringency in regard
to the sabbath will palliate the crying sin of
american slavery

what places are sacred
it is a summer eve just as the season fades
into the sere and yellow leaf of autumn
the sky is clear and calm wiih here and
there a white streaky cloud moving slowly
aloug as if loth to lose sight of the setting
sun which is gilding every object with a
shade of its own inexpressible brightness
not a sound is heard save the scarcely per
ceptible rustling of the leaves shaken bv the
soft breath of summer or the gurgle of the
neighboring stream as it leaps playfully from
stone and then glides with an unruffled cur
rent beneath the shade of the drooping
willow whose white leaves are reflected on
its glassy surface the birds are uttering
perhaps their last chirrup before they nestle
down in calm security assured of the kind
protection of heaven everything around
fe calm peaceful and lovely bearing the im
press of him w ho is holy ard ineffably bene
ficent the voice of god may  heard in
the dash of the hurricane in therushing of
the whirlwind in the roar of the thunder
but neither of these nor all combined tell of
him in such heartthrilling soulsubduing
accent as the still small voice of the summer
evening look around youwhat do you
behold the temple of god it w w
building and worthy of the great architect i
and as you lustra to the w htspered j
in your soul which tells you that it the
house of god and conjures you to worship
him love him and obey him are you not
constrained to acknowledge that be is present
of a truththat h hears that he love that
he will listen to you

along the billaide till it is entirely lost in

and sufferings fill a dark page in the world s

the close of the psalin they think of the poets
beautiful words the lord of hosts is with
us the god of jacob is our refugethe
calm settled countenance determined yet
subdued and the glistening eye turned up
ward in devout adoration clearly tell that
these words do indeed speak the thoughts
that are passing in the mind the idea ex

such a confidence they are enabled even in
the midst of dangers and sufferings to par

there must at all times command our respect
we enter a quiet respectable
in one of the streets of that city the doors
are shut the curtains drawn the hum and
bustle of the streets has nearly subsided
solitary footsteps are passing at intervals and
each cart or carriage can be heard as it comes
rumbling along now the sound is softened
by the distance now it comes nearer
nearer now the jolting of the wheels from
stone is distinctly heard as it passes the door
again it softens subsides and dies away in
the distance it is the beginning of winter

been coming down in cold dripping drizzling
showers during the whole day and may still
be heard as each gust of wind whistles
through the street pattering against the win

cheerful blazing fire talking of what has hap
pened to each during the dayor perhaps of
some brother or friend who is sojourning in
a strange land the hour for family worship
arrives the wellworn bibles are produced
and the psalm is sung and the portion of
gods word is read and the father whose
head is sprinkled with the frost of middle age
kneels down and the mother the partner of
his cares and sorrowsthe cheerful sharer of
his joys kneels down and the sonssome
of them in the vigor of manly youth kneel
down and the daughters young beautiful
full of tender sensibilities and pure single
hearted devotion kneel dow r n and they all
by the mouth of him who is the rightful
priest in that household commend themselves

worthy of a moments attention they are
men of quaint attire and slow nasal speech
theyare men of sincere earnest hearts who
not being permitted to worship god in the
way they think right have fled from their
own country to the more libertyloving shores
jf a neighboring state they have heard of
a faroff land in the new w orld and are on the
eve of embarking for its unexplored shores
savage men are there savage beasts are
there a wild and savage country is that to

on the th of november thanksgiving
day in the year  in the city of

met for divine worship when a sermon
adapted to the occasion was preached by the
minister the house referred to above is a
urge and handsome  place of worship it
is substantially built and beautifully finished
the seats sad seatbocks are ak taahhmcd
one uniform color the pews and sales are
all carpeted and a splendid mahogany desk
occupying about onethud the width of the
building is planed at one end a woudreas

l
cendants of uw ow puritan mot there on the
occasion shore mentioned a hyms wu
read by the minister and when be had dime
reading the deep solemn tones of the orgaa
discoursed excellent melody then a choir
of pceompbshed singers sang with the organ
accompanying the words which the minister
had read a considerable portion of the audi
jeisce during this performance looking au the
t wngers or gaxmg listlessly atoned than or
i perhaps observing the dress and demeanor of
their mnghliors after this was finished the
minister engaged in prayer the people fur
thff most part sitting at ease in zion on
their soft cushioned seats their feet resting 
on ottomans and apparently thinking of any
thing but the prayer in which they were sup
posed to he engaged then another hymn
was sung then a sermon was preached
w hich if it might be judged of by the atten

nor very interesting then after a peribrm

niog the congregation separated oh how
hare the descendants of the ancient pilgrim

god is not confined to temples made with
hands they that worship god must
worship him in spirit and in truth the
grana gorgeousness and solemn ceremony of
homan catholic worship and the orthodox j
formalism of modern presbyterianism and con j
gregalicnalism he loves not nay they arc
abomination in liis sight compared w ith the 
heartfelt devotion of those hillside and sea

saints and angels by a roman catholic
priest nor any of the varying services of mo

vain because there is no authority for them
in the law and testimony it is vain also i
to claim for any particular place any superior
sanctity for the same reason god respects
neither persons nor placer wheresoever his
people are there is he in whatsoever place
his worship is observed that is a holy place
during its observance but to attach any par

selections
from the new york tribune
freedom or slavery in
congress
washington jan 
there was a struggle in the house this
morning very characteristic of the law ail
justice which pervade this area of freedom
which we are so zealously extending at a cost
of fifty millions a year i presume the tele
graph will not have described it fully so t will
endeavor to add a word of illustration
mr giddings of ohio moved a resolution
of inquiry setting forth that a colored man
long a resident of this district a servant at
mrs springs where mr g hoards where
his wife is also a servant had an agreement
with his legal owner whereby he agreed to
pay the latter  for his freedom which
sum he had paid except oo when on satur
day last i believe two men came iuto the
house threw him down bound him gagged
him and carried him off to one of the slave
traders prisons in the city by virtue of a
sale by his villanous master of course
whence he has since been shipped to new
orleans for sale this was at once met by a
motion to lay on the table which was first vo
ted downb to  but on a second trial
carried to  so congress the sole
legislature of the district voted that such
an outrage is not worth even an inquiry hut
all regular unexceptionable and according to
the legal marolit of the peculiar institution
i hope this will be the last we shall hear of
this atrocity
washington jan 
the vote in the house yesterday on the
atrocious case of slave piracy brought to its
notice by mr ghidings will doubtless have
been analyzed in the tribune before this let
ter is received yet i am impelled to offer
some farther elucidation
the outrage could not have been more a
bominabie if the slave coast of africa had
i been its theatre and the most atrocious sava
ges its authora the victim had made him
self respected by all who knew him by his
quiet industry and diligence in his vocation
he had fairly bargained for his freedom and
had paid fourfifths of the stipulated purchase
money as appears by receipts from his mis
creant owner on the books of his trustee but
his wife states that he had actually paid the
whole price except  having made pay
ments when his trustee wash way and no cred
it could be recorded and had  of his little
balance in his pocket when the pirates jump
ed upon shackled and kidnapped him two
weeks more aud lie would have been out of
the house of bondage now he is torn from
all he holds dear and is on his way in chains
to wear out the w retched remnant of his life
in the cauefields of louisiana
y now the reason why congress ought to
have acted on this case is this this whole
drama of piracy and villany has iren enacted
in strict accordance with and under the erpress
protection of the laics of the united states
the w oman who sold her slave to himself
pocketed almost the last dollar of her price
for him and then sold him over again to the
owners of the slavepen which carried the
flag of polk dallas sc texas at its mast
i head during the last presidential contest has
done nothing which the laws of this model
republic do not sanction and uphold she
has merely availed herself of the temptations
to piracy and seoumlrelism in general which
those laws create mr gkljings therefore
projiosed a simple and very natural inquiry
 into the character of these laws and the
proper remedy for the outrages they author
ize and this inquiry a house of keprcscnt
atives threefifths of whom represent free
j men only have voted to stifle and put down
and among those representatives of free
states w ho voted thus inhumanly are one
wh i george a erlarrt of pennsylvania
the native jyrin two numbers trom new
i york city macay and a troll cmc more
from our stat ehirdsall of broome who
represents d s dickinson and gen casa
three from maine f lark hammons and
williams two more locos from peimsyiva
i niabrodhcad and c j ingersoli four from
ohidcummins kermon miller and rich
ey and three from illinois ficklin rich
ardson and turner la all serenteten repre
sentatives of freeman only turned then backs
upon freedom and voted that rascality and
piracy are not deserving of rebuke nor even
j invinstigation
of course the representatives of slarc
holders with the single exception of noble
i delawares houston voted against any inqui
t ryit would have been political destruction
to any of them to do otherwise they can
j hardly be  darned as the world goes bat
how dude it an honest reader will inquire
that there were at least thirty absentees from 
i free states and only twefrt from slave
states when this important vote was taken j

the idea of slavery is to use a mar
as a thing against his nature and ii
opposition to his interests the con
sequences of such a principle it is im
possible to escape the results of this
idea meet us at every step man i
certainly not cruel by nature even ir
the barbarous state in cur presen

to make their slaves as comfortabh

be treated not as men bat only as
things this first principle involves
continual violence and oppression with
all the subordmatctpastiealars of theif
condition which shall now be touched
on as briefly as possible a famous
man said in public that his slaves weie
sleek and fat the best thing he
j could say in defence of his keeping
men in bondage but even this is not
always true take the mass of slaves
together and an abundance of testi
mony compels the conviction that they
are miserably clad and suffer bitterly
from hunger so far as food clothing
and shelter are concerned the physical
condition of the mass of field slaves is
far worse than that of comic mned crim
inals in the worst prison of the united
states houseslaves and mechanics
in large towns fare better they are
under the eye of the public farm
slaves feel most the poignant smart

art committed mainly to overseers the
swiss of slavery whom mr wirt calls

principled race
let us pass over the matter of food
clothing shelter and toil to consider
other features of their condition they
arc treated with cruelty often branded
w ith a red hot iron on the breast or the
shoulder the arm the forehead or the
cheek though the roman law forbade
it fifteen centuries ago they are dis
figured and mutilated now by the mad
ness of anger then by the jealous
malice of revenge their backs and
sides scored with the lash or bruised
with the paddle bear marks of the
violence needful to subdue manhood

are the ways by which the people of the oh
world may labor against our slave system arc
they arc not slow in finding them cut th
following is from a tractive presumeby thcpei
of henry richardson one of the most con
 scientious and devoted friends of the slav
with whom we ever met slavery agitatcc
in any form must serve to shorten its wicket
reign
reader we solicit your attention
while we bring under your notice a case
of cruelty in which as a nation we
are deeply implicated not intentional
cruelty on our part it is true but equal
ly oppressive in its results and evinc
ing to say the least a remarkable want
of consideration for the feelings of oth
ers we allude to the consumption of
slavegrown produce and the conse
quent stimulus given to slavery and the
slavetrade were the misery we thus
occason only brought to our own doors
we should start from it aghast horrified
and selfcondemned
to illustrate our meaning we will
suppose that a leading baker of the town
vc live in is an unprincipled trades
man he is known to use dishonest
means in obtaining his supplieshe
keeps back the wages of his work peo
plehe heats and half starves his ap
prenticeshe allows them no time
even to go to church or to read the bi
ble would any respectable house
holder choose to be seen in the shop of
such a man while there is an honest
baker on the other side of the street
vet the lady who would not buy a loaf
of bread manufactured under such cir
cunistances calls at the next shop and
buys a pound of sugar the production
of which has been attended with human
misery ten times more intolerable she
little thinks that to enable her to sweet
en her daily meal the african vil
lage may have been firedthe hor
rors of the middlepassage inflicted
human beings brought to the auction
block find sold into interminable sla
very tire wife from the husband and
the child from the parent the gang
male and female driven to the cane
field with a cartwhipherded together
at night like cattlesystematically kept
in heathen darkness and degradation
perhaps you are inclined to repudi
ate the charge of giving encourage
ment or support to such a wicked
system let us ccine then to the proof
on step into a shop and purchase a
pound ot sugar from some slavecolony
fur instance cuba it may be that you
do not know that it is slavegrown hut
this is no excuse you ought to know
the grocer takes your id and retain
ing a fraction as his profit hands all
the remainder to the wholesale dealer
the dealer hands it to the importer the
importer to the cuban merchant the
merchant to the slaveholder to whom
it becomes a premium for the mainten
ance of slavery thus a regular chan
nel for our gold is kept open between
the english consumer and the cuban
planter it is this that steels his heart
against the slave that pays the slave
driver and let ds the bloodhound it
is not cruelty the planter loves but gold
and this we give in exchange lor sugar
t produce which he flogs the slave
verily we are guilty concerning our
brother
the remedy is simple we do not ask
you to give up the use of sugar but
merely to avoid the slavegrown article
and use that of jamaica bengal or
some other british possessions where
happily the lash is now unknown slave
groun sugar is no longer shut out by a
statute of the realm what a noble
spectacle it would he and how power
fully it would tell upon foreign nations
to see tiiis country in advance of its
lawsslavery shut cut by the moral sense
of the community
the frccchurch of scotland has
been blamed and justly flr receiving
the contribution of american slave
holders wherein did her error con
sist
ist in taking money which had been
unjustly obtained being in part the
profit of stolen labor
in the countenance given to
davchrddera and the encouragement
consequently afforded to slavery by tbit
transaction
but if the freechusch were wrong
in taking the slaveholders money lor
religious purposes is not every man in
england wrong abo buys the slave
holders sugar to gratily his own appe
tite the sugar is obtained not less
unjustly the encouragement to slavery
is more palpable and direct and the
motive is as inferior as sensual is below
spiritual the consequences too in
the latter case are more disastrous for
you encourage not merely slavery but
the african slavetrade that atro
cious system to which according tc
high authority  human beings are
sacrificed on an average every day
we live add to this the temptation is
positively less for you can have free
labor sugar anywhere if you only ask
for it what right have we to cismoi
against the freechurch or even
against slavery itself while we fee the
slaveholder by putting gold into hb
pockets
englishmen are accustomed to pride
themselves on west india emancipa
tion and it was a noble feeling which
spent twenty millions in an act of jus
tice but if after abolishing slavery
in our sugar islands we transfer oui
orders to the foreign slaveholder
where is the benefit if we were de
termined to use the produce of slavery
why did we not keep the money in oui
coffers and continue to employ slaves
upon our own soilw here we might have
watched o r their interests instead o
increasing the number of these in cuba
and leaving them to the tender mercies
of spanish slavedrivers
to prove that the evils we refer tc
are not imaginary we give an abiidger
quotation from a letter to lord johr
russell published in the times of oc
toberth under the signature of ja
cob omnium merely premising tha
the description it contains remarkably
agrees with that of dr madden am
other eyewitnesses
i spent the beginning of this yeai
in cuba with a view of ascertaining
the preparations which were bein
made in that island to meet the openin
of our markets to an englishman
coming up from grenada and jamaica
the contrast between the paralysed am
decayed aspect of the trade of thos
colonies and the spirit and activity
which your measures had infused intc
that of the havannah was most dl
heartening
the town was illuminated when
landed in consequence of the news o
high prices in england three splen
did trains of de rosnes machinery
costing  dollars each had jus
arrived from france and were in pro
cess of erection steam engines ant
engineers were coming over daily fron
america new estates were forming
coffee plantations were being broke up
and their feeble gangs of old peoplt
and children w ho had hitherto been se
lected for that light work were formet
into task gangs and hired out by th
month to the new ingenws then in ful
drive
it was crop time the mills wen
round night and day on every estate
i scarcely hope to be believed wher
i state the fact every slave was work
ed under the whip eighteen hours oui
of the twentyfour and in the boiling
houses from five to six r m and fron
eleven oclock to midnight when hall
the people were concluding their eight
een hours work the sound of the
hellish lash was incessant indeed il
was necessary to keep the overtaskee
wretches aw ake
the six hours during which they
rested were spent in a barracoon s
strong foul close styewhere they wal
lowed without distinction of age 
sex
there was no marrying among the
slaves on the plantations breeding was
discouraged it was cheaper and less
troublesome to buy than to breed
religious instruction and medical aic
were not carried out generally beyonc
baptism and vaccination
whilst at work the slaves w r erc
stimulated by driversarmed with swords
and whips and protected by magnifi
cent bloodhounds
to afford you an idea of the lighl
in which negroes arc looked upon bv
the cuban planters i will mention that
i was present at a hiring bargain w hich
took place between an american and
a frenchman both men of unusually
good character the american want
ed ten additional hands  lie french
man only wished to let eight females
at last the latter said i will teii
you what ill do ive a lame house
boy he has never hern used tc
field labor certainly but he is a very
spirited lad and your mayoral may get
a deal of work out of him if he only
presses him a little you shall have
him that will make nine arid then
ive got a magnificent wench she
was confined three weeks ago ill
yvean her baby at once and she shall
he here fit to go to work on sundry
the bargain was struck the baby
weaned and the wench put to work
possibly your lordship is at this mo
ment sweetening your tea with the re
sults of her exertions
the spaniards have always been
esteemed humane slaveowners and 
have no wish to make them worse than
they are what  describe here i sate
 he lex scripta of cuba as regards the
negroes indeed most humane but
the corruption which pervades ev
ery branch of the public service in that
island renders it entirely a dead letter
seeing that results so oppressive at
tend the consumption of slave produce
it is surely the duty of every one who
lavs claim to a particle of humanity or
iiristian feeling to abstain from it as
much as possible we know that in a
country circumstanced like this it is
out ot our power to avoid the produc
tions of slavery altogether unless in
deed we betake ourselves to the woods
and live on roots and berries like an
anchorite but decs this absolve us
trorn giving a preference to free labor
whenever we have the choice be
cause  and my household do not know
how to avoid rubbing off a few grains
annually of slavedug gold in our purs
es or a few ounces of slavegrown die
on our clothing are we therefore justi
fied in consuming some hundred weight
of slavegrown sugar or some scores
of pounds of slavegrown coffeu while
the same articles in free produce are
within our reach
it has been calculated that every fee
families who use slave produce iraploy
one slave the most serious difficulty
we anticipate is in the article of cot
ton so universal in its use and so op
pressive in its culture to meet this
cam some progress has been made in
obtaining freelabor cotton from trini
dad and even from america itself un
der proper guarantees one cr two
mill ow ners have been iuduced to man

a special meeting of the board of trus

   the undersigned was invitee
to prepare a full statement of the ori
gin history designs and principles o
the society for which they act and la
it before you through such papers a
he niiuht have access to with a dcsiri
 to solicit your candid and praverfal at
tendon to the reform in our henevoleni
operations especially in missions whicl
is now rapidly progressing we nect
not apprise you that we have had greai
difficulties in reaching your ear oi
account of the fact that the most of oui
i denominational papers have maintainet
a studied silence on the subject of oui
operations and m st generally have
closed their columns against our com
inunications while they have thus
refused us the opportunity of speaking
for ourselves they have freely given t
the winds their dark innuendoes againsi
i us and have expressed freely theii
suspicions upon the motives and plans
upon which we have acted in carrying
forward the free missionary movement
still our cause has been steadily pro
grossing and striking its roots eleepci
and deeper into a rich virgin soil enjoy
f ing the smiles of heaven and gaining
the unqualified favor of the true ant
the good we believe that our princi
ples only need to be known to be prizec
and loved we have not room in this
i communication to present fully tiie po
i sition of the american baptist mis
i sionary union from which we dissen
on account of its aristocratic and pro
slavery character and shall reserve t
another the principal facts in its brie
i history which stamp it with odious pe
culiarities and antibaptist features
with reference to the free mission
i ary organization we would call youi
attention first to the history of our owr
movements
i origin of tiie society
this society had its origin in the
growing antislavery sentiment of north
ern churches and in the general desire
of antislavery baptists to disconnect
themselves from the voluntary societies
of the denomination which were sup
ported in common with slaveholders
i and thereby become entirely separated
from the fellowship of slavery in the
work of missions and general benevo
lence the triennial convention the
old organization of the denomination
was always proslavery to the core
tieentyone years of its existence its
presiding officer w as a slaveholder ant
many ol its board ot managers were
slaveholders of the first water and
yet its members were religiously fellow
shipped by our northern brethren ant
the known avails of slavery were read
ily received with which to support anc
carry forward the cause of missions
tiie wicked maxim of olden times
seemed to guide the convention ir
relation to funds
luri odor bnus est ex requalibct
i hie smell of money is good come whence it may
in the spring of  a national
convention ot baptists assembled in
the city of new york for the purpose
of considering the connection of the
denomination with slavery and of in
quiring if something could not be done
by baptists to relieve the benighted
and suffering slaves oi our country
and to disconnect the antislavery por
i tion of the denomination from a practi
cal support of the slave system in
which they conceived themselves to be
involved through their church and
various associations relations baptist
antislavery conventions of a less im
portant character had previously been
held and the eastern baptist chris
tian reflector and vermont telegraph
baptist papers then strongly advocated
high antislavery action many mem
bers of the national convention which
j was held at new york in iso were
i at that time prepared for a new mis
sionary organization and earnestly
wished its establishment the meet
ing however after putting forth two
addresses one to the churches of the
north and the other to the churches
of the south of a thrilling nature ad
journed for one year these addresses
i greatly alarmed the proslavery church
es and ministers of the north and the
slave holding baptists of the south
the convention recommended the with
drawal of felloe ship from slaveholders
at the communion table this action
greatly exasperated the south in
 therefore when the baptist tri
ennial convention met at baltimore
the southern me mbers by means of the
northern proslavery men many of
them members of the old board adopted
a course which threw the abolitionists
off the board and committed tire con
vention essentially to the interests of
slavery the southern members re
joiced in the result for they accom
plished ail they wished they ruhd
the convention
mach excitement followed the
meeting of the baptist general con
vention in toll it became apparent
to abolitionists generally that a new
organization must soon lake place or
the work of missions must bp aban
doned early in the spring of  a
provisional foreign missionary com
mil tee was established separate from
the baptist general convention and
holding no connection with slarrhold
era a communication was opened
with the heathen through which our
benefactions might flow to the benighted
 without being stained with the tears
or blood of the slave
its name however bespoke its
i design ah hoped the baptist general
j on vent ion would break off its connec
tion with slavery when the occasion
for a provisional arrangement would
cease the antislavery portion of the
denomination desired a union among
their brethren in the work of missions
which had been sadlv disturbed by a
long continued union with slaveholders
i many to be sure from conscientious
views ol the sinful nature of religious
cooperation with oppressors in bene
j volent institutions felt compelled to
w ithhold their offerings from the mis
sionary cause others directed their
donations to the heathen through other
denominations
now the provisional committee
 was instituted by the american baptist
antislavery convention as ati inci
pient organization provisional only
being designed to give place to perma
nent society provided the baptist gen
eral convention did not become discon
nected from slavery abundant evi
dence was given during the years
ibl that the brethren at the hear
of the triennial convention did noi
design to change its relation to th
south or disconnect the missionary
enterprise from slavery
in may therefore of   the
free missionary society was formed
i under the name of the american anr
foreign baptist missionary society
thi s name was changed subsequent
to that of the american baptist fret
mission society we were incorpo
rated in june ibg by the legislature
of the state of maine the design n
the society was to effect a change ir
the denomination with relation to co
 operating and fraternizing with slave
holders in the work of missions anc
other benevolent operations in which
as american baptists we were gene
rally engaged and to carry out the
commission of our blessed lord gc
j ye into all the world and preach tin
gospel to every creature the tri
ennial convention and the other pop
ular voluntary societies were composed
in part of slaveholders and the apolo
gists of slavery in the new society r
radical change was introduced viz
that the society should be compose
of baptists of acknowledged christiai
character who believe that involuntary
i slavery under all circuastances is sin
and treat it accordingly
tliis provision of the constitutioi
prevents slaveholders and their apolo
gists and proslavery men in general
from becoming members of our society
but they are freely admitted to mem
bership in the american baptist mis
sionary union which organization i
but a continuation of the old triennia
convention with a modified name am
constitution
 membership how acquired
persons of the character above de
scribed may become annual members
by appointment of churches or by pav
ing oni dollar or for life by the pay
ment f twenty dollars at one time
i should they cease to be of acknowl
edged christian character they wil
i lose their connection with the fret
mission society thus does the con
stitution guard the christian and tho
rough antislavery character of the or
ganization
board of trustees
seeing the common error of estab
i lishing a large board of managers ir
most of benevolent societies the new
organization has established a board oj
trustees not to manage for the society
or for themselves hut to take care o
and keep in trust the property of the
friends of benevolence and disburse
their benefactions according to then
will and direction the board is coin
posed of the usual officers of the so
ciety and eleven trustees who have

an aggressive agency upon slavery it
purposes to send the gospel to the mil

the design of the gospel of jesus

as a society we do not cooperate

fraternizes w ith slaveholders or re
ceives the known avails of slavcrv with
which to carry forward any of its pur
poses w e cannct send to the heathen
missionaries or aid in the support of

which the heathen arc oppressed and
proclaim the antisin elements of the

i principle comprehends a thorough sepa
ration of christianity from slavery the
giving to the world a religion of purity
justice and humanity which springs

seeking blood of jesus christ our sa
viour
conclusion
before closing permit me to state
that the american baptist free mis
sionary society is the only free channel
of communication with the heathen in
i our denomination the american bap
tist missionary union which has taken
the place of the triennial convention
has adopted a constitution which admits
j of memberships w ithout regard to chan
acter or morality the union is open to
slaveholders and is in close fellowship
m its operations with the southern
baptist i riennial convention with
which it cordially cooperates by dis
missing to it some of its missionaries
and by a cordial fraternization and ac
tive cooperation in its fields of foreign
missionary labor the union at the
j time ot the adoption ot the new consti
refused to incorporate any or
ganic provision which should bear tes
timony against slavery one amend
inent was voted down limiting mem
bership to persons of acknowledged
christian character who were not
slaveholders also another limiting
the officers to persons who were not
slaveholders these were test ques
tions and the union took the pro
slavery position from the first and has
followed in the train of the old conven
tion hut possesses a constitution a thou
sand times more odious and aristocratic
than that which gave the weight of the
fellowship of the denomination to slave
limi rs i the general convention
v e cannot therefore unite with the
lmon without surrendering the cause
ot the slave and abandoning ike benev
olent reforms which are now gathering
around them the true and the good and
are the glory of our age wc dare not
t in tte lan k r k of the first ad
dress our society put forth i will say
our course dear brethren has been
dictated by no spirit of controversy by
no wish to excite unnecessary divisions
by no feeling of pride or worldly ambil
tion on the contrary we are fully
aware that personally we can reap
no benefit therefrom but the consci
ousness of doing right and the reward
tbit comes of grace if wc know any
thing oi our own hearts it is because
we love the lord jesus christ and
w ish to be engaged in sending the gos
pel of salvation to the destitute and the
benighted everywhere that we havo
thus separated ourselves from those wo
fine as we love our own lives and
we entreat you brethren for the sake
of his glory who died for us and fop
the sake of a world sunk in covetous
ness oppression and idolatryfor tho
sako of all who are perishing for tho
lack of the bread of life to engage
heart and hand in this great and holy
work god even ourr god will bless
