from the sixteenth annual report of the massa
chusetts antislavery society
wilmot proviso
ia our lust report we gave an ac
count of the proviso to the resolution
appropriating two millions of dollars to
be employed by the president in pur
chasing a peace with mexico moved
by mr wiltnot of pennsylvania at the
close of the first session of the last
congress to the effect that neither
slavery nor involuntary servitude shxll
ever exist in any part of any territory
to be acquired from mexico except for
crime and of the manner in which
the action of the senate was prevented
after it had passed the house by sen
ator davis of massachusetts speaking
against time until the hour fixed for
adjournment had arrived a proviso to
the same effect was appended to a bill
authorizing the president to use three
millions of dollars for the same purpose
on motion of mr preston king of new
york and passed the house by a vote
of  to  in the senate howev
er the proviso was struck out by a
majority of ten and upon the resolu
tion being returned to thp house the
proviso was lost by a vote of y to 
and it was then passed without the
amendment by a vote of  to b
so supple and subservient arc the faith
ful commons of this republic to the
authentic will of the house of slave
holders since that time this proviso
has furnished the chief nucleus for the
opposition to the war and its objects to
the more independent spirits of both
parties the outrage upon the con
stitution committed in the annexation
of texas following at its due interval
upon those of the annexation of lou
isiana and florida having been sub
mitted to the point seems to be granted
on all hands that any quanity of terri
tory may be united to these states and
all that is left to the free states is to
jmke a stand of necessity an unavail
ing one against the permission of sla
very in such new acquisitions
this very shape which the political
hostility to slavery has found itself com
pelled to take is one of the strongest
testimonies to the supremacy of that
power over us it has trampled under
foot all constitutional guarantees which
tood in the way of its designs while
it enforees them upon us in their
jitraitest interpretation to prevent
our interference with thoae purposes
and having conceded the thing de
manded our antislavery politicians
would make amends for their folly by
seeking to obtain the consent of the
victor that it shall not be used for the
purpose for which it was sought and
n a pregnant proof that there can
be no effective resistance made to the
encroachments of the slave power ex
eept by men who regard the union as
e great political bulwark of slavery
ana who are ready to level h with the
u t as a necessary preliminary to the
dejruciton c f that enemy of mankind
indication of their own
c c n but hope that the daily

which they hv k lr brother eeep

the whole hulory f ae vnm
uice it wxs guhered into n
nation has been a continual wfcne to
the truth that there can be gmmine
union between good and evil between
liberty and slavery there never baa
been a union of these states a coe
lition there has been and its fate has
been that of every coalition which bai
beep attempted to be made between i
he north star
good principle and a bad one mace tb
world began the bad bee predomi
nated ever the good the victory
has been as it should have beea to the
evil element of the attempted compro
mise v
the only history worthy tike nemo
that we bare in this country in the nar
rative of various devices of the
i north to escape the jaws of staveiy
without taking her bend out of its
mouth attempts more or less vigor
ous have been mads at various peri
ods to put the monster on abort allow
ance but they have always ailed and
they mutt always fetl as long as they
are made in subordination to the agree
ment which gives slavery the power to
help itself the resistance which was
made to tbs purchase and afterwards
to the admission of luaiaiiaa tbs
missouri contest and the texfs strag
gle were conspicuous attempts of this
nature and splendid failures they
were all of them the present phase
of this spirit of resistance to the ag
gressions of slavery is seen in what is
called the wilmot proviso which em
bodies the principle that whatever
territory is acquired by the present war
shall be free territory a large part
of the whig and a proportion of the
democratic presses make a stand upon
this ground resolutions to this effect
passed the legislature of massachu
setts unanimously and have also pass
ed the legislatures of various other
northern states democratic as well
as whig but this effort will be as
futile as any of us predecessors af
ter the vaporing about the annexation
of texas and the smoke in which it
ended slavery will be indeed a fool
and that it never has been in its gen
eration if it be deterred by these de
monstrations from doing what it likes
hopes have been entertained that
the democratic party at the north
would rally round this principle at the
next election for president and put
silas wright as its incarnation in the
chair of state but this hope faint
as it should have been has been dis
pelled by the sudden death of that
statesman and all the other prominent
northern aspirants for the place will
be ready enough to repudiate it for the
sake of the only support which can
give them a chance of a nomination
much more of an election the south
has taken its ground firmly and deci
dedly and there is no doubt of its
maintaining u successfully its van
tage is too great for defeat if it
want the whole continent to cape
horn it can have it or all the resist
ance the north will make the heart
of the north must be renewed before
it will be ready to make any effectual
head against the irruptions of the slave
power and that will not be before
the next election of which circum
stance the democrats at least are well
aware
and how stands it with the whigs
the undivided front which they seemed
at one time to present under this
standard is already broken southern
machiavelistn has already made a crack
which by due pains may be widened
into a split the hon mr berrien
of georgia a pious slaveholder and
one of the officers of the bible society
and of the a b c f m if we are
not much mistaken has suggested the
change of the issue from no mbre
slave territory to no more terri
or y
mr schouler the editor of the bos
ton atlas who before he was transla
ted to a metropolitan see gave some
signs of antislavery vitality and sa
gocity falls in with this suggestion and
is followed by a portion not large as
yet of the northern whig press mr
berrien is plainly a knowing manr
he is no unworthy pupil of the great
compromiser clay to whom that same
atlas judged boston would give as
warm a welcome as she did lafayette
he takes a proposition that imm vital
principle in it and after squeezing its
life out offers its breathless corpse to
his whig brethren as a much more ef
ficient leader than when it was alive
and he is taken at his word by a por
tion which we prophecy will be an in
creasing portion of the whig party
no more territory no more than
what than to the rio grande or the
nueces or the city of mexico a
dissolving frontier like ours knows
no such thing ss new territory au
that we want was ours from the crea
j tion of the world
a little later mr buchanan takes
the democrats in hand and kindly
helps them out of their quoodary
northern democrats are not to be
expected to approve of slavery in the
abstract it seems this is a great
and rather a startling concession but
ithen the constitution compromises
compacts and all the rest of it aaake
lit pita that they are expected to ap
prove of all alavery does ia the con
crete mr buchanan of course can
not be opposed to die acquisition of
territory nor even of slave territory
but he is not in iavor of nothing but
slave territonr o no he is fer
applying the btwsouri compromise to
whatever we help ourselves to and ex
cluding slavery from all north of 
degrees and  minutes or in plain
terms he would prohibit slavery
wherever it physically impossible that
it should most and the northern de
clurion perplexities are ml
an end
but it ia ab mere heating the air
even if the whigs or democrats or
both at the north were of one mind
as to the wilmot proviso what eettid
they do rwa to procure its adoption
suppose mr corwin who semes the
present whig mpwsntsrivw of the
wilmot idea to he elected president
i what could he do or they that chass
him do could they any to dmry
ti ssmev m
mgbtt m or  nxtmjth u gp no the paxksr at vft alu and all wb abb bbtottbl
thus fer shall then go and her
shall thy proud waves be stayed v
there in the senate wifi sit that iroi
majority of slaveholders who will mod
at all their impotent straggles th
example of mr berrien shows that th
whigs cannot depend on the souther
division of their party m a ease when
the interests of stevety me at stake
the proviso can never hseorne a few
and it wifi ha distinctly intimsted the
no men that maintain it can expect eon
firotation lor any office at the hands o
the senate the way of escape whicl
mr berrien has opened will be madt
as broad as the way that leadeth t
destruction and many there will fe
that wifi walk therein the history o
the proviso lost winter is an antetyp
of what is in store fer it passed by a
democratic house it was as soon a
the wifi of the senate was expressed
crushed by the very men who bad jusl
voted for it
we hope that the better part of the
whig party and of the democratic
party too will do stout battle for the
principle of the wilmot proviso be
cause we believe that if anything can
show them the only effectual deliver
ance it will he the experience they arc
about to have they will find that il
they can succeed ia tying this millstone
about the neck of a presidential candi
date it will carry him to the bottom
with a most comfortable alacrity al
sinking they will find that there is
not strength enough left to the people ol
the free states even if they were uni
ted to a man to resist the determined
purpose of the slave power thej
will learn the might of a compact in
telligent oligarchy over incongruous
masses be they never so massive
they will discover that to attempt tc
destroy or to limit slavery under the
constitution is as vain and absurd as
to fight in fetters from all this expe
rience and more we trust they will
come to see that the only way to be
free from the despotism of the slave
holders themselves and to put them
selves into a position to give effectual
aid to the slaves is to dissolve the
union
it may look hard but it is much ea
sier than to carry the wilmot proviso
for the one can he done by a majority
of the inhabitants of the free states oi
a portion of them while the otler can
not though they were all united as one
man when the antislavery whig
and democrats will unite in demanding
a reconstruction of the government
in proclaiming the dissolution of the
present confederation and the forma
tion of a new union that shall be suck
indeed when they shall put forth theii
strength against instead of under the
present constitution when they shall
meet not in partizan conventions bul
in conventions to prepare the people
for a revolution or to carry that revo
lution into effect then they will begin
to exert some independent political in
fluence and to produce an effect on
public affairs they can then help to
create a republic in which the will ol
the people will be law and not the ca
price of a small aristocracy their na
tural enemies above their reach and
beyond their control a republic m
which there may be such athing as po
litical success without personal dishon
or in which a career may be opened
to men of honor and selfrespect as well
as to turncoats and parasites in
short a commonwealth the very oppo
site of everything that this spurious
republic is and the realization of ev
erything that it pretends to be
congress
the action on the wilmot proviso
in its new form was all that we have
time to notice of the proceedings of the
last congress although the able speech
es of mr calhoun and of mr corwin
as expositions of the proslavery and
the antisfevery points of view in
looking at the facts and the possibilities
of slaveextension mightwell demand
a passing word the speech of mr
corwin in particular was a masterty
effort which pfeced him in conspicuous
position before tfie countnr akin to thai
which he occupies with his own state
and opened to ban a way to public con
fidence and national distinction il
need not be said that whatever was de
manded to carry on our freebooting
campaigns in mexico was readily
though not unanimously dispensed by
the guardians of the public purse
the opening of the present con
gress was marked by an extraordinary
event in oar federal annals for the
fourth time since congress was a
speaker has been chosen from neu
england there being a small whig
majority this became an object of am
bition to the aspirants of that party
for some reason the southern whigs
consented to the nomination of a north
ern man only stipulating that his prin
ciples should bear the southern brand
though but a small minority of tin
party still they might have had a can
didate of their own section of country
hod they held out to the compromising
point they wove satisfied however
with having one of their own selection

and mr palfrey was in the highest de
gree honorable to them inasmuch a
it showed that they believed in obliga

and were ready to obey them though
a the ccat of party denunciation the
excitement which was produced by this
act of insubordination particularly with
regard to mr palfrey and in his owe
state was intense this gentleman
who is honorably known to the aboli
tionists and to the country by his ma
numission of his hereditary slaves
his activity in the antitexas cam
paign and by his able papers on the
slave power appeared in congres

act it was bad in itself it was worse
as a prognostic of what might remain
behind the proslavery whigs ol
his district and of the neighboring me
tropolis who had done their best tc
prevent his election by refusing to sup
port him though the regular candidate
were full of wrath because he dared
in a case where he believed his owe
consistency and honor and the best in
terests oi his constituents to be con
cerned to imitate their example hi
conduct however has received the
unqualified approval of those whose
approbation he would esteem an honor
and we believe will meet with the sanc
tion of his constituents should he ever
appear again at their tribunal he has
auspicated his political career by an
act of manhood singular in this time
serving generation and we believe
that his public conduct will be wortity
of the augury that has marked it
opening
mr calhoun in the senate has de
veloped the policy of tre wiser sort o
the slavcholding interest in a resolu
tion to the following effect that tc
conquer mexico and to hold it eithei
as a province or to incorporate it inti
the union would be inconsistent wit
the avowed object for which the wai
has been prosecuted a departure frerr
the settled policy of the government
in conflict with its character and
genius and in the end subversive ol
our free and popular institu

but then he goes for taking a de
fensive line that shall cover ample ter
ritory for indemnity and this is to be

the north will at last agree with hei

but fair to infer that at least onethird

i indeed in one of the slave states this
is n a matter of mere inference for
in  gov clarke of kentucky de

lowest forms of literature though one
of the most powerful read even by
men who read nothing else in the

newspapers and in the free 
these numbers do not express the en

general rule the circulation of thc
southern newspapers is  to  per

it has been currently taught in the
most popular churches of the land that
slavery is a christian institution
sustained by the apostles and sanc
tioned by christ himself none of the
 theological parties have been so little
connected with slavery as the unitari
anaperhaps from tbe smallness of the
sect itself and its northern latitude
but for years one of its vicepresidents
was a slaveholder
while the southern churches teach
that slavery is christian the northern
join in the belief here and there a
few voices in the north have been lifted
up against it seldom an eminent voice
in aa eminent place then to be met
 with obloquy and shame almost all
the churches ia the land seem joined in
opposing such as draw public attention

slaves aad would wade kneedeep in

to you lam the author of monte

makes open declaration of my lineage
i have travelled in other quarters of
the globe yet resembling my renowned
namesake who sighed to conquer new
worlds i am anxious to visit your
transatlantic continent in this fam
less moved by vain curiosity than a
desire to breathe the pure atmosphere
of civil liberty and to mingle my ardent
sympathies with those of a free and
happy people one tiling alone deters
me from immediately realizing this
cherished wish of my heart lam told
that my african blood will subject me
to inconveniences in the united states
and that  may be even taken and sold
as a slave according to the existing
laws this of course i hold to be an
atrocious slander propagated by the
envious monarchists of the old tvorld
yet i have deemed it prudent to ad
dress you on the subject and solicit
your advice if tliere be any difficulty
in my travelling through the united
states might it not be removed by my
being invested with some diplomatic
functions which i have no doubt my
friend and admirer the duke dc mont
pensicr would readily obtain for me
an early reply to this note will confer
upon me a lasting obligation
accept sir the assurances of my
highest consideration

in the accomplishment of your wishes
your african blood would subject you
to imprisonment and slavery in this
state as well as all other slave states
in the american union your genius
and reputation would afford you no
protection you belong to a rate that
has been the slave of the higher and
stronger races iron time immemorial
if you have read my various speeches
and letters you most be convinced
that slavery is an institution ordained
by providence honored by time sanc
tioned by the gospel and especially
favorable to personal and national li
berty that it is compatible avith de
mocracy is evinced by the fact that
tire slave states are the principal seats
of democracy in this union and that
we regard the democratic party here
as the main bulwark of the institution
that slavery is favorable to civilization
is demonstrated by the fact that in this
state setrtli carolina where the
slaves are double the number of the
whites refinement of manners is car
ried to the highest pilch and charles
ton its capital is the acknowledged
metropolis of american chivalry it
would not avail you in coming here
to be invested with a diplomatic cha
racter necessity knows no law self
protection is the first law of society
though slavery is a benignant institu
tion and our slaves arc the happiest
creatures in the world yet they might
be easily stirred up to rebellion if
free blacks were allowed to come here
they might excite their fellow africans
to insurrection we live sir ia the
midst of a perpetual crisis we must
preserve our throats from butchery
our homes from conflagration at all
hazards at the same time we must
maintain and perpetuate our peculiar
institution in such a state of things
should you visit charleston you would
doubtless experience no insult but you
would bo politely turned out of town
by our chivalry as was lately the case
in respect to a public agent sent hither
by the state of massachusetts

that they may be imagined to suit the

the rorth and the fbe
i sidekcy
the public mind is at present deeply en
grossed and apparently perplexed on tho
question as to which of the manstealers or
hired assassins shall be nominated to nm
an candidates in the approaching political
campaign for the presidency of our slave
holding and slaverypropagating republic
upon whom the nominations will fall is ex
ceedingly doubtful if anything can be learned
from newspaper speculations about the mat
ter for the greatest confusion prevails among
them with respect to it but one thing is
certain slavery the old presidentmaking
power ia still on the throne and it is equally
certain that as on all former and similar occa
sions it will so shape and control tho de
cisions of each political party as to leave
liberty with nothing to hope from either
the old game of o and  will be
played off again and the friends of freedom
will be again dogged with tbe doctrine of
choosing between two evils as if moral evils
could be separated the people of the north
are juat now if we may judge from their
noisy tumult and clamor sporting joyfully in
the delusion of imagining themselves parties
to a decision of the question of who shall be
nominated infatuated and deluded men
how long will you be deceived your voice
in this matter is without weight your boasted
power is a shadow you have surrendered up
your proper influence in the choice of rulers
in your unholy union with slaveholders you
have joined hands with tbe wicked man
stealer to rob and plunder your equal brother
and though you may share with him to the
foil the vile profligacy and infamy of his
crime as for from being equal to him is
power you tro but his mean servile and
cringing tassel you are eaught in the snare
which you set for others and are under the
same yoke in part that you imposed on the
neck of the oppressed and despised black
man
it ia in strict accordance whb all philo
sophical as well as all experimental knowl
edge that those who unite with tyrants to
oppress the weak and helpless will soonor or
later find tho groundwork of their own
rights and liberties giving way the price
of liberty is etenal vigilance it can only
be maintained by a sacred regard for the
rights of all men the people of the north
have sought to attain sod secure their rights
by a most flagrant infringement of the rights
liberties sad happiness of others they have
consented to stand side by side with the ty
rant with their heels ca the hearts of fettered
millions leaving them to perish under the
weight of what they eah our glorious
union and in so doing ltavw given the
southern slaveholder the most effective power

these resolutions
in perfect consistency with the foregoing
resolutions congress ban within the last few
days voted down the only principle upon
which the north has made the slightest show
of independence the only foundation ef the
north is gone sttd whil e the south stands
firm bold and united in favor of the com
plete preservation and exterskn of slavery
and the permanent supremacy of the slave
power the north lies disjointed scattered
and confused with no great and commanding
interest or principle to maintain ox defend
they stand like so many russian soldiers
respectfully awaiting the command of their
superiors a threat of dissolving the union
makes them shiver in their shoes with terror
the bleeding wounds of outraged freedom
plead but plead in vain insulted
liberty the nust precious boon for which
the fathers poured out their warm blood
on the icy earth pleads for assutanco but
has no power to move them to manliness
and coldly disdainfully and sacrilegiously
called by them an abstraction they
are your practical men and prove their right
to the name by adroitly allowing every favor
able opportunity for making an issue with
and aiming a blow at the slave power to
pass unimproved the wilmot proviso was
an issue and one of much consequence and
we have no doubt that many at the north sup
posed that now would come a noble struggle on
the part of northern freemen against southern
slaveholders nor can we doubt that many
in both the whig and the democratic party
meant to stand by the principles of that pro
viso at all hazards but they little understood
the base metal of which they were made
large numbers in both the whig and de
mocratic party at the very first word cf their
southern masters meanly deserted then prin
ciples the whig dropping entirely the of
fensive word no more shoe territory and
adopting the soulless me of no more terri
tory sod the democrats repudiating ibe
idea of making the wilmot proviso a tent in
the sorting presidential contest thus yielding
up to their masters everything which they
have ever demanded what respect can the
south have for such servile doughfaces
they have hot to shake foe rod and they
are down upon their knees at once soeingfor
pardon we hate with a perfect hatred foe
supercilious arrogance of southern slave
holders but we cherish a most burning con
tempt for their miserable allies at the north
we feel disgust mingled with deeper hate
for he mean subserviency of foe north
we are glad to bebeve that there are yet a few
in each political party who would he pleased
to have foe coming contort waged on foe
principle of the wilmot proviso but they
are foe youthful aad not foe hvfioenttal of

d  the albany patriot copies that part of
oar letter published a few numbers back giv
ing a short account of our meetiag in troy
with the following comment
colored as well as whita men must judge
for themselves how they are to oktaiu mil
equality while refusing to assume civil re
sponsibilities bd cooperating with those who
throw from their hands the oars by which
alone they can reach shore beeaase bad men
hate prostituted them to unworthy pur
poses
this we regard as a caution to mr garnet
against cooperating with us in sustaining our
independent press on the ground that we
hate refused to assume civil responsibili
ties and hare thereby thrown away the
means by which alone civil equality is to be
attained we might ask the patriot what
civil responsibilities we have refused to as
sume and should probably receive as an an
swer you have refused to vote true
but not for the reason which the patriot as
signs we believe the constitution of the
united states to be radically slaveholdrng in
its character requhriag all who swear to sup
port it to become parties to the enslavement
of our race and to violate the divine law
we therefore refuse to bo parties to any such
compact or constitution we go against
any union with slaveholders and should do
so even though it could be shown that in so
doing we gave up the only earthly means of
emancipating the enslaved or elevating the
oppressed consistency and the clear conclu
sions of tnrr own moral sense have marked
out this path for us and w dare not swerve
from it
but is voting the only instrumentality with
which the powers ef prejudice and slavery
can be successfully met and vanquished no
and we have only to copy a few extracts from
the same albany patriot to show that he is
aware of the existence of another for more
effective than mere voting hear him
the searching inquiries of a vigilant
untrammelled press and the light diffused by
it slavery cannot endure it withers before
the ioiuenaes that come from such a quarter
if mosey and etfort could be copiously ex
pended to gather up feet connected with the
transactions of the slave system only about
washington and spread them before the
world through the numerous public journals
the nuisance would shortly disappear from the
federal district we have no doubt is would
be smitten with blight and death elsewhere
by the application of the same means the
wrongdoer does not like to feel that all eyes
are gazing at him of all the different classes
and shades of rascals that throng the high
ways of this worid there is not probably one
of them more sensitive under impeachment at
the bar of public opinion than the slaveholder
the wretch who has the hardihood to deny
the authority of godto rob humanity of its
most precious rights and virtue itself of its
just rewards thepress of this country lac
never yet is its majesty bee brought to bear
upon slavery its team are timid faltering

grimmest of all crimea merchandizing in hu

course it ordinarily does to its treatment of

cordially by the hand and thanked them for

ffy hie shove extract from a new york
paper will astonish no leas than grieve the
numerous asttslavery friends of these gifted
singers especially whi their english and
irish friends be pained and mortified by this
unholy prostitution of their noble powers
the hutchinson family known and distin
guished in this country and in europe as
among the truest and best of libertys friends
singing the honor and praise id a slaveholder
what a spectacle for the departed spirit of
roger wo find it hard to fancy the angel
hearted ahby singing the praise of a notorious
trafficker in human flesh we charitably
believe that her heart was not there and if it
was the angel was not we have frequently
seen her and het younger brothers strongly
tempted to violate ihck principles and have
witnessed with heartfelt pleasure their calm
and beautiful meekness as they have turned
to the infernal imps saying get thee be
hind me satan and we fondly hoped they
would bold out to the end a they com
menced in the spirit we hoped they would
end in the same but alas l a here of popu
larity has triumphed over their love of prin
ciple their moorings awe loosed and there
is no telling where they will stop yet we
hope they will repent of this sin against the
bleeding captive and again rally under the
banner of emancipation oar words are
those of sorrow uct of anger

terested in looking orer the last number of the
star in tbe address to tbe christians of roch
ester and your strictures on revivals per
haps you would be interested in hearing that
we have protracted meetings in the various
proslavery churehes in this village and 
think this week it is called a revival souls
born into the kingdom you must not in
fer that we are not a religious people be
cause tbe advocates of tbe suffering slave were
shut out of every maetiughouae in this place
almost our whole population are members ol
the church and almost ever winter special
efforts are made to gather the rising genera
tion into the aik of safety yet lam in
clined to think this revival was commenced so
late in the season that few will be gathered
canandaigua is t very religious place
piety is fashionable and few are so short
sighted as to their interest to remain long one
of the i okl the praises of god arc echoed
back from the walls of the sanctuary on each
returning sabbath the condition of the poor
heathen on the other continent is well re
membered weekly prayers are put forth in
their behalf and money is poured forth freely
to convert them from the error of their opin
ions but heathens ia america heathens
that are made such by tbs wicked and ungod
ly laws of tills professedly christian land and
whose members are increasing at the rate of
coo per year tliir case must pot be
mentioned and rather than be annoyed with
such an uupic uwuil topic the churciies of this
village have excomoauuicaiod every abolition
ist from their communion their business is
ip preach the gospel sod anvwafuk and not
meddle with such secular matters ns slavery
thsy hive too mteh religion to rebuke tbe
wicked and cruel war with mexico toe much
religion to put forth any well directed effort to
stay the tide of intemperance hat now ap
pears to be coming in like a flood too much
religion to rebuke the system of caste and re
spect of persona by which the image of god
in the person of the poor colored man is flout
ed and despised in the sanctuary they have
a higher mission souk must not have their
attention turned off from the one thing need
ful by the sculiar topics to euetam aa un
popular reform with them would be tbe great
est folly the gospel is to do up tho whole
work of the worlds redemption why should
they lose their reputation by attacking any
oue specific wrong
in revivals like the present the all absorb
ing interest is the love of souk but how much
real love for souls there is among die revaluta

mr burnt says that by a perse
vering culture of the mind aa eminence
might be attained equal to any that has
formerly been won that what man has
done man can do again and he who
formed our spirits placed among our
common faculties those which may be
polished into an exquisite perfection as
ever the mind of man has heretofore
shown them to have been
from the earliest stages of life up to
manhood the mind of man was con
stantly receiving false images and in
fluences he was taught to believe
that there were some who were born
irith faculties which were denied to
others and be who possessed these
faculties more than another was said
to possess native genius if a man
outstripped his fellows and reached
the eminence which was the sure re
ward of his exertion the world ascribed
it to his native genius unmindful of the
sisyphuslike labor of each step which
led him toward the accomplishment of
his purpose
the idea that native genius was con
fined to the few has deterred many
from tasting the fruit of the tree of
knowledge nothing was to be gained
without effort and if the resolution
could be formed and maintained with
sturdy energy to press forward regard
less of the influences which the world
spread  around him on every side he
might attain to the highest eminence

its vagrancies to cure it of its constant

as one of the most difficult but one of

why postage should be uni
form and cheap
t amasa walker
the post office department in u
i its ramifieatioos is but a east we
have a central bureau at wtasbington
we establish mail routes to all parts
oftbe united states and appoint deputy
postmasters in all the principal towns
and villages all this we must do il
we would have an efficient estabhsh
t ment we pay a certain sum annually
 for transporting the mail no matter
how much or how little is in it the
i mail must go just so for and jwat so
i often whether there be many letters
or few in the bags the officers of
the department must have pay for their
i attention to the business whether
f many or few letters pass though their
i hands the aggregate cost of the
f post office is a certain sum annually
whether it distributes  mil boos or
 millions of letters per year ii
not au this true and if so does it in
f fact cost any more to eonvey a letter
i from washington to st louis than
from washington to baltimore or
t from boston to galena than from boa
ton to newton certainly not then
 why should not the rate of postage be
uniform every letter roust be mailed
and delivered whether it goes one
i mile or one thousand its weight h
inappreciable all the letters now car
ried in the u states mails do nol
amount to three tons weight per day
divided among the thousands of stage
coaches railroad cars and steamboats
employed in the service if there
were four times as many letters as there
now are tire cost of transportation
would be precisely the same as now
what then do we conclude from all
these facts why that since it evi
dently costs no more to carry a letter a
great distance than a small one justice
demands that ail should be carried at a
uniform rate
again since it is obvious from the
foregoing considerations that we can
transport  millions of letters as
cheaply as  millions it is evidently
our duty to reduce the rate of postage
to a very low point if by so doing wc
can transport a much greater number
of letters and what shall we say ol
the prospect of doing this in view of
the eminent success which has attended
the partial experiment made by our
government three years ago and the
intimation of the postmaster general
in his late report that a still further
reduction may be safely attempted
and what shall we say on this point in
view of the complete success which has
attended the penny postage system of
england where the number of letters
has increased more than three fold
why clearly we can only conclude
that if two cents the revenue of
the department would in a short time
that is as soon as the natural opera
tion of the system were fully developed
be equal to what it now is the
avcivge rate of letters postage the last
year the p m g tells us was but six
and a quarter cents then if under a
two cents rate the increase should be
as great as k has been in england
and who doubts owing to the fact of
the more general education of the peo
ple and their enterprising spirit it
would be much greater would nor he
revenue be as large as it now is
the increase in england as we have
said was more tbar threefold now
it is quite plain arithmetic that  times
 are  and consequently that the
revenue from letters under the low rate
could be as large os under the higher
one if the increase were a little more
than threefold as it has been in eng
land under the penny system
if all this is trueand rt seems quite
incontestiblewhy should we not have
uniform and cheap postage at once
we believe there is no reason why we
should not have it and yet k is quite
certain that we shall not except on
one condition and that is that the
reoflk demand it there is no hope
from any other quarter
the experience of england shows
this the reform met with the aoet
determined oppoeitien from the officers
and attaches of the post office depart
ment who exerted themselves to the
utmost to prevent the adoption of the
system and to thwart its operation after
it had been adopted by parliament
no reliance must be placed upon
government officers and officials in this
matter it mast b a dfotiwef end

we hare received an interesting
and for such an occasion an uncom
monly scientific address delivered by
ir a means before the medical cot
lege of georgia at the opening of its
annual session in augusta nov bth
 it is remarkable for the procni
nence which it gives to the pathological
agency and value of electricity the
learned professor throws together a
 greater number of important and signifi
 cant facts than we have elsewhere seen
in synopsis to establish the identity oi
 the electric and vital energies all the
processes of life he finds are electric
and conducted by arrangements subject
j to strict electric conditions the de
 veiopment of these conditionsthe care
 ful provision of conducting and nooeon
lj ducting tissues just as required in elec
trical apparatus is carious in the ex
treme we are pleased to see that in
establishing his positions this southern
professor not hindered by any unworthy
prejudice of complexion takes honora
ble notice of the remarkable practice ol
our colored and blind fellowcitizen dr
danid ruggles with whose great sue
cess our readfera are already somewhat
i acquainted
dr means refers as follows to some
experiments which seem to prove a
solid foundation in physiology for the
practice of dr ruggles which out
readers will remember consists in
 ing of disease by he electric state o
the skin determined by that delicati
sense of touch acquired in blindness
i he sayf r
 the human bhiod in a normal am
l healthy condition of the system is in i
positive state which is constantly main
tained by the activity of the generating
sources withinan excess generally
passing off in silence from the cuticulai
surface so that out of  experiment
made by mr hemtner of england upon
the uncovered skin  indicated
the presence of positive electricity
this surplusage of the fluid upon the
surface we believe to be indispensable
to the healthful condition of the whole
animal economy and that when from
any cause it is diminished or ceases
diseased action ensues r
dr means is of opinion that the
state of the surface in inflammatory
rheumatism is electropositive and the
reverse in chronic rheumatism dr
ruggles m quoted from the hampshire
herald of jan  says  of the electric
action which he is enabled to perceive
in chronic rheumatism it is quiescent
in inflammatory rheumatism it is
treasioua and appears confined by the
cuticle r the importance of ibis elec
trical indication of disease if by any
means it can be duly ascertained is
quite obvious it is the still small voice
and confession the inmost truthof
nature herself to believe that any
one can see or feel what we do not is
anything but natural when feeling the
skin of a living person we can recog
nise the difference of dry and moist
warm and cold but are as ignorant of
the presence or absence of electrical
emanations as tbs hottentot is of the
constitution of the atmosphere we
naturally set down every claim or pre
tension to deeper perceptions as hum
bug or charlatanry but right reason
may not bear us out in such a decision
and we believe it does not in the case of
dr ruggles from our long acquain
tance with him we believe him incapa
ble of any such attempt at deception
but let that pass for nothing
the testimony of scientific men
founded os accurate scientific experi
ments that there are such electric con
ditions of health and disease as dr
ruggles without any knowledge of
those experiments professes to have
discovered by his disciplined to sc is is a
good foundation for faith to build upon
and the practice of dr ruggles pre
sents us with h number of strutlug facts
which certainly go for enough to excite
the most lively interest if wot endbubt

off his shoes notwithstanding this
precaution after descending the roof a

took off one of his stockings and whilst

further efforts to save himself from the
fearful fell were useless he then with
remarkable presence of mind rolled
himself over upon the roof whilsihe was
sliding m order to prevent falling up
on the platform and when he reached
the eaves having drawn in and held his
breath clenched his teeth and hands
and contracted his muscles he leaped
to the ground a distance of  or 
feet and came down on his feet

courtesy and obligmgnc
evidently a great deal of real brotherly
kindness among them the greetinii
which you see exchanged along the
road are such as one member of a large
united family would pay another vaiy
ing with the age and character of the
individual there is a considerable
degree of boisterousness sometimes
and my impression at first was that
they were quarrelsome and violent but
a sight of their goodhumored anima
ted faces quickly undeceived me they
were merely taking advantage of thtr
occasion to be as sociable and jelly
as they could and were all talking to
gether bantering and joking with each
other every one trying to be best heard
above the general din you seldom
see the sullen surly countenance or the
fretful anxious expression so common
in our country tho tyrolese peasant
is conspicuous for his frank and manly
bearing and his look of independence
if a man be reduced in circumstances
be does not therefore sink into a lower
grade he will take to some manual
labor or become the driver of a atell
wagen and retain his old connections
and considerations in society the
usual aristocracy of the towns who
generally speaking arc a very modern
ised class of people arc the govern
ment officials these laboring to main
tain a distinct existence and to keep
themselves as separate as possible from
the mass by their dress and habits in
the matter of education however there
is no distinction all are educated to
gether r and it not uncommonly happens
that at the distribution of prizes which
takes place periodically the child of
the peasant is preferred to one of the
exclusive class i myself was present
at such a distribution at which the
smartlydressed daughter of the burgo
master figured among a crowd of ser
vant girls and little lasses in red hose
the nobles live at inspruck the capi
tal of young tyrol or about the court
and belong to quite another sphere
gentry there are none the law of
primogeniture does not prevail here so
that the land is parcelled out among the
children of the soil and there are as
many proprietors as there arc people
the law enjoins and provides for the
education of every individual every
child must to school for so manr
yearsl believe till he is twelveand
must produce a certificate of having at
tained a certain proficiency before he
can enjoy any ot the privileges of a
denizen or even be permitted to enter
into the marriage state the whole
population of the country therefore can
read at the very least and they would
seem to bo a studious peope the
women take their books to church

the rambler new periodical

comfort of tho working classes a
large piece of land is bought in the
suburbs which is covered with suitable
buildings watered and drained from
central reservoirs all things land
