from parkers letter on slavery
effects of slavery on law and politics
continued
in some states it is a penal offense to 
teach slaves the elements of common
learning jly the recent code of vir
ginia any one who undertakes to teach
reading or w riting to slaves or even
free colored persons may be lined jroin
sylll to frllk the same is forbiilen
m georgia in alabama the punish
ment is a fine from fttso to in
mississippi imprisonment for one year
louisiana forbids the teaching of slaves
to read or w rite and prohibits any one
from using language in public discourse
or private conversation having a ten
dency to produce discontent uinoug the
free colored population the latter ol
fmice is punishable with imprisonment
or death at the discretion of the
court this antipathy to the educa
tion of the colored race extends even
lo the free states it is not unknown
in new england the state of ohio
established schools in  for the
white youth of every class and grade
without distinction
according to the alleged precept of
mahomet slaves are supposed to be
bound by feebler social and civil obli
gations than freemen and thus common
offences receive but half the punish
ment of the free such it is said is the
common law of mahometans in i ur
key and the east in virginia there
are six capital offences for a freeman
seventyone for a slave in mississip
pi there are thirtyeight offences for
which a slave must be punished with
jeathnot one of which is a capital
crime in a free white tnan in some
states the law is milder but in none
does the christian republican of anglo
suon descent imitate the humanity of
the mussulman and legally favor the
weaker part correcting slaves as the
children of the state
many offences for which a slave is
evorely punished are not wrongs by
nature sins against the universal and
divme law but only crimes by stat
ute thus in mississippi if a slave
he found firehuntiug he is punish
able w ith thirtynine lashes well laid
mi his bare back in the same state
if a slave he found out of the limits of
the town or off the plantation where
lie usually works any one may ap
trehend and punish him wiih whipping
iiu the bare back not exceeding twenty
lashes if he refuses to submit to the
fxmnination of any white person
such white person may apprehend and
moderately correct him and if he should
assault and strike sueh white person j
te may be lawfully killed louisiana
tas a similar law and also pun j
ishes any slave or free colored person
exercising the functions of a minister
rtf the gospel with thirtynine lashes
in virginia a slave or free colored per
son may be beaten with twenty lashes
for being found at any school for
caching reading and writing in south
carolina he is forbidden to wear any
iut the coarsest garments
tuc roman code allow ed etnancipa
ion tho customs of england and ger
nany favored it the christian church
iften favored and recommended it in
he roman empire the advance ofhu
nanity continually rendered it easy and
omnion a alave sick and derelict of
us master recovering claimed legally i
ns freedom for salvage of himself
jut in america the laws constantly
brow obstacles in its way in south
carolina georgia alabama and miss
ssippi no matt can emancipate any
lave except by the authority of thej
gislututcgranted by a special enact
the north star
mcnt conveying the power in georgi
a will setting free a slave is so fai
null and void and any person attempt
ing to execute it shall be fined looo
in kentucky missouri virginia ma
rviand it is less difficult but evei
there no man is allowed to emancipate
a slave to the prejudice of his creditors
or in virginia mississippi and ken
tucky to the lessening of his widowi
dower the common law favors thret
thingslife liberty and dower the
law of these three states sacrifices the
liberty of slaves to the dower of c
widow emancipation must be made
with most formal and technical minute
ness or the act is void does the mas
ter solemnly covenant with his slave t
emancipate him the contract can be
revoked at the masters will no ex
traordinary service of the slave except
in north carolina would be held a
good consideration and sufficient to
bind the bargain in some states as
maryland and virginia in factno
person under thirty nor over fiveand
forty can be emancipated
take all the slavelaws of the united
states together consider the race that
has made them their religion the po
litical ideas of their government that it
is in the nineteenth century after
christ and they form the most revolting
work of legislation to be found in the
annals of any pacific people the codes
of the barbarians who sat on the ruins
of the roman empirethe burgun
dians bavarians the ailcmanni with
the visgoths and their northern kin
have left enactments certainly more ter
rible in themselves rut the darkness
of that period shrouds all those bar
barian legislations in a general and
homogeneous gloom and here it is
the freest and most enlightened na
tion of the world who keeps ex
tends and intensifies the dreadful stat
utes which make men only things binds
and sells them as brute cattle in
 the council of london decreed
that hereafter no one shall presume
to carry on the nefarions business in
which hitherto men in england are
wont to be sold as brute beasts the
churches of america have no voice ol
rebukeno word of entreaty when
christian clergymen sell their brothers
in the market the flag of america and
the majesty of the law defends that
business which the anglosaxon
bishops seven hundred and fortyfive
years ago looked on as nefarious
jvtfarium acgotinm m de tocque
villc regarded the american slavecode
ijs legislation stained by unparalleled
atrocities legislation which forbids the
slaves to be taught to read and
write and which aims to sink them as
nearly as possible to the level of the
nines
the effect of slavery appears
general legislation of the south in
ivisdom and humanity it is far behind
he north it is there that laws are
most bloody punishments most bar
barous and vindictive that irregular
violence takes most often the place of
legal procedure that equity is least
ure even for the free whites them
selves one end of the slaves chain
is round the masters neck justice
says the proverb has feet of wool
but iron hands the slavedrivers
whip and the bowieknife of the ame
rican have a near relation
some of the southern states have
enacted remarkable laws to this effect
that when any free negro or person ol
color arrives in any vessel at a south
ern port lie shall be shut up in prison
until the departure of the vessel the
owner of the vessel paying the costs
by this law the free citizens of the free
states arc continually imprisoned in
south carolina and louisiana phis
is not only a violation of the constitu
tion of the united states but it is con
trary to the common customs of chris
tian nations a law without a parallel
in their codes a result which gouver
neur morris did not anticipate in
 when he made his satirical cal
culation of the value of the union to
the north
the iniquity of the code of the slave
states has passed into some enactments
of the general government of the union
in  a luw was made by congress
to this effect a fugitive slave escaping
into a free stateand consequently anv
man claimed to be suchmay he seized
by the master or his agent and carried
back to slavery without the intervention
of a trial by jury to determine whether
he man is a slavesimply by a trial
oefore any judge of the circuit or
jistrict courts of the united states re
dding or being within the state or be
fore any magistrate of the county city
or town corporate where such seizure
or arrest shall be made the proof
required that the man is a slave is by
oral testimony or affidavit of the
parties interested in the mans capture
this is a departure from the customs
of your fathers a departure which
the common law of england would
not justify at any time since the norman
conquest the trial by jury has been
regarded the groat safeguard of per
sonal freedom even in the dark ages
of english law it was the right of ev
ery man of every fugitive slave when
his person was iu peril had n slave
escaped with ins children and remain
ed some time a freeman slutu liber
did the master find the children ami
not the father he could not hold them
till he caught the father and by a jury
trial proved his claim in the united
states the laws do not favor liberty in
case of men born with african blood in
their veins
the power of the general govern
ment has been continually exercised
igainst this class of americans it
pursues them after they have taken
refuge with the indians it has sullied
he american name by vainly asking
the monarch of england to deliver up
right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of os and all we are brethren
i fugitive american litres who had fled
r j o canada and sought freedom under
her flag
j the federal government established
j slavery in the district of columbia in
i various territories and approved the
constitutions of eight new states which
aim to perpetuate the institution
j for a long time the house of repre
sentatives refused to receive ell peti
s tions memorials resolutions and propo
 sitions relating in aoy way or to any
extent whatever to the subject of sla
l very thus have the  unalienable
rights of man been trampled under
foot by the government of the most
powerful republic in the world but
i last summer in the city of washing
ton two women were sold as slaves
on account of the united states of
america by her marshal at public
auction
but let us look at the political effect
of slaveiy the existence of 
 slaves in the heart of the nation
with interests hostile to their masters
weaken the effective force of the nation
in time of war it was found to be so
in the revolution and in the late war
the slave states offer a most vulnera
ble point of attack let an enemy of
fer freedom to all the slaves who would
join the standardthey will and in
every negro a decided friend and the
south could not stand with millions of
foes scattered through all parts of her
territory have the slaves no arms
i there are firebrands on every hearth
during the revolution many thousands
escaped from south carolina alone
at the conclusion of the last war with
england she offered to pay 
 as the value of the slaves who in
a brief period had taken shelter be
neath her flag what if england had
armed them as soldiers to ravage the
country and burn the towns will a
future enemy be so reluctant the
feeling of the civilized world revolts at
our inhumanity tlte english for
reasons no longer existing took little
pains to avail themselves of the weapon
thus thrust in their hands in the time
of our troubles with france when war
was expected general washington had
serious apprehensions from this source
even in  during the french war
governor dinwiddie of virginia did
not dare venture to part with any
of our white men at any distance as we
must have a wathful eye over our negro
slaves
the revolutionary war showed the
respective military abilities of north
and south and their respective devo
tion to their countrys cause it is not
easy perhaps not possible to ascertain
the sums of money furnished by the
particular states for the purposes of
that war the number of men it is easy
to learn taking the census of 
as the standard the six slave states
had a free population of  or
including kentucky and tennessee
 let us suppose that du
ring the revolutionfrom  to 
the number was but twothirds as great
or  in those states there
were  slaves all the other
states had likewise slaves hut in new
england there were but  their in
fluence quite inconsiderable in military
affairs let us therefore compare the
number of men furnished for the war
by new england and the six slave
states in  the population of new
england was  but let us
suppose as before that from  to
 it was on an average but two
thirds as large or  during
the nine years of the revolutionary
war new england furnished for the
continental army  men while
the slave states with a free population
of  furnished but  men
for the continental army besides that
fhe slave states furnished  militia
men and new england 
let us compare a slave state and a
free one of about equal population
in  south carolina contained
 persons connecticut 
supposing the population during the
war only twothirds as great as in 
then south carolina contained 
and connecticut  persons
during the nine years of the war s
carolina sent  soldiers to the
continental army and connecticut 
d  in  massachusetts contained
 souls during the revolution
according to the above ratio 
while the six slave states with their
free population of  furnished
ut  soldiers for the continental
irmy and  militia men massa
chusetts atone sent  soldiers to
he continental army and  militia
rhus shoulder to shoulder massachu
setts and south carolina went through
he revolution and felt the great arm
f washington lean on them both for
tupport
by the constitution of the united
states in the apportionment of repre
lentatives to congress five slaves
count the same os three freemen this
s a provision unknown in former na
ional codes resting on a principle un
lemocratic detrimental to liberty and
titherto unheard of the principle of
dlowing parts of a nation political
ower in proportion to the number of
nen which they hold in bondage it
vould have astonished the heathen
jemocracry of athens long centuries
igo by this arrangement from 
o  he south gained seven repre
sentatives in the first congress from
 to  fourteen from  to
 nineteen from  to 
twentytwo from  to 
twentyfive by the la apportion
nent bill one representative is allowed
or  freemen or a proportionate
lumber of slaves by this arrange
nent in a house of only  members
he south gains  representatives on
iccount of her slavemore than 
f the whole
rochester n y friday april  
at present the north ku  rspre
sentativee for  souls or 
 free men one representative
for each  free men the south
has  representatives there are
within the slave states  tree
men they have one representative for
i each  free persons
in the next presidential election the
north will have  electoral voles
the south  the north baa an
electoral vote for each free men
the south one for each  t  part
of this difference is due to the fact that
in the south there are several small
states but twenty electoral votes are
given by the south on account of her
property in slaves bui if slaves are
merely property there is no reason why
southern negroes should be represent
ed in congress more than the spindles
of the north
but the south pays direct taxes for
her slaves in the same proportion a
direct tax has been resorted to only four
times since  by the general govern
ment viz in    and
 the whole amount assessed is
 of this about 
 was actually paid into the treasury
of the united states though part in
depreciated currency of that the
south paid for her slaves if the com
putation be correct only 
in  the surpttis revenue of the
union amounting to  
was distributed among the several
states in proportion to their electoral
votes by the census of  the
north had  free persons and
the south but  the free
states received   and
the slave states  
each free man of the north received
but   while each free man of the
south received   in that division
at that time the south had one hun
dred and twentysix electoral votes of
which twentyfive were on account of
her slave representation she there
fore received by that arrangement
  on account of the repre
sentation of her slaves jprom that il
we deduct the  paid by her
her as direct taxes on her slaves there
is left   as the bonus
which the south has received from the
treasury of the nation on account of the
representation of slavessouthern pro
perty represented in congress to
this we must add  which the
south received ih  from the sale of
public land on account of her slaves
the sum is   mr pinck
ney was right when he said the terms
were not bad for the south
slavery diveis the freeman from in
dustry from science from letters and
the elegant arts it has been said to
qualify him for politics as political
matters have been managed in the uni
ted states in this century the remark
seems justified by the facts elections
are not accidents of the eight presi
dents elected in the nineteenth century
six were born in the southchildren
of the slave states no northern mau
has ever twice been elected to the
highest office of the nation a similar
result appears in the appointment of
important officers by the president him
self from  to  one hundred
and seventy appointments were made of
ministers and charges to foreign pow
ers of these seventyeight were filled
from the north  from the south
of the seventyfour ministers plenipo
tentiary sent to europe before 
fortythree were from the slave states
there have been fifteen judges of the
supreme court from the north eigh
teen from the south the office of
attorney general has been four times
filled by northern men fourteen times
by men from the slave states out of
thirty congresses eleven only have
had a speaker from the north there
are significant facts and plainly show
the aptitude of southern men to manage
the political affairs of america these
are pilots for fair weather pilots also
only trusted in a storm
extract
from the speerh of gerrit smith delivered in
kyranue janutry   on land reform
happy thrice happy will it bewhen
land shall be no more bought and sold
w hen like salvation it shall be free
without money andwithout price and
when every person shall have his own
needed share neither more nor less of
his mother earth how much more
equal than now will be the circum
stances of men and the wealth of men
when the prophetically foretold happy
period shall have arrived and every
man shall sit under his own vine and
fig treeor in other words have his
own home to dwell in how much
more common and honorable then than
now will be manual toil how much
less generalthe system of wages w ith all
its attendant degradation and unhappy
bearings how much more general
then than now will be the spirit of
manly independence how much weak
ened the feign of vice how much j
strengthened the reign of virtue how j
much more common will be early mrj
riages when invited by a free soilthan
w hen delayed as now by the necessity
of earning money to pay for landj
then too there will be no slavery j
before the reducedtopractice theories
of landreform slavery would disap 
pear as surely and as speedily as tjae j
mists of morning before the rising ana j
apportion the soil equally among its
equal owners and where would there
be room for slavery you could not
work it in even edgewise often within
the last few years has ay heart ached
when i have heard abolitionists speak
contemptuously of landreform they
know not what it tof which they speak
contemptuously they know not that
it is one of the moat effective antiala
very measures most effective got
only to ovarthro present rfwery bat
to prevent and make impossible its
suscitation and re petition and then i
too bow difficult it will be to carry on
war ty indeed tbe ipirit of war shall
bo able to survive such a demonstration
of practical justice and such a recog
nition of the equality and brotherhood
of men as the success of landreform
will be i say bow difficult it will be
to carry on war for then few will be
without homes and you cannot draw
men from the substantial comforts of
home to the uohooored and poorlypaid
services of private soldiers war finds
its recruits among tbe homeless
among vagabonds then too what a
victory for the cause of temperance
for intemperance as well as war finds j
its recruits among tbe homeless
among vagabonds then too what a
victory for religion when millions
now robbed of homes by systems of
landmonopoly shall have homes to
thank god for and homes in which to
cultivate the homebred virtues and
the sweat and solid enjoyments of reli
gion
one thing more ere i close we all
love to perform the offices of everyday
charity we ail love to feed the hungry
and clothe the naked and none of us
can turn the destitute beggar empty
away nevertheless such charity
notwithstanding we cannot refrain from
indulging in it is not free from the most
pernicious effects it cures not and it
often aggravates the disease to which
it ministers its temporary relief is but
too generally followed by permanent in
jury how much better to provide the
poor with homes or to speak more
correctly to let them provide them
selves with homes upon their own god
given shares of this goodly green earth
than by robbing them of these shares
to keep them mendicants and to hold
them in dependence upon our charity
delivered from this dependence by
having as they would have had they
homesthe means of subsistence within
themselves they are no longer a burden
upon the community and no longer a
shame to themselves they are no
longer degraded either in the eyes of
others or in their own eyes the world
respects them they respect them
selves they are in circumstances to
be both useful and happy
deep and dependant poverty is a
great evil if only because it is so de
structive of independence of spirit i
think it is doctor franklin who says in
reference to the cringing servile spirit
which is so wont to characterize the
very poor man how difficult it is to
make an empty hag stand up straight
among the poorest of men there are
indeed some of the noblest specimens
of manhood for the very poor man
who amid the numerous and mighty
temptations to compromise his irme
pendence of spirit yet maintains it is
assuredly above all praise neverthe
less it must he admitted that the de
pendence created by deep poverty is
much in the way and very citen fatally
in the way of the maintenance of an
independent spirit how unhappy then
how worthy of all condemnation
are the laws arrangements usages
which have the effect to multiply the
deeply poor
let then the soil be freebe free
as god made it free this is the grand
remedy for poverty for this instead
of leaving the poor under the necessity
of being ever helped and of therefore
being ever poor enables them to help
themselves and to emerge from their
poverty
we are not doing our whole or even
our chief duty to the poor when we
tielp the poor even proud aristocracy
mill consent to help the poor nay it
abounds in selfcomplacent and gra
ious condescensions to the poor but
t will not let the poor come up by its
ride and help themselves our great
luty to the poor is to remove from their
vay the obstructions which false social
arrangements have thrown into it and
o suffer them to rise to that one level of
nanhood from which they have been so
rruelly thrust down and to welcome
hem into that brotherhood in which ev
ry human being is entitled to a place

became a furious radical and wrote
with all the hardihood of a pirate he

that not a vestige of royalty remained in their
land cheers and that among their very first
efforu iu behalf oliberty was the decree for

renewed cheering from the large audience
which filbd the spacious building
the follow ing resolutions were read to the
nueting by edmund q uuey of dedham
 reved hut the magnanimous con
sistency of the french people in using the
first inonmt of their own librty to extend
to every human being within the limn of the
reputdic the blessings winch they had just
gained for themselves ts without a parallel in
the history of the world and deserves the grate
ful admiration of ovary lover of justice and
humanity
wr rslved that we especially rejoice
in this set a it frees the name of kpubbe
from the odium which the incousisteucy of
awnca has heap d upon it aud wfsses the
world with the sight of a republic without a
slave and are glad that th humanity of a
gensroua pop bo stamjed with deserved
opprobrium the infamous dogma of human
slavery being the only comrstone of free trv
stipitions a id that european progress and

 resolved that the cold and reluct mat i
norioe taken of thia decree against slavery
hr the great body of the political journals of j
this country and its entire sopprewios by
some of them afford melancholly proof of the
decline of the spirit of freedom amoogat us
and of the fearful extent to which slavery
has infected every part of the land
 resolved that remembtring the noble
protest so frequently addressed by fayette to
clarkson l never would have drawn my
sword in the cause of america if i could have
conceived i was helping to found a govern

a fitting tribute to the memory of the most il
lustriously virtuous of frenchmen and ooe of
the earliest opponents of negro slavery that
wr a thank the rvench people for the silent re
buke their example gives to a nation which
has proved itihf so unworthy of the generous
confidence of fayetteand invoke the influ

national protest and remonstrance to aid ua in

similar demonstrations in new york city and
 detroit michigan but the crowded state of
the paper will not admit of their publication
i at length a brief selection from the proceed

been expressed they sjieak for themselves

whereas we are participants of the glory
as well as of the shame of our country it is
befitting and becoming in us to express oar
approval or disapprobation of whatever con

but his death like every other event of the j
kind furnishes admonitions to the living
which ought not to be lost by them we ate
again reminded of the vanity of human de

wisdom and allpowerful agency of god i

our antislavery tour
ye were reluctantly compelled by press
ing and unavoidable duties at home to forego
the pleasure of attending the meetings as
announced last week to be held at ithaca
they were however promptly atteuded by
our beloved friends charles lenox remond
and joseph c hathaway the report which
i they bring from that quarter is quite as cheer
ing as that brought from most quarters which
we have recently visited they spoke to
large and interested audiences and without
the least disturbance but a few years ago
no people were more ready to mob anti
slavery lecturers than those of ithaca we
were there about five years ago and being
 unable to get a house in which to speak
meetinghouses and halls being all closed
against us and were compelled if we spoke
at all to speak in the open air essaying to
do so we were attacke j by a mob and were
only protected from their bloody assaults by
j a heroic brother fugitive who interposed his
person between us and our moliocratic assail
 ams those days have now passed and the
people of ithaca are said to be as ready to
hear on the subject of slavery as the people
j of most other towns
thursday and friday th and thwe
held meetings in the congregational church
i at springport or union springs as the place
is sometimes called there are here many
friends and enough of them appeared at the
meeting to encourage tbe hope that that
society retain among them a few who have
not defiled their garments or forgotten the
early testimonies of their fathers against the
system of abominations for the overthrow of
which we had met to plead it was cheering
to see the plain coat and bonnet dotting the
whole congregation it reminded us of the
peace and antislavery meetings which we
have frequently addressed in great britain
and ireland in those countries friends lake
the lead in almost all benevolent and reforma
tory movements and have no fears of being
mixed up with the world in doing good but
here the case is far otherwise what there
is the rule is here the exception it will not
always be so already we see a change for
the better in the branches of litis venerable
society

the meeting the address of the former was
truly a noble effort the effect produced
was deep and thrilling he called attention
to the many disadvantages and embarrass
ments against which nominally free colored
people have to struggle in this country ex
posed to the meanness vulgarity and ab
surdity of what is commonly called prejudice
against color stated the true criterion by
which the oofored man should be estimated
to be that of merit and enududed with an
appeal which seemed to stir every soul and
warm every heart we have never heard

along in every statement argument and
rebuke to which he gave utterance and ml
with an impression which will be lasting and
useful we shall remember with high satis

stands on the kentucky side of the ohio not
a great ways from cincinnati and in a posi
tion where its inhabitants havo constantly
forced upon them the unpleasant comparison
between the prosperity of a slave and free j
population was recently held a meeting at
which the question of slavery was boldly dis
cussed the examiner tells us mr charles
m thurston declared that the old questions
of bank protection c were all of second
ary importance to that of slavery he spoke
of the evilsof slavery and exclaimed would i
to god we were rid of it one burst of
enthusiastic applause followed this expression
we feel says the examiner that the
meeting pronounced the doom of slavery
let no one say that our prospects are gloomv
the voice of the people is the voice of god
the speaker hoped that a clause emanci
pating the slaves would be inserted in the j
constitution applause followed the expres
sion of this hope not a oice in the meet
ing was raised in favor of slavery
rights of married women an act
securing to married women their separate

right of dower on her husbands death she
has no claim whatever to his property and
otherwise only to the difference between her

the question will be mooted whether he his j

your rapid and complete success in your new
career
it ia painful to have occasion to record ap
parent retrogression where all would natural
ly expect to witness advancement you were
somewhat acquainted with the condition of
i public sentiment on the antislavery question
in this region four years ago and may rccol
lect the good name then borne by ilarveys
burgh in warren county some years si nee
a proslavery acquaintance remarked to me
be wondered the almiglity did not sink har
veysburgh it was such an abolition hole
j that acquaintance has since greatly changed
and so has the village of which he spoke
you will have seen in the antislavery
bugle and cincinnati herald certain state
ments in relation to the dismissal from school
of a young lady in that place solely on ac
count of the stain upon the complexions of
her ancestry by some critical observers sup
posed to have been slightly imparted to ber
own v it gave occasion for some standing
high in that community as intelligent and
i moral persons to manifest the wickedness the
deep depravity they had covered up under a
fair profession these wexi remonstrated
with and entreated in vain a meeting was
called to consider the general subject of edu
cation and its bearings upon this particular
case the assemblage was addressed by the
i intrepid and eloquent samuel lewis with a
truthfulness to humanity and a power worthy
of himself and his high theme it was a
discourse soamevso unanswerable as to carry
with it both the intellect and the conscience
wherever these existed to be reached in all
who heard time passed the evil doers
and their abettors offering no aramls or
atonement the immediate victim sought her
home in highland county there to mourn
over blighted hopes and prospects the in
jured and proscribed tace of which she hat
thus been made the representative submitted
silently as usual to the additional indignity
and injury heaped upon them by professed
friends the pulpit resound again as here
tofore with empty declamations and ridicu
lous prayers the physician peddles abroad
his pills and potions the lawyer deals around
his pettifogging opinions the farmer draws
again his furrow to receive the setnl of hope
and promise the merchant vends his tape and
tea the mechanic whistles merrily to the
sound of hammer and saw and the mighty
march of human events urges onward as it
no deed of wrong and outrage had been com
i nutted no rights invaded no sensibilities
crushed no aspirations for advancement in
 knowledge extinguished by greedy and mere
cenary men upon the surface of society
all seems smooth and serene not a ripple
j discernible to indicate there has been a
disturbing event a wreck of hopes and hap
j pine but is all calm and quiet as it seeni
i i hopel believe not iu the breast of each
i of each of these oppressors dwells an accusing
spirit which renders the thought of margaret
campbell and her wrongs an uneasy one 
i despite all his eflbrts to the contrary he
 may try to lay the pi antotn by dwelling upon
j his own wrongs by the accusation of sdan
derous editorials and false rumors circu
lated against himself but from these appli
ances he gains no ease a guilty conscience
carves a memorial of itself upon the counte
nance of each so plainly that he who runs
may read tha members implicated may be
trumpeted as justification before a work as
guilty as themselves in humanity destroying
prejudices or venal worship of lucre but
these serve not to drown the still small voice
within tosilcnce that but one of two modes
is possiblea continual practice of the same
or guiltier deeds or repentance and repa
ration
but what docs the present calm portend as
existing beneath the surface with the other
class the abolitionists who have proved
themselves faithful and tree in vindication of
the rights of the oppressed and rebuke of
their oppressors do they give up the con
flict weaiy and in despair i trust not let
him do so who feels that in this contest be
has erred in principle in the depths of their
souls it is not lobe doubted burns a zeal
against tyranny and oppression stranger and
more enduring than before which awaits in
silence for time to ripen opportunity the more
effectually to disclose itself the seed is but
buried not destroyed as we hope and in due
season will be witnessed its gumiiuatkm and
justification
my dear friend who can measure the
length and breadth and depth of the unholy
prejudice against color of the american peo j
pie he only whose instruments can grasp the
tenuity of conscience and the alldevouring
appetite for wealth which characterizes them
not one of those who were audacious enough
to drive miss campbell from the srhooi dare
show manly courage sufficient to avow that he
had any objection so far as himself was con
cerned to her continuing each one was
only afraid some others whom he had heard
of would object now who is responsible
for the exlstirg state of things  some w ill
tell us the priests for they claim for them
selves power and opportunity to make public
sentiment what they wuh i hold them bound
fur a fell share they have in a great
measure the ears of the people and they
hare set times and daces wherein to teach
theca but perhaps they overrate their own
power sod capability
unfortunately by parhum they are a mar
ketabie commodity like tjie goods upon the
auction stand for them the highest bidder is
the buyer sod we are too keen traders to buy
what we do sot hke er to keep the article if
we make a blunder in the selection and aa
the people hare a choice in what shall be
preached to them of course they lake cam to
have a supply suitable to the demand it wifi
aot do then to lay the whole responsibility at
the door of the priest like the moat of

ets and people each for himself in his ow n
awe this ia done through compulsion a s
well blame the yankee for vending wooden

i am disposed to lay ihc burden on the

the hutchinsons
on the morning of the d of april the sun
shed its rays upon philadelphia and the neigh
borhood not the glorious sun in beaten
o which the poet writes not th sur
giving light and he it and vegetation to re
viving nature in early spring cot the sun
dispelling the mist and dampness and vapon
of night not the sun that shines bright anc
joyous m the deep azure probably thus sur
shone too but it is not to this sub that the
attention of the reader is a out to be directed
nor to a son having any similarly ireneficrn
results it is to a sun which instead o
light sheds darkness upon the worldthick
murky clammy dismal darkness dark
ness that might he felt a sun which give
no heat quickens no life hut chills and
numbs and freezes a sun which shines noi
in heaven but is of the earth earthy if n
have not even a lower origin a sun in
short which resembles the heavenh sun in
nothing but the name header it is the
daily sun of plujd ipha
tins dealer in darkness gives out on the
morning in question what he is pleased to call
a word of ad wee how amiable who
dikis not see rise up before him as the
writer the image of a lrencvolent old gentle
man with a bald head and a smile on his
ruddv fatherlv countenance how very kind
it is of ibis writ r in the daily sun to put
himself to so much trouble it is not only a
word of advice either the benevolent
old gentleman with the bald head is by far too
modest as these benevolent old gentlemen
always are instead of a word as he
humbly calls it in his selfdepieciating spirit
it is at least seven or eight hundred words
all words too that have a meaningwords
which americans can well understand all
this too for nothing unparalleled gener
osity howardlike philanthropy kind
benevolent om gentleman when thy days
come to a close will not many honorable men
follow thee to thy burial and carve a monu
mental marble for thee in the halls of thy
fathers and cap the clunax of thy inscrip
tion with lie gave advice gratis
this word of advice is a b autiful illus
tration of the very prevailing malady yclept
colorphobia li is such a precious nor
ccausuch a genuine specimen of cant and
rant and prejudice conglomerated into a so
truly original dish that the most illustrious
white d la cusiu may well tremble fur his
fame h is rich and rare and piquante pity
it is that it is intmtssiie to place the whole o
it before the readers of the north slur here
is a small piece as a sample
whave a serious charge to make against
the managers of the hutchinson family fur
not hiving announced in their handbills and
ajvertisemlit that no distinction of culm
would lie in ale in a knitting persons to thuii
concerts it is well known that a distincrioi
is made on all ordinary oe asioiis and thai
there are m uiy p irsons in the community v hr
would on no account knowingly place them
selves and their families in promiscuous asso
ciation with the colored race
kind old gentleman when you under
take to give advice you should not make a
charge it reminds one altogeth t too forcibly
of the old fishioiied mode of reforming a
criminal by hanging him it is decidedly of
irish extraction ilut benevolent tdd gentle
men are always rather eccentric in their
actions and must not be criticised too severely
according to the strict standard of etiquette
the hutchinson family w ill doubtless appre
ciate this writers kindly intentions notwith
standing bis rather rough mode of going
about to seek their benefit and will in future
contrive to make the poor unhappy mortals
who are suffering in body and mind from
the dreadful scourge of colorplwjia under
stand that they are not expect  to attend
the concerts the hutchinson know as
every one else knows that all diseases arc
more or less infectious perhaps they wil
buffer another word of advice and add t
all their future handbills and advertisements
a note to the effect that all who are afilictet
with the grievous and infectious malady o
colorphobia inasmuch as they value tin
health and happiness of their fellowcitizens
arc particularly requested not to attend tin
concerts they will thus prevent the infer
tion from spreading into other families tha
are now free from it it is just like thus
benevolent old gentlemen they are ulwayi
so thoughtful of the public welfare wlia
should we do without them
continuing his word of advice the write
says
the ilutchinsons need not be told at thi
day that the feeling against practical amal
gauiatiou is so strong with many persons tha
they would be very likely to resent in thi
most summary manner a trick by which they
and especially the female members of thei
families had been subject to an associattoi
wluch they abhor
ohthe monstrous cruelly of these hutch
iusons how inhuman it was thus as tin
compassionate old gentleman with the bait
bead says to entrap unsuspecting ladies am
gentlemen into a concertroom when thei
were laboring under such a desperate disor
der no wonder that lie was spiritmovei
to give a word of advice to the reprobate
who wore guilty of such wickedness wha
else could be anticipated from such un
timely exposure hut tits and hysterics am
perhaps worse evils  it would not be at al
surprising if the next arrival from phtladelphi
brings the intelligence that some of the poo
entrapped unsuspecting females and ex
quisites are mnv subject to a fit of temporary
insanity a voting lady not long since tol
the writer that the first time she saw a blacl
man she was well nigh thrown into convul
sums she thought h was the devil come v
lake lo r home a pretty cogent reason
c rtainlv fur going into convulsions posh
bly some of the entrapped were in
similar predicament they no doubt knev
that they had maqy sms unrepented of an
feared that their tunc was come wha
heart of stone u there that does not pity thus
unauapecung female members of families
are they not deserting of the deepest com
miseration  that even one of them shuli
have been subjected to the bunting uifani
and eternal shame of being in the same con
certroom with any of those horrid crca
tures is truly appalling kvital marlyrdou
can be compared to it  v hat refinement o
bar liar ism in ancient or modern times bean
any resemblance ur this fearful infliction
such suffering must tnciu an eternal reward
doubtless heaven mill be the portion of ibos
who have come through this fiery trial bui
what if there should be mach men and
j women there also and no nigger pew
oh horrible thought ob torture meufier
able where can theee poor uasuepeeting
t female member of families go will they
rather chooec to g the other road per hap
they will
i further on the daily sun aays
it is really ume that some one should tell
these people in a spirit of friendly candor
that they are not apostle and martyrs en
trusted u ith a mission to reform the world
but oidv a company of common songsingers
whose performances sound very pleasingly to
ihc great mass of icople ignorant of real
music and finding sn innocent gratification m
listening to melodious sound w hich they are
capable of understanding
kind good dear old gentleman and they
act vou to bell the cat perhaps you
know as much about music and care a much
about it as does your very respectable walk
ing staff perhaps you consider it your
iiuion to make yourself look foolish at
least once ayear and tliat onccaycar the
month of april a very appropriate lime
doubtless fur the general amusement of the
public will not somebody undeceive you
it is really painful to think that you shonld
continue to suffer under such a delusion
there is not the slightest necessity for it
pray dont do so any more every one is
perfectly satisfied of your benevolent inten
tions no one who knows anything about
you can for one moment entertain the slightest
doubt about them put it is really too much
to expect of you tliat you should be a how
ard a lutlur and a llaydn all in one if
you manage to be a howard and a luther
even on an infinitesimally small scale rest
you satisfied vou can still be a benevolent
old gentleman even if you do not know du
fiorn or rc from and have never learned
to distinguish between a flat a sharp and a
a natural there are many other things
about which you might give a word of ad
wee in your own kind fatherly manner
without making yourself so inexpressibly
ridiculous what in your estimation may
j be the difference between melodious sounds
and real music  most lexicographers give
melody as the meaning of the word mu
sic and music as the meaning of the
word melody and they are supposed
 by the generality of readers to bo convertible
terms the difference at all events must be
very triflipg and such as an old gentleman
should not pretend jo distinguish
this word of advice is after all a
very strange medley there is still another
feature in it which is altogether too interest
ing to be passed over it is this
i no colored person of right views would
feel flattered bv the servility of a set of public
mngeis who would condescend to take their
money and smg to them
poor old gentleman you must certainly
be ii your dotage if it be servility io take
tin colored persons money and give bun
in exchange that which he pays for what do
you call it to take the colored person
himself and give lim nothing some peo
pfe who are nut in their dotage call it the
foulest robbery and the sura of all villanics
w hat despicable servility it is to sing to
men and take their money it is so
to edit papers and sell them to colored per
sons to go to war and ask colored per
sons to pay the taxes necessary to carry it
on to establish a government and make
colored persons pay for its support
tbc benevolent old gentleman probably means
that colored persons ought not to pay for
any of these thingsthat they have paid
enough already perhaps he is right there
can be no doubt tliat the white americans
owe the colored race much but this is alto
gether a new and unexpected manifestation of
a stricken conscience colored persons
j you will at least understand henceforth
that this dear old soul will not take your
money you may have as many daily suns
as you like without paying a cent if you
think they are worth having hasten to
avail yourselves of your opportunity per
haps he may repent

able metropolis of my native country threw

freely extended to the stranger shall ever
cheei the various phases of my uncertain fu
ture most fully shall i always appreciate
their efforts to make my two months stay in
their midst a delightful one and so successful
were they therein that i took my leave of
new a t ork as though i were departing from
a second home filled writh regrets that i
could not render their abidingplace the termi
nation of my wanderings
not the least of these regrets was that i
could not remain yet a day longer in order
j that i might be able to attend a meeiiug of
colored citizens to testify their regard for the
character and sorrow for the lossof the sage
lof quincy truly that gteat and good man
who had spent more than half a century in
the service of his country whose head had
been whitened by the frosts of eighty winters
and who bad never suffered one moment of
his long life to aid in the advancement of op
pression merited well such a manifestation of
respect but he has gone to take
ilis chamber in the silent hails of death
and highly momentous is the question upon
i whose shoulders has his mantle fallen alas
in the insults heaped upon sister states in the
sanguinary w t ar waged against a sistei repub
lic and in the fierce efforts made to crush ev
ery measure that would tend to restrain sla
very within its present limits we may readily
deem we read that the service once so heart
fully rendered to the spirit of liberty exists
no longer sire in name and that new altars
have been erected lurid with strange fire and
officiated at by an order of priesthood which
the martyred heroes of the revolution would
disdain to recognize aa their offspring the
departed statesman was one of the very few
remaining links which connected the present
with the past the epoch in which the rhetoric
of the schools the polished acumen of the
legislator and the genius of diplomacy re
fined by the experience of age are all prosti
tuted in the service of oppression with that
one in which the honest country gentleman
left his ploughshare to rest in the furrow
and the artisan suffered the instruments of bu
craft to lie idle on the bench while they
hastened with hearts on fire wrfth patriotism
and bps burning with eloquence to pledge
their all in the sacred cause of freedom and
among the proudest honors that will always

trained lost in silent contemplation of those
magnificent headlands natures own bul j
warts throw n up to hurl back the invader
from this soil of freedom as the day drew
to its close the scene was truly a most beau
tiful one in the midst of these promitories
clad in tho bright verdure of this region of
perpetual summer appeared a vast pile of
limestone known by the name of the plat
form and which viewed from a distance as
sumes the appearance of an enornous for
tress from its mimic parapetsthanks to a
passing shower there floated apparently
like flaunting standards two gorgeous rain
bows throwing triumphal arches athwart the
course of our little vessel nor was the
scene less imposing in the opposite quarter of
the horizon
where like a routed king die sultan son
still struggled on the fiery verge of heaven
pouring upon the intervening expanse of wa
ters the last treasures of his fading glory un
til it flowed an ocean of mingled gold and
azure it was a spectacle thatt were pity

ashore in company w ith captain cutts the
gentlemanly master of the hayti and was
introduced to a number of gentlemen resident
in the place i found the wharves alive with
all the stir of a flourishing commerce and
my ears were almost deafened with the wild
and discordant babel produced by a thousand
tongues each rattling away fluently in the
french language or its corruptions the cre

of novelty the strange appearance of the j
housesthe manner and habits of the people
so different from those to whieh a resident of j
the united states has been accustomed that
they obtrude themselves on the instant upon
his attentionthe soldiers on guard at the i
port or loitering at the corners all bearing a
skin the color of which at home would sub

and a thousand other things told me plainly
that i was no longer in the land of my birth
of all that had grown precious to me by
the endearing tics of association yet i have j
found here several american friends and lbri

john van buren
this gentleman seems to possess a talent
somewhat rare among politicians 
of perspicuity of style in
i speaking hia hearers can scarcely
raise a doubt as to what be means he
apparently has not taste for throwing
dual into the eyes of his audience and
leaving them at the close of a speech
in delightful uncertainty respecting his
reel sentiments on the subject on which
he has harangued them in his speech
at the state convention of the rad
ical democracy held at utica n y
j he very clearly defines his position rela
i five to slavery in mexico his burning
words are a rebuke to many a cow
j ardly servile northerner who dares
not speak above a whisper respecting
the outrage which the slave power of
the nation is about to perpetrate but
we are sorry to hear him say that he
jj would give slavery where it exists the
security which the constitution has
given to it will he help to sustain
wrong and injustice from which hi
soul revolts because his fathers con
traded to do so will he seize the
fugitive and restore him to his pursuer j
will he fight against insurgent slaves
who have heard that resistance to
tyrants is obedience to god and who
feeling that death is preferable to bon
dage have rushed to a wild
effort to obtain liberty yet the con
stitution requires this of the north it
is in the bond will he consent to the
compact does he not feel in his
inmost soul that nak is more than
constitutions w f e arc sure that he
does his bold words concerning
resistance to the oppression of mexico j
clearly show that he thinks there is a
higher treason than treason to ones
country that the traitor to hum aw
i itv is the trator most accurst if he
will be true to his own better nature
j and walk in the light already revealed
to him weshall not much longer hear
from his lips such language respecting
constitutional securities to slavery
the following is an extract from the
speech alluded to
now i am free to sayformy self
and as i have already said to the inem
bers of this convention i say so with
the more freedom because it is of no j
kind of consequence what my action
may be that  have never entertained
but one opinion in regard to the traffic in
human flesh and buying and selling lire
bodies and that is an unqualified aver
sion and disgust for it and while i j
would give to those states where it ex j
ists the security which the constitu
tion has given to it the moment they step
an inch beyond this they attract the pub
lic attention and invite a discussion of
the evils of slavery they do so un
wisly and i regrit it but when they
do so the free white people of this
state will discuss and condemn it the
idea of marching in the th century i
with the immense power of this free
republic upon an enfeebled and half
civilzcd people and forcing upon them
the institution of slavery which they
rejebt and making it a fundamental
article of a treaty of peace that they j
shall be guarded against is so repug
nant to my sense of what is due not
merely to the superior magnitude and
strength of our own country but so
disgraceful to our free institutions and
so pregnant with evil to the people of
both countries that if i couid be satisfied
that this tear is prosecuted to plant hu
man slavery in mexico devoted though
i am to the glory honor welfare and
progress of these united states in every
breath of my life in every fibre of my
system so help me god i would join
the mexicans tomorrow in resisting
such oppression applause not
only this but i would pledge myself to
recruit among the freemen of this
state armies while the kingdom of

after lady hesters reception of

his name sit down and let us talk
we are already friends how
my lady said lamartine can you
honor so soon with the appellation of a
friend a man whose name and whose
life are entirely unknown to you you
know not m ho ain
it is true she replied i know
not what you are according to the
world nor what you have done while
you lived amongst mankind but i al
ready know what you are before god
do not take me for a madwoman as
the world often calls me but i cannot
resist the wish to open my heart to you
there is a science at present lost to
your europea science which cra

here but still exists unextinguised i

only seen you for a few minutes yet
you arc known to me as well as if i had
lived an age with you shall i reveal
you to yourself shall i predict your
destiny believe as you think
proper you are not the less one of
those men whom i expected whom
providence sends to me and w ho have
a great part to play in the drama which
is preparing you will soon return to
europe but it is all over with europe
prance alone has a great mission to
accomplish in which you will partici
pate i do not yet know how but i
can tell you tonight if you wish it
when i have consulted your stars i
do not know the names of all i at
present see moic than three i per
ceive four perhaps five and who
knows perhaps still more one of
them is certainly mercury which gives
clearness and color to intelligence and
speech you must be a poet i read
it in your eyes and in the upper part of
your countenance lower down you
are under the empire of wholly differ
ent and almost opposite stars there
is the power apparent of energy and
action return thanks to god
there are lew men born under more j
than one star few of whom that one
is fortune fewer still whose star even 
wbeu favorable is not counterbalanced
by the malignant influence of an oppo

and ail aid each other in your favor

never heard it before said she with

the following remarks to lad stan

hope that he wee an aristocrat like
herself i un neither an aristocrat
nor democrat i have lived long
enough to have foond on examining
both sides of the medal of human na

principles are as little aristocratic as
the reverse i anr a man and an ex

life and opinions of julius
melbourn

this book was on our table many
weeks since and would have been no
ticed long ago had it not been mislaid

born on the plantation of a major john
son some ten miles from the city of

or ill fortune educated enriched and
freed

spot of marias death preparatory to
their leaving to reside in england
the lund of freedom entering a
methodist chapel melbourn ses a

much like his dead wife that he fastens
his gaze on her and is overwhelmed
with conflicting emotions mighty
god he exclaims rushing to embrace

lady is his long lost wife who instead
of drowning herself as her master
thought had escaped and here some
twenty miles oft had been kindly
received into a quaker family as a
nun from cuba her dark complexion
her beauty and accomplishments and
the fact that mrs benson her ben
efactor had lost a sister in the west
indies completely furthering the
benevolent deception
the reunited and now happy family
sail from newyork for england in
october  the son goes into
business in london and the parents
are residing in warwick when the
story closes
the book contains  pages only
fiftynine of which are devoted to the
life the rest being reminiscenees and
sketches of thomas jefferson john
kandolph john quincy adams
william wirt etc together with
rambling political disquisitions
the late member of congress
whoever he may bewe imagine that
we could point out his residence not a
hundred miles from pompey hill has
written quite an interesting book not
withstanding he is so palpably ignorant
of artistic storytelling lie is ev
idently a man of warm sympathies in
telligence refinement and wide famil
iarity with our national politics up to
the present day but has not cultivated
the tact of special pleading so abso
lutely necessary to the storywriter who
would excel boston courier
the conscientious slate
some time ago i accidentally met at
the house of a farmer in a remote coun
try town a fugitive following the north
star he told me his story with great
simplicity and a heavy heart his
wife belonged to a lady who treated her
with great indulgence and to whom she
was strongly attached he was less
fortunate he belonged to a tavein
keeper who lived five miles from his
wiles residence an arbitrary capri
cious and brutal man the only time
he was allowed to visit his wife was on
sunday night after all the work of the
house and barn was completed he
would seldom leave before  oclock
and oftentimes it was ten or eleven be
fore he could get permission to start
he was required to return by daylight
on pain of a severe flogging some
times wearied with his long walk after
a week of excessive toil he would oven
sleep himself and not arrire at the ap
pointed time on sue t occasions his
master would tie him up by his thumbs
to a beam in the barn and beat him
most cruelly the white boys belong
ing to the family of course learned the
trick of violence they would curse and
swear at him without provocation and
often for some fancied disrespect
would hnri pitchforks or hummers at
him the poor fellow carried away
proofs of this part of his story for he
was covered wth scars
at last life grew such an intolerable
burden that be told his wife oa one of
bis visits to her that if ever one of
i those dreadful floggings occttnedacftio
bo had determinedito run away with
i aaojr teen ahe begged bin not to in
i dulge such on idem for it would kill
l her to be aeporated from him he told
her that he wwpld bear almost anything
rather than leave for he had rather
die than go away from her but
said he if he and his boys go on at
i the rate they have done lately  cao
not stand it he then began to build
castles in the air about the possibility
i of her following bine to the free states
and of their finding some little cabin
where they could live unmolested by
enemies she sobbed and wept be
seeching him not to talk about it for
what would her poor mistress do with
out her and she had always been such
a good mistress it would break her
heart to think of leaving her alone and
then they would sorely get caught and
that would he so dreadful
ah said william to me if i had
only had such a master aa she is a mis
tress i never would have come away
from my poor wife she was as good a
wife as a man ever had she enit all
my stockings and made all my clothes
this suit i bare on is of her weaving
every thread of it
 asked him if they had children
he answered with a good deal of fer
vor no i thank god there is none
to blame me that i brought them into
the world to be slaves vve had one
baby and we loved it but when it
died we praised god
after this conversation about running
away his wife enjoyed hn visits but lit
tle she would wake up a dozen times
in the night for fear he would oversleep
himself and get a whipping at last
the event so much dreaded occurred
he did oversleep himself and was se
verely punished his wife with many
tears wanted to know whether his re
solution had changed and for her sake
he resolved to bear on but soon after
cruel treatment for some slight cause
drove him to desperation and he se
cretly made arrangement for departure
he saw his wife once after his final reso
lution was taken but by a powerful
effort of selfcontrol was silent concern
ing his grievances and his plans she
little dreamed that she was seeing him
for the last time
oh dear said he howl did
want to tell her how my heart did
swell i thought it would burst
i would have told her all my plans
if i had been you said i perhaps
she would have agreed to follow you
oh no she would nothe replied
if she could have brought herself to
leave her mistress she would never get
the courage she was never ten miles
from home in her life aud w as afraid of
everything if i had bid her farewell
she would have cried till she made me
tell her all my plans they would i
have gone to her the first thing when
they missed me and she wuld either
have been obliged to let out all my se
crets or else to tell a lie she would
not betray me i know and i could not
hear to have her tell a lie for me
on the night of his departure poor
william had a dreadful struggle with
himself twice he turned back towards
his wifes abode and twice with blind
ing tears he retraced his steps at
last with forced bravery he hurried
on swallowing his grief
he had wit enough to travel further
south close hidden in woods and
swamp  during the daytime for he
wcll knew they would naturally seek
for him toward the north
it was enough to make any human 
heart ache to hear him mourn for his
wife i could not have been driven
away said he except by very had
treatment and now  sometimes wish
i had borne it all and worse rather
than have left nancy she was very
good to mealways good we both
belonged to the methodist church and
we took a deal of comfort praying to
gether she is praying for me now i
know but how can i manage ever to
see her again if my master was not
quite so bad i would go hack but that
would be dreadful we used to hope
that he would sell me he was offer
ed a thousand dollars for me once but 
he wouldnt take it
i saw william in one of the interior
towns of new york and i afterward i
heard of his arrival in canada

influence of nature
all men need sometimes to be alone
and to be quiet it is good for one to
ojen his eyes and heart to the in
fluences of the natural world in the
solitudes of nature mans voice is
silent only that divine voices may be
heard there it it is sometimes diffi
cult to do good actions it is also diffi
cult not to think good thoughts what
we think of is determined very much
by what obtrudes itself on the senses
on the wharf or the exchange with
the sights and sounds of business on
every side ones thoughts turn natur
ally into the channels in which flow the
thoughts of all around him in the
country what one sees and hears sug
gests entirely different meditations
the universal harmony stills his fretted j
passions all the objects which the j
eye rests on speak of infinite wisdom
and providential care the at mo 
sphere which he breathes is as healthy
for the soul as it is for the body he
goes out at eventide to meditate and
heaven and earth transfigured as their l
true glories are revealed he returns
feeling that he has been standing in
the temple of the most high
chlosoform is recommended as ex
cellent for scolding wives a husband
who has tried it says no family
should be without it 
tims time is the preacher
change is the tooe he harps on as he
hurries along change he shouts as
he lays his band on the mountain peak
and powders it to dust change he
thunders as be twists the hale oak up
by the roots change as be scatters
the thistledown to the wild change
he whispers as he turns the beaver of
the young man and points with n grin
to the tottering step of the aged j
change as he brushes the vermillion
from the cheek ofbesutyand change
he grumbles forth as be lays his band
on the shoulder of bio of broad chest
and iron nerve and points to the grave
change is his last word to his emissn
rice when he yds them forth on their
rounds to overturn and destroy
oats without nights and
nights without days
dr baird io bis lector at the

a stranger more forcibly if be visits

stockholm from gottenburgh 
miles distant in the morning and in
the afternoon went to see some friends

seemed as if the inhabitants had gone
away or were dead no signs of life

 o clock there is a great illumi
nation all night as the sun passes round
the earth towards the north pole and
the refraction of its rays is such that
you can sec to read at midnight dr
b read a letter in the forest near
stockholm at midnight without arti
ficial light there is a mountain at
the head of the gulf of bothnia where
on the st of june the sun docs not
go down at ailtravelers go up there
to see it a steamboat goes from
stockholm for the purpose of carrying
those who arc curious to witness the
phenomenon it only occurs one night
the sun goes down to the horizon you
can see the whole face of it and in five
minutes it begins to rise
at the north cape lat  deg the
sun does not go down for several
weeks in june it wouldbe about 
degrees above the horizon at midnight
the way the people there know it is
midnight they see the sun risethe
changes in those high latitudes from
summer to winter are so gacat that
we can have no conception of them at
all in the winter time the sun disap
pears and is not seen for six weeks
then it comes and shows its face
afterwards it remains for  or 
i minutes and then descends and finally
it does not set at all but makes almost
 a circle around the heavens d baird

to hired personswhat they considered
a day he could not say hut supposed
they worked by the hour and  hours
would be considered a days work
birds and animals take theiraccus
tomed rest at their usual hours the
doctor did not know how they learn the
time but they had and go to rest
whether the sun goes down or not
the hens take to the trees about  o
clock p m and stay there till the sun
is well up in the morning and the peo
ple get into the habit of late rising
too the first morning di b awoke
in stockholm he was surprised to see
the sun shining into his room he
looked at his watch and found it was
only  o clock but there were no
persons in the streets the people are
not in the habit of rising so soon the
swedes in the cities are not very in
dustrious owing probably to the
climate hartford times

situation can a man he placed where the
awful doubt is converted to a tremen

the bed of death w hose pulse beats
faintly and whose subsiding pain seems
i to announce the coming of release
he may linger for hours he may rc
i coverthe ray of hope beams and
those who love him share its brightness
his hours arc not numbered the
sinking mariner clings to the last fi qg
ment of his illfated ship and holds on
while nature gives him strength and as
he mounts the toppling wave strains
his anxious eyes in search of assist
ance a vessel may heave in sight
f lie may be drifted to some kindly shore
his fate is not decided
 the unhappy wretch who alone lives
i his last day hopeless and in unmitiga
ted misery is the sentenced convict on
the eve of execution he sees and heats
all that is passing round him with the i
terrible consciousness that it is for the
last time
he beholds the sun gleaming through
the bars of his cell iu ail his parting
brightness and knows he sees his gold
en rays for the last time he hears
the prison clock record the fleeting min
uteshow vastly fleeting to him
throughout the night each hour sounds

his wife his children his beloved
parents come to him he stands amidst j
his family in the full possession of his
bodily health and mental faculties he
clasps them to his heartthey go the j
door of his cell closes and shuts them
from his sight he has seen them for j
the last time 
he is summoned to the scaffoldthe
engine of death stands ready he feels
the pure air of heaven blow upon his
j facethe summer sun shines brightly
for the fast time i le sees the green
field and the trees and ten thousand
objects familiar to us all the cap is
drawn over his tearfraught eyesthe
 objects vanish never never to be seen
again by him he hears for the last 
 time the sacred word of god from hu
man lips in another moment the

breathes for the last time

this world of cares regular and certain
in every other case it is a mystery when

erection op a barricade
all down the streets groups of men
were thundering at the doors and c
mandiug arms and powder the doors
were opened ajar by the scared in
habitants who handed out some a gun
some a brace of pistols bayonetdirk 
ac one man threw a sheathed sword
from an upper window it fell clashing
on the pavementand was scrambled i
for with fierce merriment by the mob i
and  heard the quick strokes of several
heavy crowbars ringing on the stones
and in a few minutes a barricade began
to grow as if by magic out of the
groand it was piled up with stones
tubs trucks cart wheels scaffolding
boardseverything that came to hand
under the direction of a man with a
red cap on his head and a torch in his
hand who directed the proceedings 
with perfect mretd and whoa the
others seemed to regard with deference
ms architect py this time the work
had grown breast ugh the stones had
to he fetched from some fifteen or twen
ty feet off and then the leader ranged
his men in lines who passed the stones
from hand to hand as buckets are pass
ed at a fire all this took place within
a stones throw of a detachment of w
fanlry who looked on in silence and
offered no opposition here as els
where the gamins performed prodigies
of activity dragging great stones and
tubs twice their own weight and
swarming over each other in their stum
bling haste it wns a strange sight to
see these midnight workmen running to
and fro between the torchlight and the
darkness and their uncouth building
lifting its rough battlements higher and
higherhiding first the legs ot the men
then their chests and finally their
heads when it was finished the
leader stuck a red flag on the top ai d
then stood contemplating the immense
heap with a grim smile i went up to
hiiu and remarked that it was pretty
i strong ah he returned with a
sort of artistic pride voila la bnrri
