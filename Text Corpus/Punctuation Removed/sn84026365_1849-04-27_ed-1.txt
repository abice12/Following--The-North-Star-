man has no natural rights
the svilheri presbyterian review

presbyterian orthodoxy a late nuni

we have searched in vain for any
authority fr mans natural rights ii
he had anv they existed before the i
fall that is adam and eve may j
have hid some rights which gd gave
them and which modern philosophy in
its pretended reverence for the name oi
go  prefers to call natural rights j
we can i magine they had the right to
eat of the fruit of the trees of the gar
den they were restricted even in this
by the prohibition of one as far as we
can know without positive assertion
their liberty of act i m was confined to
the garden these were not inalien
able rights however for they forfeited
them a id life with tno first act of disj
obedience had they alter this any
rights we cannot imagine them
they were condemned beings they j
could have no rights by christs gtij
us king these are the only rights
man can have as an independent isolaj
ted being if we choose to consider
him in this impossible position in which j
so many theorists have placed him if
he had no rights he could suffer no
wrongs rights and wrongs ars there
fore necessarily the creatures of society j
such as man would establish himself
in his gregarious state they are in
this state both artificial and voluntary
though man has no rights as thus
considered undoubtedly he has the
power by mutual and common consent
to establish in society such arbitrary
rules of right and wrong as bis ne

slavery not a moral evil
so at least affirmed xr atkinson
ofva in a recent speech in the natio
nal house of representatives listen
to him
but the honorable gentleman from
new york in bis second proposition
affirms that slavery is a great politi
cal social and inoral evil in direct
comlict with the fundamental principles
of this government opposed to its
growth prosperity and future welfare
let us look for a moment at this branch
of the subject  presume the gentle
man was never a slaveholderhas
never been much if at all in the slave
slates and in his candor ac
kn iwledge mat practically he knows
nothing of the workings of that instituj
tioa upon the moral social or political
condition of the society where it exists
i ask the honorable gentleman and
those who think with h in to go with
me into the families of the south
where you find black slaves but no
tekile slaves want do you scc a
farmer the owner of five ten twenty
or may be a hundred negro slaves
they are well fed weli clothed when
in good health they are emdoyed
chiefly in agriculture not confined toi
the hot rooms of a northern inanufac
lory but breal bug a healthy salubri
ous atmosphere not compelled to work
at inclement seasons and when the
sun sets in the west to cl e the dav
you will sec the happy cheerful negro
retire to his comfortable house with a
light heart partake of his nights meal
aud if he has a wife or children in the
family of his master or his neighbor he
spends the cheerful eve with them if
he is sick ho is not thrust from his
master denied the comm m comforts of
life and submitted like some poor
wretch and pauper to suffer with ail
the north star
the ills to which man is subject but he
jis supplied with a physician nourish
i rnent and attendance and when he
recovers from a bed of sickness he has
no bills to payno home no employ
ment to seek
sir i wish the gentleman could visit
tny native slate that proud old com
raonwealth god bless herenjoy the
hospitality of her citizensgo to their
i places of worship and see the well
dressed negroes marching opto the altar
to pay their devotions to the living
god to see the mistress and her child
ren reading to their meniaj the bible
the book oj life and teaching the young
blacks their catechism anmsponsbito
i to their creator think you sir you
 or the honorable member from the em
pire state would find in all this a social
i and moral evil no sir you gentle
men who have had no experience in the
matter know nothing of our domestic
servitude you can no more see the
truth respecting it than a blind mao
can distinguish colers or admire the
beauties of the rainbow our slaves
are instructed in religious exercises
and in many instances houses are erec
ted on the farms for public worship
j and ministers of the gospel paid by

j slavery such as that i have described
and which i know to exist be a moral

west india emancipation
the prolavery journals of this
country particularly those of the south
have persisted in declaring that the
british west india islands were ruined
by emancipation so confidently has
this declaration been iterated arid re
iterated that some honest friends of
freedom not having at hand the means
of ascertaining the truth have been
deceived the perplexity attending
this subject has arisen from the fact
that in estimating the condition of the
islands men have looked at them sole
ly from a commercial point of view
finding that the exports of sugar have
greatly diminished sinee the abolition
of slavery they jump at once to the
conclusion that freedom works badly
as if the manufacture of sugar were
the one thing needfulthe grand
thermometer by which to measure the
prosperity and happiness of a com
munity the fact thntod people j
once driven by the lash oncef bought
and sold like cattle are gradually ac
quiring property in the soil and secur
ing for themselves comfortable homes
and the means of education passses
for nothing enough for the apologists
of the peculiar institution that the
white planters who under slavery
gre w rich on unpaid toil have been
called to sacrifice some of their ill
gotten wealth and their exclusive privi
leges
the new york evening post pub
lishes a letter from cuba from which
we copy the fallowing important tes
timony the editor says that the
writer is a gentleman on whose state
ments of facts implicit reliance may be
placed practical christian
i was present a few days ago at a
conversation between tw r o large sugar
planters and slaveholders of this island
one of whom was relating to the other
the substance of some communications
recently received by him from a friend
of his in jamaica this gentleman
pronounced wholly untrue the common
impression that the emancipation was a
disastrous measure and fatal to the
proprietors its first effects has indeed
been such but chiefly through the
fault of the planters themselves and
the wasteful and bad methods of man
agement which were incident to the
system of slave labor and which re
in lined after the emancipation of the
slaves but now it was all working out
to his entire satisfaction the inability
to procure the amount of labor re
quired for the culture and manufacture
ofthe sugar which processes you know
are united in the same hands the plant
er employing extensive and costly ma
chinery to manufacture his sugar on
the spot where he grows his cane had
forced them to the adoption of labor
saving improvements and economies
and with the aid of these all the labor
needed could be obtained from the
negroes for moderate wages better in
quality and cheaper in expense to the
planter than under the old system of
slavery in particular he stated that
he had recently introduced on his
estates certain improvements by means
of which the sugar boiling process was
performed within twelve hours of the
day instead of occupying the whole
twentyfour as formerly and as still
practiced elsewhere and that he was
now able to accomplish as much within
the twelve hours as before within the
twentyfour he was able to have as
much labor as he wanted at a shilling
a day costing him much less than the
expense formerly of maintaining the
requisite force of slaves
to appreciate this let me inform
you that on the cuban estates best
and most humanely managed the ne
groes work eighteen hours out of twen
tyfour during the crop season or
about half the year and not much less
than that during the rest of the year
here too is a paragraph from the
kingston jamaica journal which
shows how emancipation is working in
that island
the altered relationship between
employer and laborer has brought
about a change the laboring popu
lation are now possessed of the privi
lege of keeping cattle and all kinds of
animals their industry excels the
most ardent applications la many

special modes their industry is power

mr clay as alf abolitionist
popularity of henry clay as napol

name now one being the napoleon of
peace another of finance and another
of magnetic telegraphing we may call
him the napoleon of defeat he has
achieved more signal unsuccesses than
any other tnan in the country his
popularity lias never struck down any
deep root into the heart of the people
old hickory who put a great deal of
straightforward sense into very crooked
spelling who hanged the bank as he
had hanged ambrister in florida who
bullied france who dragooned south
carolina and swore by the eternal now
and then had a far stronger hold upon
the masses because he reflected them
more truly but clay somehow con
i jured up an enthus asm into merchats
and cottonspinners he found and had
a way to get on fire the hearts of
banks and brokers boards though
a slaveholder uttering sentiments which
would have authorised his own chattels
to cut his threat he was the idol of
of those whose enthusiasm for freedom
is multiplied by the square of the dis
tance at which the struggle fur it takes
place though not immaculate in pri
vate character lie attracted to himself
the support of the religious classes
bible tract missionary and magda
len societies were well nigh unanimous
for him washington was the jerusa
lem and he was the godfrey of a new
crusade was not all this because he
was the genius of compromises of
middle courses of plfkving neither hot
nor cold in shoct of the american sys
tem whatever the cause the loyalty
to him has no parallel except in the
house of stuart in this view it be
comes poetical as a forlorn hope as
devotion to disinterested defeat it has
gained here and there a recruit from
a different order of minds avhittier
addressed to him the mot p tical ot
modern political verses and even now
as hogg wrote jacobite songs after
the last of the stuarts had for years
been laid in his mockery tomb at rome
greeley turns sadly away from the solid
rough and ready pudding to sup full
of the east wind of long ago hopeless
hopes and to compose cold dithyram
bics to the patriarch sitting over his
wine at the st charles hotel
the whigs have at last grown wea
ry of the attempt to make bricks with
out straw out of their clay the
wreck of the great western politician
lies a weatherbeaten beacon upon the
shoals of compromise ships of larger
rate and stouter timber are thumping
there which might be got off by back
ing the sails and throwing overboard
a little constitutional ballast which
among other disadvantages has the
prime one of shifting
mr clay has been the most unpolitic
of politicians he has made at best
only coasting voyages hugging the
shore closely all the while he has
never struck out into the open deep oi
great principle for his navigation is
not by compass or by the eternal stars
but like that of other fishermen who
venture in their own private dories by
certain landmarks on the shore such
for example as the white house a
fog leaves hirn bewildered with a pair
of arms and oars and his good or bad
luck as it may happen
mr clay has in his time split as
many hairs as another and as alex
ander ordered a bushel of peas to the
dexterous pea shooter the whig par
ty in giving their will othe wisp leader
the mitten should have been careful
that it was a hair one his philan
thropy embraced all races bat em
praced the african with a difference
that is with a handcuff he was a
republican of the sternest pattern but
who could conceive of a republican of
the sternest pattern blacking his owii
boots indeed we think it would be
hard to prove that cincinnatus the fa
vorite sample of that sort ever did any
thing of the kind he was willing to
allow that slavery was a moral and pv
litical evil to both master and slave
but were not his chattels fat and sleek
he opposed the annexation of tex
as but thenhe was in favor of it
he was torn by coflicting emotions
northwardly he was anti southwardly
he was pro he was opposed to the
mexican war but would have relished
slaughtering his private mexican in a
humble way on the question of the
wilmot proviso we suppose he would
be against the extension of slavery in
fo new territory but he would be in
favor of allowing southern gentlemen
to emigrate thither with their flocks and
herds in reviewing his political life
what great principle do we find that he
was ever capable of appreciating one
and only onethat henry clay of ken
tucky ought to be the next president ol
these united states but unfortunately
ho has always had a fancy that the
presidential chair was situated some
where between two stools and has ac
cordingly several times seated him sell
with an uncomfortable rapidity on the
fl kir
this mistake if reckoning the locality
of the desired object mislod others
it left gen case lately with his heeli
in the air and yet gen taylor found
rochester n y friday april  
it io that very position and succeeded
in sitting down in it
we have said that the name of mr
clay comes up to the mind associated
with the advancement of no great prin
ciples of no interest that has bearings
more general than a locality or a class
it is true that he was an an advocate ot
emancipation in kentucky half a cen
tury ago and be tells us in his recent
letter that his nfnnions have remained
unchanged ever since that fifty year
have wrought no advancement or ripen
ing of his ideas on this subject does
not tend to raise him in onr minds as a
statesman but in truth his views ot
slavery have never beenrtppse of a
statesman ftor of a phffikathroptst
statesmanlike they could not be for
tiiey were limited by the supposed in
terests of a single class and they have
received no forward impulse and no
expansion during the period of more
than au entire generation which has
accomplished more thau any other in
the propagation of social and humani
tary science truly philanthropic they
could not he for they were smothered
by the pressure of a merely physical
majority
the medical history of the human
mind exhibits many instances of suffi
ciently ludicrous hallucinations men
have iancied themselves teapots junk
bottles and what not lord timothy
dexter had a penchant for considering
himself dead and we have known those
who took it for granted that they were
alive with as little substantial founda
tion in fact but we have never met
with any vagary of mental assumption
more preposterous than that mr clay i
should suppose himself an abolitionist j
his letter reminds one of governor
panzas dinner on the island of barta
ria the preparations for the mea
seem satisfactory enough and we
sit down expecting a substantial repast
but one by one the dishes are whisked
away from us and we are finally left
to make such arrangement with our im
portunate appetites as the assets left
to us in the shape of knife fork and
napkin will admit of
we have no complaint to make of
the three or four introductory para
graphs mr clay treats all the non
sense about the benefits of slavery con
temptuously enough but he immedi
ately proceeds to consider the question
with sole reference to the presumed
advantage of the white race ho takes
theacase out of the court of conscience
where alone it can be decided abso
lutely and without appeal and putsit
at the mercy of the nevsreading ttitga
tion of political economy if there be
no moral wrong in the robbery of one
half of the community by the other half
the problem of the advantages of such
a system would meet with a very dif
ferent solution from each moiety res
pectively but if the system be wick
ed and unprofitable because that is one
necessary condition of wickedness the
chances oftprolonged debate are great
ly lessened
even after taking it for granted that
emancipation is for the interest of ken
tucky mr clay humbly concludes by
saying that if the majority decide
against him he shall submit the ma
jority of the people of the united states
has several times decided against him
and yet he has shown no bashful reluc
tance to being again a candidate
pick your flint and try again was
his motto a few years ago is a ques
tion which concerns an entire race to
be given up more readily than the
shadow ol a dream of a chance for the
presidency if the majority be thus
absolute in deciding what things are
right and what wrong what office
would insure the throats of the masters
in any states where the slaves become
numerically superior
the truth is that mr clays letter is
disgraceful to the community in which
it was written we admit that delib
eration should characterise the move
ments of states and such a deliber
ation will necessarily without any pre
caution of ours characterise the move
ment of large masses of men liviog
under a long established social system
i provided they are begun early euough
and are made in accordance with the
spirit of the age for example if the
slaves of kentucky were liberated to
morrow and relieved from every polit
ical disability the question of their po
sition in the social order would settle
itself by a slow and gradual operation
of natural causes a social wrong
based originally upon brute force and
perpetuated by it may be reached and
remedied by legislation and the sooner
the better why wait for the rust to
eat handcuffs asunder when there is a
bey ready to unlock them we con
cede to mr clay that deliberation
should characterise statesmen no less
than states the rudder which deter
mines the intellectual or ethical ad
vancement of any age may be behind h
as in a vessel but the steersman st
the wheel is in front tod with a clear
outlook forward mr clays notion
of the duty of the man st the helm
seems to be that he should be keeping
his balance astride of an empty cask
out of sight in the rear of the ship
we shall not trouble ourselves with
an analysis of a document which all our
readerswill probably read for them

political sanctimony
no form of cant is more common
than the affectation of reverence to
ward the popular forms o religion by
political editors and officeseekers as
investment of capital the recent illustr
tions of this hollow sanctimony among
proslavery presses and servile dough
faces of the north are peculiarly rich
and instructivethese men have the
highest regard for the sacredness of
the sabbath the holy sabbath and
if mr palfrey writes a letter or mr
giddings sits inmt place in congress
on sunday morning as a service to
the holy cause of liberty they are
horrified at the profanity of the aboli
tionists and free soil men taking
care to forget the date of mr win
throps reply to mr palfrey and that
every other member of congress is ex
posed to the same censure with mr
giddings except that many of them
were using the holy time in the ser
vice of slavery which he was employ
ing for freedom generals taylor
and scott may kill mexicans by the j
thousands and blow up churches with
their congregations on sunday armies
may march or the new president may
travel on sunday and the solemn quiet
may be broken with the roar ofoannon
and shouts of the multitude at his re
ception with no shock to this sensitive
piety but a word spoken or deed done
for humanity on that day is greivous
sacrilege as a class of long facsl
canters we quote the following from the
new bedford mercury a zealous tay
lor paper
the desecration of the sabbath by
giddings and root free soil leaders
of the house calls down the severest
censure on all hands these men de
serve to be pilloried for turning the
house of representatives into a bear
garden during the session of congress
but especially should they be execrated
for setting such a sinful example to the
youth of our country as a fist fight on a
sabbath morning
not only is no censure intimated a
gains foote and meade and other
southern bullies who were to blatne in
those disgraceful scenes but either
through malignity or unpardonable ig
norance the responsibility is all placed
on the heads of men whose only gulit
as our readers know consisted in bear
ing patiently their insults and threats
and blows
if the men are to be execrated
who set sinful examples to the youth
of our country there are other and
in some instances loftier heads on
which anathemas will fall the slave
holding warrior whom mercury helped
to lift to highest power would recieve
a shower ofneither honors nor bless
ings and he would hardly thank that
editor for his doom while the fate ot
those who exalt him as the representa
tive of the two giant crimes of the na
tion and age would be far from envi
able we suggest to the mercury
that a love of self and regard of his
party leaders should make him cauti
ous of imprecating curses on men who
set sinful examples to the youth of the
country like midas bis prayer
would bring retribution upon himself

the wrongs of slavery
slavery is a wrong to the owner be
cause it places upon him in addition to
to his own moral responsibility the re
sponsibility which belongs to others
in becoming the owner of a human
being one takes that being mind and
oul as well as body into his own care
his will is substituted for that of tbe
being owned to his commands in
stead of tbe decrees of conscience the
slave must submit he judges between
the right and tbe wrong in fact obe
dience to him is tbe slaves great rule
of right and disobedience the sum of
wrong he comes directly between
the slave and tbe slaves god now
where is the moral accountability of the
slave tbe accountability is not hjs
for be is not his own yet the accoun
tability must be somewhere if lb
slave is ignoraot degraded and vicious
some one must be responsible for hi
ignorance degradation and vice and
upon whom does this responsibility de
volve upon whom can it devolve ex
cept upon tbe master in becoming
tbe owner of a slave a man assumes
tbe moral accountability of tbe slave
an undesirable and fearful assumption
it seems to os we know not bow
others may feel dut for ourselves mi
load of our own responsibility is quite
as much as we like to bear we
should regret exceedingly to answer for
others sins finding it sufficiently hard
u answer for not own
slavery is a wrong to the children
j of tbe owner
i slaves as a class are ignorant and
degraded incapable of exerting a pun
moral or intellectual influence over th
youngyet to them the care ot tb
young is in a great measure confided
during tbe period when the most
lasting impressions are made and
when it is of infinite importance tbai
right impressions be made the young
are entrusted to those who are
far too often morally incapable ot
making a right impression upon heart
or mind is not this a wrong is it
not an actual wrong are there not
manv men and women in our midst who
tell us that it has taken months and
years to remove the impressions made
upon them in their susceptible years
impressions which have long rendered
them the victims of superstitious fears j
of which even when suffering they i
have been utterly ashamed
slavery impairs the independence of
the young children accustomed to being
waited on served become dependant
upon those who serve them they in
truth become the slaves of their slaves
instead of relying solely on their own
energy and activity and doing promptly
themselves what they wish to have done
they must put in requisition the services
of one or more attendants thus their
own powers lie dormant and useless
hence many grow up to manhood and 
womanhood helpless and utterly desti
tute of all power of selfsupport and self
dependence hence also many grow
up with a contempt for labor which ren
ders them mere drones in the social hive
such is the legitimate influence of sla
very upon the young though that influ
ence is often counteracted by the wis
dom and fidelity of parents who seeing
the tendency earnestly guard against
it
slavery sometimes proves a deadlier
wrong to the children ot slaveholders
all of us who have lived in the midst
sf slavery have known too many in
stances instances written in bloods
dark lines on memorys page of deeds ofj
violence done in moments of passion by
men who in childhoods hours were
wont freely to vent their anger upon the
slavechildren around them and whoi
thus grew to manhood with passions j
unchecked and ungoverned utterly des
titute of selfcontrol and utterly unfit j
for temptations trying hour could all j
the dark deeds which owe their exis
tence to this fearful system bo written
in their own dark lines a volume would j
be produced repulsive indeed to the 
eye and painful to the heart but a i
most eloquent protest against slavery j
a a fatal foe to the young
slavery is a wrong to thr v
denies him the right of libei ty that
right dear to the humblest being with
out whici the palace of luxury is a
prison with which povertys lowly cot
becomes the abode of peace and hap
piness it denies him the sacredness
of marriage when the slave pronoun
ces the solemn vow of affection he
knows that at any moment tho com
mand may come for him to break the
vow and bid farewell to the companion
chosen as his lifefriend for him there
is no marriage for him no law sanc
tions the marriage rite and no law
frowns upon the forcible sundering of
the marriage tie at any moment
when caprice may dictate or avarico
tempt the slavehusband and the slave
wife may be torn asunder forever
slavery denies the sacredness of
home he has no spot on earth which
he may call his own no asylum of his
own where the intruder may never
come wife and children home and
heart are all at the mercy of others
we speak now of the system of slavery
that system as we all know in many
very man instances through the hu
manity and kindness of masters loses
these repulsive features hundreds of
families are there in kentucky in
which the tenderest care is exercised i
over the slave in which his feelings as
a husband and a father are sacredly re
garded still however many such in
stances of kindly affection there may j
be the essential nature of the system
remains the same in theory if not in j
practice the slave is denied the inalien
able rights which we have mentioned
and other rights as dear and sacred
are denied him he is denied the right
of intelligence in the states of the
union the endeavor to impart a know
ledge to a slave stamps the offender as
a felon and exposes him by law to a
felons fate thank heaven no such
relic of barbarism disgraces the sta
tutes of kentucky but the existence of
such a law in the states where the
slaveinterest preponderates over ah
other interests proves the essential
character of the system and demon
strates bow terrible a wrong slavery is
to the slave
such is slavery a wrong to the mas
ter to the masters children and to the
slave it is a wrong to the whole com
munity a wrong to republicanism a
wrong to religion tho tree is corrupt
and must produce corrupt fruitsome
beautiful vines of affection may be en
twined around its trunk but they can
never cover its rottenness some fair
iruit may appear on its branches but

noi without regret and will now apeak
though what i say must be said hastily and
imperfectly the dum and confusion of
noisy ec york is rot the place i would
select from which to write though i sup
pose i might soon become accustomed to it
and come to feel a much at home here as in
my editorial chair in rochester i have now
been here eight days earnestly endeavoring to
promote the antislavery cause and the cir
culation of the north star among the colored
people of this city and iciniiy with such
an object and among such a people it may
be supposed that i have had pleasant breexes
and smooth sailing but such is not the case
colored people like other people may be
said to care far less about the antislavety
cause than they do about things of far less
importance patty spirit and sectarian big
otry arc not more universal and bitter among
white than among colored people they
are not less active in sundering the bonds ol
of philanthropy and blasting the generous im
pulses of ftatcrnal feeling among one class
than among the other in these things white
and colored people stand upon the same iria
lional and uncharitable footing and the
remedy for the evil must be applied alike in
both r ises  was made to feel this w hen 
applied for ihe use of zion church a large
building owned bv acoloied methodist con
gregation in this city and was informed that
the only terms upon which the trustees would
alnw it to be opened tor antislavery meetings
was the payment of thirteen dollars per even
ing such an answer from the tiustees of a
white church would not have surprised though
it might have grieved me hut coming from
a church owned and worshipped in by colored
persons many of whom have themselves been
slave and ai this moment have friends re

l during all the horrors inflicted by that god
defying and tnanimbruting system it cut
me to the heart os mean m
blooded unnatural and made me hang tny
head and blush to think myself associated with
such a people at this time  know of no
better way of gutting the subject of slavery
before my fiends and the colored people gen
erally than by submitting to these humiliating
terms and though  barely had in my purse
the sum requiredl pledged myself to pay it
but that nty soul is fired with an overwhelm
ing sen of the foul and ruinous w rongs ol
my people and that i chciish a living faith
in the cause of truth and righteousness 
should have turned away with emotions of dia
i gust and despair
 how strange it is that even colored men
i themselves under the ban of proscription and
oppression can adopt the detestable airs ol
the very men who sic oppressing them in
j their blindness they would throw open their
church doors freeof cost to a white minister
who might come among them to plead the
 cause of the heathen in the isles of the paci
fic while they would exclude a colored man
or make him pay thirteen dollars who de
sired the use of the same house to plead for
the freedom of our intbruled brethren in
i bonds like their white oppresses they
place sacrifice above mercy and getting re
l ligion above doing the will ol god to
them methodism ia dearer than abolition
j ism and while the former is allowed m the
i church the latter is charged thirteen dollars
i warn the trustees of zion thurch that they
are adoptiug the contemptible and disgraceful
i aim of their white oppressors and are there
by sealing theii own degradation i do not
complain that the trustees of this church
i exact a sufficient sum to defray the expenct
of opening and lighting the house i eona

it may be thought that  am making too
much of this mailer and am too severe upov
the men of that church my apology is that
the course pursued has been long continued
to the injury and degradation of our people
and that ills time the evil was exposed the

remarks that ray visit to this city has been
mainly unpleasant or unsatisfactory for the
fact is far otherwise on my arrival i was
cordially welcomed to the home and hospital
ty of ray friend thomas van ronsellaer i
found him alive to the great cause of freedom
ready to render me every aid in his power to
make my mission to this city a successful one
i am also happy to acknowledge the generous
help rendered me by the rev peter rose min
ister of ztoo church who very kindly offered
me the use of bis pulpit in which to plead
our common cause i deem this all the more
generous and commendable in mr roes be
cause i was once a member of his church and
left it ou account of a change in my religious
and antislavery views such a sin t is jmt
generally forgiven or overlooked lam also
indebted to rev j n gloucester and to mr
james w c pennington both of whom
readily and willingly threw open tlieir church
es without money or price i have not been
without the assistance and encouragement of
other distinguished colored gentlemen mr
george downing dr j mccune smith
mr charles l reason mr william p
powell and many others gave me a cordial
reception and rendered me assistance in se
curing for me a hearing to all of whom 
desire to return my sincere thanks besides
this i have bad several very pleasant inter
views with respectable and intelligent gentle
men w hose acquaintance i had not enjoyed
before on my arrival in new york  was
i agreeably surprised by meeting wihmp friend
i and fellow worker in the cause of freedom
i charles lenox remond who though he had
been long absent from home and desirous to
go ihhher immediately consented to remain
with me and address such meetings as i should
be able to get up in new york and vicinity
my first meeting was held at brooklyn in
the beautiful and commodious church under
the pastoral care of rev mr gloceater
mr remond failed to reach this meeting to
the great disappointment of the audience
after i had addiessed the meeting mr van
reuscllaer addressed it in a warm and vigor
ous appeal for the north star the second
meeting was held in newark in new jersey
tuesday evening th april herel received
efficient help fruin rev mr rogers who
kindly opened his church free of charge for
the meeting on wednesday night th
 attended two meetingsone in newark
and the other in new york the places of
meeting are twelve miles apart but with the
i help of railroad and steam i was able to ac
i connplish it the meeting at newark com
menced at halfpast seven and that at new
york commenced at  oclock mr remond
addiessed the meeting in new york until
relieved by me from newark both meet
ings were soulcheering especially that held
in new yurk the night wasdaik and rainy
yet the audience was large and spirited we
weie informed that mr remoud had made
one of his happiest efforts carrying the au
dience with him even when he rebuked their
neglect and indifference the most sharply
our next meeting was held in mr pen
ningtons chutch on friday evening th
instant a full account of which will be fur
nished by the secietary of that meeting 
expect much good from the proceedings of
that evening the appointment of a com
mittee to secure subscribers for the north star
is s most significant and cheering fact and will
doubtless be the means of securing valuable
aid to the paper the speeches of mesars re
mond lovning an d dr james mccune smith
as well as that of the rev j w c pennington

that there ia a deepconcerted scheme for
the annexation of cuba to the united states

perfidious wicked design is not more question

linked and yet unbroken chain of slavery
here in the deep and abiding interest
cuba is the great western slave mart of the
world containing the bar racoons or tefioiog
shops to the slave factories of pedro blanco
and other pirates on the western coast of afri
ca it in the jpeat channel through which
sieves are imparted snootily into the united
sutra contrary to the law of the land and
the sovereign power by which the cor stita
tioosl power of  is stricken down sod
made null and void at tbe will of the slave
holder into this island are there annually
imported more than fifty thousand slaves ex
pressly for tbe faumso market and being con
tiguous to the united sutes vessels from
baltimore washington city richmond and
other american slavemarkets usually after
shipping anr slaves purchased in those par
ticular places sail to the isle of cuba under
the pretext of touching by havana for trade
when they enter the barracoons the traders to
whom tbe slaves on board belong frequently
the master and owner of the vessel being con
cerned in the traffic purchase a full cargo ol
slaves sail to new orleans where they an
sold out to the highest bidder at the slave
market there from whence they are taken tc
all paru of the south in this highhanded
manner is tbe provision prohibiting the impor
tation of slaves into the united sutes aftei
the year  openly and constantly trampled
under foot and thoee in power the suprenx
judicial and executive authorities being gene
rally slaveholders or their abettors well know
thes facts and by keeping silence wink a
and encourage such undisguised infamou
deeds of daring
there are at present in cuba probably no
less than  slaves there being in 
nearly twenty years ag with a year
ly increase of trade in the slave products
these human souls computed at the owes
estimate of bo apiece would amount t
the sum of  which added to th
land possessions would bring into thisconntrj
if annexed to it no inconsiderable wealth t
be at once added to its resources as a nation
besides the imports and expenditures witl
foreigo nations would according to the amer
ican policy of encouragement to home manu
faciures uvm possible be turned to the
domestic market
for the consummation of an object to them
so desirable as the annexation ofcuba the late
administration james k polk who if noi
tbe projector was the accomplisher of the un
equalled scheme of the annexation of texas
gave insiuctions and authority to mr saun
derson acting minister at the court of spain
to negotiate with that government for the
payment of the spanish debt to england re
ceiving aa an equivalent a mortgage on cuba
which would at onee place fairly in the amer
ican power tbe island as an american terri
tory and tbe principal objection to this pro
ject appears to have been made by the span
ish subjects resident on the island who be
coming alarmed at tbe prospect of the passage
of the wilmot proviso and the fear of the
prohibition of the slave trade being extended
over them would prefer to remain an integral
portion of spain to that of becoming a frac
tional part of the united sutes government
the project being once determined on as
we really believe it has been the slaveholders
and their compatriots in the north will find no
difficulty in effecting a removal of these objec
tions since their whole studied policy is to
dupe the eountiy into their interested measutes
which they will moat probably succeed in
the objections to texan annexation were once
as strong even on tbe part of texans them
selves and aa apparently improbable as that
of the projected annexation of cuba but
how soon were such objections dissipated a
large majority oftexans oveiruling the others
and the proposition passing tbe congress of
of tbe united sutes with one or two honor
able exception with scarcely a respectable
opposition
 it is surmised that the interposition of great
britain would be brought to bear to prevent
the accomplishment of this scheme of cuban
annexation let none deceive themselves on
this point great bnuin does not desire a
war with any nation at present and only
wages war when she cannot aroid it her
first resource is negotiation by treaty when
 this does not avail her last is a resort to arms
she will never concern herself with tbe affairs
of other nations when she is not particularly
intaested and her relations with cuba are
such that they may easily be adjusted by ne
gotiation which ia as compatible with tbe
bntiah policy as warfering to suppose that
england will interfere mainly on account ol
the regard she has for the colored people and
laves of the island is also a great mistake
although purely an antislavery nauoo sod
tried and proven friend of tbe a incan race
yet she has no greater love for mack than
white sad my not be expected to interfere
except her interest and commercial relations

to prevent a scheme fiaught with such fearful
consequences as this project of annexation ol
cuba there is but one party more interes

designthe colored people themselves and to
them we make the appeal we heartily be

legation of commissioners who sent some ten
or twelve years since by the cortez council of
the nation to investigate the affairs of the col
ony reported that cuba mush cease to be a
spanish colony and become a negro govern
ment for the reason there is no power under
heaven capable of subduing four hundred
thousand negroes it they deliberately deter
mined that theyuwtf not be oppressed by them
there are now six hundred thousand hu
man souls held in abject bondage in cuba all
of whom must ere long be disenthralled by
the very nature of things but for this ameri
can interference and shall we who are nom
inally free as mute asthedumbgagged slave
remain silent at the approach of such an alarm
ing usurpation and not utter our voices
against it shall we whose dnty it is to give
the strongest opposition to these inroads upon
right be the most indifferent to them no
we shoffld not the cause ia ourawe are
the interested party and every colored man
should make common cause of it uniting in
mind hwtt aeetiment and action sending up
one united voice of solemn indignation against
this and every anch scheme and by every
means in his power enlighten his brethren in
slavery upon the subject of their inalienable
godgiven righia this we conceive to be as

to those whom he at that time called to follow
him in order to assure them that although they

wealth was not the only cause but undoubted

slavery will not be established in the new

i that the southern slaveholdeis hope to play

for hopethough it is a hope to be indulged
only with fear and trembling that the north

 quoted below shows tnat slaves w ill s on be in
california in great numbers it will be re
collected that it was recently decided by a
judge in missouri that according to ameri
can law all that was required to render
slavery legal was to prove its existence will
northern men allow that t lie atiue interpre

it is w hat greater absurdity can be committed
than to talk of excluding slavery from the
territories under that constitution x no urr
ion with slaveholders is the only sure ground
to preserve the noith from all participation in
tho sin and shame of slavery let the north
come up to that point and the days of this
iniquity are numbered j d
we are pleased to witness that the citixens
of the southern states are taking things in
their own hands so far as regards tho estab

have we learned of some hundred ot more
slaves being sent to that country from dif

choleraprevention the best remedy
the loudon tunes publishes an extract
from a circular issued by the board of health
which shows the advantage of adopting pre
ventive measures in stopping the ravages of
this malignant malady ot more importance
however is it that every one shuuld
exercise a watchful care over his own health
those debilitated by vice and intemperance
are invariably the first and in some cases the
only victims cleanliness temperance in
eating as well as in drinking and abstinence
from every vice with open air and exercise
are the best preventives of this as of all other
diseases the hebrew poet spoke not less
truthfully than poetically of the safety
of the good man in the midst of the
pestilencea thousand shall fall at thy side
and ten thousand at thy right hand hut it

colorphobiaa discovery
home poor unfortunate wight of an editor
who publishes a paper called the standard not
known to fame it is true but still a paper and
to tome extent of course the mouihptece of
of the humans in westfield maas was re
cently laboring under an attack of the malig
nant and dangerous malady known as color
phobu the diagnosis was no doubt perfect
many of the symptoms manifested themselves
most unequivocally it especially appears
from the evidence that he had a quite unusual
dread of coming in contact with persons of a
certain color yellow if from an attack of
jaundice he was not peculiarly affected by but
if from a natural hereditary cause his alarm
and uneasiness were very great the darker
the color the greater was his dread ihe ap
proach of s decidedly black man aroused him
to a perfect paroxysm of terror his fiiends
tried to reason him out of this singular notion
but could not they expostulated with him
but in vain they showed him that the black
man of whom he was so terribly afraid was
by no m tans such s frightful objectthat be
was in fact quite a harmless clever sort of
a fellowbut all to no purpose like the
rev dr of whom we have heard who fan
cied himself a teapot and would insist upon
walking about with an arm on each side so
placed as to make one assume the place of
the handlethe other of the spout and by
no force of reasoning was it possible to con
vince the deluded d d that he was anything
of more importance than an old maid s teapot
ih like that other unhappy mortal of whom
we have heard who fancied that he had an
overgrown noseso large that he required to
walk with care when crossing the threshold
of his door lest some protruding carbuncle
should come in contact with the doorposts
and moreover imagined that this immense pro
boscis was made of glass and if only slightly
touched would break into a thousand frag
ments just in such an illusive state of mind
was the hapless editor of the w estfield stan
dard during his recent attack of colorphobia
such cases may be met with every day in
almost every town and city of the union may
be found many just such cases or if the dis
ease does not so strongly manifest itself the
virus is there and requires only the applica
tion of certain external causes to make it as
sume in the afflicted patient all the most pain
ful and malignant symptoms these externa
causes unfortunately lor ihe editor of the

borhood presently how vehemently he

the virtual repeal of the law of  by the
last legislature ii a subject of regret to all
sensible men of all parlies
its mural influence was good for deference
to virtue is itself a virtue and it becomes a na
tion to affect at least some shame in carrying
on the slave trade it was good because so
far as slave breeding was profitable it gave
slaveholders a partial monopoly of the sys
tem and if an evil system is to be kept up it
may be a salvo to our moral sensibilities to fill
our pockets with gold it had the effect of
preventing to some extent the increase of a
most degraded class of slaves for whilst under
the law of  the south was our penal colo
ny under the system kentucky is to be the
botany bay of all the south we trade a
pressure in the money market will ensue
when criminal slaves are returned instead of
the metaht already the rale of usury has ad
vanced and above all if as these men
hope slavery is to be made perpetual among
us only a vety little common sense is needed
to induce us to keep the white race as much
as possible in the ascendant the repeal of
this law then is not only paricidal but displays
a love of evil for its own sake which was not
necessary to make slavery infamous
that emancipationists however should
fall back upon he law of  as a battleground
instead of pressing their own great principles
seems equal weakness and folly nor can i
jiin with thgse who have such affinities for
majorities lam not so much in love with
majorities as to square my policy far less my
principles by what a given majority may
chance to think
upon a tariff or any mere financial meas
ure we find no such timid suggestions but
again and again have we rallied to renewed
effort in many a lost field why then only in
this contest are we asked to take council of
our fears and because we may suppose that a
majority may be against us to lay down our
arms without striking a blow
slavery is a legal tyranny over natural
right and every just man will seek uncom
promisingly its overthrow the people made
it and the people can unmake it
the slaveholders attempt to browbeat us
into giving our vote tacit support to this
wrong and withering curse for
such are the terms of some of our leading
i men what is there in slavery that it should
j lie treated with such tenderness what is
i there sacied in slavery it is time this silly

col fremonts expedition
col benton has received a letter from col
fremont detailing the privations and misfor
tunes which he experienced in his journey
over the rocky mountains he says in this
letter of the sufferings of his party
one after another wearied and frozen wero
left behind to dieothers passing onward te
save themselves from cold hunger and star
vation were compelled to eat the dead bodies
of their comrades before they became cold j
the st louis republican of march th
further says
col fremont left sante fe on the th
ult on his way to california of the dread
ful disaster which befel him in the mountains
we have this account the published letters
from col fremont and his friends left hinr
ascending a mountain and within five or six
miles of the summit but this elevation hei
never reached a storm came up which
forced him to retreat and to shelter in he
valley belowhere it is said the snow
drifted and accumulated to the depth of thirty
or forty feet and the party lost all their ani
mals and were compelled to leave their entire
outfit the snow covered the animals and
every thing else from view and col f and
his party were driven to seek safety on th
sides of the mountain in this emergency
bill williams a hardy mountaineer and twj
others volunteered to seek succor from the
nearest settlements and it was arranged that
they should return in twenty days as they j
failed to do so however col fremont and
one or two others resolved upon attempting to
reach taos and on the sixth day from their
leaving camp they overtook williams and
one of his companions the othermr
king of the district of columbia was repre
sented to have died of the exposure and of
hunger and in the extremity to which theo
were driven the survivors were forced to eat
a part of his body
col fremont made his way to taos ob
tained aid provisions and horses and then
set out in search of his party but more than
one third of his men had in tbe interval of bis
absence died from exposure and hunger and
one or two of them had given out and were
left to die when he came up with them
the number who thus perished is stated at
eleven
on his arrival at sante fe he was furnish
ed with horses bj tbe quartermaster and with
stores from the commissary of the l s and
after recruitinghis party again set off for cali
forniataking the route pursued by col cook
in  j
he and his party have suffered terribly in

ragged schools in london
i went one evening to aec king
kdward street ragged schol the
largest one of this description m all
london and in its composition tht
wont before describing it i will al
lude to the origin of the ragged school
system of education there has al
ways been in london a vast population
of ignorant jmvertystricken children
some legitijnate others illegitimate
who earn their food by sweeping the cros
sings running on errands selling
matches and watercress and bv beg
ging and stealing this host of chi id rer
have been heretofore left to gain theii
education in the street and consequent
ly they in due time helped to till tojaili
and furnish work for the hangman it
was perfectly naturalthese pool
wretches w ere not particularly to blame
for their conduct for it was in exact
accordance w ith their educationso
ciety made them villains and then to
crown the sin punished them for it
they never heard of the bible or ol
right they simply knew that they
suffered and any act to relieve that
suffering was in their eyes holylt
by stealing they could supply them
selves with breadwhy not take it
the rich took from them w hy not re
taliate philanthropists began to study
their condition and come to the con
clusion that society was more to blame
in the matter than the poor wretches
themselves and steps were taken at
once for their benefit john powels
the poor shoemaker has the honor of
f being the inventor of the ragged
schools as robert raikcs was of sun
day schools this poor shoemaker
would gather about him while at his
work tlm outcasts of the streets and
teach them to read from the bible and
good hooks the poor man in this
way gave hundreds for nothing the
 art of reading and writing besides ed
 ucating their morals liis idea was
caught up at once by the philanthro
pists and the humble shoemaker ever
since takes his jdace beside howard
and even wilberforce as a philanthro
pist indeed in his case there was
i more personal sacrifice than in either
of the cases i have mentioned for he
had a large family and could ill support
them ami his duties as teacher neces
sarily detracted from his slight income
bv consuming a portion of his precious
time in a short time almost every
degraded locality had its ragged
i school and also many of the provincial
cities and in some dayschools are
held with hired teachers and all the
i scholars receive one or two meals a
day in the majority of the schools
i however there is but one daily session
and that is in the evening and the
teachers all voluntary among them
are some of the finest finest in its true
sense ladies and gentlemen in london
and the supervisor told me that he had
many times escorted charles dickens
i over the schools as he is their true
friend and supporter a union i
j formed t the head of which stand
lord ashley it is s ji
first men of the laud and grants sup
plies to all the needy schools
j one evening i visited with the su
pervisor king kdward street school
j the quarter was near spitalfields a
most disgusting and dangerous portion
of the metropolis after walking foi
 some time amid the most noxious
j stenches and narrow streets and slime
we came to a low building in which
the school was held as wc approach
ed the door j saw that a large nutubei
i of hoys and gills were gathered abonl
it shouting at the top of their voices
let us inplease lot us indo lei
i us inwc will be good
what said  to my friend have
i you ut room for all
 no he replied every night we
turn scores away for want of room
and a sufficient number ol teachers
we shall never get in at this door
j there is a private one which we can
get in at if they have not scented us
 but they had scented u they knew
i him and followed on our heels
 we will pass on as though we had
no intention of visiting the school
i whispered my friend and away we
went and the boys ran back to the
front door as soon as they were out
of sight we turned and stealthily ap
proached a private entrance gave n
low knock it was opened but just us
we had got in a pack of hoys caine
rushing against the door help
help shouted my frind and a half
i dozen sturdy teachers came to our re
liefthe door was closed and barricad
j ed and we walked about to look at the
school
tiiere were thri e hundred scholars pre
i sent the teachers were of both sexes
j and were about twenty in number the
room was not plasteredit was foriner
j ly a barnbut the strong gaslights lit
up every nook and corner the am
i was cloe and unhealthy notwithstand
mg the upper windows were some of
i them open but the sight that the
children presented  think i shall never
i forgetlmagine three hundred rag
j ged dirty filthy noisy children with
great staring eyes brassy faces and
impudent airs and then realize the self
sacrifice of those finelyformed young
men and sweetlooking young women
who moved about among them as teach
ers  felt horrified at first and as l
stood leaning against a post close at
inv side was one of the sainlliest most
delicate ladies  ever saw teaching a
i dozen of the filthiest boys in london
i forgot myself and drew up my face
with horror as l gazed  saw a sweet
i smile play over her face as i said
pardon me i atn u stranger to
wretchedness like this and it astonished
j me to sc o ie like ycu in the midst of
i it a slight color ran to her face os
i she answered inildlv vet halfreproach
fully r
c irist blessed even such as these
i i never shall forget that answer for
 it wa utterly devoid of cant in manner
j or tone and i walked on with rny feel
ings of disgust overcome by those of
pity some were writing some reading
and many the majority learning their
letters they were of all ages from
eight to twenty and of both sexes
just after i came in a couple of rough
looking fellows about sixteen years
old differed about the nttmunaiarian of
a word in the taatamaui
it is nt  ntf oo
ilia replied the other
you lie said the first i
a blow came from the first to the
second i ran to the spot and found
them with their cufis turned over in the
true congressional mode as i came
up they began to look sheepish
and finally one said to the other the
one who had struck the first and only
blow
i say tom we was only in fun
was we
no that we was nt replied the
other and they immediately returned
to their testament i have thought of
the ludicrous affair many times since
aud have concluded that it is not the i
only species of encounter that often
takes place over the bible by rabid
men which in reality involves no ques
tion of importance
i could hear the poor wretches at
the front door shout let us inlet
us incontinually but now suddenly
with a great crash the big door came
plunging in and headlong after it some
twenty or thirty boys putthem out
put them out shouted the superin
tendent but we could not do it the
great unwasben were masters of the
field and we begged for quarters
now said a lusty fellow who was
their ringleader now for some readin j
and spellin but just then a police
man whom we had sent for came in 
with his leathern cape dripping with
wet and at the sight of his baton the
insurgent boys took to their heels and
were soon away but now without cry
 ing eloquently do let us readdo j
let us stay masterwe will keep very j
stillwont we bill this last ap
peal was made by all to their leader
who seemed to keep charge of theirj
i conduct we wont make any noise
jitself was eloquent but thewill
we bill was irresistible after they 
were gone and as i heard their voices
failing begging yet that they might
come in i fell to thinking on their
hard lot bremis has somewhere paint
ed a fullgrown brawny armed man
lusty with life begging not for bread
but for work and unable to gft it
 the world was admitted the picture to
i be true in many parts of britain and
its pathos has been appreciated and
yet here was a scene more sad if it
were possible here were children j
not knowing even of the existence of j
jesus dark and wretched and yet
coming from their wretched abodes to
where they see the faint beams of light
and crying plaintively give us light
ah give us light and thus to be i
turned awaythus to be thrust into j
the paths of wickednesswas it not
affecting the teachers w t ere not to
blame tor the building could not hold
more but were not those lordly chris
tians walking so statelily to their i
churches on sunday and on the week
day passing laws to hang these children i
were not they to blame every day
wasting money enough to clothe and
feed and educate these wretches and
yet talking in the tone of virtuous in
dignation of the wickedness of the
world ami canting about the fulness of
redemption
poor poor children lacking bread
lacking dry houses to sleep in hungry
as wolves and yet forgetting all and
coming to the school and beggingnot
tr bread though starving butfor
i light knowledge and religion over
i yonder children roll in splendid car
riages awayover yonder the children
of the rich cast to the dogs enough to
give them their greatest boonand
yet it is withheld from them and rich
j fathers make laws to imprison and hang
them poor ones for doing what every
one would do in their circumstances
j when will men learn said i
 halfuloud when will men learn that
ignorance is the father of sin and that
society makes her criminals
the school was out and the teachers
leathered about me to ask if we had
j such scenes in america
no thank god in new england
where my home is we have no such
scenes i replied and we parted
j more about the ragged schools

it is pleasing to reflect that the
public mind of england has softened
while it lias ripened and that we have
in the course of ages become not only
a w iser but also a kinder people there
is scarcely a page of the history of
the lighter literature of the th centu
ry which does not contain some proof
that our ancestors were less humane
than their posterity the discipline
of workshops of schools of private
families though not more efficient than
at present was infinitely harsher
masters well born and bred were in
the habit of heating their servants
pedagogues knew no way of imparting
knowledge hut by beating their pupils
husbands of decent stations were not
ashamed to heat their w ives the im
placability of hostile factions was such
as we can hardly concieve whigs
were disposed to murmer because
stafford was suffered to die without
seeing his bowels burned before his
face as little mercy was shown by
the populace to sufferers of an bumbler
rank  an offender was put into the
pillorvit was well if he escaped with
life from the shower of brick bats and
paving stones if he was tied to the
carts tail the crowed pressed around
him imploriug the hangman to give it
to the fellow well and make him howl
gentlemen arranged pasties of pleasure
to bridewell ou court days for the
purpose of seeing the women who beat
hemp there whipped a man pressed
to death for refusing to plead a wo
man burned for coining excited less
sympathy than is now felt for a gallant
horse or an over driven ox fights
compared with which a boxing match is
a refined and humane spectacle were
among the favorite diversions of a large
part ot the town multitudes assem
bled to sec gladiators hack each other
to pieces with their deadly weapons
and shouted when one of the combat
ants lost a finger or an eye the
prisons were helu on earth seminaries
of every crime aod every disease at
the assizes the lean and yellow culprits
brought with them from their cells to
the dock an atmosphere of stench and
pestilence whick sometime avenged
tkem signally on bench bar and jury
bat on this misery society looked with
profound indifference no where couldj
be found that sensitive and restless com
passion which has in our time exten
ded a powerful protection to the factory
child to the hindoo widow to the ne
gro slave which pries ioto the stores
and water casks of every emigrant
ship which winces at every lash laid
on fbe back of a drunken soldier which
veill not suffer the thief in the hulks to
be illfed or overworked and which
has repeatedly endeavored to save the
life even of the murderer
it is true that compassion like all
other feelings ought to be under the
government of reason and has for the
i want of such government produced
some ridiculous and some deplorable
effects but the more we study the
annals of the past the more shall we
live in a merciful age in an age in
j which cruelty is abhorred and in
which pain even when deserved is
inflicted reluctantly aod from a sense
of duty every class doubtless has

the most defenceless
diogenes
was not so sneering as people
thought there was a fund of humor
in the man he laughed at mankind
bnt there was a little kindliness under
neath and they who say he was a
surly sneering dog mistake the mao
he was an ascetic hat not for ascetic
isms sake which was an evil many
were apt to fall into asceticism in
fact bred a vanity of its own if beg
gary became a prfossion he who was
raggedest and dirtiest became the prince
ol beggars one man took pride in
the luxury of dress and another in
simplicity and both bred their dangers
men often made asceticism an end in
itself all through the lives of the as
cetics there is the tendency to exalt
selfdenial into an end whereas it only
appears beautiful when it is adopted to
effect a great end when a man shall j
deny himself to work something good
for another but the thing w hich is
called selfdonying is not worth the
name having no taste for a particu
lar sin we get up and boast to the
world about what selfdenial we have
exercised in not falling into that temp
tation this was not the asceticism i
which the great teacher gave us to
follow it was a voluntary laying down
of enjoyment not wrong in itself for
the effecting of some greater good
but the greater number of men had no
jidea of laying down the life to win it
there was a virtue which could not
get tempted and then boasted itself
how securely it had stood but this
mans was voluntary and taken upon
him he was not poor because he
could not have been rich but because
he wished to carry out to the extreme
the great doctrine of how independent
a man was of what this world could
give or bestow to correct the continual
tendency of mankind to be smothered
jby the things by which it ie surroun
ded but the ascetic man was simply
i the factor of a man and the more asce
itic the more we saw that he wa inter
preting one law of life only
ithere came to see diogenes alexan
der the great one of those passionate
lustful brave daring men who do the
worlds work and enter into all its
pleasures this man who had taken
of the whole that life could give came
to diogenes with an air of patronage
full of the stars and garters of
ancient glory and asking what he could
do for him alexander suggested that
another dwelling than that tub might
be more convenient for diogenes hut
diogenes loved that tub which had
i sheltered him for years besides it
was not taxed and was moveable at
pleasure alexander says can i
give you honor no only think of a
star now upon my great naked hairy
breast well lie offers him a garter
but diogenes suggests that there is
nothing to be gartered aud at lust in
despair alexander sayscan i do
nothing for you ves says the man
stand out of mv sunshine he found
that monarch were opaque when the
sun was behind them that the cold
shadow of an alexander was not
w anned by the abundance of riches he
had at his bestowal then alexander
said if he was not alexander he w ould
be dienes next to having all he
wanted was the ability to do without
i anything of course it could not he
expected that he would say he was
second to diogenes but he decidedly
admitted that diogenes was number
two he would not say which was the
greater man of the two but he cer
tainly did not admire a man turning
poor to become righteous it was
hard for a rich man to enter the king
dom of heaven hut it wm noble to see
him keeping to broad cloth and even
not quite abolishing champagne and
still keeping a brave soul a welldisci

much to conquer obstacles as to elude

i exercises in the slow pursuit of wealth
