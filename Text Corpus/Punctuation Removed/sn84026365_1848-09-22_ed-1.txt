conclusion an conjectures
these are sir the general outlines o
the political route in which i wish toj
seo our friends nd enemies walk in
which i wish that the press anti speech
executive and chambers should guide
france and europe it is the only road
which has not an abyss at its termina
tion or which conducts to a future
you know it before the catastrophe
which afflicted our hearts without sur
prising our foresight for wc did sue it
prompt certain inevitable at the end
of the false narrow retrograde path
where blindness and error were urging
on those we loved to have as guides
whom we followed as the soldier should
follow his chief to death but not to
suicide these were our thoughts and
our words alas barren thoughts and
words which the breath of adulation
or of intrigue never suffered to reach
the cars of kings which the wind of
popular passions may also carry away
perchancetoday nevermind they
will fall dry and cold upon the sand or
upon the rock but they will not die
there forever a true idea a social
idea fallen from heaven on mankind
never returns to the void once it has
germinated in some true hearts in
eome logical and healthy minds it bears
in itself a something vital divine im
mortal which cannot entirely perish
passions vile interests ignorance
habit prejudices envy may crush it
beneath their feet may mutilate it with
the sabre or the axe its fruits are
delayed for a day for a century per
haps or two providence has its hand
full of centuriesand counts them not in
its works but at the century marked
at the fatal dayperhaps we are at it
the living idea whose deeds havoa
been shed abroad and multiplied by
the very storm bursts forth at one mo
ment in all minds all parties send it
out again as their own all opinions
own it as the bottom of their common
thought foreseen or not an event hap
pens may be an accident and the
world is renewed the idea of liberty
has all these characters if france
would if powerg knew liote this great
fact of social renovation might be
worked out under our eyes nothing
opposes it nothing resists it in things
as in minds the hour has struck

they continue to seek their support in
an element which is now beginning tc
fail which will be found wanting still
  more in the future the aristocracy in
the restriction and not in the expan
sion of political right and actionll
they continue to keep their hands
clenched instead of opening them wide
if they will reign and not guide if they
will pitch their tent for a day and force
the social mind to a precarious hah in
the defile at which the nineteenth cew
tury has arrived and where it will be
smothered unless it pass through with
daring power at the head of its gener
ations thus possibly two things are
deficient at this epoch without which
all theory falls to the ground all ex
perience vanishes in aira country and
a man
for want of the man the political
man the man complete in intelligence
and virtuea man sublime and living
impersonation of an age strong in the
strength of his own and his epochs
conviction bonaparte of speech hav
ing the instinct of social life and the
lightning of the tribune as the hero
has that of death and of the battlefield
palpitating with faith in the future co
lumbus of liberty capable of discover
ing another political world of convinc
ing us of its existence and of leading
us to it by the persuasion of his elo
quence and the domination of his
genius for want of such a man an
archy may be therevile hideous re
trogressive dcmigoguic sanguinary
yet impotent and shortlivedfor even
anarchy supposes strength crime has
also its party in france the scaffold
has its apostles but crime can never
he a political element crime is the
most antisocial of human things be
cause society is not and cannot be
other than morality and virtue this
party is beyond the law of the country
and of civilization it is to politics what
robbers arc to societythey kill but
they d not reckon society has neither
a necessity nor an appetite for blood
it has not even to fightnothing to
overturn b fore itall is made straight
under its steps that imitative admi
ration for the men and the tvorks of
terror is nothing hut the sophism
which sometimes accompanies the
hangman as it precedes him always it
is aa after tasteof blood shed and
drunk in our epoch of shame whimi
some maniacs take for thirstand which
is only the tigers dream
for lack of political virtue in the
country at the first earthquake of the
powers at the first hurricane on the
tempestuous sea of liberty a general
clamor will arise put back give up
all the way we have made take in sail
the most precarious port will be good
the most obscure the most ignorant
soldier w ill don the cockethut and the
grey coat and fancy himself a bona
parte will sabre liberty and civiliza
tion root and branch and w ill exclaim
my people until they detect that
the hero is only a strawstuffed effigy
and until they seek another w ho wears
tyranny more gracefully and dresses
up slavery better this free people
does not love liberty enough they al
ways think they see the temple of glory
with a hero in the doorway open to
admit them and to avenge them for a
new anarchy they are mistaken the
hero is no more and liberty is their
only asylum
let us then seek after political vir
tue let us seek after it both for our
selves and others this period will take
care to exercise it let us seek it where
it is to be found in a strong convic
tion in a sincere faith of mankinds
progressive destiny in a religious re
spect for our dignity as man in a se
vere contemplation of the divine issue
that god has placed before society as
before individual life this issue is
himself it is the perfection of the indi
vidual and the perfection of the gener
ic being human naturewhich ought to
bring the virtuous man and society it
self nearer to god
the divine thought applied at length
to policy is already fermenting in the
young generation which presses on us
that generation young strong moral
religiousit is all the hope for the fu
ture saint simouisin itself is a happy
symptom bold plagiarism which comes
from the gospel and which ought to
return there it has already rescued j
some enthusiastic spirits from the vile 
doctrines of industrial and political ma
terialism to open to them the indefinite
horizon of moral perfection and of so 
cial spirituality that is in reality
the point to be gained but by the
route christ has traced out which his
progressive doctrine enlightens iu pro
portion as man advances and upon the
real and solid grouud of humauity up
on the respect for all rights upon the
accomplishment of all duties upon the
reform and not upon the destruction
of the only basis which god has hith
erto given to his tanuiy and to society
property it may be humanity will
discover one day another social prin

has made the divine word alone

promises it unfolds itself with time
but u discloses to each epoch only that

force the indefinite hope of the per

alone can direct them there the prin
ciple from whence we all emanate be
lievers or sceptics friends dr enemies
is christianity its logical deduction is
social perfection it is this which has
made modem liberty more true than
ancient liberty it m this which pre
pares for us again political and civil
charity more true than the narrow
exclusive and egotist patriotism of an
tiquity its reign w ill be no other than
the rational epoch the reign of reason
for reason is also divine
a word here by this future and
perfect reign of christianity  do not
mean that material reign of christian
ity that palpable and universal empire
i of the catholic principle predominat
ing in fact over all the political powers
subjugating even the world to religious
truth and giving also the lie to the sub
lime of its author my kingdom
is not of this world this doctrine of
religious policy realized in social forms
a doctrine which some men of faith
and talent are vainly rekindling today
has never had the assent of my rea
son it is seeking in a crowned mys
i ticism in a posthumous theocracy in
a priestly aristocracy a principle and
rule of human power which exists no
where but in despotism or political ar
istocracy truth itself should not be
manifested nor imposed by forms ol
material domination for her agents
will be always men men alter or cor
rupt all which they touch with the
hands of man and make of the liberty
of the children of god a degrading
tyranny for us the only form ot man
ifestation and empire of religious
truth is speechis liberty the only
yoke of hearts and understandings is
conviction that is the only empire of
christian truth the only yoke we all
bear with liberty and with love when
the immortal trunk of christianity
which renews its branches and its foli
age according to necessities and peri
ods shall have borne and multiplied its
last fruits for us
let us now revert to the present day
and conclude you see hope and light
in a distant horizon in the future of
the generations which follow us un
certainty and darkness over our actual
fate our immediate future mean
while hope prevails and if each of
us without regard for party opinions
or desires places himself in the truth
which is immediately before him seeks
there his daily duty and employs his
strength without calculating it the re
sult leaves not a doubt the social world
will have made an immense step and
even its fall will have advanced it sev
eral ages i ain no prophet but rea
son prophecies an eternal law a mor
al law which the ancients called fatal
ity which the christians name provi
dence and which is nothing more than
divine will enchaining consequences to
principles effects to causes is working
eternally for or against us according
as we start from the false or the true
in the private life of the individual as
in the social life of empires this law
shows itself incessantly by its happy or
vengeful applications it requites even
in this world every man according to
his works according to his truth and
virtue it is the shadow of divine jus
tice that we perceive on the earth
with this divine law before our eyes
we can and do in reality predict every
day with a full and infallible assu
rance
we can then predict that if a right
has been omitted or voluntarily violated
in a political fact its absence or its
violation will plunge the power and
the country in a long and laborious ex
piation
that if thn power innocent itself of
the political necessity from whence it
springs comprehends this dictatorship
of events this mission of a social des
tiny and entirely employs it without
any selfseeking for the disinterested
salvation of the country in the sincerei
and broad foundation of a liberal andj
rational order it will triumph over all
obstacles it w ill create w hat is its evi
dent missiou to create and will last so
long as these necessary things ought
to last time to finish their work itself
a transition to another order of things
more advanced and more perfect
that if it docs not comprehend it
self and if it does not profit to the ben
efit of liberty and humanity by the fu
gitive moments which are given to it
if it does not ae that a long broad
and straight road is open without ob
stacle before it and that it can carry
thereby the spirits laws and facts to a
point from whence they cau no more
retrograde if it count itself us some
thing if it stops or returns it will per
ish and several ages perhaps will
perish with it

shall at least have protested if out

which shines for us this light which all

i some one has said that in times of
revolution it is ofttimes jess difficult to
do ones duty than to know it hut the
moral of christianity has a light that
always illumines our steps sutficient

i the instability of events and the stormy
wind of fortune can neither veil nor

choice which this morality commands
us let us make it from day to day
hour to hour according to reason con
science and virtue let us yield nothing
of it to our enemies nothing to our
friends even let us endure hatred and
insult from the one smiles and raillery
from the others before each mai
before each epoch before each deed
there is a duty in each duty there is
a virtue in each virtue a present or
future reward each of these duties
accomplished by us is without our i
knowing it high policy for policy is
only morality applied to civil life
our duty to ourselves like our poli

country from which we caunot secede
without weakening it and consequent
ly notmuthout crime the country
which had greater call for suc

would never pardon us for not having
offered so much of them in our sta

false political attitude accept let us
not justify that title of conquered
which skilful enemies would impose on
us to give themselves the odious rights
of victorythat title ttf conquered
for which some of us have the weak

no conquered in france in the battle
of july except those who in fact or
in heart betrayed the sworn law to
attack the country in her right and her
repose to overturn institutions and
place at the mercy of a street row a
nation a throne europe and the age
we are not of such men we re
proved them beforehand at the lime
and afterwards let us lament their
blindness and their punishment but nut
adopt to ourselves the political repro
bation wherewith we struck them be

committed tbe fault and we pay the
penalty we are neither the victors nor
the vanquished we are the victims of

let it not be said that we have aban

it cannot live without form that the
form of all political reality is a govern

government is a strong and true exec

caprice that it wants root in the soil
to resist tempests that the roots arc
organic laws which inut attach it to
the country and communicate to its

the word liberty on the frontispiece of
its government but that it must stamp
it on the very foundations aud from

of rights duties discussion election
and liberty above all let us prove to
it that it should be just and that the
right of all only lives in the right of
each despotism can subsist on a
false base because it depends on force
liberty cannot because she relies on
ustice if the right of a single one is

knows to extract good from evil who
holds in his hands the reigns of em

that they must walk in the road of their
divine destiny toward light and virtue
that impulse of human nature towards

generous hearts and spirits which this
earth produces in each generation
without ever exhausting her supply of
genius aud virtue extinguish their tri

common duty and guard that future of
france which france alone can keep

the most devoted of her sons who only
quits her for a day because she does
not require him whom she can sum

nor lainentedcd it ms an fevil nor ex
pressed a desirre for its cessation nor
so much as mentioned it by name it

slaveholding havo ever been popularly
designated
neither did it abolish the abominable
foreign slave trade which was then in
full career hut actually profit hutd the
abolition therof even by n nundinal for
twenty years without giving the slight
est pledge that after the year hh the
traffic should be suppressedthus it
sanctioned and pledged national pro
tection to unmitigated piracy against
humanity it did all this without one
solitary expression of shame sorrow or
compunction
it gave slaveholders a preponderating
political weight in the election of pres
ident and vice president and in the
lower branch of the national legisla
ture to the extent of three fifths of nil
their slaves whence has resulted o
slave holding oligarchy in the gov
ernmcntand innumerable evils to the
country it pledged all the citizens j
of the united states to deliver up
fugitive slaves on demand of persons
claiming them under the laws ofa slave
holding state just as if they were act
ual felons w hereby thousands of unfor
tunate people have been subjugated
not only to recapture but to all manner
of cruelties for the innocent act of try
ing to obtain by peaceful flight their
natural and inalienable rights
it pledged the whole natural force of
purse and arms to protect slaveholders
against domestic violence though nat
urally and wantonly provoked py out
rage and inhumanity under the system
of slavery in this way usconstitu
tion clandestinely but effectually en
dorsed the moral and republican char
acter of slaveholders held out a bounty

the rights of man installed the slave
trade as a legitimate branch of national
commerce for twenty years cut olfthe
slaves from all hope of deliverance
either by flight or resistance made the
federal government jailer to the slave
states opened the door to a long series
of slavocratic usurpations and com
pletely implicated the whole nation in the
guilt of an institution which aggregates
and involves all the wickedness which
human beings can commit against one
another or their creator all this is
as clearly demonstrable as that two
and two make four
yet this constitution was framed and
adopted by a people professing unboun
ded reverence for republican liberty and
the natural rights of man and it con
tinues to be suported on oath or affirm
ation by such a people thus far to the
triumphant march extension and con
solidation of slavery
that it may be seen how jealously
this constitution guards the irty ofi
republicanism agatnst the tyranny off
jdonarchy and the insidious encroach

lowing article
if any citizen of the united states
shah accept claim receive or retain 
any title of nobility or honor or shall
without the consent of congress accept

or emolument of any kind whatsoever
from any emperor king prince or for
eign power such person shall cease to

shall be incapable of holding any office
of trust or profit under them or either
of them
thus it appears that ifa citizen of
the united states without a special act
of indulgence from congress should
accept of a cane or a tin medal or a
red ribbon from tueen victoria he
would forfeit all the rights and hon
ors of citizenship lie could neither

outcasts and vagabonds they are
virtuous and industrious they are wil

they obliged to both work and starve
alas man inhuman and sordid has
become calloushearted and soulim
bruted with the inordinate spirit ofguir
and will sacritice a hundred of thu
bodies and souls of unoffending and in
nocent females to add a few more dol
lars to his already enormous profits
we believe this subject is a proper one
for legislation and any man guilty of
paying less than a living compensation
for work is a proper subject for fin

greater than formerly a a nation

great drama of life and many efforts
are now in the course of aetionto place
her where she of right ought to be on a

our attention was directed to thin

the young woman whose attendance
upon a course of inedieni lectures was
noticed by us some month since is
now a resident assistant physician in
the almshouse in that city that she
visits the several wards and perform
all the duties incumbent upon her in a

exertions would seem to deserve

during the day previous to that appointed
fir the convention there were strong indica
tion of a storm which made the friends
apprehensive that the meeting would be a
failure as it was to ba held in a grove
there were meetinghouses and acbteu
houses and a large academy all unoccupied
ya the claims of humanity may not be urged
in them
however at the time appointed came fair
weather and an audience of upwards of a
hundred assembled in a beautiful grove just
targe enough iost shady enough and alto
gether rightlast year when a similar meet
tag was held only about half a dozen came
together the general subjects of freedom
and slavery were discussed during the day
and remarks made calculated to produce a
sense of individnal responsibility of selfre
spect and of true independence
friday morning met according to ad
journment the meeting was organised
zebina h small being appointed president
and esekiel thatcher vice president
charles steams and lucy stone secretaries
a committee on finance was also appointed
but the names were lost
parker pillabury presented the following
resolutions
 resolved that our nations religion is
a lie and our government a crimedeserving
not the support but the execration of every
friend of justice and humanity
 resolved that the mass of our minis
ters are monsters in human form boasting
that they have power to abolish slavery in
one single year and yet sanctifying and sup
porting it from year to year
 resolved that oui constitution is a
covenant with death our union an agreement
with hellbinding the people cf all the
states to sustain and support the slave
breeding slavetrading and slaveholding of
the south
 resolved that such a government is
treason to the majesty of heaven rebellion
against the government of godand to vote
under it or to hold office in it knowing its
character is a crime scarcely less than blas
phemy against the holy ghost
 resolved that the only recommenda
tion of general taylor to the presidency is
his bloodhou n d butchery of the semi
nole indians and his successful massacre of
the mexicans at the command of slavery
both of which atrocities were sternly op
posed by the whig party from whence came
his nomination to the highest office in the
peoples gift
 resolved that the surperlative mean
ness and unparalleled sycophancy of general
gass in crawling down to lick the spittle of
southern slaveholders was the only recom
meniation and eligibility he possessed to be
the candidate of the democratic party for the
presidency of the united states
 resolved that james g birney was
dropped by the liberty party on the ground
that john p hale who was never an abo
iitionst was the more available candidate
and now j p hale is superseded by martin
van buren an open enemy oj antislavery
for the same reasonwhich shows that party
as devoid of integrity and fixed principle as
either of the others
 that the only true and righteous ground
to which intelligent and honest men can come
is that of entire separation from all voluntary
support of the government the constitution
aud the union inscribing bravely on their
banners with determined spirits and trust in
god union with freedom union
with justh e but no union
with slavery nor slavehold

the proslavery character of the church
and clergy was moat fully exposedits
hypocritical mask torn off effectually and our
nations religion proved to be a lie never
were words of earnest remonstrance and
calm rebuke more faithfully uttered never
did the spirit of proslavery writhe in greater
agony then on this occasion when its naked
dcfoimity was exhibited while none were
found able to throw around it shield or covet
ing towards the close of the meeting on
saturday an effort was made to create dis
turbance by some young men who were
trying to persuade a man said to be half
crazed but who notwithstanding said many
true things to interrupt and disturb the
speakers and when allusion was made to the
conduct of these disturbers they probably
as others would not suppose themselves qd

am address e the oils red people sf the
united states
fellow cocnttrnnt
under a solemn sense of duty inspired by
our relation to you as fellow sufferers under
tbe multiplied and grievous wrongs to which
we as a people are universally subjected
we a portion of your brethren assembled in
national convention at cleveland ohio take
tbe liberty fo address you on the subject of our
mutual improvement and social elevation
the condition of our variety of the human
family hat long been cheerless if not hope
less in this country the doctrine persever
tafly proclaimed in high places is church and
state that it is impossible for colored men to
rise from ignorance and debasement to in
telligence and respectability in ibis country
has made a deep impression upon the public
mind generally and is not without its effect
upon us under this gloomy doctrine many
of us have sunk under tbe pall of despondency
and are making ao effort to relieve ourselves
and have no heart to assist others it is from
this despond that we would deliver you it is
from this slumber we would rouse you the
present is a period of activity sod hope the
heavens above us are blight and much of the
darkness that overshadowed os baa passed
away we can deal in the language of bril
liant encouragement and speak of success
with certainty that our condition baa been
gradually improving is evident to all and
that we shall yet stand on a common platform
with our fellow countrymen in respect to po
litical and social rights is certain the spirit
of the agethe voiee of inspirationthe deep
longings pf the human soul the conflict of
right with wrongthe upward tendency of
the oppressed throughout the world abound
with evidence complete and ample of the final
triumph of right over wrong of freedom over
slavery and equality over caste to doubt
this is to forget the past and blind our eyes
to the present as well as to deny and oppose
the great law of progress written out by the
hand of god on the human soul
great changes for the better have taken
place and are still taking place the last ten
years have witnessed a mighty change in the
estimate in which we as a people are regard
ed both in this and other lands england
has given liberty to nearly one million and
france has emancipated three hundred thou
sand of our brethren and our own country
shakes with the agitation of our rights ten
or twelve years ago an educated colored man
was regarded as a curiosity and the thought
of a colored man as an author editor lawyer
or doctor had scarce been conceived such
thank heaven is no longer the case there
are now those among us whom we are not
ashamed to regard as gentlemen and scholars
and who are acknowledged to be such by
many of the most learned and respectable in
our land mountains of prejudice have been
removed and truth and light are dispelling the
error and darkness of ages the time was
when we trembled in the presence of a white
man and dared not assert or even ask for our
rights but would be guided directed and
governed in any way we were demanded
without ever stopping to enquire whether we
were right or wrong we were not only
slaves but our ignoranoe made us willing
slaves many of us uttered complaints
against the faithful abolitionists for the broad
assertion of our rights thought they went too
far and were only making our condition
worse this sentiment has nearly ceased to
reign in the dark abodes of our hearts we
begin to see our wrongs as clearly and com
prehend our rights as fully and as well as our
white countrymen this is a sign of progress
and evidence which cannot be gainsayed it
would be easy to present in this connection a
glowing comparison of our past with our pres
ent condition showing that while the former
was dark and dreary the present is full of
light and hope it would be easy to draw a
picture of our present achievements and
erect upon it a glorious future
but fellow countrymen it is not so much
our purpose to cheer you by the progress we
have already made as it is to stimulate you
to still higher attainments we have done
much but there is much more to be done
j while wc have undoubtedly great cause to
thank gud and take courage for the hopeful
changes which have taken place in our condi
tion we are not without cause to mourn over
the sad condition which we yet occupy we
are yet the most oppressed people in the
world in the southern states of this union
we are held as slaves all over that wide
region our paths are marked with blood our
backs are yet scarred by the lash and our
souls are yet dark under the pall of slavery
our sisters are sold for purposes of pollution
and our brethren are sold in the market with
beasts of burden shut up in the prisonhouse
of bondagedenied all rights and deprived
of all privileges we are blottod from the page
of human existence and placed beyond the
limits of human regard death moral
death has palsied our souls in that quarter
and we arc a murdered people
in the northern stales we are not slaves to
individuals aot personal slaves yet in many
respects we are the slaves of the community
we are however for enough removed from
the actual condition of the slave to make us
largely responsible for their continued en sfeve
ment or their speedy deliverance from chains
for in the proportion which we shall rise in
i the scale of human improvement in that pro
portion do we augment tbe probabilities of a
speedy emaneipation of our enslaved fcliow
countrymen it is more than a mere figure
iof speech to say that we are aa a people
chained together we are one peopleone
j in general complexion one in a deg
radation one in popular estimation aa coe
j rises all must rise and aa one fella all moat
fall having now our feet on tbs rock oi
freedom we most drag our brethren from the
slimy depths of slavery ignorance sod ram
j every one of us should be ihimsii to nnsaid
or himself free while his brother is a slave
tbs wrongs sf mu brethren should he out
eoostast theme there should be no time top
precious no calling too boly no place too ej
ered to make room for thu cause we
should not only feel it to be the cause of hu
manity but the mam at ehristtamty and fit
work for men and angels we ask you to
devote yourselves to this cause as one of the
first and most successful means of uolf im
provement is that careful study of ft yos
will learn voaf own rights and numpto hrod
tbe vista of coming rime your high and god
appointed destiny many of tbs brightest end
beet of our number have become such by toeir
devotion to this cause sad the somety of white
abolitionists the fetter bate been willing to
make themselves sf in reputation forsur sake
and in return let ns show ourselves worthy
of their teal and devotion attend antisfe
very meetings show that you are interested
in the subject that yon hate slavery and fore
those who ats laboring for is overthrow
act with white abolition societies wherever
you can and where you cannot get op soci
eties among yourselves but without exclusive
ness it will be a long time before we gain
all our rights and although it may seem to
conflict with our views of human brotherhood
we shall undoubtedly for many years be com
pelled to have institutions of a complexions
character in order to attain this very idea of
human brotherhood we would however
advise our brethren to occupy memberships
and stations among white persona and in
white institutions just so fast as our rights
are secured to us
never refuse to act with a white society or
institution because it is white or a black
one because it is black bat act with al
men without distinction of color by so act
ing we shall find many opportunities for re
moving prejudices and establishing the rights
of all men we say avail yourselves of white
institutions not because they are white bat
because they afford a more convenient means
of improvement but we pass from these
suggestions to others which may be deemed
more important in tbe convention that now
addresses yon there has been much said on
the subject of labor and especially those de
partments of it with which w f e as a class have
been long identified you will see by the
resolutions there adopted on that subject that
the convention regarded those employments
though right in themselves as being never
ibeltjs degrading to us as a class and there
fore counsel you to abandon them as speedily
as possible and to seek what are called the
more respectable employments while the
convention do not inculcate the doctrine that
any kind of needful toil is in itself dishonora
ble or that colored persons are to be exempt
from what arecalledmenial employments they
do mean to say that such employments have
been so long and universally filled by colored
men as to become a badge of degradation in
that it has established the conviction that col
ored men are only fit for such employments
we therefore advise you by all means to
cease from such employments as far as practi
cable by pressing into others try to get your
sons into mechanical trades press them into
the blacksmiths shop the machine shop the
joiners shop the wheelrights shop the
coopers shop and the tailors shop
every blow of the sledge hammer wield
ed by a sable arm is a powerful blow in
support of our cause every colored me
chanic is by virtue of circumstances an ele
vator of his race every house built by black
men is a strong tower against the allied hosts
of prejudice it is impossible fur us to attach
too much importance to this aspect of the sub
ject trades are important wherever a
man may be thrown by misfortune if he has
in his hands a useful trade he is useful to his
fellow man and will be esteemed accordingly
and of all men in the world who need trades
we are the most needy
understmd this that independence is an
essential condition of respectability to be
dependent is to be degraded men may in
deed pity us but they cannot respect us we
do not mean that we can become entirely in
dependent of all men that would be absurd
and impossible in the social state but we
mean that we must become equally iudepen
dent withother members of tbe community
that other members of the community shall
be as dependent upon us as we upon them
that such is not now the case is too plain to
uced an argument the houses we live in
are built by white menthe clothes we wear
arc made by white tailorsthe hats on our
heads are made by white hatters and the shoes
on our feet are made by white shoemakers
and the food that we eat is raised and culti i
vated by whits men now it is impossible
that we should ever be respected as a people
while we are so universally and completely
dependent upon white men for the necessaries
of life we must make white persons as de
pendent upon us as we are upon them this
cannot be done while we are found only in
two or three kinds of employments and those
employments have their foundation chiefly is
not entirely iu the pride and indolence of tbj
white people sterner necessities will brio j
higher respect
tbe fact is we must not merely make thj
white roan dependent upon us to shave hl
but to feed him not merely dependent upoj
us to black his boots but to make them ifl
man is only in a small degree dependent os ul
when he only needs his bouts blacked m hffi
carpet bag canted as a hide fees pride and
little more industry on bis part may enable hiu
to dispense with our services entirely as wise
men it becomes us to look forward to a stats
of things which appears inevitable tbe
time will come when those menial employ
ments will afford less means of living than
they now do what shall a large class ol
i our fellow countrymen do when whits men
find it economical to black their swr boots
and shave themselves what wiu they do
when white men learn to wait on themselves
i we warn you brethren to seek other and
more enduring vocation

sir my reasonsl will not say my apol
ogy for addressing to you this letter will be
come evident by perusing the following brief
statement of facts
about the middle of august of the present
yeardeeply desiring to give my daughter a
child between nine and ten years old the ad
vantages of a good schooland learning that
seward seminary of this city was an in
stitution of that characterl applied to its
principal miss tracy for tbe admission of my
daughterjintoihat seminary the principal
after making suitable enquiries into the childs
mental qualifications and informing me of the
price of tuition per term agreed to receive
the child into the school at the commencement
of the september term here we parted i
went home rejoicing that my child was about
to enjoy advantages for improving her mind
and fitting her for a useful and honorable life
i supposed that the principal would be as good
as her wordand was more disposed to his
belief when i learned that she was an aboli
tionista woman of religious principles and
integrityand would be faithful in the per
formance of her promises as she bad been
prompt in making them in all this i have been
grievouslyif not shamefully disappointed
while absent from home on a visit to
cleveland with a view to advance the cause
of education and freedom among my despised
fellow countrymenwith whom  am in all
respects identified the september term of
the seward seminary commenced and my
daughter was promptly sent to thu school
but instead of receiving her into mne school
according to agreement and ad in honor the
principal was bound to do she was merely
thrust into a room separate from all other
scholars and in this prisonlike solitary con
finement received the occasional visits of a
teacher appointed to instruct her on my re
turn home i found her still going to school
and not knowing the character of the treatment
extended to her i asked with a light heart as
i took her to mjyaide well my daughter how
do you get on at the seminary she an
swered with tears in her eyes  get along
pretty well but father miss tracy does not
allow me to go into the room with the other
scholars because lam colored slung to the
hearts core by this grievous statement and
suppressing my feelings as well as i could i
went immediately to the seminary to remon
strate with the principal against the cruelty
and injustice of treating ray child as a criminal
on account of her colorsubjecting her to soti
i tary confinement because guilty of a skin not
colored like hex own in answer to all that
i i could say against such treatment i was an
swered by the principal that since she prom
stjaed to receive the child into school she
ihad consulted with the trustees a body of
i believe unknown to the public and
i that they were opposed to the childs admission
to the schoolthat she thought at first of dis
regarding their opposition but when she re
rnembered how much they had done for her
in sustaining the institution she did not feel
mi liberty to do ao but abe thought if i allow
ed her to remain and be taught separately for
i term or more that the prejudice might be
overcome sad the child admitted into tbe
school with the other young ladies and misses
bit a lost to know what to do for the best in
rut of the child i consulted with mis
hrogfero and others and the result of tbe
ouauhatiou was to take my child from the
seminary as allowing her to remain there in
such circumstances could only serve to de
grade her in her own eyes and those oi the
other scholars attending tbe school before
however carrying out my determination to
withdraw tbe child from the seminary mias
tracy the principal submitted the question oi
the childs reception to each scholar individual
ly and  am sorry to say in a manner well
calculated to rouse their prejudices against
her she told them if there was one objection
to receiving her she should be excluded and
said if any of theta felt that she had a preju
dice and that that prejudice needed to be
tfreegthened that they might have time te
whisper among themselves in order to in
crease and strengthen that projudioe toons
young lady who voted to receive the child
she said as if fe utoauhment did you
mean to vote so are you accustomed to black
pctaomv tbe young fedystood silent the
question was so extraordinary and withal
so ambiguous that she knew not what answer
to make to it dpiie however of tiro no
womanly seuduet of the principal who what
ever may ha her religious feitb has not yet
learned thu ampfaet pnneipleof christianity
do to others as ye would that others shswld ds
unto youthanks to the uaeorraptihle virtue
fchtidhood and youth in the fetuses of then
mao f them to share with them tits menmngv
and privilege of the school and when asked
here the should ait if admitted several
ymng ladies boated by me by
after lb matidestmjoa f mtimnl on lb
pwt of ifte khofen one would bare ooppooed
bat ail oppnaitmhi on the pvt of the principal
would bare ceased but bis was aut be case
the childs admission was subjected to a se
verer test each scholar was then told by the
principal bat the question most be submitted
to tbeif parents and that if owe parent object
ed the child would not be received into the
school the neat morning nsr child went to
school as ssual but returned with her books
and other materials saying that one person
abated and that aha was thuirfnri sirluitiul
from the seminar
now sir these are the whole beta with
one important exception and that fact is that
you are the person the only person of all the
parents sending young ladies and misses to
that seminary who was hardened and mean
enough to take the responsibility of excluding
that child from school isay to you exclu
sively belongs the honor or infomy of attempt
ing to degrade an hmoeent child by excluding
her from the benefit of attending respectable
school
if thia were a private affair only affecting
myself and family i should possibly allow it to
pass without attracting public attention to it
but such is not the case it is a deliberate at
tempt to degrade and injure a large class of
persons whose rights and fadings hare been
the common sport of yoomdf and such per
sons as yourself for ages and  thiak it bit
wise to allow you to do as with impunity
thank god oppressed and plundered as we
are and bare been we are not without help
we hare a press open and free and have am
ple means by which we are able to proclaim
our wrongs as a people and your uwn infamy
and that proclamation shall be as complete as
the means in my power can make it there
is a sufficient amount of liberality in the pub
lic mind of rochester to see that justice is
done to all parties and upon that liberality i
rely the young ladies of the school who
saw the child and had the best means of de
termining whether her presence in the school
room would be offensive or degrading to them
have decided in favor of admitting her with
out a dissenting vote out of all the parents
to whom the question of her admission was
submitted not one except yourself objected
you are in a minority of one you may not
remain so there are perhaps others whom
you may corrupt and make as much like
yourself in the blindness of prejudice as any
ordinarily wicked person can be
but you are still in a minority and if  mis
take not you will be in a despised minority
you have already done serious injury to se
ward seminary three young ladies left the
school immediately after the exclusion of my
daughter and i have heard of three more who
had intended to go but who have now declin
ed going to that institution because it has giv
en its sanction to that antidemocratic and
ungodly caste i am also glad to inform
you that you have not succeeded as you hoped
to do in depriving my child of the means of a
decent education or the privilege of going to
an excellent school she had not been exclu
ded from seward seminary five hours before
she was gladly welcomed into another quite
as respectable and equally christian to the one
from which she was excluded she now sits
in a school among children as pure and as
white as you or yours and no one is offended
now i should like to know how much better
are you than me and how much better your
children than mine we are both worms of the
dust and out children are like us we dif
fer in color it is true and not much in that
respect but who is to decide which color is
most pleasing to gd or most honorable
among men but i do not wish to waste
words or argument on one whom i take to be
as destitute of honorable feeling as he has
shown himsetf full of pride and prejudice

w here art me about thttty years ago
fulton requested the use of the hall of rep
teaeutativea to deliver a lecture on steam
power and its applicability to navigation
he was denied on the ground that his scheme
was visionary and impracticable avery
few years rolled round and hi  visionary
and impracticable scheme became one of the
greatest and must important facta of modern
history and tbe one thought that was work
ing in the brain of that one man and which
he wished to communicate to the public in the
hall of representatives baa in the course ot
a very few years effected more changes and
produced greater results than all the fret and
fame of legislation and the thought and talk of
legislators ever willever can produce
that is not saying much say some for
it is not tbe intention of legislators to produce
great resultsall that they want is to get of
fice for themselves by shutting others out of
it well i will not dispute that pointper
haps it is perhaps it is not at all events
did we take their word for it we should come
to a very different conclusion for hear some
of them talk their patriotism is bounded only
by the ocean scarcely by that if they can
contrive to annex it and their philanthro
py by space that day then has gone by
our legislators would not now refuse the use
of tbe hall of representatives for a lecture
on steam power on tbe ground that the
scheme was visionary and impracticable
another discovery was made as it were
only a few days since electricity has be
come the earlier of intelligence and by its
means space may yet be almost annihilated
the statement was made to a respectable far
mer not many miles distant from where 
now write that a message could be sent from
rochester to albany in the course of two or
three minutes he stoutly denied the possi
bility of any such thing anything in rea
sonbut thats impossible he was hard
to convince but the evidence of his senses was
not to be disbelieved and he went away
wondering  what the world was coming to
it is a common remark nowadaysthatth
most intelligent men are the most credulous
this remark is in some respects true but in
other and more important respects it is false
the knowledge which intelligent men possess
and the estimate which they have formed in
their own minds oil the basis of that knowl
edge of the distant probabilities of scientific
discoverylead them at once to arrive at a con
clusion and generally a correct one of the
truth or falsehood of any alleged discovery
it is no sign of a philosophic inind to be in
credulous still less is that man deserving to
be considered intelligent who is for ever run
ning after the last discovery discoveries are
often made which after all are no discover
iesbut either he veriest humbug or the
offspring of an over heated brain the vision
ary enthusiast wishes for somethingprays
for it in the truest sense of the word his
mind is full of it and lo there it is the very
thing he wished the dreams of the millen
arians the fanaticism of the mormonsthe
power of performing miracles of many name
less sects are cases in point many believed
in them but they were not the philosophic
or intelligent there would seein to be a
periodical return to a belief in miraculous
manifestations there is nothing new un
der the sun after a certain period the old
fashion of a coat comes back again the old
tie of a cravat and the old belief in the su
pernaturaltho salem absurdities the witch
burning of judge matthews in the midland
couuties of england during tbe common
wealth and the foaming at the mouth and
miraculous conception and olbet wonder
working exhibitions of the kentish monastery
and so on back as far as there is any history
secui to indicate that it returns cornetlike at
a distant period after having travelled a cer
tain orbit changing its character awl each
time losing a portion of its grossness to suit
the more advanced civilization and intelligence
of the age in the greater number of these
cases the actors have been found to be either
grossly deluding or grossly deluded and the
believers have for the most part been the ig
norant and superstitious nor can it be other
wise where there is no bast to rest an ar
gument tbe reaaooing mao cannot reason if
be is shut p to a simple belief or a denial of
what appears to him from all his previous
conceptions of truth and falsehood to be a
mere absurdity of course he denies it if
what is asserted is contrary to all the known
laws of natures operations aid no proof ap
pears of any new mode or of any discovery
of what is perhaps old but hitherto unac
knowledged be will simply say be knows
nothing about it if n bears any resemblance

days after the defendant again accused her fa

what fare meant far accusing her vy the bihh
d the key complainant readied tha
when the defendant maned the aoveremn am
she cemphtunnt had domed knnufag are
til h ife fcfaxum to j
key up in a bible and held the handle of the
key which waa sticking out of the bible on
her finget and when the defendant drooped it
at her feet she fromedmtety reclaimed my

and you moat leave my heww directly the
judge further aahod whet waa the meaning
of such a trial by a bible and a key the
complainant mid she really could not my aa
she bad never seen or heard of soeh a thing
before when the defendant dropped the
bible and key on the floor she mid toe key
bad turned toward her complainant aad had
pointed her out as the thief and said she
would not have her in the home any lunger
when the defendant saw her again m the
street she called out to her i know you have
got the sovereign and spit at her and told
her to keep it saying may it do you no ul
this no doubt waa a very short and conve
nient way of convicting a thief but a it wan
devoid of ll reason and had no foundation
except in the credulity of a superstitious wo
man no one paid any attention to it it fa a
kind of revival of the old ordeal under a dif
ferent appearance but still trusting to s super
natural dccisioo which of course was not giv
en the falling of the key in a certain way
was as almost evety one knows tbe effect of
a fixed and unvarying law and it would
have fallen just so if there bad been no wo
man there for it to point at
i read a more recent case of popular cre
dulity in a bristol paper which i cannot
find it was to this effecta certain dines
had been unusually prevalent somewhere in
that neighborhood it attacked the cattle
first which waa no uousual occurrence it
then attacked men and women but more espe
cially children this peculiarity in its attack
led the ignorant to imagine that it was the ef
fect of the evil eyethat some persona
bad the power of bringing this disease on
those upon whom they looked these sus
pected persons were in consequence of this
belief like to have suffered and but for the
timely interference of the authorities would
have suffered the trial for w itchcraftsink
and be drowned or swiin and be lynched
these are sufficiently melancholy illustra
tions of superstition in the nineteenth century r
and show that not the intelligent but the ig
norant are the most credulous this and others
like it are the modes by which those who do
not relish the labor and have little ability to
reasou to a conclusion endeavor to arrive at
knowledge it is tkeir royal road unfor
tunately however it leaves them just as ig
norant as they wete before they tried it
but this is not all an illustration suffi
ciently remarkable and worthy of note can be
had at our own door even in this city of roch
ester were what lam about to relate told
me of any place at a distance i should not
believe it possible that any one of common
intelligence could be concerned in it but
should at once conclude that it was a mere
dream of the visionary or a scheme of the de
signing and no doubt it will be so judged by
those who read it which it is i have not
had sufficient evidence to determine no
doubt a very few days will be sufficient to de
cide the point the case is this
some time since i do not know how
long a man suddenly disappeared from a vil
lage called hydesvillc it was suspected that
he was murdered and to confirm this suspi
cion certain mysterious rappings were heard
at his house these rappings as is quin
probable are said to have been accounted
for on natural cause notwithstanding that
they have since been heard at several house
in this city the manifestation or spir
it as it is called gave instruction to dig at
the roots of a certain tree and tbe bones of
the murdered man would be found the
digging was done on the ist d and d of
august in tbe presence of hundreds and of
course the bones were not found for they
were not there the spirit now says that
they did not dig deep enough since then
the bones have been forgotten and not only
the spirit of that man but those of many oth
ers have made themselves manifest every
one indeed may have a confab with just what
spirit he likes clarkson raps to abolition
ists gall spurzheiin c to phrenologists
and those who are so minded bold long con
versations with their most intimate friends de
ceased the mode of operation is this and
to the unbelieving it appears a very round
about and clumsy contrivance tbe peroott
wishing to converse asks the question who
are you there will be no answer to that
questionbecause the spirit cannot speak
the questioner then says are you my
grandmother perhaps there will he no
answer to that and he says again  are
you spurzheiin and then there will be
quite commotion among the boards he
will then ask some question of mr spunheim
of course relating lo phrenology and as tak
ing a question in such a way and on such a
subject always presupposes a knowledge of
the answer  there needs no ghoet to toll us
that it isaltogether a very singular affair
but no leas strange than true this spirit
rapping has also clairvoyance associated with
it and by means of tbe two together the moat
wonderful revelation if they are revelaiioos
are mede
these are the facto every one can rea
son for himself on the likelihood of n spirit
going to work in that way and whether ho
woo id not have tho commonnot to say spir
itual sense to know that knocking even if
continued to all eternity has no meaning ex
cept what those who bear choose to attach
to it that there is a rapping there can be
no doubt but bow it is caused is altogether
involved in mystery tbe whole matter how

gen taylor for slavery
the following letter by an alabama corre
spondent of a boston paper shows what are
supposed in that region to be the views of
gen taylor on the subject of slavery
eutaw ala aug  
the fact that some of the whig papers in
massachusetts and in other state of new
england are insisting that gen taylor is
opmmsd to the extension of slavery in the
newly acquired territory ia looked upon here
in the south as the lest joke that has occurred
since the presidential canvass opened
there is no more doubt entertained here in
relation to the views and opinions of gen
taylor on this subject and wbat would be
hia course of action in relation thereto than
there is that the mississippi river empties
itself into the gulf of mexico
if any persons in new england or else
where are weak enough to be induced lo
suppose that general taylor would desert his
southern friends and his own interest in his
action on this subject they may undeceive
themselves at once we all know him to be
to the heart and soul with us on that all
important matter

al dix having been nominated for governor
of the state of new york by the free soil
party a question of no small degree of inter
est is presented for the consideration of the
colored voters of the state doubtless the
most of them look with favor upon the free
soil movement and intend to aid its progress
by voting for the nominees of the buffalo
convention
however anxious they may feel to do this
i trust not one of them will vote for general
dix for governor for however plausible or
conclusive their reasons may be for supporting
martin van buren for president of the united
states as the representative of the principles
embodied in the national platform erected at
buffalo they will not be held guiltless if they
vote for gen dix for governor of the slate
of new york do you ask me why  will
endeavor in my feeble manner to inform you
it is well known that martin van buren and
ninetenths of the prominent men among the
barnburners voted against the extension of
the right of suffrage and in all human proba
bility would do so again indeed not a few
of them have already declared that their sen
timents upon this subject are unchanged and
that if they were called upon to vote upon the
same question to day they would again vote
to fasten the chains of political thraldom upon
the limbs of our suffering countrymen this
being the case it is a question of vital impor
tance to colored men ist whether they can
consistently vote for a res a to fill any office
who if he had it in hiv power would deny
them the right to vote  coufess i have been
much perplexed by this question and am
still in doubt iu regard to it the only
ground upon which colored men can justify
themselves for voting for such a man to fill
any office is in regard the great national
question and that he is to fill an office in
which he will not by virtue of such office
be called upon to act in any way whatever
in regard to the extension of the right of suf
frage and furthermore concurring with
them upon all the questions upon which be
can be called upon to act by virtue of his of
fice it is all that can be required of such s
candidate it is upon this ground i propose
to vote for martin vm buren however pro
slavery his former acts may have been but
few will deny that he now stands upon the
buffalo platform the only reasonable ob
jection then that can be urged against voting
for him is that enough is not included in that
platform candor requites me to admit that
many are of this opinion some are dissatis
fied because the free soil party did not de
clare in favor of universal suffrage with
great dcfcienoe i must differ from these gen
tlemen the buffalo platform is of a national
characterestablished as the basis of a great
national party the object of which is to act
with reffercnce to gtcal national questions
a national question is ooe in the sense in
which i make use of the term upon which
congress or other officers of the national gov
ernment may be called upon to act by virtue
of their office the suffrage question is not
one of this nature no ooe holding office in
the national government can be called upon
in consequence ol holding such office to act
in regard to the right of suffrage iu the states
the most superficial observer must see at
once that the suffrage question instead of be
ing s national is only a local question con
fined to those states in which it may origi
nateand for the final settlement of which
each an devery state alooe must be held re
sponsible and not the nation at large if thia
mode of reasoning bs serreet what right haa
any one to complain because this question was
not included in the nalasoal platform erected
at buflhlo
the body that established that platform was
of a national characterassembled to consid
er upon national quasbom the suffrage
question not being one of this nature could
not be unladed to the platform erected by
that convention having spoken w regard

the only dark spot that now stains the oth

is the invidious distinction made by its cooeti
totion in regard to the exercaa of the elec
tive franchise ft several year we have
been laboring to have this foul blot removed
from the character of this great state the
antirepublican character and the withering
effects of this proscriptive policy have been
time and time again presented to the people
of this state hut all tg no purpooe actuated
by a spirit as mean as it is unjust they have
recently readopted this odious policy
how gun dix voted upon this questioa
we can better determine when we examine
his great speech on tlie bill to establish terri
torial government for oregondelivered in the
united states senate no the th day of last
jane in which be embraced the opportunity
to express his hatred and contempt of colored
men by making a mean nod unmanly attack
upon our unfortunate race so gteat was his
anxiety to heap reproach open ns that he
even descended to the ineffable meanness of
making statements that were palpably false
and which he mast have known to be such
at the time if he did not know anything
about the subject then be ought not to have
said anything about it the general wel
comes to our shores the swarming millions of
the old world among whom are many pau
pers and felons and regards them as an ele
ment of strength to the body politic and to
use his own language if shades of variety
exist in their intellectual and physical charac
ter he attributes it to the influences which
diversities of soil climate and government
have exerted upon them
forgetting that similar causes produce simi
lar effects lie can find no such apology for
us but says our race is an inferior caste at
the north and counts nothing in the estimate
physical or intellectual in the body politic
after staling what will probably as he thinks
be the result of the disabilities under which
we labar he makes the coldblooded and
heartless declaration nor is it the work of
inhumanity or wrong it is the slow but cer
tain progress of nature working out her ends
by laws so steady and yet so silent that their
operations arc only seen in their results
the feeling which gen dix evinces towards
us proves that he has a heart as icy as the
snowclad mountains of greenland such a
sentiment is only worthy of the bloody demon
of oppression again after complaining that
manumitted blacks come to our state in spite
of any discouragements it may oppose he
says all such additions to our number are
in the highest degree undesirable they add
nothing to our strength moral or physical
he finally winds up by saying if the
 free blacks were were removed from
the state its strength and prosperity would
be proportionally increased c these ex
tracts taken from his speech delivered on tire
th of june prove what his sentiments were
about two months since there is no evi
dence before us to show that his views upon
this subject have undergone any change the
presumption is they have not can colored
men then assist in elevating him to the of
fice of governor of the state of new york
in which office lie may be called upon to act
on the suffrage question and upon other laws
that may affect us vitally every colored
man must answer with an emphatic no
if it be the duty of colored men to with
hold their votes from gen dix for reasons
which i have assigned is it not also the duty
of their professed friends who are desirous of
improving their condition morally mentally
and politically to do the same have col
ored men as members of the body politic
any duties to perform which are not equally
binding upon all other men certainly not
if then it be the duty of colored men to
withhold their votes from gen dix for gov
ernor of the state of new york and no one
will deny that it is because he would not
only not extend to them their political rights
but by declaring that our presence in the
state is in the highest degree undesirable
and by intimating that it would be a blessing
to the state if the  free blacks were
banished from it shows that if be had it in
his power he would deprive us those
rights we already possess if this be the
case i ask is it not the duty of abolitionists
for i mean them our professed friends to
refuse to vote for him for the same reason
let no man dare answer these questions in
the negative these propositions are self
evident they need no arguments to sustain
them
i call upon the editors of the north star
as faithful watchmen upon the wall to sound
the tocsin of alarm and thunder into the care
of the colored voters of the state what will be
the fearful consequences of voting for gen
dix
let ward and garnet smith and cram
tnell and all others speak out and endeavor
to save our countrymen from the everlasting
infamy of having voted for gen dix or any
other mao tinder similar circumstances for
governor of the state our friends may tell
asit was necessary for them to do so for the
purpose of securing the triumph of the free
soil party but let us prove to them and the
world if it can only triumph at the nxpeaer
of the degradation and crushed hopes of our
deeply wronged and injured countrymen we
would rather see the buffalo platform sink to
rise no more into the deep dark sea where
toe waves of oklivioa can roll ever it forever

a llobte youth
a lad of boston the son of a widow and
but sixteen years of age recently left this city
for the island of cuba to engage as clerk in
an extensive wholesale commercial establish
ment tl is establishment was represented
by gentlemen of this city who professed to
be connected with it as a large respectable
and honorable concern the boy was to have
only one hundred dollars for the first year the j
knowledge of the business and the chance of
being connected with such a concern being a
sutheient recompense and inducement the
second year he was to have a liberal salary
the prospect was sufficient for the most
ample anticipations of the mother and son
hence the boy was taken from a flour store
in this city where he served in the capacity
of clerk and on the representations of the
gentlemen concerned and the advice of friends
he embarked for st jago de cuba his pas
sage out was paid by the gentlemen who held
out the inducement when he arrived there
what was his surprise to find instead of a
large commercial establishment the merest
grnggery not a commercial establishment
of any kind hut simply a bara retail rum
brandy and gin establishment
this is not what i came for said the
boy he refused to mix the first drop of
liquor he immediately secreted himself
from the establishment sought out the first
opportunity to make his way home and
actually worked his iassage before the mast
on board a vessel bound to boston where he
arrived not many days since ought not such
a boy to be encouraged who wants one of
the sort in his employment temp jour

colored national convention
the following extracts from papers pub
tubed in cleveland will aatisfy oar friends
abroad that some importance ia attached to
the efforts of colored men for aelf elevation
even by our white fellow citizens to oat
mind a more hopeful aigo of progteas and
improvement has not appeared than this same
colored national convention it was at
tended hy the rank and file rather than by
the old acknowledged leaders of our people
and what was done was with hearty good
will and without any previous concert
convention of colored people
i the national convention of colored
people met at tbe court house yea
terday and organised by appointing
frederick douglass of rochester n
y president several committees
 were appointed and some speeches
made during the day
the number of colored men present
was not large but they were highly re
spectable in appearance and mani
fested a high degree of talent mr
douglass presides with dignity and
ability he is not only a distinguished
man but worthy of distinction and a
gentleman
the court house was crowded with
i spectators who appeared deeply inter
ested in the proceedings ana seemed
to sympathise with this band of men
just breaking from slavery ignorance
and degradation and taking position
among the free intelligent and enlight

ed freemen this convention com
menced its sessions in this city on
wednesday the oth instant and con
tinued its labors during that and the
two following dayssome sixty or
seventy delegates were in attendance
from various parts of the northern
states among others henry bibb and
frederick douglass both of whom
as all are aware were formerly slaves
in the south
mr douglass was madetpresident
of the convention the duties of which
office he performed with an ability and
dignity that would have done honor to
more experienced men of the white
race we had the pleasure of listening
to his remarks on the occasion of his
taking the chair and purer language
nobler sentiments and more glowing
eloquence wc never listened to one
object of the convention as stated by
him was to devise means by which the
colored race might become more ele
vated in life have higher aims and live
in such a manner as to command the
respect of their fellowmen and gain
for themselves a bestowal of those rights
of which they are now so unjustly de
prived few inducements were held
out to colored men to become useful
mechanics and tradesmenthe white
man had nearly monopolized these avo
cations of life or at least had made the
customs of society such that the black
man with the same natural ability
could not comnete with him but
said the orator temperance morali
ty christianitythese the white man
cannot monopolize and in these as
well as in the world of labor we can
and must show that we are equal to any
other race and the high moral tone
of the entire address and the mass of
intellectual heads and faces before him
and the resolutions adopted by the con
vention as well as the spirited discus
sions and close logical reasoning which
they elicited all gave ample testimony
that his words were true and that they
came from the heart and reached the
hearts of those to whom they were ad
dressed
for two or three successive evenings
large and enthusiastic meetings were
held at the tabernacle church w here
addresses were made by bibb doug
lass delany lyle and others all giv
ing confirmation strong that an op
portunity for the cultivation of their in
tellects and physical powers is all that
is necessary to make africs sons our
equal brethren
viewing this convention in its moral
aspect we must say we rejoice that it
has been held for we can see in it
the germ of that harvest which the
friends of humanity will one day reap
as the reward of their labors it will
tell for good in its effects on the nomi
nally free colored people of our land
inasmuch as it will raise their hopes of
standing on higher and better ground
and incite them to make yet higher at
tainments in all that can add to their
characters as useful citizens and heart
felt christians its proceedings when
given to the world will have a tenden
cy to break down much of that preju
dice which teaches that god has crea
ted the black man with an inferior in
tellect and we are constrained to bail
it as one of the evidences of the good
time coming when a universal broth

the land among all the inhabitants
thereof for this we laborfor this

free soil principles arc popular in
new orleans especially among the
white population who earn their bread
by industrial pursuits and who feci
most deeply the blighting stain which
slavery casts upon their position in so
ciety it is estimated by a gentleman
recently from new orleans that the
greater part of the white population of
that city is of this class and if polled
tomorrow an overwhelming majority
of whites he alleges would vote iu
favor of abolishing slavery they had
a free soil meeting in lafayette one of
the suburbs of new orleans a few days
ago which was well attended the
mayor of lafayette who was present
at this meeting thiukiog that the lan
guage of some of the orators was

writings calculated to make certain
classes of their population dissatisfied

talleyrand and arnold
there was a day when talleyranc
arrived in havre hot foot from paris
it was in the darkest hour of the frencl
revolution pursued by the blood
hounds of the reign of terror strippci
of every wreck of property talleyranc
secured a passage to america in a shij
about to sail he was going a beggai
and a wanderer to a strange la d tc
earn his bread by daily labor
is there an american staying at
your house he asked the landlord o
his hotel i am bound to cross the
water and would like a letter to sorm
person of influence in the new world
the landlord hesitated a momentand
then said
there is a gentleman up stairs
either from america or britain whe
ther an american or englishman i can
not tell
he pointed the way and talleyrand
who in his life was bishop prince
and prime minister ascended the
stairs a miserable supplicant he
stood before the strangers door and
entered
iu the far corner of a dimlylighted
room sat a gentleman of some  years
with his arms folded and his head
bowed on his breast from a window
directly opposite a flood of light poured
over his forehead his eyes looking
from beneath his downcast browsgazed
in talleyrands face with a peculiar and
searching expression his face was
striking in its outline the mouth and
chin indicative of an iron will his
form vig trous even with the snows of
fifty winters was clad in a dark but
rich and distinguished costume
talleyrand advanced stated that as
he was an american he solicited his
kind and feeling offices he poured
forth his history in eloquent french and
broken english

forced to fly to the new world with
out a friend or a home you arc ao
american give me i beseech you
a letter of yours so that i may be able
to earn my bread lam willing to toil

have filled me with such horror that a
life of labor would be a paradise to a
career of luxury in france you will
give me a letter to one of your friends
a gentleman like you has doubtless
tnany friends
the strange gentleman rose with
a look that talleyrand never forgot be
retreated towards tlie door of the next
chamber his head downcast his eyes
looking from beneath his darkened brow
he spoke as he retreated his voice
was full of meaning
 am the only man born in the new
world who can hand to god
and say i have not a friend m l one in
all america
talleyrand never forgot the over
whelming sadness of that look which
accompanied these words

dean swift and the tailor
a tailor in dublin near the residence
of the dean took it into the ninth
part of his head that he was specially
and divinely inspired to interpret the
j prophecies and especially the book ot
  revelations quitting the shopboard
h turned out a preacher or rather a
prophet until his customers hfd left
his shop and bis family were likely to
famish his monomania was well
known to the dean who benevolently
watched for an opportunity to turn the
current of his thoughts one night
the tailor as be fancied got especial
revelation to go and convert dean
swift and next morning took up his
line of march to the deanery the
j dean whose study was furnished with
a glass door saw the tailor approach
 and instantly surmised the nature ol
i his errand throwing himself into an
attitude ofsolemnity and thoughtful
ii ness with the bible opened before him
and his eyes fixed on the tenth chapter
of revelation he awaited his approach
the door opened and the tailor an
nounced in an unearthly voice
i dean swift lam sent by the ai
mighty to announce to you
come in my friend said the
dean i am in great trouble and no
doubt the lord has sent you to help me
out of my difficulty
j this unexpected welcome inspired
the tailor and strengthened his assur
ance in hiu own prophetic character
and disposed him to liirten to the disclo
sure
my friend said the dean i
have just been reading the th chapter
of revelations and am greatly distress
ed at a difficulty i have met with and
you are the very man sent to help me
out here is an account of an angel
that came down from heaven who was
so large that he placed one foot on the
earth and lifted up his hands to heaven
j now my knowledge of mathematics
continued the dean has enabled me
to calculate exactly the size and form
of this angel but  am in great difficul
ty for i wish to ascertain how much
cloth it will take to make him a pair of
breeches and as that is exactly in your
line of business i have no doubt the
lord has sent you to show me
this exposition came like an electric
shock to the poor tailor he rushed
from the house ran to the shop and a
sudden revulsion of thought and feeling
came over him making breeches was
exactly in his lino of business he re
turned to his occupation thoroughly
cured of his prophetical revelation by
the wit of the dean

a man carrdo anything that he is de
termined upon and goes at work rightly

acquired as a few hundred dollars when
wealth is made the business of life

i have been as brave as napoleonas
philosophical as franklinas wise as

as benovolent as howard if they
had known their own powers but
fearing their own shadows and turning
aside from the mole hills in their path
they lingered in obscurity and died
without being either curses or blessings
to the world than to have been
scourges to mankind it was better but
who can estimate the amount that might
have been accomplished by millions
who have passed off the stage without
leaving a single memento behind let
it be yours o man to live for some
