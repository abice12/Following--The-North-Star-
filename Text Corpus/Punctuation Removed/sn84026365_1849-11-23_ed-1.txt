slavery as it is
we dnubt whether those of our fel
lowcitizens who were active in defeat
ing the emancipation party at the into
election and who are doing all in their
power to perpetuate indefinitely the in
stitution ol negro slavery have ever
devoted an hours serious attention in
the consideration ofslavery as it is
even in the rniid form of its existence in 
kentucky
there is as appears to us such a
wide difference between freedom and
slavery that if the one is right the
other must be wrong if the one is necj
essary for the promotion of our spinfuj
al health and our temporal wellbeing j
the other must necessarily he produtj
live of deep ignorance degradation and
suffering
this proposition would seem to he so
plain as to render argument superflu
ous and yet christian men with the 
bible in their hands and words of pat
riotism and piety on their lips can
openly defend human slavery and treat
those wild would remove it with ridicule j
and abuse
as an illustration of one of the phases j
tn which negro slavery presents itseli j
to a professing christian people we
would ask attention to a few statements
of facts as taken from one of our daily
papers
in the louisville democrat of th j
december last we find iris paragraph
under the head of police reports
a negro was arraigned on thej
charge of stealing clothes from the
store of b b anderson su co
the judge asked where were the
articles stolen t
the marshal said the gentleman
had retained them and did not come
into court to prosecute
his honor directed the police offi
cers to bring into court all articles found
in the possession of thievesas it was i
the only means by which they could bej
induced to come forward and prosecute
in the present case he ordered the ne
gro to be dischargedremarking to the
officers that when they found a negro
pilfering to take him out and give him
just a many as he could t cell bear and
not bring him before the court
now if this direction of the honj
judge to the police officers of tins city
is the law of slavery and we have noj
reason to believe h is not wiutt seeni
rity lias the negro against unjust vio
lence the police officers are the uc
cusers witnesses judge and executionvj
ers with no limit to the punishment j
they may see fit to inflict except the
capability oj the negro to bear it nav j
more suppose the officer under the in
fluence of those passions to which wo j
are all liable should give the negrol
rather more than he could uell b ar
and death should follow as the couej
quence by what law could you punish j
the officer the crime if it he a emu
under the instructions of the hon poj
lice judge j could only be denomina
ted a mistake as to the cap thd ty ofj
the negro to bear a whipping
now we do not say that this state of
things is unnecessary and wrong 
slavery be right for longcontinued
slavery may have made the negro so
ignorant degraded and brutish as to
render it necessary that he should be
summarily punished m h ut a form o
trial the negro we suppose furnish
es no exception to the id adage treat
a man like a dog and he will become a
dig hut we beg leave to suggest to
those of our fciiowcitizcns who regard
these unfortunate creatures as endowed j
with the feelings and failings of our
common humanty whether it becomes
us us an honorable highminded aitl
christian people to punish them for the
bgitimjte consequences of our own
conduct surelv it were the ailm
policy to labor diligently and earnestly
for the removal of an evil which cr ates
 necessity for such manifest injustice i
the north star
as a further illustration of the na
ture of slavery as it must necessarily
exist if it exist at all we give anothe
statement of fact taken from one of ou
daily papers in the courier of oct
oth we find this statement
negro max shot a negro mat
belonging to howard christy esq
was shot about  or  oclock ou wei
nesday night on penrl street nea
walnut by mr wm forwood mr
forwood saw the man steal a saddle
from a horse opposite his house and ot
attempting to arrest him he resisted
and while endeavoring to escape mr
f shot and wounded him on th
matter being represented to judge
jove of the police court he refusec
to lake cognizance of the case we
were told last night that the ball passec
entirely through the body of the negre
man and that he was not expected tc
live
and on tiie succeeding day the fol
lowing appears in the same paper
the negro man who was shot by
young mr forwood on wednesday
night last died yesterday morning
mr forwood is well known asoneol
our most respectable citizens and is an
active and intelligent member of the
baptist church we suppose he acted
in this matter in conformity with what
he considered to be his duty ns he vol
untarily came into court the next mor
ning and submitted himself to the ex
amination of the lawful authorities
the judge it would seem refused to
take cognizance of the case and here
so far as anything has been made pub
lic the matter is at an end
now we seriously submit the ques
tion to those of our fellowcitizens w ho
recognize the negro as a human being
subject to all the frailties and sins ol
our common humanity redeemed by
the blood of a common saviour accoun
table to a common father and to be
judged at the same solemn judgment
seat whether this state of things is right
and whether it is the proper vocation of
christian ministers to labor heart and
hand for the perpetuation of a system
that renders it necessary for negroes to
be thus treated
is there not something singularly ab
surd in the species of christianity which
protesses to recognize the negro as a
brother and vet in many respects treats
him like a horse or a dog and can
there possibly be sincerity in the pray
er which is so often ode red by slavery
defending christians in the presence of
whites and blacks commencing with
those words of touching simplicity and
fearful sublimity our father
which art in heaven c
wo might add much on this aspect
of human slavery as exhibited in the
extracts here quoted but we prefer to
submit the facts t the consideration of
of all sensible men just as they ore
being sensible that they plead more
powerfully for the cause of an oppres
sed and deeply wronged race of people
than any comments we can offer

nonslaveholders in slave
states
it has ever been the policy of slavery
to deny education social position po
litical rights and even the means of
living to the poor white men the non
slaveholders in the south the planter
takes his northern newspaper or his
southern magazine but no cheap lite
rature is provided for the families of the
poorer nonslaveholders who comprise
threefourths of the white population of
the slave states on this point mr
wise spoke for the planter when he
said on the floor of congress there
is no newspaper published in my dis
trict and i hope there never will be
the planter sends to the colleges of the
north or aids in building at the south
expensive institutions for the education
of the sons of the wealthy but the chil
dren of the poor must grow up in all the
ignorance and degradation of semibar
bnrism in their social condition poor
white folks are considered by the mas
ter and even by the slave as one step
lower down in the scale of social life
than either there is no escape for
these while they continue in a slave
state their minds are in two height
ened a state to learn any of the mechan
iciarts or avail themselves of any mod
ern invention to labor by the side of
the slave when they may and starve
or steal when they must is their only
resource for political rights even the
right of suffragethe only one they
nominally possess is legislated away
from thern for the system of voting viva
voce prevents its being an expression
of their own will in kentucky at this
moment they are just being to discuss
the propriety of introducing the ballot
and in the palmetto state they have
now n man in jail and hope to accom
plish his death because he has dared
to come between the w hite slaves of the
south and their mastershis only crime
be i fig the circulation of an address to
poor white folks showing them their
rights and how to get them
of the means of living allowed by the
land and labor monopolists of the souih
to those that have waxen poor beside
them we have hardly need to speak
the wretched remnant that do contrive
to escape ucross the onto and that are
i seen in one horse wagons d dogcarts
in gocarts and ou foot making their
wav to the interior tell the std story
not only of their own sufferings but ol
the greater number left behind to min
ister to the wants of some whom even
the very slaves make cn iribution
among themselves and solicit charity
front the planters
although these things have been and
are yet truo ot the poor whites in the
south there is still hope for them a
i little of th light thrown out by the
right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren
printing press has reached them they
too have beard the echo of the shout
sent up by he millions of europe ai
they burst although but for a moment
the chains they had for ages worn
the imprisonment of barrett is but one
of a chain of events destined to wake
the democracy of the slave states
read an article signed union re
cently published in the danville va
register for the author of which the
editor vouches is irom the pen of one
of the first statesmen in the state
the intention of the article is to show
that the objects of mr calhouu and mr
garrison are one i will transcribe for
you a few extracts first as to mr cal
houn and his schemes
extremes meet the ultraist of
south carolina and the ultraist of mas
sachusetts are holding out their hand
to each other that the leaders o
south carolina are ripe lor dangerous
action there is no doubt and the only
hope of escape a faint one it i  true is
that the people will repudiate their rash
advisers the state weak as she is
in numbers in territory and in wealth
is nevertheless potent for mischief
on this point we think union mista
ken not even the politicians of south
carolina are so benighted as to hope to
sustain in this age of the world a slave
state as an independeut existence with
no resources of freedom on which to
draw as need be for character or
men or money some of these diffi
culties arc referred to in the paper but
the portion of the address most worthy
of special notice is that which records
the present position and past efforts of
the poor folks of the south to attain
some of their rights
it is asked why the free laborer at
present is not voting against the slave
holder the answer is at handthe
free laborer is in a hopeless minority
give to him a hope of success and you
will find him with the new allies which
disunion will give to him did not a
very faint hope of success in  draw
out an alarming abolition vote in vir
ginia did not the great slaveholding
county of albermarle sustain at the
polls one of its representatives who led
the abolition movement when asked
how lie came to be returned his char
acteristic reply was i appealed to the
poor folks this appeal has always
been responded toby the poor folks
and always will can any one point to
u single individual in virginia who has
been weakened in popular favor by aid
ing with abolition in  is not mc
dowell who won his first and greatest
laurels as an orator by an abolition
speech cherished by the democracy
has preston lost caste with the whigs
or has the richmond enquirer had its
subscription list curtailed by the lapse
of
the drift of the address is to show
the monopolists of the south who hold
twelve hundred millions in human flesh
and nearly all the lands that the whigs
the conservative party of the country
who go for things as they are and not
as they ought to be can alone save
them from yielding the government of
the country to the masses each free
laborer having the political power of the
master of a hundred slaves it is
quite as useful in showing the free de
mocrocy of both north and south where
in lies their strength and who are the
enemies of freedom w e w

the question of slavery as a moral

the slave question not only ought to
be but has actually become and must
continue to be until it is settled one
of the leading questions of the age es
pecially in this land of boasted chris
tianity and freedom where the exist
ence of slavery creates an anomaly too
glaring to be overlooked and where
the antagonistic influences of such dia
metrically opposite elements cannot
fail to secure an agitation that cannot
possibly be quelled but by the disap
pearance of one or the other of the bel
ligerent forces leaving the other in
possession of the field the experi

can no longer answer the ends of those
who use them
into every struggle the slave ques
tion inevitably enters scarcely an im
portant national question can be deba

statesmen most intent on stifling the
question of slavery are nevertheless
compelled to discuss it themselves and
to place themselves and the country in
a position in which the discussion must
inevitably he pushed forward the ac
tion of the federal government in its
foreign and domestic policy cannot be
understood by any person wiio does not
understand the nature the character

influences ofslavery from these con

intelligent american citizen the slave
question must of necessity be examin

to understand the subject of american
slavery is simply to be ignorant of the
politics of my country and to say
that i will not diligently examine the
subject is to say that i will content my
selfto remain a citizen of a republic

understand
the question of slavery or of its abo

the selfevident truths of our declara

be retained and preserved or whether
they shall be undermined by the oppo

would we do if we could and what

for solution do they not deserve our
attention
christianity enjoins the inquiry on
this subject by commanding us to do s

whig state contention and
slavery
the whig state convention recent
ly assembled at syracuse to nominate
slate officers issued an address and
i resolutions professing strong decided
ground against the extension of sla
j very so much in the opinion of the
political profligates who made up the
i majority of that convention was nec
essary to cover up thejr shameless
abandonment of free princifles at
the election when they supported a
slaveholder for president who was
nominated by a convention which dar
ed not pass a single resolution then
they might have secured the election of
a president ami congress true to free
dom but on the contrary they allowed
a declaration in favor of freedom to be
toted down withort a word in its defence
they claim to be the ardent and
exclusive champions of freedom was
ever hypocrisy more apparent we
copy from the syracuse reveille a
neutral paper the following notice of
the jmsitim of that party on the slavery
question
resolved that recognizing the re
striction of slavery within its present
limits a one of the cardioal principles
of our political faith we pledge our
setvea to our fellow citizens end the
country to exercise to the utmost all
the power we may posses to preven
the extension of slavery over a singl
foot of free soil
this says the writer is the length
and breadth of the whig platform ol
i this state on the subject of slavery
is this what the whig party expect
ed a distinct recognition of slavery
within its present limits is a clear
sanction of its continuance in the district
j of columbia it keeps up those acccß
sed slave pens under the eyes of the
capitol and recognizes the sending oti
of scarred and chained droves or
slaves from the markets and sham
j bles of the capitol for the rice and
j sugar plantations of the presi
i dent on the shores of the mississippi
i and the rio grande notone word
is said in favor of the power and duty
of congress to abolish slavery and the
slave trade in the district but on the
contrary the existence and contix
j uance of slavery within its present
tirniis is put forth a  a cardinal point
of the whig creed
the truth cannot be disguised that
the whig party is ruled ly that class

the following is an extract from a
report in the western reverse chron
icle of a speech recently delivered at
framington trumbull county ohio
by hon j r giddings note the
i facts which show how the northern
traitors to freedom are rewarded by the
present administration
slavery and the slave trade exist in
the district of columbia by a law pas
sed by the representatives of the whole
people it is a national lawit is the
law of the people and as such supports
slavery there the guilt of slavery
and the slave trade is upon the entire
people of this union it is for them to
free themselves of the guilt it is for
you to tree yourselves of the guilt he
said if the audience could but have
been at washington on the th april
 and have seen a band of fifty
three slaves march over pennsylvania
avenue in the capitol of this nation
then they could appreciate the mon
strosity of this guilt that coffle was
headed by hope h slatter the notori
ous slavedealer of the district aided
by a half dozen slavedrivers with
clubs and bowteknives who were ar
ranged on each side of the procession
there were inon in that procession he
knew there were the edmondsons
and who has not heard of them there
were two sisters of that fiflnily as air
as comely and as accomplished as any
of the ladies of jefferson county there
was also a brother of the girls who had
been reared in refined society and was
a perfect gentleman he was a man
ofstrong mind and superior intelligence
in his intercourse with man he exhibited
equal it not superior intelligence and
refinementmore mind and genius
than your president ofthe united states
and these persons so refined so intelli
gent and accomplished were being
marched in the capitol of your nation
for a southern plantation their soon to
end their miserable existence under the
lash of the merciless slave driver in
that procession there was agony and
anguish unutterable despair was de
picted upon every countenance in
the procession was a wife torn from her
home m the absence of her husband
he followed up and attempted to take
a last farewell and instantly the club
of a driver felled him quivering and ap
parently lifeless to the ground such
are the occurrences at your capitol
under the national flag last winter
mr gott introduced his resolution to
abolish this traffic this was done
without consultation parties had not
time tadrill their members each man
voted as he felt and as hi  principles l
dictated the resolution passed by a
large majority taylor was elected
president the party began to see
where it would lead them unless some
thing was done northern men could
not expect favor from the new execu
tive a motion was made to reconsid
er wentworth moved to lay this mo
tion on the table which would have
disposed of the motion to reconsider
and the resolution would have been in
force a vote was taken on the motion
of wentworth and twentysix northern
vvhigs and twentytwo northern dem
ocrats voted against the motion the
motion was lost the motion to recon
sider was then postponed for two weeks
then debated and finally went into the
calendar and was not heard of again
during the session the motion of
wentworth was dodged by several
doughfafhgs among whom was jacob
collamer of vermont it was known
that he was a candidate for a cabinet
office he was in bis seat and voted
immediately preceding and subsequent
to the vot i on wentworths motion
general taylor soon come to wash
ington he gave collamer the office
of post master general at a salary of
 he offered truman smith
who voted against weotworths motion
the office of secretary of the home de
partment owing to the position of
parties at home trumans friends ad
vised him not to accept caleb b
smith alexander irvin jasper e bra
dy t o edwards and several othen
from the north who voted against
wentworths motion and in favor ol
the slave trade have all received lucra

what man that voted for wentwortki
motion has received au appointment
not one general taylor had not giv
en a word or a smile to those who voted
if on the other side or in other words
voted against slavery and the slave
i trade

will come with instructions to present

by this means the french cabinet will
recover from the appearance of conces
sion in the prompt appointment of m
poussins successor but mr clayton
is quite certain that this intercourse
with m bois le compte will be of the
most friendly character and that the
matter in dispute will be disposed of
very readily and in a manner altogeth

there is no ground for the statement

speculations are rife at the capitol
j in reference to the speakership of the

the tenor of his remarks on the subject
does not indicate that he and his assoei

is of the opinion that a vay different or

course mr holmes may pursue it is
very clear that no organization at all

since our last we have chronicled the
passage of sixteen slaves who have
made their escape through this city
eight of whom are from kent county in
our state and eight from near the head
of sassafras md about  miles from
wilmington some of the slaves from
kent county applied to the steamboat at
shorts landing but were refused a
passage but afterwards made their es
cape up the state by land crossing the
wilmington bridge under the very nose
of the constables who were watching
for them they brought intelligence
to the abolitionists here that a few more
were concealed some few miles from our
city but did not like to come m for fear
of being caught one of our most ac
tive abolitionists sent a messenger in
search of them and after looking for
them for a day without effect at last
found them being conducted into the
city by a man whom they had no sus
picion of being an abolitionist at the
same time four more from near the
head of sassafras md also made their
escape a day or so after a colored
man attempted to get off his wife and
family who were slaves to mr george
davis of the head of sassafras md
the brother of his wife betrayed them
and when they got about eight mileson
the road they were overtaken and had
to take to the bushesthe pursuers
took after themthe man attempted to
save one of his children and ran with
it on his back for some time hut at last
had to abandon it to make his own es
cape his wife and children were cap
tured
the above mentioned case we are in
formed is one of peculiar hardship
the colored man who is free has been
working for several years with mr da
vis his wages being kept to pay for the
freedom of his wife and family his
wages it is stated amounted to tendol
lars more than the price agreed to be
paid for their freedombut when he
demanded it mr davis old him to
clear out and if he come on the
place again he would shoot him
j whiie mr davis was in chase of the
above mentioned colored mans family
four more valuable slaves belonging to
him took that opportunity of running
away they reached this city and
i made good their escape to the north
if the statement of tne case of the
colored mans wife and children men
tioned above is correct it is one of pc
i culiar hardship and it would be wel
i for the citizens of diary land to enquir
into the matter such instances serv
to prejudice the mind of the people mor
j forcibly against the slaveholder if in
correct we shall cheerfully publish i
refutation
we have reason to believe that tbs
above are not all tha slaves who hsvi
made their escape through our city re
ceotly the abolitionists are extreme

believe that the underground railroac

very insecure both in maryland and

the labors of mr ray are confined
almost exclusively to the colored popu
i lation of the city of new york by an
understanding with the executive com
mittee he has been permitted to de
vote the greater portion of his labors
for the past year to the church which
he had previously gathered they
have not been blessed with any special
outpouring of the spirit of god yet a
good degree of prosperity external and
internal has been granted to them
the number of permanent and regular
members of the congregation has been
increased the church at the date of
mr rays report consisted of thirtr
five members during the summer
months the sabbath school has con
tained more than forty scholars in the
winter the number was less general
missionary labor in the street and from
house to house although receiving less
attention than in former years has not
been entirely neglected and the col

will be more those of a missionary in

in concluding his report mr ray
calls the attention of the committee
and the patrons of the society to a
prominent obstacle in the way of the
progress of religion among the colored
population of a large city excluded
by a cruel prejudice from the edifices
erected for religious worship by their
white brethren or driven into a dis
graceful corner they have been com
pelled in self respect to seek places of
worship where separated from the
prejudices which have hitherto oppres
sed them and prevented the progress
of the gospel that they might worship
god and cultivate their religious affec
tions without opposition and free from
the contumelies under which they have
suffered in a few instances only have
they been able to accomplish this
they cannot like their brethren among
the whites even when possessed of
equal wealth secure an eligible situa
tion for their assembling together
the prejudice that meets them in what
ought to be to them a sanctuary fol
lows them as they seek to purchase or
to rent a place in which to worship god
in the church it manifests itself by shut
ting them up in a corner in the street
by enhancing the price of property al
ready almost beyond their reach until
they are entirely unable to procure it
or by raising objections to having loca
tions they might select occupied by
colored congregations it is respect
fully submitted whether an impartial
christianity does not require that wo
should do more for this proscribed
class and that all missionary bodies
should so direct their labors as to
break down the prejudice which
strengthens the bonds of the enslaved
and crushes the upward tendencies of
the free jimer missionary

once on a time there was a gentle
man who won an elephant in a raffle
it was a very fine elephant and very
cheap at the price the gentleman paid
for his chance
but the gentleman had no place to
put it in
nobody would take it off his hands
he couldnt afford to feed it
he was afraid of the law if he turn
ed it loose into th streets
he was too humane to let it starve
he was afraid to shoot it
in short he was in a perplexity very
natural to a gentleman with moderate
means a small house common feelings

plaintiff had furnisher said polly w ith tempo
rary relief and support that said polly was
in great want c and in truth all these
facta were not denied by the defendants
the defendants rested then defense on
the ground that aaui polly tenone was a

page  which reads aa follows
sec  that nothing in this act shall
be so construed as to enable any black or

up his opinion of the law which he announc
ed in substance as follows that he was
not entirely clear in his mind but thought
blacks and mulattoes were not within the

letter from the editor
pkovidence r  nov 
there is always more or less interest felt in
 absent friends in the meetings and conventions
of those laboring upon common ground for
i the overthrow of slavery while the anti
slavery cause is neglected and despised
while those who are engaged in it are the
subjects of miarrpresentation calumny and
h abuse by a corrupt press and a canting pul
pit and while abolitionist are bound togeth
t r by the strong ties of common suffeiings
and sympathies this interest will continue to
be felt to the most dislant extremeties of our
ranks antislavery meetings are a sign of
i antislavery life discussionbold hot and
j exciting is the natural element of the latter
it delights to meet the people face to faceto
look into the eyes and hearts of men speech
speech the live calm grave clear pointed
warm sweet melodious and powerful human
voice is iis chosen instrumentality the pen
j is not to be despised but who that knows
anything of the might and electricity of speech
as it bursts from hearts of fire glowing with
light and life will not acknowledge the supe
riority over the pen for immediate effect as
tronomy zoology botany conchology
chemistry and geology are fit subjects for
the pen but humanity justice and liberty de
mand he service of the living human voice
j aud the power of exalted eloquence as their
exponent
slavery can use the pen at the north with
considerable impunity it can gild its deadly
poison w ith beautiful aud attractive colors and
escape with little harm ink and paper have
no sense of shamethey cannot blush under
exp sure nor smart under rebuke and indig
nation but just let slavery present its bra
zen front to the great congregation of living
breathing human beings and its ugly phiz
is at once covered with confusion the pro
slavery clergy and doughfaced politicians
know this and therefore seldom venture into
onr meetings fot the purpose of opposing us
face to face they silently basely lay in
wait to catch us in our words that they may
use our mistakes and foibles against us when
we are not allowed to reply they know
that slavety is a poor orator when confronted
by an abolitionist and they wisely keep si
lence but enough
i took up my pen to give a hasty account of
the fourteenth annual meeting of the rhode
island state antislavery society it com
menced iis deliberations in this city on wed
nesday morning at ii oclock and continued
till thursday night nearly  oclock the
occasion lias been one of a highly gratifying
haracier  he spacious mechanics hall
i was at times etowded at every point with a
v y respectable class of people who listened
l w nil profound attention to the glorious thoughts
and truths that poured at limes from the plat
lorm hie first morning meeting ws but
tbnlv attendedthe abolitionists themselves
bad not come in and at the hour appointed
the vacant hall presented a sad appearance
abolitionists should be prompt on such occa
sion as much depends upon a right com
mencement for a happy conclusion though
the ptesent meeting may sem tobe s contra
diction to tins statement we started vad
and desponding but ended in the most chtr
fui and hopeful spirit the speaking
commenced on thursday morning by c c
burleigh who in his usnil masterly style
reviewed the present aspect of antislavery
i
iffars north and sooth the coedien
from w hich was that anlrsuvery men have
the strongest ground for encouragement hie
speech ess listened to by the scattered few
with a thoughtful stillness which showed that
his words were received into good and baoeet
hearts mr burleigh was followed by dr
walter chanoing of boston in a highly in
teresting and touching speech he alluded
in a delicate and feeling manner to the name
be bore and the state of bis birth congrat j
ula ted on on the goodness of oar cease and
the certainty of ita success described his emo
tions while listening in the british parlia
ment forty years ago to a speech from the lipe
of the meekspirited bat dauntless wants
force contrasted the wilberforce of that
day with the wilberforce of history and ar
gued therefrom a day of triumph and glory to
the present antislavery movement he said
he had seen william lloyd garrison dragged
through the streets of boston only a few
years ago with a halter about his person but
behold the change the man thas persecu
ted has become great in the land and his
opinions have overspread the country and are
echoed on the banks of the pacific by a hun
dred thousand voices this sentiment was
loudly cheered by the audience showing that
they appreciated its truth as well as its beau
ty the dr was in the city on a professional
visit and was compelled to leave at an early
period greatly to the regret of the audience
the morning session ended by a few remarks
from myself in the afternoon the meeting
was much larger than that held in tbe morning
and presented a livelier appearance the fa
ces of old and dear friends greeted me from
various parts of the hall which told me that
anti slavery was not dead in rhode island
that there were yet a chosen few who were
not weary in well doing eider cheeney
was upon the platform when i reached the
hall some one had informed him that
thoughts were entertained of abandoning the
r i antislavery society he had only
heard that the thought had been entertained
but the bate mention of it had called him to
his feeland he poured forth hia feelings and
arguments against it in a strain of eloquence
which frequently elicited the hearty approba
tion of the audience mr cheeney referred
to the religious views of mr garrison and
declared that though a believer and a minister
of the gospel of christ he felt happy to occu
py the antislavery platform with william
lloyd garrison here a theological alterca
tion took place between the speaker and mr
ray potter who denounced mr garrison aa
an infidel and a pope and said that when
mr garrison had any influence in the rhode
island society he ray potter had never
been treated with respect and courtesy in its
meetings this controversy soon spent itself
by letting it alone and the proceedings again
went on regularly the annual report was
read by cyrus m burleigh a business
committee to prepare resolutions was appoint
ed aud several pertinent speeches were made
and the meeting adjourned to meet again at
halfpast six oclock in the evening
at the time appointed the house was crowd
ed and the platform reinforced there was
no lack of speakers c c burleigh charles
lenox remond c m burleigh george
bradburn mrs sophia liitle ray potter
and mrs redlow besides many of the rank
and file who could give tongue to the cause of
the bondmjn were present and ready to work
when opportunity presented the evening
meeting was first addressed by c c bur
leiglt on the importance of keeping the sub
ject of anti slavery before the country in ita
most concentrated form he was followed by
our friend charles lenox remond who spoke
with great effect showing the pernicious in
fluence of slavery upon all classes of the peo
ple of this countrytho white as well as the
black man as a colored man under the ban
of a wicked prejudice and cruel proscription
 listened with pride and admiration to the el
oquence of this accomplished colored orator
if he stood alone without another in the land
to vindicate the manhood and mental power
of ray oppressed despised and plundered peo
ple his single example would be sufficient to
put to silence and to shame the miserable and
degrading theories with respect to us mr
remond was followed by mr bradburn who
spoke with unusual ease and effect the au
dience were pleased with his wit and laughed
heartily at his humorous manner and his sin
gularly extravagant gestures  must not
pretend to report his speech for fear of mis
representing him
after mr bradburn the writer was called
to the platform and addressed the assembly
till nearly ten oclock when the meeting ad
journed to ten oclock thursday morning
of the meeting during thursday i must refer
my readers to its official proceedings i may
however say a word of the evening meeting
it was the greatest and most interesting of all
the vast hall was densely crowded and being
brilliantly lighted presented a grand scene
there was light and life there hearts to be
touched and judgments to be convinced
there were heads and face that evinced the
presence of age and experience and told the
speakers that intelligence and dignity were
expected to characterise the occasion a se
nes of resolutions was on the table involving
the whole question of a dissolution of the
union those front the business committee
affirmed the doctrine of disunion and those
from mr george l clarke were of an oppo
s j racier it was evident to all that a
reluctance was felt on the part of some of
the providence friends to hn this subject din
cusu mr davis a member of the slate
assembly ar  a member of tbe rhode island
state antislavery society hoped that the
subject would not be brought forward that
evening it was to hia mind a question
better suited to smaller meetings composed
entirely of abolitionists after numerous re
marks from various speakers as to the propri
ety of bringing forward the subject it was
agreed that each speaker should decide for
himself which of the resolutions or aeries of
resolutions should form the basis of hia re
marks the writer at once took the platform
and in a speech of about thirty minutes open
ed the whole subject of disunion whereupon
mr bradburn was called to hia feet and t
ooe of the best speeches i ever heard against
the doctrines of the americas antislavery
society on the subject of disunion he spoke
nearly an hour and was rapturously applaud
ed throughout he evidently bed the sympa
thy of tbs audience wuh him sad sat down
with an air of triumph but the tiwpk was
then charles c barkigh amended the
platform and proeoaded to addima the
mg for a time ia a strain of convincing elo
qneoce not even alluding to ih p eech to
which the audience had jt listened this
wan for the most part to dear away tbe
meaningless and useless rubbish with which
the great central question bad been surround
ed he went from point to point with the
spend and agility of an arabian racer first
bn vend the resolutions second he referred
to the different aspects of the question to
which they related then gawe statement oi
the various points in their logical order the
audience were atill all bad been laughter
and pleasantry before all was still now
on went the speaker truth had mounted
her swiftest chariot the great lessons of
duty were made to shine like stars in the blue
firmament he at length baited and took up
a bit of paper it was a paper containing the
points of mr bradburna speech one by
one he took them up turned them over re
plied to and triumphantly refuted them
mr burleigh was several times interrupted
by mr bradburn witn questions and replies
but these formed no barrier to the iron strength
of burleighs argument they only called
forth finer and brighter qualities of mind from
the speaker than be had before displayed and
subjected the restless objector to more com
plete and disastrous defeats aside from
the glorious truths vindicated and my sincere
interest in them the debate on intellectual
grounds was worth going the whole journey
from rochester to providence to hear
during the meeting a hall was provided by
the antislavery ladies where dinner and tea
were prepared each day for the accommoda
tion of friends from the country i have not
time just now for farther comment upon this
meeting it was a great and glorious one

will eapeciallyjrepresent the views of the pro

our mind candidly we may say that we con

the rochester anitslavery fair
has been postponed till the th of january
to give time to make more extensive prepara
tions neariy all the old articles left over
from other fairs haing been disposed of we
notice by a report in the north star that
articles for the benefit of the cause are now
sold at eleven different places in the vicinity
of rochester a box of goods has just been
received from europe which will prove a
valuable accession to the collection on hand
it ia intended that the approaching fair shall
be equal to any of its predecessors in splendor
and variety
we find the above notice in the democrat
f this city and copy it for the purpose of
correcting a mistake into which our neighbor
has somehow fallen aiticles are not so far
mwe are aware sold at any one place for
the benefit of the cause either in the vicini
ty of rochester or elsewhere during the
last few months fairs have been held at
eleven different places at some of them with
satisfactory success from the statement
of this fact in the report of the committee
published last week this mistake has probab
ly originated
the rochester annual meeting
the western n y antislavery society
will hold their annuafmeeting on the bth and
th of january in the city of rochester
which our friends in the city and country are
earnestly invited to attend we feel that the
injunction neglect not the assembling of
yourselves ought most faithful
ly tobe adhered to remembering it is by uni
ted efforts that the bonds of the fettered slave
must be broken we know that the laborers in
the great work of refotm are comparatively
few but truth is mighty and we are
encouraged in believing that the day of re
demption draweth nigh as we are assured
that the faithfulness of the few tried and devo
ted friends of freedom has already sundered
the chains and set at liberty many a despon
ding captive and the reflection stimulates us
to a greater devotedness knowing full well
that the corrupting and demoralizing effects
of slavery on our white as well as our colored
brothers and sisters call loudly and impera
tively upon our holiest feelings for energetic
action while opportunity is yet afforded
considering the disabilities we are laboring
under and the apathy of the mass around us
on this vitally interesting subject much has
been done in these parts during the past year
but a steady petsevering uncompromising
devotion ia indispensable and we hope that
while we labor with untiring zeal to strike at
the root of this infernal system we shall re
member that bursting the fetters should be
followed by the genial influences of sympa
thy and elevation and that during our delib
erations some suggestions may be made with
regard to devising means to place the escaped
bondmen in situations in which their long
boned intellect their manhood shall be called
out that they may be prepared to receive the
truth that they may be recipients of gods
love and thus be enabled to enjoy the boon of
liberty of which they have so long been rob
bed we again say to our fneods far and
near come op to our annual gathering u beie
by a free and spontaneous interchange of sen

at the beginning of last week some of
onr eitixsoa were well mg b eurtled oat of
their propriety by the announcement through
sdrertiseinenis and handbills tbit a pahlic
exhibition of the jfytfersms noses sp
posed to be supernatural which hare for
some time past been beard id thi city was
about to be given at corinthian hall on
the evening appointed wednesday the th
a good audience assembled some of them
we doubt not really expecting to see a live
ghost exhibited mr capron of auburn
late editor of the anburn branch of the na
tional reformer appeared bn the platform
accompained by the two young women
through whom the spirit or whatever else
it mav be makes itself manifest mr cap
ron commenced the proceedings by deliver
ing an address chiefly on the difficulties al
ways attendant upon the introduction of any
new sciencewhich was all very true and in
teresting but in the present instance as we
apprehend rather foreign to the subject the
object of the meeting being aa we under
stood to prove whether or not this thing had
any claim to a scientific origin not to apolo
gise for its imperfections and unpopularity
after this introduction of the subject the
lecturer proceeded to give an account of the
i rise and progress of the rapping the story
j of the murdered pedlar and the noise heard
in the bouse where the deed was supposed to
have been done are too commonplace to
i be repeated bete from this story vulgar a
it is the whole affair seems to have arisen
not a very satisfactory origin for what is
claimed to be the opening up of a new world
the discovery of a new science but be
i this as it may it cannot be denied that noises
were heard in that house which to this
day have never been satisfactorily explained
by a process which it would take too much
space to describe it was found or imagined
that this noise was intelligent and answered
questions put to it by rapping the ques
tions being always such as could be answeied
affirmatively a rapping was understood to
mean yes a want of rapping tomean no it
was then found that this tiling could spell out
sentences by the slow process of rapping at
the etters of the alphabet gone over slowly
by the person in communication this ia
the present state of me science the
moving of tables pulling of coattails and
other matters attributed to the spirit may
be true but as we have not seen them we

cannot be expected to vouch for their truth
the assertion that the spirit has learned to
write and has begun to communicate its ideas
through pen ink and paper is also sufficient
i ly problematical we shall believe that it is
so when we see the writing done
during the delivery of mr caprons ad
dress the knocking was distinctly heard at
the most distant corner of the hall it was a
hollow sound as if of a slight blow with a
i mallet followed by a rebound on the boards
of the platform it was always near or imme
diately under the feet of the two young wo
men before mentioned mr capron stated
as the reason why lie appeared on the plat
i form as the expounder of this thing that on
a recent visit to this city he had received a
j communication appointing him to the office
that he was very unwilling to engage in any
such undertaking and went home that the
spirit or whatever it was followed him to
auburn and rapped to him in his own house
that it pelt out the words you had better go
there go where said he the reply
speedily was you had better go to roches
ter so he was not disobedient but came
at this meeting a committee of five persona
well know n to have no connection with the
matter was at the command of the spirit
appointed to investigate and report on the
next evening in the same place
on thursday evening a large number as
sembled the committee reported that they
had spent almost the entire day in testing the
genuineness of this affair and could detect
nothing on this evening mr capron again
lectured in nearly the same strain as on the
evening preceding and read a well known ac
count of something similar which was beard
by the household of john wesleys father
on this occasion however it is worthy of re
mark that in relating the command given
him at auburn he stated it thus you had
better do that do what you had
better go to rochester theie is a slight
discrepancy here which seems to require ex
planation cither form of communication is
short enough and we imagine might have
been accurately remembered especially when
it was supposed that it came from a spirit
on this evening another committee was ap
pointed to return to a meeting on the follow
ing evening
on friday evening ihe commttiee reported
that they had not been able to detect any im
posture one of them suspecting that the
sounds were produced by ventriloquism ap
plied the stethoscope to the chests of the
young women and ascertained that such a
supposition was unfounded it may be stated
that this iood committee heard the noie not
only on ihe floor bat on the wails and doors
of the different  ms where the investigation
was made and that they were careful to se
cure in order to avoid collusion that no men
lion should be made of the place where they j
intended to make the investigation on this
evening still another committee was appoint
ed saturday evening a very large concourse
assembled judge bssell was called to the
chair the committee reported that they
had associated w ith them a committee of la
dies to earcb the clothing of those young
women that they bad found nothing and
were as much at fault as their predecessors
one of this committee confessed to us pri
vately though we conceive such confession
to b premature that he did not believe the
young women made the noise on this last
evening an amount of rowdyism manifested
itself which we did not think it possible that
rochester could have flung together the
chairman himself was the leader of the mob
and if any violence had been done he would
juatly have been held responsible for it the
whole affair may be a very glow fraud we
have been all along of opinion that n ia but a
resort to the barbarous code of judge lynch
imposture or no imposts cn is clearly to be
oodemned and affords evidence of the exist
nee of s very low state of public moiality
for a judge to be the leader ia such outra
ges is above all reprebeaaiblc a weeks
lodging is tho jail would do soeh earn aa the
judge who occupied the chair a l miu
amount of good let impostors be gxposed
but by lawful and rational means
io this state at present rests the matter
the sounds are supposed to be made by two
young women end most of course continue
to be so supposed until suflfctent proof is giv
en to the contrary il they make this noise
bow do they do it it ia not by any machin
ery fastened to their clothing for that would
have been discovered when they were exam
ined by the ladies committee as we under
stand in a state of nature the noisegoing
on as before it is not done by ventuloquism
as has been affirmed by the medical man who
applied the stethoscope and who ia well ac
i customed to the use of that instrument the
question has been asked has elecuieity any
thing to do with it the answer is that it
has not fot the persons have been placed up
on tumblers set on the floor still the noise ia
heard on or rather under the boards and
it ia heard moreover notooly in one room ol
one house but in any room of any house
i where these two persons are it does more
than rap we ate told that this spirit goblin
imp or hobgoblin good bad or indifferent
i also moves chairs and tables and pulls people
by the arms and coattails if this be true
and if as the spirit says tins thing will
soon be genera oh to be a school boy once
again we might pull onr worthy preceptors
tails with impunity and he would never take
the trouble to look round under the impres
sion that it was only one of his mischievous
familiars having a pleasant romp but what
is it
seriously we must confess ovtaelves puz
zled when asked if it is a spirit it raps
which is an affirmative answer it professes
to be now not one nor many spirits but aa
would appear any and every spirit in oppo
sition to this idea may be urged the very
blundering and silly mode of its communica
turns arguing at all events a meaner intelli
gence than that of man then it pretends to
j know many things which men do not know
we have asked the question and got the an
swer but upon putting a definite question
 and getting an assurance of its knowledge on
some particular subject and then following
this assurance up by a test question calcula
 ted to demonstrate such knowledge it has in
variably failed to give a correct answer il
a spirit at all it is therefore a lying spirit
i mr capron argues that this thing depends
upon some scientific cause that it is spiritual
but manifested in accordance with ome law ol
nature which we do not understand we
can readily agree that if it is there at all and
is spiritual such must be the case but it
wants the first element of sciencethat is
certainty the pedlar must doubtless have
been an old bachelor for such a whimsical
fidgetty mortal was never seen in any othei
situation atone time he or they will talk
without ceasing at another time in exacily
i similar circumstances not a single rap can be
got but what is it we do not think that
jwe are called upon at present to decide the
matter is under investigation and will no
doubt be made manifest j d
a few words to henry b brewster
in the last no of the north star i per
ceive a communication from thy pen in reply
to wm p mclntyre and j w randolph of
albany the latter part of thy reply contains
some very plain and strong if not convincing
language to one imbibing in early life the
idea that manstealing was a great crime
and that american slavery being founded up
on the system of manstealiug could not be
much better it was i confess rather startling
to read from the pirn of a professed religious
instructor the solemn gsseveration of the be
lief that american slavery is ordered by the
almighty ruler of the universe and that it
is the greatest blessing next to our national
independence this country ever enjoyed
if my opinion is one of the errors of my
youth and thine correct in order to convince
me and others in the ame dilemma of thy
sincerity thou wilt probably take those step
daughters of thine in troy to the south on
thy return there that they may participate of
the blessing or if they object or the
measure otherwise fails thou wilt probably be
willing to test the thing personally say for a
year or at least a month and in order ful
ly to experience the blessing without any mis
take it may be proper to place thyself in the
power of some master about to fail and become
bankrupt and perhaps use a little effort to
be sold to some one going to the rice swamps
of georgia i have suggested a very short
time for thy service aa a slave in order that
thou might live through the most plentiful
bestowment of ihe blessing in its various
forms thou may perhaps have some chil

faiknd douglass the object of a ns
tional league or a union of the oppressed
for the sake of freedom i a subject of aocb
magnitude and importance that those taho
may not regard it as being attainable under
the present civil and religious organizations of
this country are inexcusable for remainng
silent
you have well and truly said let no one
hesitate to speak because he thinks he sees
insurmountable difficulties in the way of the
movement we want discussionwe want
action
the expediency of ah organized union j
among our people has long engaged my atten
tion and i do most freely confess that it ap j
pears to me to be a subject that is fraught w ith
difficulties and dangers as well as promises
and blessings  have neither the time nor
the necessary qualifications to engage in pub
lic discussion and have been anxiously wait
ing to aee some able polemic pen engaged in
the fruitful theme my present object in wri
ting is to afford you an opportunity of more
fully explaining the principles and measures
necessary to its accomplishment
i believe that the motto union of the op
pressed for the sake of freedom will be in
terpreted by the proslavery press to mean an
union of the black against the while man and
the overthrow of ameiican institutions for
however strange and unnatural it may appear
it is nevertheless true that the success of any
movement among ourselves is more dependent
on the praise of our enemies than the labors
of our friends for of late our denunciations
have been as unerringly directed agai st ab
olitionists as slaveholders when you shall
have launched the league in the prosla
very current of this nation you will be obli
ged to answet the nautical questions viz
from whence do you hail  what is your
object  and to what port are you destined
or receive a broadside
you well know that we have no security
in the divine nature of our object for that be j
ing interpreted in the popular tongue means l
devil incarnate and vestal purity of mo
tive a rapacious desire to corrupt all that is
good and holy in the affections of the mul
litude so deeply seated are the religious
and political prejudices against which we have
to contend that virtue and vice change their
character to suit the complexion of the actor
during the recent eventfulperiod of nations
the press has been teeming with the fate of
leagues for civil and religious reform and
the proclamation has gone forth that god is
on the side of the strong
it will be useless to say that this is not a
complexional question for its success would
depend on so stating it and the collision
springing from its action against public senti
ment would be more likely to increase and
concentrate existing prejudices than scatter
and disseminate them it is therefore no
less a dictate of interest than humanity to
avoid a complexional issue
i therefoie assume that while we have no
national existence as a people we can have
no national institutions and if this position
be true the league in a national point of
view falls to the ground dly that the
history of nations shows that a distinct civil
and religious code has been the only success
ful rallying point calculated to unite any peo
pleand as the colored people of this county
are for the most part disfranchised and with
out any distinct religious faith from that ot
their oppressors they are without the elemen
tary principle calculated to cement them in
the bonds of confederation dly we have
the example of history that the religious in
stitutions of both ancient and modern nations
were made subservient to the civil power and
so regulated a  toaid in securing and trans
mitting temporal as well as spiritual blessings
among the people now the colored people
of this country are almost destitute of civil
and political power and are also without a
distinctive religious faith calculated to promote
their temporal interests but have what in
my humble opinion is worse for them than no
religion at all copied and adopted the pro
slaveiy tenets of american protcetanism as
they exist in the methodistpresbyterian epis
copalian and baptist denominations whose
consolidated point of union is a belief in the
existence of god and the natural inferiority ol
the colored people il cannot therefore be
expected that people who have sincerely and
honestly though unfortunately adopted
those creeds and theories which have for a
series of years been enforced by interpola
tions of scripture hewn out by cunning and
scientific theologians for the purpose of per
peluaiing the infernal dogma of our inferiori
ty can have a just respect for themselves or
feel within them those vivid pulsations whose
soulinspiring throbs aumate the bosom ol
manhood no it cannot beevery iaw ol
the human mind rejects such an affirmation
man is naturally a religious being his re
ligious nature constitutes his highest element
if he stoops from his naturally erect position
before lus god and his follow man and copies
the religious theory of his aggressor he then
feels religiously happy in whatever makes his
oppressor happy while the former thanks
iis god that he was born to rule the latter
thanks god that he was burn to serve
the religion of those protestant sects is so
antipodal to the freedom and prosperity of our
people that no w hite man can successfully
advocate our equal claims to citizenship with
out first losing caste in the church and there
repudiating lus religion altogether in my
i humble opinion if our people ever become
j united in the prosecution of objects for the
promotion of their common welfare it will be

the rattlesnake hunter j
by j u whittier
until my ghastly tale is told
my lieai t within me burns
during u delightful excusions in the
vicinity ofthe green mountain a few
years since i had the good fortune to
meet with a singular character known
in many parts of vermont as the rat
tlesnake hunter it was a warm clear
day of sunshine in the middle of june
i saw him for the first time while en
gaged in a mineralogical ramble among
the hills his head was bald and his
forehead was deeply marked with tie
strong lines of care and age his
form was wasted and meagre but for
the fiery vigor of his eye he might
have been supposed incapacitated by
age and infirmities for even a slight
exertion yet he hurried over the
huge ledges of rock with a quick and
almost youthful tread and seemed ear
nestly searching among the crevices
and loose crags and stinted bushes
around him all at once lie started
suddenly drew himself back with a sort
of shuddering recoil and then smote
fiercely with his staff upon the rock be
fore him another and another blow
and he lifted the lifeless form of a large
rattlesnake upon the end of his rod
the old mans tyes glistened but
his lip trembled as he looked steadfast
ly upon his yet writhing victim ano
ther ofthe accursed race he muttered
between his clenched teeth apparently
unconscious of my presence
i was now satisfied that the person
before me was none other than the
famous rattlesnake hunter he was
known throughout the neighborhood as
an outcast and a wanderer obtaining a
miserable subsistence from the casual
charities of the people among the rocks
and rude hills where his only objects
seemed to be the hunting out and des
troying of the crotalus horidus or rat
tlesnake  immediately determined
to satisly my curiosity which had been
strangely excited by the remarkable
appearance of the stranger and for
this purpose  approached him
are there many of these reptiles in
this vicinity  enquired pointing to
the crushed serpent
they are getting to be scarce
said the old mau lifting his slouched
hat and wiping his bald brow 
have known the time when you could
hardly stir ten rods from your door in
this part of the state without hearing
their low quick rattle at your side or
seeing their many colored bodies coil
ing up in your pain but as l said be
fore they are getting to be scarce he
infernal race will be extinct in a few
years and thank god  have inysell
neen a considerable cause of their ex
termination
you must of course know the na
ture ofthose creatures perfectly well
said  do you believe iu their pow
er of fascination or charming
th old mans countenance fell
jshere was a visible struggle of feeling
within him and his lip quivered and
he dashed hi brown hand suddenly
across his eyes as if to conceal a tear
but quickly recovering himself he an
swered in the low deep voice of one
who was about to reveal some horrible
secret
i believe in the rattlesnakes power
of fascination as firmly us i believe
ia my own existence
surely said i you do not be
lieve that they have power over
man bcinga
i do  know it to he so and the
old man trembled as he spoke you
re stranger to me he said slowly
as he scrutinized my features for a
moment but it you will go down with
me to the foot of this rock in the shade
there and he pointed to a group of
leaning oaks that hung over the de
clivity  will tell you a strange and
sad story ot iny own experience
it may be supposed that i readily
assented to this proposal bestowing
one more blow upon the rattlesnake as
if to be certain of his death the old
man descended the rocks with a rapidi
ty that would have endangered the
neck of a less practised hunter after
reaching the place which he pointed
out the rattlesnake hunter commen
ced his story in a manner which con
firmed what i had previously heard ol
his education and intellectual strength
i was among the earliest settlers in
this part of the country i had just
finished inv education at harvard when
i was induced by the flattering repre
sentations of some of the earliest pio
neers into the wild lands beyond the
connecticut to seek my fortune in the
new settlementmy wife the old
mans eyes glistened in an instant and
then a tear crossed his brown check
my wife accompanied me young deli
cate and beautiful as she was into this
wild and rude country i never shall
forgive myself for bringing her here
never young man continued he
you look like one who could pity you
shall seethe image of the girl who fol
lowed me to the new country and
he unbound as be spoke a ribbon from
his neck with a small miniature at
tached to it it was that of a beautiful
female but there was an almost child
ish expression in her countenance a
softness a delicacy and a sweetness
of smile which i have seldom seen in
the features of those tasted
i even slightly the bitter wears of exist
ence the old man w atched my coun
tenance intently as i surveyed the im
age of his early love
she must have been very beautiful
i said as i returned the picture
beautiful he repeated you mav
well say so but this avails nothing j
have a fearful story to tellwould tc
god i had not attempted it but  wil
go on my heart has been too often
stretched on the rack of memory tc
j suffer any new pang
we had resided in the new country
nearly a year our settlement had in
creased rapidly and the comforts anc
delicacies of life were beginning to bt
felt after the weary privations ant
severe trials to which we had been sub
jected the red men were few anc
feeble and did not molest us thr
beasts of the forest aud mountain were
ferocious but we suffered little from
them the only immediate danger tc
which we were exposed resulted from
the rattlesnakes which infested out
neighborhood three or four of oui
settlers were bitten by them and died
in terrible agonies the indians often
t told us frightful stories of this snake
and its powers of fascination and al
though they were generally believed
yet for myself i confess  was ratltei
amused than convinced by their marvel
lous legends
ln one of my hunting excursion
abroad on a fine morning it was jus
at this time of the year i was accotn
panied by my wife twasa beautifu
morning the sunshine was warn
and the atmosphere was perfectly
clear and a fine breeze from the north
west shook the bright green leave
which clothed to prolusion the wreath
i ing branches above us i had left mj
wile for a short time in the pursuit o
game and in climbing a rugged ledg
of rocks interspersed with shrubs aim
dwarfish trees i was startled by i
quick grating rattle i looked forward
on the ledge of a ioosenod rock lay i
large rattlesnake coiling himsef as i
for the deadly spring he was withit
a lew feet of me aud i paused for ar
instant to survey him i know no
why but i stood still aud looked at th
deadly serpent with a strong feeling o
curiosity suddenly he unwound hi
coil as if relenting from his purpost
of hostility and raising his head in
fixedhis bright fiery eye directly oi
my own a chilling and indescribabh
sensation totally different from any
thing i had ever before experienced
followed this movement of the serpent
but  stood still and gazed steadily am
earnestly for at that moment then
was a visible change in the serpent
his form seemed to grow larger ant
his colors brighter his body inovet
with a slow almost imperceptible mo
tion towards me and a low hum o
music came from him at least it sound
ed in my ear a strange sweet melody
faint as that which melts from th
i throat of a humming bird then tht
tints of his body deepened anc
s changed and glowed like he change
of a kaleidoscope green purple anc
gold until i lost sight of the serpem
entirely and saw only a wild and curi
ously woven circle of strange colors
quiyering around me like an atmos
phere of rainbows i seemed in the
i centre of a great prism a world ol
j mysterious colors and tints varied anc
darkened and lighted up again arounc
me and the low music went on with
out ceasing until my brain reeled and
fear for the first time came over me
the new sensation gained upon me
rapidly and i could feel the cold sweat
gushing from my brow i had certain
ly no danger ou my mind and no defi
nite ideas of peril all was vague anc
clouded like the unaccountable ter
rors of a dream and yet my limbi
shook and i fancied i could feel the
blood stiffening as it passed along my
veins i would have given worlds tc
have been able to tear myself from tbc
spot i even attempted to do so but
die body obeyed not the impulse ol
the mind not a muscle stirred and 
stood etiii as if my feet had grown tc
the solid rock with this infernal music
of the tempter in my ear aud the bale
 tul colorings of tins enchantment before
me
suddenly a new sound came on my
ear it was a human voice but it seemed
strange aud awful again again bul
i stirred not and then a white form
plunged before me and grasped my
arm the horrible spell was at once
broken the strange colors passed
from before my vision the rattlesnake
was coiling at my very feet with glow
ing eyes and uplifted fangs end my
wile was clinging in terror upon me
the next instant the serpent threw him
self upon us my vife was the victim
the fangs pierced deeply into her
hands and her scream of agony as
she staggered back from me told me
the dreadful truth
then it was that a feeling of mad
ness came upon me and i saw the foul
serpent stealing away from his work
reckless of danger i sprang forward
and crashed him under my feet grind
ing him upon the rugged roek the
groans of my wife now recalled me to
her side and to tha horrible reality of
her situation there waa a dark livid
spot upon her hand and it deepened
into blacknesses i led her awaywe
were a considerable distance from any
dwelling and after wandering for a
short tune the pain from her wound
became insupportable to ray wife and
she swooned away in my arms weak
and exhausted as i was i yet had
strength enough left to cifry her to
the nearest rivulet and bathe her brow
in the cool water she partially re
covered and sat down upon the bank
while i supported her head upon my
bosom hour after hour passed away
and none came near us and there alone
in the great wilderness i watched over
her and prayed with her and she
died
the old matt groaned audibly as he
uttered these words and as he closed
his long bony hands over his eyes i
could see the tears falling thickly
through his gaunt fingers after a
momentary struggle with his feelings
he lifted his head once more and there
was a fierce light in his eyes as he
spoke
but i have had my revenge from
that jptal moment i have felt myselt fit
ted and set apart by the terrible ordeal
of affliction to rid the place of my
abode of its foulest curse and i have
well nigh succeeded the fascinating
demons are already few and powerless
do not imagineaid he earnestly re
garding the somewhat equivocal ex
pressions of my countenance that i
consider these creatures as serpents
only creeping serpents they are ser
vants of a fallen angelthe immediate
ministers of the infernal gulf
 a a
years have passed since my inter
view with the rattiesnuke hunter the
place of his abode is changeda beau
tiful village rises near the spot of con
ference and the grass of the church
yard is growing over the grave of the
old hunter but his story is fixed upon
my inind and time like enamel only
burns deeper the first impression it
comes up before me like a vividly re
membered dream whose features are
too horrible for reality the rover
from the national era
prejudicea contrast
one day i watched a curious looking
nest of caterpillars those worms that
are so daintily dressed up in their long
far all were busily spinning out theii
silken webs except a few who were
pushed away because they had black
stripes through their fur so they curl
ed themselves up and rolled away tc
spin their webs as best they could
i came another day and found they
all had wings of purple or gold oi
crimson spotted no two were alike
but all were so beautiful that they could
not tell themselves which were the ones
that had the black stripes when they
were nil wrapped up in their fur
the morning sun beamed brightly
upon hill and valley and sent its cheer
ful rays even among the dark glens and
woody dells of edendale fit name for
the wild and picturesque beauty of the
susquehanna where nature has been
lavish with her smiles and frowns a
quiet and pretty villa graced edendale
and its beautiful loneliness was cheered
by a happy circle within
a young boy who made their heart
glad skipped merrily forth and in a
freak of mirth bounded over the banka
and through the glens the wind tos
sed his close curls as he ran and brot
a warm glow to his dark olive cheek
away he went shouting joyfully
hours passed and the child waa
gone yet where can he be is he
lost is he drowned were the breath
less inquiries the mother grew fran
tic the father anxious and excited
louis louis was shouted through
the woods and resounded among the
rocks but no louis was there dave
and weeks dragged on but notidings ol
louis
a crowd was gathered at a slave auc
tion in one ofthe large southern cities
one another and another was sold
and then came upon the stand a youth
ful boy whose beauty filled all with
surprise and interest the terror
stricken child gazed around with a be
wildered stare his little heart beat
wildly and tears chased rapidly down
bis cheeks but frightened at the threats
of the auctioneer he pressed his hand
tightly over his mouth to smother the
violent sobs that shook his frame
there were the same glossy cluster
ed curls the dark sparkling eye and
the rich olive complexion that marked
the joyous louis of edendale
goinggoinggone and the
heavy stroke ofthe hammer as it fell
told that louis was a slate
he was quickly pushed aside but
as they were about to lead him away a
horseman came with furious speed down
the street and checked the reins ab
ruptly as he reached the auction stand
every one gazed at him in astonish
ment as he leaned forward and looked
intently and breathless among the group
of slaves
father father screamed a strug
gling child with a wild cry
an instant more aud the man with
one bound sprang upon the platform
and gf a ped his boy the slavedealer
cowered before the imposing dignity of
the noble looking man who stood before
him with his eye bent upon
him in rage and indignation and his
quivering lip scarce finding power to
speak the throng looked on eagerly
expecting to see hts uplifted arm strike
the offender to the earth as he claim

my child a slave a slave have
you dared to setae and sell a te kite
child
the sympathising and excited crowd
could no longer restrain thair indigna
tion murmurs and threats broke forth
and then cries of down with the kid
napper issued from tbc throng the
story buzzed through the city and the
gathered multitude were appeased only
wheo justice was meted out to the slave
dealer and his accomplice
a young girl was seized and sent in
to slavery she had been stolen away
from her old blind mother who had
none else to care for her want every
hour separated them farther and farther
as the young slave trod her way weari
ly under a blazing sun she wrung
her hands and wept in agony as she
thought of the fate of her mother she
will strive with her sightless eyes to
find me all the day long her feeble j
voice will call lizzy lizzv and she
will hear no aoswer but the lonely echo
she will wonder why i am gone so long
i cannot sit by her side again and she
will not hear the voice of her child any
more reading to her the bible she lov
ed so well how cheerless will be her
days and how sleepless will be the
nights for she will hear by and by that
lizzy is a slave oh my mother my
mother i can see you no more
she looked back with longing ach
ing eyea to where the woods and sky
seemed to meet as though to catch a
parting glimpse of her home
on on shouted the driver aud
his long lash curled about the shrinking
form of tha weeping lizzy
in vain she plead when they sold her
in vain she told them she was free
who cared for her grief who was
there to give her justice who thought
of the mind the soul that was to be
trammelled alas none for her skin
was not fair none sympathized with
her she was a black slave

not quite so fast mr t you
have little to boast of in your own

my own if not more
imposible ejaculated mr turner
tur fur ner tier turner how
otherwise pray should you spell it
we shall see said mr r in the
first place you may spell it thus thur
ner
but on what ground do you use the

for the same reason that you have
these letters in thames thomas rc
if th represents the sound of t in
thomas why not in turner or rather
thumerv
well this is but one change what
others can you show me
oh several you are not perhaps
aware that the sound of u as in tur
and that of e as in ner are each rep
resented by various vowels in our lau

mr r in the word colonel the
