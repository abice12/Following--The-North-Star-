garnett and others who did not dis
cover at present any necessity for a
colored college among the reasons in
it favor was urged that such an insti
tution would excite among the colored
citizens a more general desire lor
mental improvement that the aspirants
for learning wouldsooxicorapose a class
iuficient tfc filpit as also to patronize
those already existing that a field
would hereby be opened for the employ
ment of those qualified for professor
ships in the various departments it
was also mentioned that one distin
guished and wealthy individual had
manifested a willingness to appropriate
a large sum of money in aid of any
tangible method of ameliorating the
condition of colored americans and in
the opinion of friends the college was
presumed to embody most of the fea
tures of an available plan it was fur
ther urged that the colored youth
under care of colored teachers associ
ating with those of his own complexion
and condition would not feel depressed
as likely to be in other institutions
surrounded bv those whom he had
always regarded as opposed to his
equality and therefore colored col
leges were the most favorable to his
mental growth
in reply it was remarked that the
establishment of a colored college was
ittempted many years ago and could
mt succeed being regarded by many
is an extravagant and uncalledfor
neasure that it was too late in the day
or colored people themselves to found
mv exclusive institution there are
iow colleges and academies where they
an be admitted on equal terms with
vliite students and that therefore the
lecessity did not exist and it was their
glorious privilege to contend for equality
o secure every point gained and still
iress on for more the fear of colored
children sinking under the weight ol
irejudicc in a white institution was not
i conclusive argument against their
jxercising the right of entrance the j
olored youth should be stimulated to
istablish such a character in these
eats of learning by his energy in
itudy and deportment towards teachers
tnd pupils as to disarm opposition

uious association converted enemies
into good friends reference wasj
made to massachusetts and other states
where the doors of many institutions ot
learning are now thrown open and thej
colored student was invited to parti
cipate freely with others j
another argument and one urged
against every exclusive colored insti
tution w as that the expense and trouble
necessary for their establishment could
be employed to a more practical and
permanent advantage in securing access
to those already organized we should
not entertain for a moment the idea of
creating any more links ot that preju
dice which is now binding us to earth
but as other americans push our w ay
through the various avenues of im
provement and elevation
after an animated discussion the
question was taken by yeas and nays
and resulted in favor of the plan of a
colored college vizyeas  nays
 and a committee of  was ap
pointed to solicit funds in aid thereof
the other recommendation from the j
same committee was submitted by dj
smith in favor of the establishment
of a national press
the report was adopted y eas

at the suggestion of the committee
on agriculture a resolution of thanks
to gerrit smith was voted for his
munificent donation of lands to the

made in favor of colored people emi

addresses from distinguished members
of the convention a large audience
was present on the second evening
when after an inspiring song the meet
ing commenced with an address to the
slaves from hehry h g yrxett
those acquainted with his talent and
eloquence it will be unnecessary to
mention that the address produced much
sensation
mr doroli at a subsequent meet
ing introduced a report on the  best
means of abolishing slavery and caste
in the united states wherein was ably
upheld the doctrine of moral suasion in
opposition to physical force and which
became in turn as an offset to mr

feelings in tt most eloquent speech on the
proslavery result of the colored suffrage
question in his native state connec

irish result nts in connecticut voted o
zaintf the colored man and though he
had loved ireland revered her great

his rebuke wiisertainty a just one
iut perhaps needs one remark in extenu
ltion the opposition of irishmen in
rnerica to colored men is not so much
in flibcnvanism as an jltncricanitm
use of the colored people is popular
ind the pecuniary interest of many ot

ad example of their proslavery ameri
can teachers let them be severely

i cheering sign of the times the speaker
nentioned that judge daggett who

changed his opinion as to have deposited

alexander crummell offered a
speech which for beauty and chasteness

i logical expression commanded the
dose attention of the refined and intel

lave received a favorable opinion of
vhat can be attained by colored men
rushed to the earth even though they

a prominent feature in the speech of 
frederick douglass was an exhorta
ion to the colored people to come out
rom their proslavery churches ex
laiming that liis right arm should with j
r before he would worship at their
doodstained altars they were not the
laces for colored men this sentiment
rented some excitement for colored
nen like others dont care to be re
minded of their inconsistencies
the influence of the public meetings
vas most beneficial audiences were
lumerous and highly respectable the
uestion of slavery and elevation of the
olored man became topics of general
onversation even in circles hitherto

it may safely he asserted that much
rood will result from this convention
ntelligent men there assembled to enj
juire what sliall he done to extirpate
slavery from the land and elevate the
character of its oppressed here mind
irappled with mind plans were proposed
ind their merits discussed and while
liscouragements reported from any i
ocality awakened sympathy in kindred
marts the least dawn of success inspir
d all with a new zeal pledging their
verv effort to hasten the day of einan

the grand question at the conven
ion was that of emerging as soon a
ossible from all exclusive colored in j
titutions and becoming part and parcel
f a general community colored peo

ire opening for their improvement in
ill the varied business and social rela

freedom and if there are those who
vill cling tothe fleshpots of egypt why j
hey should not complain ifthe advancing
rain jostle them from the track
the convention did not because it j
ould not recommend any novel plan
or elevation any person of ordinary
alibre must know that to become de
rated they must cultivate and practice
he same traits which are elevating oth
rs around them and if it is as indeed
ve all feel it to be harder for the col
red man than others why then let him
vork the harder and eventually the
summit will be attained

a signal proof of the practical value
of american piety has recently been
afforded by the sanctimonious state ot
connecticut we suppose our readers
know there is bo state that lias made
her phylacteries broader or made loud
prayers at the corners ot the streets
or tithed mint anise and cummm more
strictly than this same psalmsmging

was lately preyed by law a briefly
as an english pttridge the clergy is
recognized a trut theocratic oligarchy
the sanctuary fe thronged from week
to week with the desperation of a peo
ple stripped of tfery other diversion
it is the state of colleges theological
j schools bible htssionarv tract and
colonization soqielfps if ever there
were a nation eeatous of good works
here is their habitation the atmos
phere that overhangs the land is heavy
with the odor of sanctity
i the laws by which the piety and mo
rality of this peculiar people were
hedged around in the eider time were
denominatedbv the profane the blue
law and that cerulean hue has
thence been taken as the color of righ
teous souls as well as oftrue hearts
the old blue laws to be sure have
been somewhat modified as time has
worn on but the spirit that dictated
and inspired them has survived and still
walks abroad that spirit was the spirit
of caste and tyranny the spirit that
looked about tor some to whom it might
say stand further off fori am ho
lier than thou this spirit is still rife
and rampant it is still embodied in j
laws of w hich the color only is chang
ed the blue lairs have given way
to the black lairs laws as cruel as
absurd as unnatural as immoral as
antichristian as anything in the whole
circle of the blue blaws or as their
whole code put together the blue
laws were an oppression to man the
black laws are an insult to god the
blue laws contemplated the texture of
a mans soulthe black laws that of
his skin the one had to do with mat
ters within the control of those upon
whom they acted the other w ith mat
ters over which the sufferers have only
the power of the ethiopian over his skin
or the leopard over his spots the one
code punished men for acts of their own
doing the other punishes them for the
crime of their creator
within a few weeks an amendment
to the constitution of connecticut by
which the equal political rights of color
ed men with white men were recognized
was submitted to the suffrages of the
people the proposition as far as we
are informed stood alone the bald
question whether the oolor o the skill
should be a bar to political equality
was that which the lieges of connec
ticut were called together to decide
and what was the decision out of
some fifty thousand voters only about
twentyfive thousand took the pains to
express any opinion at all and of those
that did vote only some jive thousand
were found w illing to recognize the man
of color as a political equal with them
selves those who abstained from voj
ting may fairly be taken as opposed to
the amendment so it appears that out
of the entire voting population but one
tenth were free from this base degra
ding absurd inhuman antichristian
prejudice of color we doubt whether
any community in proportion to its size
could be found in the world out of this j
country that would not be ashamed of
political association with such riducui
lous barbarians the hottentots rise to j
a high place in the scale of civilizaj
tion in the comparison for we do not
believe that even a hottentot would de
ny the humanity of a connecticut pedj
lar should one find his way to his kraal
at least if he had never heard of this
demonstration on the part of the pedlar
state
the meanness of this transaction is
a match for its absurdity the state ol
connecticut we take it has not the
slightest scruples about putting her dirty j
hands into the pockets of these colored
citizens or rather inhabitants who are
not citizens and making them pay j
their proportion of the expenses of the
government in which they have no
voice some seventyfive years ago
there was none of the colonies louder
in denunciations of the british parliai
ment for taxing them without represen
tation than this same colony ot connec
ticut she sent israel putnam and
which is more tp the purpose benej
diet arnold to fight the battles of liberty
and having got what she wanted as far
as great britain was concerned she
turns round and treats a portion of her
own population in the same manner ihe
british parliament imposed the taxes on
tea glass and painters colors because
it supposed that the colonies were not
strong enough to resist the imposition
the state of connecticut doosuhe very
same thing because she knows that the
handful of poor colored inen within her
borders can offer no effectual resistance
to this oppression she is proved by
her own acts to he recreant to principle
she is a traitor to the cause for which
the revolution was fought she show s
that now at least the spirit of arnold
predominates over that of putnam in
her composition
now what can be the motive for such
a demonstration as this the motive
we apprehend to be twolbld it is
compounded partly of the w ih which
low grovelling natures have to tram
ple on something beneath them this
accounts for much of the persecution of
the colored people everywhere in the
free states it is a comfort to the low
est and most degraded of the white to
feel that there is a class of society which
they ran despire and trample in the
state which make the louden preten
sions to democracy and regard for pop
ular rights the popular right at nwst
ing and injuring the colored people with
unpumtv is one of the most prized of
all this element doubtless enters
largely into the mental composition of
this ninetenths of connecticut voters j
but there w yet another the influence
of which is so less potent there is no
state of which a greater proportion oil
the inhabitants are engaged in direct
business with the south this tratfie
manufacturing commercial and ped
dling extends itself through all classes
of society and the result is a depth
and bitterness of proelavery depravity
of which this vote is but an imperfect
jp
there is but one thing to be said in
mitigation of the sentence of unqualified
condemnation w hich this recreant state
deserves and that is that the aboli
tionists hare hardly done their duty by
her they have passed by to fields of
greater promise and left her to the ten
der mercies of proslavery religion and i
pseudoabolitionism the result is aj
proof of the value of the labors of amer j
lean theology and of the third poiiti
cal party we commend it to the
american a s society as a mission
ary ground calling loudly upon them to
come over and help it a campaign or
two carried on with the spirit with which
the war ha  been carried into other

is the ordinary course of events by

to tell us that higher motives than any

who assume the responsibility ol gov

new moulding the national character j
md elevating its tone of morals it conj
fers far other and greater benefits than
its originators at first proposed and

kindred abuses or growing itself out j
f a wrong principle which has other
results besides this immediate one it in j
sensibly prepares tne way for wider andj
more radical reform having once gath

speaking of the slow step ot the eng

the change will be delayed so long
that when it comes the people will have
been instructed in the necessity for
something more than a mere repeal of
an act of parliament important as that
appeal unquestionably i they w
see the necessity for an organic change j

among the resolutions winch it is
my intention to present for your consid
eration at the conclusion of this address
one proposes in your behalf and mine
to disavow in the most positive manner
aiiy desire on our part to acquire am
foreign territory whatever for the pur
pose of introducing slavery into it 
do not know that any citizen of the ulil
ted states entertains such a w ish but
such a motive has been often imputed to
the slave states and l therefore think
it necessary to notice it on this occasion
my opinions on the subject of slavery
are well known they have the merit
if it be one of consistency uniformity
and long duration i have ever regarded
slavery as a great evil a wrongfor the
present l fear an irremediable w rong
to its unfortunate victims i should re
joice if not a single slave breathed the
air or was withiu the limits of our coun
try but here they arc to be dealt
with as well as we can with a due con
sideration of all circumstances affecting
the security safety and happiness of
both races every ftate has the su
preme uncontrolled and exclusive pow
er to decide for itself whether slavery
shall cease or continue within its limits
without any exterior intervention from
any quarter in states w herethe slaves
outnumber the whites as is the case
w ith several the blacks could not he
emancipated and invested with all the
rights of freemen w ithout becoming the
governing race in those states colli
sions and conflicts between the two ra
ces would be inevitable and after
shocking scenes of rapine and carnage
the extinction or expulsion of the blacks
would certainly take place
in the state of kentucky near fifty
vears ago i thought the proportion of
slaves in comparison with the whites
was so inconsiderable ihat we might
safely adopt a system of gradual eman
cipation that would ultimately eradicate
this evil in our state that system
w as totally different from the immediate
abolition of slavery for which the party
of abolitionists of the present day con
tend whether they have intended it
or not it is my calm and deliberate be
lief that they have done incalculable
mischief even to the very cause which
they have espoused to say nothing of
the discord which lias been produced
between different parts of the union
according to the system we attempt
ed near the close of the last century
all slaves in being were to remain such
but all who might be horn subsequent
to a special day were to become free
at the age of twentyeight and during
their service were to be taught to read
write and cypher thus instead of be
ng thrown upon the community igno
rant ami unprepared as would be the
case by immediate emancipation they
would have entered upon the possession
of their freedom capable in some de
cree of enjoying it after a imrd
struggle the system was defeated and
i regret it extremely as if it bad been
then adopted our state would be now
nearly rid of that reproach
since that epoch a scheme of un
mixed benevolence has sprung up
which if it had existed at that time
would have obviated one of the great
est objections which was made to gra
dual emancipation which was the con
tinuence of the emancipated slaves to
abide among us that scheme is the
american colonization societyabout
 years ago a few individuals myself
among them met together in the city of
washington and laid the foundations
of that society it has gone on amidst
extraordinary difficulties and trials sus
taining itself almost entirely by sponta
neous and voluntary contributions from
individual benevolence without scarce
ly any aid from government the co
lonies planted under its auspicesare now
well established communities with
churches schools and other institu
tions appertaining tothc civilized state
they have made successful war in re
pelling attacks and invasions by their
barbarous and savage neighbors they
have made treaties annexed territories
to their dominion and are blessed with
a free representative government i
recently read a message from one of
their governor to their legislature
which in point of composition and in
careful attention to the public aftairs of
their republic would compare tdvan
tageously with tlie messages of the gov
ernors of our own states i am not
very superstitious but i do solemnly
believe that these colonies arc blessed
with the smiles of providence and if
we inav dare attempt penetrating the
veil by which he conceal his
dispensations from mortal eyes that he
designs that africa shall be the refuge
and the home of the descendant of its
ho ns and daughters torn and dragged
from their native land by lawless vio
ti a philanthropic and consoling
reflection that the moral and physical
condition of the african race in the l f
state even in a state of slavery is far
better thanit would have been if their an
cestors had not been brought from their
native land and if it should be the
decree of the great ruler of the uni
verse that their descendant shall be
made instruments in hi band in the
establishment of civilization and chris
tian religion throughout africa our re
grets on account of the original wrong
will be greatly mitigated

moot of the editorial department of a newspa
per devoted to the cauto of liberty human
ity and progress the portion u one which
with the purest nrtivon we have long desired
to occupy it ha long been our anxious wish
to see in this slaveholding slavetrading and
negrohating land a printingpress and paper
permanently established under the complete
control and direction of the immediate victims
of slavery and oppression
animated by this intense desire we have
pursued our object till on the threshold of ob
taining it our press and printing miteriils
are bought and paid for our oifico se
cured ami is well situated in the centre of
business in this enterprising city our office
agent an industrious and aniablc young
man thoroughly devoted to the interests of
humanity has already entered upon his duties
printers well rocoromanded have offered their
services and aro ready to work as soon as we
arc prepared for the regular publication of our
papor kind friends are rallying round us
with words and deeds of encouragement
subscribers an steadily if not rapidly coming
in and warm of the best minds in tho country
aro generously offering to lend us the power
ful aid of thoir pens the sincere wish of our
heart so long and so devoutly cherished seems
now upon the ere of complete realization
it is scarcely noc ssary for us to say that
our desire to occupy our present position at
the head of an antislavery journal has re
sulted from no unworthy distrust or ungrateful
want of appreciation of the zeal integrity
or ability of thu noble band of white laborers
in this department of our causo but from a
sincere and settled conviction that such a jour
nal if conducted with only moderate skill
and ability would do a most important and
indispensable work which it would be wholly
impossible for our white friends to do for us
it is neither a reflection on the fidelity nor a
disparageiueut of the ability of our friends and
fellowlaborers to assert what common sense
affirms and only folly denies that the man
who has suffered thr wrong in the man to de
mand redress that the min struck is the
man to cry out and that he who has endurta
jlv cruel pangs of slacrrtj is the man to adco
tat liberty it is evident we must be out
own representatives and advocates not exclu
sively but peculiarly not distinct from buf
in connection with our white friends in the
grand struggle for liberty and equality now
waging it is n ee right and essential that
there should arise in our ranks authors and
editors as well as orators for it is in these
capacities that the most permanent good can
be rendered to our cause
hitherto tho immediate victims of slavery
and prejudice owing to various causes have
had little share in this department of effort
they have frequently undertaken and almost
as frequently failed this latter fact has often
been urged by our friends against our engag
ing in the present enterprise but so far from
convincing us of the impolicy of our course
it serves to confirm us in the necessity if not
the wisdom of our undertaking that others
have failed is a reason for our earnestly en
deavoring to succeed our race must be vin
dicated from the embarrassing imputations re
sulting from former nonsuccess we be
lieve that what ought to be done can be done
c say this in no sellconfident or boastful
spirit but with a full sense of our weakness
and unworthiness relying upon the most
high for wisdom and strength to support us
in our righteous undertaking wo are noi
wholly unaware of the duties hardships
and responsibilities of our position v

and vc aro resolved to go forward
in aspiring to our present position the ait
of circumstances has been so strikingly appa

with the solemn sanctions of a divine provi

shrouded in the midnight ignorance of tha
internal systemsunken in the depths of ser
mhty and degradationregistered with foui
looted boasts and creeping thingsregarded
as property compelled to toil without wage
witli a heart swollen with bitter anguish
and a spirit crushed and broken by a singu

succeeded in escaping from the grasp of the
man who claimed us as his property and suc
ceeded in safely reaching new bedford mass
in this town we worked three years as a daily
laborer on the wharves six years ago we
became a lecturer on slavery under the ap
prehension of being retaken into bondage two
years ago we embarked for england during

our safety ransomed us from slavery by the
payment ol a large sum the same friends as
unexpectedly as generously placed in our

letter to henry clay
sir i have just received and read youi
speech delivered at the mass meeting in lex
ington kentucky th november  am
alter a careful and candid perusal of it i air
impressed with the desire to say a few worth
to you on one or two subjects which form a
considerable part of that speech you will
am sure pardon the liberty i take in thus pub
liely addressing you when you arc acquaints
with the fact that i am one of those cnfor
ttnate victims whose case you seem to com
miscratc and have experienced the cruel wrongs
of slavery in my own person it is with n
ill will or bitterness of spirit that i address
you my position under this government evst
in the state of n y is that of a disfranchisa
man i can have therefore no political end
to serve nor party antipathy to gratify mi
intents are not wicked but truly charitable
i approach you simply in the character of on
of the unhappy millions enduring the evils o
slavery in this otherwise highly favored am
glorious land
in the extraordinary speech before me aftei
dwelling at length upon the evils disgrace
and dangers of the present unjust mean and
iniquitous war waged by the united states up
on mexico you disavow for yourself ami thr
meeting in the most positive manner any
wish to acquire any foreign territory whatevn
for the purpose of introducing slavery into it
as one of the oppressed  give you the full
expression of sincere gratitude for this decla
ration and it pledge which it implies and
earnestly hope that you my
lour ow unsultied by compromises which
pardon me have ion often marred and defect
the beauty ami consistency of your haw
declarations and pledges or former occasion
it is not however any pnrt of my prose
tention to reproach you invidiously or nrrcrrlv
for the past unfortunately for the race vm
do not stand alone in respect to deviation
from a strict line of rectitude poor erring
and depraved humanity has surrounded you
with a thrsqg of guilty associates it would
uot therefore be magnanimous in tue to re
proacb you for tho past above all otheas
forgetting the things tlu are behind i
simply propose to speak to tm of what you
are at this ties of the errors sad erfr of
year present as i think wicked position and
to point out to yea the path of repentance
which if pursend mast lead too to the poe
session of peace and happiness sad make you
a messing to your country sad the world
in the speech under consideration you any
my eataio oa ike rntjert of rfnerr are well
kwn orj hare the wcrii if it be oae of rnii
teacy snitfnrisety and loaf dmtm
j the fast sentence is probably true your
opinions on slavery may be well known but
that they hare the merit of consistency or
of uniformity i cannot so readily admit il
the speech before me be s fair declaration of
your present opinions i think i can convince
you that even this speech abounds with incon
sistencies such as materially to affect the con
solation yon seem to draw from this sourer
indeed if you are uniform at all you are only
so in your inconsistencies
you confess that
slavery i a great eil and a wrong to st vie
tin and jroc would rejoice if not a siucv elarr
breathed the air thia the limit of our country
these are noble stniments and would seem
to flow from a heart overborne with a sense
j of the flagrant injustice and enormous cruelty
of slavery and of one earnestly and anx
iously longing for a remedy standing a
lone it would seem that the author had long
been in search of some means to redress the
wrongs of the unfortnnav victims of whom
he speaksthat his righteous soul was deeply
grieved every hour on account of the foul
bot inflicted by this curse on his country
character
but what are the facts you arc yoursell
a slaveholder at this moment and your worth
on this point had scarcely reached the outei
circle of the vast multitude by which you
were surrounded before you poured forth one
of the most helplesfe illogical and cowardly
j apologies for this same wrong and great
crir which i ever remember to have read
i is this consistency and uniformity if so the
oppressed may well pray the most high that
j you may be soon delivered from it
speaking of the unfortunate victims o
this great evil and wrong you hole
j this most singular and cowardly excuse foi
perpetuating the wrongs of my unfortunate
race
bui here they are to be dealt ulth as well as ri
ran with a due consideration of all circumstances aj
i feeling the security and happiness of both races
what do you mean by the security safety
and happiness of both races do you meai
that the happiness of the slave is augments
by his being a slave and if so why call hin
j a unfortunate victim canit be that this ii
mere cant by which to seduce the north int
your support on the ground of your sympathy
for the slave i cannot believe you capable
of such infatuation ido not wish to bclievt
that you arc capable of either the low cun
ning or the vanity which your language or
this subject would seem to imply but will se
j it down to an uncontrollable conviction of the
innate wickedness of slavery which forces itsel
out and defies even your vast powers of con
eealment
but further you assert
every state luw the supreme uncontrolu
exclusive power to decide for itsrlf whether slaver
shall cease or continue within its limits without am
exterior intervention from any quarter
here i understand you to assert the mos
profligate and infernal doctrine that any stati
j in this i nion has a right to plunder scourgi
j an d enslave any part of the human family
within its borders just so long as it deems i
tor its interest so to do and that no one o
k dy of persons beyond the limits of said stati
i has a right to interfere by word or deed agains
it is it possible that you hold this monstrous
tnd bloodchilling doctrine it so what con
fidence can any enlightened lover of liberty
place in your pretended opposition to slavery
i  know your answer to all this but it only
i plunges you into lower depths of infamy that
the horrible doctrines avowed above you g
on to say

in states where the slarrs outnumber the whites
a s die rase in several which i believe are onh
two out ot fifteen the blacks conkl not be einanei
kited without becoming the governing power in thes
 states
i tills miserable bugbear is quite a con
festoon of the mental and physical equality
o the races ou pretend that you are
i republican ou loudly boast of your dem
ocratic principles why then do you object t
the application of your principles in this case
is the democratic principle good in one case
and bad in another would it be worse fort
mack majority to govern a white minority that
it now is for the latter to govern the former
but you conjure up an array of frightful ob
jections in answer to this
j cnuuians and conflicts between the tte races wmli
inevitable and after shocking scenes of rapme and cur
the ertincti m or aputsiam of the blacks i ould ctr
tainjy take jdace
how do you know that any such result
would be inevitable where ou the page 
j history do you find anything to warrant ever
j such a conjecture you will probably potni
j me to the revolution in st domingo the old
and threadbare falsehood under which demo
cratic tyrants have sought a refuge for the lasi
fort t years but the facts in that direction
  against you it has been dearly proven
that that revolution was not the result of eman
cipation but of a cruel attempt to rcenslavc
an already emancipated people lam not a
ware that you have a single fact to support
j your truly terrible assertion while on the oth
l er hand i have many all going to show what
i is equally taught by the voice of reason and
of god that it is always strß to do
right the promise of god is that thy
light shall break forth as the morning and thy
health shall spring forth speedily and thy
righteousness shall go before thee the glory
of the lord shall be thy reward then shall
j thou call and the lord shall answer thou
shall cry and he will say here i am
j the history of the world is in conformity
with the words of inspired wisdom
for instance at the history of emancipation in
the british west indies there the km
were and still are an overwhelming majority
have there been any shocking scenes of re
pine mid carnage extinction or expulsion
you know there have not why then do you
make use of this unfounded and irrational con
jecture to frighten your fellowcountrymen
from the righteous performance of a so pie
of justice to mdiioea no m groaning in al
o hopeless bondage
ii now gin your argument in support of the
morality of your position
fo adapting the inpmice j
kiihi ahraf asfc practicable or pnariha n the

the eaaea which yon pot in support of the
foregoing propositions are only wanting in
one thing and that is analogy the plunder

to which no honest mas cm look with my de
gree of satmfoction it was t wrong to the
indiana then imag aad how muchaocrer we
might seek to repair that wrong the victims
are far beyond any benefit of it but with re
ference to the slave the wroag to be repaired
is a present one tho slave holder is the every
day robber of the slave of his birthright to
liberty property and the pursuit of happiness
his right to be free is unquestionablethe
wrong to enslave him is sclfjtf identthe duty
to emancipate him is imperative are you
aware to what your arguimt on this point
leads do you not plainly cc that the greatest
crimes that ever cursd eir common earth
j may take shelter under yur reasoning and
 may claim perpetuity on die ground of their
antiquity
sir i must pass over yflur allusions to that
almost defunct and infernal scheme which you
term unmixed benevolence for expelling
not th slave but the ns colored propie from
these united states as well as vour charge
against the abolitionists

itis phthnthrnptr and con valin rrleitin that
the moral and physical rmhethn of the african in the
l fitted states in a state of slavery is far better than it
wjoli have been hod their mvesiors hj been brought
from their native land
i crut scarce repress the flame of rising in
dignation as i read this cold blooded and cruel
sentence there is so much of satan dressed in
the livery of ilcaven as well as taking conso
lation from crime that i scarcely know how
to reply to it let me ask you what has
bean the cause of the present unsettled con
dition of africa why has she not reached
forth her hand unto god why have not her
fields been made missionary grounds as well
as the fecjee islands because of this very
desolating traffic from which you seem to draw
consolation for three hundred years chris
 tian nations among whom we are foremost
have looked to africa only as a place for the
j gratification of their lust and love of power
j and evcr means hare been adopted to stay
j the onward march of civilisation in that unhap
j pv land
our declaration on this point places you
consolation with that of the wolf in devouring
the lamb you next perpetrate what i con
ceiie to be the most revolting blasplieiny
i you say
r wl d hlnu the decree of the great ruler o
the uaverse that their descendant shell be made in
i struments m his hands in the establishment of civdiza
and the christian rrurim throughout africaou
i egrets on account of the original wrong unit be grtatli
mitigated
i here sir you would charge home upoi
god the responsibility of your own crimes an
v mild seek a solace from the pangs of a guil
ty conscience by sacriligiously assuming tha
i in robbing africa of her children you acted ii
otl hem great purposes and were hu
j fulfilling the decrees of the most high god
but as if fearing that this refuge of lies migh
fad you strive to shuffle off the responsibilit
ot this g evil on great britain may
not ask if you were fulfilling the great purpo
sss of god in the share you took in this traffic
and can draw consolation from that allegei
fact is it honest to make england a smne
above yourselves and deny her all the miti
gating circumstances which you apply t
yourselves
j you y hat gnat detain inflicted th
eal upon you if this be true it is equal
true that she inflicted the same evil upon her
s it but she has had the justice and the mag
nanimity to repent and brins forth fruits ttiee
j for repentance you copied her ixid example
wh y not avail yourself of her good one also
j now sir i have done with vour speech
j though much more might be said upon it
hare a tew words to say to you personally
i wish to remind you that you are not onlj
iin the autumn but in the very winter o
seventyone years have passed ove
 your stately brow you must soon leave thii
world and appear before god to render uj
an account of your stewardship for fifti
years of your life you have been a slaveholder
i you have robbed the laborer who has reapei
j down your fields of his rightful reward yoi
j are at this moment the robber of nearly fifri
human beings of their liberty compelling
them to live in ignorance let me ask if yoi
think that god will hold you guiltless in th
i great day of account if you die with th
blood of these fifty slaves clinging to your gar
j meats i know that you have made a profes
sion of religion and have been baptized am
am aware that you are in good and regula
standing in the church but i have the autho
rity of god for saying that you will stand rc
jected at his bar unless you put away th
evil of your doings from before his eyes
cease to do evil and learn to do wellseel
judgment relieve the oppressedand pleat
for the widow you must break everj
yoke and let the oppressed go free or takt
your place in tbe ranks of evil doers anti
i to reap the reward of corruption
at this late day m your life i tumk h
would be unkind for me lo charge you with
any ambitious desires to become the president
of the united states i may be mistaken m
this but it seems that you cannot indulge eithej
the wish or expectation bear with me then
while i give you a few words offmther counsel
as a private individual and excuse the plain
ness of one win has i elt the wrongs of sla
very and fathomed the depths of its iniquity
emancipate your ow n slaves leave them
not to be held or sold by others leave them
free as the father of htseountry left his aad let
your down to posterity as h m
down to us a slaveholder to be sure but a
repentant one make the noble rewire that
o for as yo are personally concerned
asteaicx shall e fere
in taking you to do this i ask nothing
which in any degree conflicts with your
argument against general emancipariuti the
dangers w hich you conjecture of the latter
caimk he apprehended of the former your
own slaves are too few in number to make
them formidable or dangerous la this matter
you are without excuse i leave yon to your

henry clay on slavery
the oracle of the whigs has spoken and
the presidential tptesfion is settled  say his
idolaters at least so said they upon the re
ception of his lexington resolutions although
the telegraphic notice of his speeeh gave
ominous presago that everything was not
exactly according to gunter as we were
told that when he came to the slavery ques
tion here the wires didnt seem to work
welland we were referred to the speech
itself which would be forthcoming in due
time in the interim however the whig
press shout loud hosannas and attempt to
roarback the people into the notion that
ciay has come out upon antislavery
ground or is up neck and neck with the
wilmot provisothat is that he would inter
dict slavery in any new territory which might
be acquired such a representation is a
swindle and a fraud henry clay totally
avoids that issue and sneaks behind the posi
tion of no more territory which he and
every man knows to be a falsi issue and
under the circumstances of the case an ab
surdity
but let us hear the great western he
says we disclaim in the most positive
manner any desire on our part to acquire any
foreign territory whatever for the purpose of
introducing slavery into it ido not knoic
that any citizen of the unitd states entertains
such a wish this is the wonderful and
positive disclaimer which has so inflated
the whigs and has made llenry clay pre
sident of the united states a disclaimer
to which upon mr clays own showing
everv man in the south can subscribe he
in short endorses and defends the whole south
from the charge of desiring territory for the
purpose of extending slavery yet mr
clay knew and we all know that these same
men millions of them would move heaven
and earth to prevent the passage of the w il
mot proviso they are determined to have
territory and mr clay knew it they arc
determined that there shall be no interdiction
of slavery therein and he also knew that is
it any thing else than a pettifogging quibble
for him to disclaim for them and him that
they want territory for the jntrpose of ex
tending slavery if it is notorious that the
south are determined to fight over the mis
souri question again about this new territory
what care we lor ten thousand disclaimers
from clay calhoun co that slavery is
not the purpose for which they want the
territory has mr clay come upon the re
publican ground of free lafor upon free soil v
he lias never approached the thought in his
whole speech does he say any thing that
looks like favoring a wilmot proviso let
me quote the wilmot proviso there shall
be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude
in any territory hereafter acquired by the
united states nothing like this appears
in the speeeh and to pretend that mr clay
favors such an idea is a gross fraud upon the
people
does mr clay profess any change of opin
ion on slavery so far from it he refers to
his past history and publicly expressed opin
ions and claims that they have at least the
merit of consistency uniformity ami
long duration on his own showing
llenry clay the author of the missouri com
promise is the same old coon p

some facts
immigration to the west lndffs

we take the following from the annual re
port of use committee of the bnash nod f
a antislavery society it rfnmi the oe
i cesnty of keeping n sharp lookout over thus
jin wbooe bosoms the haven of slavery kaj
i once had a place
the committee have frequently of late hat
to call attention to the mode of supplying th
british colonies with foreign laborers an u
just in principle unwise in policy nod buff
inhuman and immoral in its character and ten
denews it should bower rbe distinctly on
demood that they have never opposed the in
troduction of hnirttgraiks into the colonies
provided the conditions of such imuugratxm
were equitable and humane all that ffuv
have required has been that the immigrant
should be introduced either at their ow n expense
or at the expense of those requiring their servi
ces that there should be an equality of the sexes
in the immigrants imported that the immigrants
should be free to choose their employers and
employments on their arrival in the colonies
and that as perfect liberty of action should be
secured to them as to any other class of the
laboring population in the colonies instead ot
this however the immigrants except in acorn
paratively few instances an introduced at the
public expense the emancipated laborers le
mg taxed heavily for this purpose that the
number of males introduced have bsen in the pro
portion of ten to one of females that practi
cally they have no liberty of choice but are
distributed according to the w ill of the colonial
agents or the w ishes of the planters and they
are brought under a system of laws w hich re
duces them to a species of semislavery from
which few have the means of escape at least
j for five years
under the various schemes of immigration
j which ha a obtained at mauritius there have
 been introduced from the year  to 
inclusive no less than  coolies chiefly
males besides several thousands of malgaches
chinese johannesc and others into british
i guiana there have been imported during the
same period of africans coolies portuguese
germans and others  w hilst into ja
maica and trinidad it is not improbable that
hiooo at least have found their way yet
owing to the fearful mortality which has oc
 ctirml the tcimination of indentures and con
tracts and the return of immigrants to their
homes the cry for fresh immigrants is as loud
as ever and the nsourees of these colonies are
drained to the uttermost to meet tin demand
and are even put in pledge for years to come
as in the case of british guiana and trinidad to
repay capital and interest in loans to be rais
i ed for this particular purpose whilst in mau
ritius funds that were specially devoted to
public works amounting to  have
been misappropriated to immigration with no
j prospect of their ever being repaid
it is now clear however that two sources on
which the government and planters principal
ly depended for asupply of laborers to the three
colonies of jamaica british guiana and trin
idad have either failed or are tot costly to be
kept open the liberated africans at sierra
leone with the exception of those who
have recently been captured refuse to leave
that colony and the expense connected with
immigrants from british india is found to be
too heavy for the colonies to bear the com
mittee expect therefore that when the present
season has passed and the  coolies
promised have reached those colonies there
will be an end of that kind of immigration to
the west indias
to meet the loss of supplies from the quar
ters indicated the goverment on the pressing
solicitations of the west india body have de
termined upon obtaining laborers from the
kroo coast western africa and by way of
j experiment have fitted up one of h m steam
vessels the growler to go thither and have
appointed agents on the coast to engage and
superintend the shipment of kroumen for
guiana and trinidad the committee have
felt it to bo their duty earnestly to protest
against this new scheme first because the
kroo coast is not under british jurisdiction or
control secondly because the agents are to
lie paid headmoney for obtaining the kroo
men thirdly because the kroomcn are if not
absolutely slaves under the dominion of their
headmen or chiefs so that they can not act a
free agents fourthly because they will not be
permitted by their chiefs to take their wives
and families with them and fifthly because it
will afford a most pernicious example to for
eign states having slave colonits or territories
to supply themselves with laborers nominally
free but really slaves and thereby give a new
stimulus to tiie slavetrade w ith all its muni
i fold horrors
the committee feel that this important sub
j ject demands the most serious attention of bri
tish alkilitionists and they hope w ill meet w ith
their most strenuous opposition

had the abolitionists not interferred in the mat
ter by this time schools for children of color i
would have been quite as common here as
schools for white children the advantages of
the latter arc nothing in comparison with those
of the children of the state of new york
there are many slaves however who are
taught to read and writethe law to the con
trary notwithstanding i have just been shown
a written letter from the pen of a girl eighteen
years old who is an educated slave her
mistress taught her as the whites rise in
civilization intellectual and moral improve
ment they elevate all their servants in an equal j
ratio intelligence and good habits are easily
and naturally acquired by children in good so 
eiihv place them from infancy to manhood
in the society of the ignorant and depraved
and it will be something akin to a miracl if
they are letter than their instructors
the sparseness of the settlements at the
south and its poor lands are the great barriers
to the general and thorough education of the j
masses who must elevate the blacks by their
example the building up of numerous villa
ges of intelligent mechaifies and the creation
of markets for fruits vegetables milk butter
eheese fresh meats c demanding a large
number of laborers to cultivate in gardens and
many acres of land is the way to lay the foun
dation for good schools libraries lyceums i
churches lectures newspapers and all the
other means and agents for the social moral
and intellectual advancement of our race it
is not for me to reproach any people for their
ignorance and low standard of physical com
fort who from their birth upward have never
had a fair opportunity to be better informed
give to the children of the southall the social
intellectual and other advantages possessed by
the most favored of the free states and you
will see in twentyfive years a perfect change
of opinion on many vital questions the south
ern heart is right and its head is beginning to
look and travel in the same direction

ignorance in alabama such is the
title of un article in the southern alabama
advocate on the subject of popular education
in the course of which the following state
ment is made founded upon the census of

by that document we find that the white
population of the state then amounted to a
bout three hundred and thirtyfive thousand
 and that of these the number
over twentyone years of age alone who could j
neither read nor write amounted to upwards of
twentytwo thousand  twentytwo
thousand citizens in a republican state who
could not read the charter of their liberties
twentytwo thousand in a christian land to
whom the scriptures the guide of moral con
duct were as much a sealed book as to the
unhappy beings in the darkest regions of pa
ganism these are astounding factsthey
are disgracefulthey are mournful
by referring to the census it will lie lound
that the number of white persons in alabama
over twenty years of age was  the
lair estimate then is that almost one in every
five adult white persons in alabama in 
could neither read nor write and we have
the testimony of this writer that the evil has
been steadily increasing since the census was
taken he attributes it in some cases to the
worthlessness of the school lands donated by
congress and in others to the neglect or
mismanagement of them the truth is the
legislature has provided no system of public
education and the reason of this is obvious
it was stated by senator archer of irgima
in a short address delivered by him in cincin
nati a few months ago at the close of the
annual examination of the common schools
by which that city is adorned
senator archer said tiic cincinnati
times remarked at the close of the exami
nation that he now saw for the first time
evidence of the practicability of popular edu
cation no one he said who had been so
long conversant with politieal matters as he
had could doubt that the only safeguard of
our free institutions is the diffusion of sound
knowledge among the whole people it vccs
to him a source of deep regret that in his own
stott from the nature of its population the
establishment of a system of public schools
had been impracticable
this is the secret of it the nature o
the population prevents the plantation
thins out the fre white population and what
should be s school district is occupied bra few
wealthy slaveholders with hordes t of slaves
to the latter education ts forbidden and the
former do not live near enough to keep op a
school and even were this not the case their
habits dtspeae them to employ private tutors
or send them to boarding schools rather than
suffer their children to mingle with these ol
j the poor at a common school but the poor
alone cannot keep up schools and thus aav

years ago however without any apparent
cause other than the infirmities of increasing

much inflamed and swollen and at times pain

their appliances proved useless and some ol
them injurious my limb grew worse until 
was almost confined to my house and my leg
in addition to the swelling and inflammation
assumed a dark purplish color from the knee
to the ankle the skin was almost dead and
it appeared on the point of breaking out into a
running sore and i was instructed by my phy

nothing further could be done than to render
me comfortable these bad symptoms began j
to make their appearance above the knee and
assumed a more serious aspect affecting my
general health and appetite in this condition
i was persuaded to consult dr ruggles in re

is a pity that the trashy literatuie of me
day should find readers within the wails
of a college yet it is thus that some
spend too much of their valuable time
as an instance of this i am going to
repeat here a great story a graduate
of harvard told me that during his
college life he three thousand
volumes of fiction three thousandy i
you exclaim t impossible he rnutfti
have said three hundred three
sand he assured me and his veracity
is unquestionable nor did the evi
dent regret with which he spoke of it
admit of any motive to exaggerate
but let us see if it be possible and if
it be the well known mania of novel
reading in some person makes it
probable in four years including one
leapyear there aie  days he had
then to read hut two volumes and a
fraction daily sundays included rij
sing early and reading far into the
night he was able to do this he used
he said to run into boston on his feet
every evening during twilight to the
book shops and circulating libraries toj
return volumes and obtain others i
had thought this an unparalleled in
stance in the history of novelreading
as among students i hope it is but
happening to speak of it to a friend he
mentioned the following being with

had been stricken with the fatal disease and
was reduced by it to nearly a skeleton his
friends looked upon him as a doomed man
and he himself had given up all hopes ol
loug continuance of life he was one morn
ingcraw ling about his groundsand accidentally
went into a shed w here a man had been lot
tliug some wine and at the moment of his
masters entrance had just incited some rosin
to seal the corks w ith it could not be other
wise than that those within the room should
inhale the smoke arising from the resin to
the surprise of the aillictcd one his respira
tion became free and unobstructed and it in
stantly occurred to him that the relief he ex
perienced was produced by his having inhaled
the rosinous smoke he remained better du
ring the day and without consulting his doc
tor repeated the experiment in his sleeping
room that night he slept soundlya bles
sing he had not known for years
twice a day for a week did he continue
his experiment and with increased success
he then mentioned the affair to his medical
adviser who was equally surprised with him
self at the improvement of the patients health
and advised him to continue the inhalations
night and morning
in the space of three months his cough left
him and his appetite returned in six months
his health was so improved that he contem
plated returning to his native country he de
layed however doing so until a year had ex
pired sstill persisting in his new found reme
dy his health was completely restored and
he was once more a sound man
newspapers a newspaper can drop tin

eloquence the best style as coleridge
has remarked is that which forces us to
think of the subject without paving attention
to the particular phrases in which it is clothed
the true excellency of style is to make us
feci that words are absorbed in things and to
leave upon the mind a strong impression e
the sense and the tenor of the reasoning railt
er than a broken and piecemeal recollection o
particular expressions and images the result
on the contrary if not the intention of too
much pulpit oratory is to till the ear with a
multitude of grand terns and bewilder the
fancy with a crowd of tropes while it is com

a kindhearted child
there is nearly in front of oar office i
an old pumpa kind of town pump
which every one mar use and whose
wet and bespattered base speaks plain
er than sign boards could do of water
for man and hones and a very excel j
lent pump it is too never oot of order
easily worked and furnishing the pu 
rest clearest coolest water in the
world many a thirsty school boy and
omnibus driver has refreshed himself at
that pumpthe trackmen and draymen
j stop there and the old iron ladle that
i hangs by its side has been pressed to
many a sweet and pretty lip it is no
j unusual thing just after school hours
to see some little fellow with hissatch
 el over his shoulder working away at
the handle for ten minutes at a time till
ail who have gathered around it have
been supplied with drink but yes
terday the pump was honored as though
an angel had blessed it a rosy cheek
ed girl her face half hid in a flood of
glorious curls came bouncing by driv
i mg her hoop as the old decreprd apple
j women whom every body knows and
whom no one passes without git ing her
a penny was endeavoring to obtain a
drink she had set down her basket
but bent nearly double by the weight of
her years and sorrow s was still com
pelled to lean upon her staff the little
hebe saw the difficulty and was in an
i instant at the handle holding the la
die until it was filled she carried it gent
ly to the lips of the old lady then filled
i it again w hile the warm grateful thanks
j ofthe poor woman called the crimson
to her cheek which as she hurried a
way was deepened by the consciousness
j that she was observed we shall ever
remember that girl and the joyous sat
isfaction with which she performed a
good and kind action to the aged the
scene and the hearty thanks of the old
lady called forcibly to mind and not
altogether inappropriately the beauti
ful thought in talfords tragedy of ion
it a littlo thing
i to gire a cup of water yet it draught
of cool refreshment drained by fevered lips
may send a shock of pleasure to the soul
more exquisite than when nectarious juice
renews the life of joy in happiest hours
reminiscences of chalmers
on entering kilmanv one sabbath
morning i was informed that mrs
chalmers had during the preceding
night presented the doctor with his
first child on meeting with him i ad
verted to the circumstance and inquired
how mrs chalmers and the child were
getting on he replied that they
are as well as could be expected but j
could not have conceived that an event
i of this kind would have occasioned such
j a stir that so many persons would be
i employed about it that there would
have been such a running up and down
j stairs and from one apartment to an
t other and all this bustle about bring
ing into the world a creature not three
j feet long i observed that no bustle
i would be more cheerfully submitted to
than that which takes place at the birth
of a child whose utter helplessness
j makes so irresistable an appeal to our
sympathy and tenderness and as to
the child not being three feet long
we must estimate its value as we do
that of a young treenot by the small
ness of its dimensions but by the size
that we expect it to attain there
may be some truth in that said the
doctor smiling hut really such a
hustle as he house was thrown into by
this affair i was quite unprepared to
expect
of the bewilderment to which contem
plative persons are liable the doctor
exhibited a ludicrous instance by com
ing on one occasion from kilmanv to
cupar with a pair of stockings of which
the one was of a quite different pattern
from that of the other the person on
whom he had called and from whom i
had the anecdote pointed out to the as
tonished doctor the mistake he had
committed
dr chalmers toilet was soon dis
patched to the advantage which
dress gives to the external appearance
he was remarkably indifferent he
 might have been seen walking about
kilmany in such laded habiliments as
would have made a person who did not
know him suppose that his condition
was a large remove beneath that of a
clergyman on one occasion when
walking to cupar accompanied by my
brother i encountered the doctor or
j the kilmany road and stopped a few
minutes to converse with him when
i overtook iny brother who had gone
j forward he said that he wondered how
i had become acquainted with the bea
i die of the parish the beadle i ex
claimed dont judge by the outwarc
appearance he is the minister of the
parish the celebrated dr chalmers
with whom any one however exaltce
i his rank might be proud to be acquain
i ted
a specimen of caligraphy so difficuli
to decipher as that of dr chalmers
j believe it would not be easy to find
his letters were so shapeless so unlike
those they were designed to represent
i that you would have been almost tempt
j ed to think that he intended to mystify
his meaning and perplex his correspond
ent  once received a letter from him
which nobody to whom i showed ii
could read and which i believe wouh
have baffled all my attempts to do so
had  not been previously acquainted
w ith the subject to which it referred
studious persons are somtimes sur
prisingly ignorant how to act on ordina
ry occasions i r chalmers came home
one evening on horseback and as nei
ther the man who had the charge of hi
horse nor the key of the stable could bt
found he was for some time not a little
puzzled where to find a teinporar resi
lience for the animal at last he fixed
on the garden as the fittest place he
could think of for the purpose and
having led the hore thither fee pucd

an incident of the slave trade
ktlitip la the csiveese eewrafafee
in the vear  there was hovering
upon the african coast a large clipper
brig called the briihttntr commanded
by a desperado named homans ho
j mans waa an englishman by birth and
was known along the whole coast and in
cuba aa the most successful slaver of
his day the brig was owned by two
men residing in havanna one an en
glishman the other a spaniard she
was built to carry slx hundred negroes
i and in her homans hadin ten successful
voyages actually landing in cuba five
thousand negroes the brig carried
ten guns had thirty sweeps and a crew
i of sixty spaniards the most of them as
desperate as their commander an
english brig of war which attacked
her w f as so cut up in hull and rigging
that she was abandoned and soon after
sunk an english sloop of war attempted
to carry the brilliante w ith boats but
was beaten off with great slaughter
now it was well known that ho
mans was again on the coast and it
was resolved to make another desperate
effort to take him with the evidence of
his guilt on board the arrangements
were well made he was allowed to
take in his cargo of negroes and set
sail
the brilliante had not lost sight of
the coast when the qqick eye of the
commander discovered that he was en
trapped four cruizers three english
and one american had been laying in
wait for him and escape was hopeless
  for in running away from one he would
come w ithin reach of another night
was coming on and homans was silently
regarding his pursuers when suddenly
the huge sails of the brig flapped idly
the wind died rapidly away and the
slaver was motionless on the waters
this will not do homans muttered
knocking away the ashes from his cigai
their boats will be down upon me
before i am ready for the visit and a
he said this his stern face lit up with n
smile the expression of which was dia
bolical it was evident he meditated
some desperate plan
a dozen sweeps were got out and
the vessel moved slowly through the
water meantime the darkness having
j deepened homans proceeded to carry
out his design
the cable attached to the heaviest
anchor was taken outside the hawser
hole and carried round the bow aft
round the stern and then forward on
the other side the hatches were then
taken off and the negroes passed up
each securely ironed by the wrists as
j the miserable w retches came from the
hot hold into the fresh air they express
sed by their looks a gratitude that would
have softened the heart of any hut the
fiend in whose power they were avith
out a word they were led to the side
made to bend over the rail outside ol
which the chain ran it w r as slow work
j hut at the end of four hours six hundred
africans male and female were bending
oyer the rail of the brig in a painful po
rtion holding by heir chained hands tc
a huge cable which was to be attached to
j a heavy anchor suspended by a single
sling from the bow
homans himself examined the fasten
ings to see that every negro was stron
ly bound to the chain this done he
ordered the pen work of the hold to be
broken up and brought on deck bounc
up in matting well filled with shot and
thrown overboard the work was com
pleted an hour before daybreak anc
i now the only w itness of homansguilf
was attached to the fatal chain ho
mans turned to his mate and with t
smile full of meaning said in spanish
harro take an axe and go forward th
wind will come off to us soon lister
for the word and when you hear it cu
the sling
the man went forwrard and homan
j turned and in vain attempted to pene
itrate the darkness i dont w ant t
lose the niggers he said speaking
aloudand yet i dare not wait unti
daylight i wish i knew where th
hounds were
at that instant the report of a gm
reached his ear then another and an
other in different directions the cruis
ers were firing signals
thats enough answered homans
i know where you are then raising
his voice he cried harro are yoi
ready the wind will reach us soon
ay ay sir was the response
i in a few moments the sails began t
j fill and the vessel moved slowly throug
jthe water
how much water do you suppose w
hare here asked homans turning t
the man at the wheel
fifty fathoms at least was the reply
that will do the slaver muttered am
he walked forward and carefully exam
ined the chain gang as he brutal
termed his diabolical invention
the negroes sent up piteous groans
for many hours they had been hem
over in that unnatural positionby w hicl
thcv were suffering the keenest torture
the breeze strengthened the rriffj
ante joshed tike a racer over the deep
homans hailed from the quarter deck
while his men collected in groups wit
nessed munoved the consummation ol
of the plan
are you ready harro
aye aye sir
 totoaim looked around and out int

hundred human beings had gone down
with that anchor and chain into the
deaths of the ocean
two hoars after daybreak the bril
tiante was overhauled there was no
evidence that she was a slaver and her
captors were obliged to let her pass
the instructions to cruisers at that time
did not allow a vessel to be captured

t t tut verdict in favor
the masterthe miutart caller
out
we subjoin a brief statement of the 
facts of the arrest of three negroes at
mount holly under the plea that they
were slaves independent of the natu
ral abhorrence which exists among us
against slavery the trial has an inter
est as being the first ever held in this
country we give the facts as narra
ted by a friend
this highly interesting and important
slave case took place in mount holly
new jersey and was very unexpectedly
decided last evening it was a clauu
made by mr john koth a slave holder
who resides in cecil county state o
maryland to recover as fugitive slaves
perry henson noah henson and ra
chel pine three respectable colored
citizens who have been residing for
several years in the neighborhood ol
mont hollytwo of them being married
and one having a family of children
j these persons were seduced from their
homes on thursday last on a pretended
claim for taxes on arriving at mount
holly in the evening they were all
j seized as fugitives by a warrant and
taken before judge hayward some
of their friends hearing of it that night
assembled very early in the morning
and employed for them as counsel mr
r  spencer of mount holly who
went before the said judge and deman
ded a trial by jury under a recent law
by the state of new jersey which was
granted and the hearing postponed un
til yesterday morning when messrs
stratton and moftit of mount holly ap
peared as counsel for the claimants
and mr spencer assisted by mr paul
brown of philadelphia for the defend
ants at the onset of the case mr
stratum attempted to prevent the exer
cise of peremptory challenge of three
jurors which however was overruled by
the court upon the jurors being call
ed by mr charles collins sheriff of
burlington county it was found that
he had returned twelve men and no
more consequently upon the defend
ants counsel challenging three jurors
the panel was exhausted
the claimant produced several wit
nesses from maryland who testified that
they had known these alleged fugitives
for several years and believed that they
had formerly belonged to mr john
roth sen who as stated by one wit
ness died insolvent and that they now
 considered them the property of the
i claimant because they bh seen them
living with him one witness testified
that he was the administrator of johp
roth jun the present claimant by
orphans court
upon these grounds the counsel for
plaintiff rested their case
mr spencer then commenced his
i speech for the defendants in which he
most energetically appealed to the jiiry
as citizens of new jersey to stand by
their own state laws made for the me
j fence of human liberty he then stated
that the plaintiffs had not made out fheii
case according to the requirements of
the laws of new jersey for the follow
ing reasons
ist been use they had not produced
properly authenticated documentary ev
i idence that maryland was a slave state
d because they had uot satisfacto
rily proved the title of the present claim
ant to these three persons either by bill
l or otherwise and that either of these
points being unsustained must pi we
fatal to their cause he proceeded by
showing that under these views of the
case the jury must pause before ye
turning into hopeless bondage three je
spcctabje inhabitants of this district
this speech was most ably delivered
and had a thrilling effect upon the laifge
audience there assembled
mr david paul brown then followicd
upon the same side in a most emphatic
manner showing the great important
ance ol the present decision on accoi nt
of this being the first occurrence of f le
kind in this or any country he th n
went into the legal merits of the caje
which he handled in a masterly maja
ner and fully sustaining the views pre
sented by his colleague and urging the
importance to the jury of keeping the
claimants strictly to the laws and n t
to infringe in the least upon the rights
of these unfortunate persons who sto d
charged with no crime save that of
color
this most powerful appeal was listen
ed to with the greatest attention and
appeared to produce great effect upon
the court and jury as well as all pres
ent
mr stratton then followed for the
j claimants in which he acquitted himsc if
with ability but did not attempt to a j
j wer the objections on the other side

the jury returned in about twenty
minutes with a verdict in favor of the
plaintiffs and aa the officers were about
removing the prisoners one of theirnum
ber made some resistance or an effort to
escape when he was seizedand the court
was immediately cleared of colored per
sons who retired without the least dis
position being manifested by them to
make a riot yet notwithstanding this
the sheriff drew his pistols and threat
ened to shoot the citizens if they attemp
ted to interfere the slavedealers and
their allies also flourished pistols and
dirks and some with oaths threatened
to shoot the first nigger they could
find
ropes were called for and the nris
soners lied very securely one of them
was treated in a very barbarous man
ner and the voices of s timber of re
spectable inhabitants were raised to
beg i them to drsit from such cruelty
while they were still lying upoa the
w ith their hands pinioned behind
them and only a frw of the citizen in

thert was no reasonable pretext for
this disgraceful proceeding of calling out
the military during the whole of the
trial although there was a large num
ber of colored people present they be
haved with the utmost propriety they
were respectable in appearance and
made not the least demonstration of at

it is but proper to say that manv of
