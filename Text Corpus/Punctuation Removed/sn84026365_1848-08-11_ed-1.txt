afternoon session
a urge nydicoen convened op
portunity for praer was given a
long and mtcrcvlmg utter from james
i c jackson approving the objects 
the couv ntid was read
j sarah c owen then resented an
address port aving the evils to which
women ore su je t
sarah u hishals read an address
setting forth some ol the causes of wo
mans degradation and urging hei
earnestly to come torward to the work
of elevation several resolutions wer
i read wnich l mott ably advocated
though she thought them too tameshe
wanted s unething more stirring
mrs roberts reported the average
j price of labor for sempstresses to he
from  to d cts per day board from
io to   per week to be deduct
ed therefrom and they are generally
obliged to take half or more than hall
in due bills
mrs gawley corroborated the state
ment having herself experienced some
of the oppression of this portion of oui
citizens and expressed her gratitude
that the subject was claiming attention
mis stanton offered a resolution
respecting the wages of house servants
which she thought too low for the lab i
ithey perform and urged the necessity
of reformers commencing at home
mrs mott said our aim should be
to elevate the low ly and aid the weak
i she compared the condition of wornai
j with that of the free colored population
 and dwelt upon the progress they had
m made within the past few years urging
 imitation of their perseverance through
opposition and prejudiceand said
while woman is regaidcd as an inferior
 beingwhile the rible is brought for
ward to prove the right of her present
position and while she is disposed to
feel satisfied with it all these efforts
can do hut little vve cannot expect to
do much by meeting iu convention for
those borne down by the oquessur un
less the oppressed iheinselvesftel and act
and while so little attention is paid to
education and so little respect to wo
man she spoke of the education ol
j boys and girls in england the coin
tnon schools for hoys show  an improvc
j tnent mathematics and many of the
higher branches being taught while
the girls learn little more than to read
write and keeffc their little accounts
sewing being the principal object of at
 tention the teachers say it will not
do to educate them you unlit them
i for servants we grant that wo
i mans intellect is feeble because she
i has been s long crushed does one
inan have fewer rights than another
because his intellect is inferior if not
why should woman be denied her rights
fr that reason let her arise and de
mand them and in a few years we shall
see a different mental development
lie regarded this as the beginning oi
the day when woman shall rise when
i she shall occupy her appropriate posi
tion in society

this equality would have on the happi
ness of a family if the wife and husband
should differ in regard to politics or the
education of a child mrs mott re
j plied by asking which is preferable
j ignorant or intelligent differences
mr sullv farther said when the two
heads disagree who must decide
there is n lord chancellor to wiom
to apply hut does not st paul strictly
enjoin obedience to husbands and thar
rnan shall he head of the woman mrs
mott replied that in an extensive in
tercourse with the society of friends
she had never known any difficulty to
arise on aecount of the wifes not hav
j ing promised obedience in the marriage
contract she had never known any
other mode of decision except a resort
to argument aa appeal to reason and
although in some of the meetings ol
this society women are placed on an
equality oa of the results ao much
dreaded have occurred the opposers
of womens rights who though they
bid u obey the bachelor st peul
themselves reject his coeoselhe ad
vised them not to marry in general

the resolution were then read ant
amt post moved their adoption a
discussion ensued in which mrs mott
i mrs stanton and mr pickard par
ticipated
mr pickard asked who aftei
marriage should hold property ant
whose name skould be retained h
thought an umpire necessary all bust
ness must cease until tue consent o
bth parties be obtained he saw ar
impoaibiity of introducing such a rult
into society the gospel has establish
ed the unify i the quarried pairthey
two are one
mrs staxtox thought property migbi
 he held jointly and the choice of namei
discretionary with the parties the
custom of taking the husbands name is
not universal
the following res dutions were now
adopted with but two or three dissent
ing voices
resolved that we petition our state
legislature for our right to the elective
franchise every year until our prayei
be granted
resolved that it is an admitted prin
ciple of the american republic that
the only just power of government is
derived ir in the consent of the gov
erned and that taxation and represent
ation are inseparable and woman be
ingtaxcdequally with man therefore she
ought not to be deprived of an equal
representation in the government
resolved that we greatly deplore
the apathy and indifference of woman
in regard to her rights it restricts bet
to the occupancy of an interior reli
gious political and domestic station ir
society and we wish to inspire hei
with a desire to stand on an equal basis
claiming her equal right to think speak
and act on all subjects that interest the
human family
resolved that the assumption ol
law to settle estates when men die
without wills leaving widows i  an in
suit to woman and ought to he regard
i ed as such by every friend of l ight and
humanity
resolved that in the persevering
and independent course of mrs black
well wh recently intended n series
of medical lectures at geneva and ha
now gone t europe to graduate as a
physician we seea harbinger of a day
when woman shall stajid forth edeem
ed and disenthralled and perforit
those important dunes which are sc
truly within hoi sphere
whereas the husband has the legal
right to litre out his wife to service
collect her w ages and appropriate them
to his exclusive nr independent benefit
and whereas this ha  contributed to
establish that hideous custom the pro
mise of obedience in themarriage con
tract effectually though insidiously
reducing her almost to the condition ol
a slave whatever freedom she may
have being granted her as a privilege
not as a right therefore
resolved that we will seek the over
throw of toe barbarous and unrighteous
law and encourage woman no longer to
promise obedience in the marriage con
tract
resolved that the universal doctrine
of the inferiority of w man has ever
caused her to distrust her own powers
and paralyzed her energies and placed
her in that diffident position which re
quires the most strenuous and unremit
ing efforts to overcome but which will
he effected by faithful perseverance in
the practical exei cie ol those talents so
long wi i pped in a napkin and buried

resolved that those who think the
laboring class of women are oppressed
ought to do all in their power to raise
their wages beginning with their own
househould servants
resolved that we tender a vote ol

married life depends upon the lady a
great deal more perhaps than she is
aware of she scarcely knows her own
how much she may do by

bow much by unremitted kindness and
little attention to acquire and retain
such influence she must however

that it is not nrtb while to be agreea
ble when there is only her husband by
that she may close her pisno or lay
aside her brush for why should she play
or paint merely to amuse her husband
no she must consider all these little
arts of pleasing clifly valuable on his
accountas means of perpetuating her
attractions and give permanence to his
affectionsshe must remember that her
duty consists not so much in great and
solitary acts in display of the sublime
virtues to which she will only be occa
sionally called but in triflesin a
cheerful smile or a minute attention
naturally renderedand proceeding from
a heart full of kindness and a temper
full of amiability
in looking over a late paper i met
with the above valuable hints on the
duties of wives to their lords pointing
out the modes in which they were to
secure in the husband the chivalric
devotion which had characterized the
lover the most infallible specific or
the one most strongly insisted upon in
rules of this kind is a smiling coun
tenance no matter what a wifes an
noyances may have been during the
day her countenance be always
wreathed in smiles on the approach of
her husband
being one of those fortunate individ
uals who have hitherto escaped the
noose  have had leizure to give to
these subjects that profound reflection
i which characterizes those situated like
i myself
for if theres anything in which i thine
li in anangng all my frien affairs
not having of uiy own domestic cares
it has often recurred to me there
fore that it was rather singular that all
this good advice should always come
froiii one side how it is that there
are so few guideposts to point the way
to innocent young gehtlenien whohave
recently submitted their neck to the
noose and the halter why is it
not ofiener insisted upon that the hus
band should always return to his fire
side with a smile and endeavor to
soothe the perturbed spirit that has for
hours been subjected to the thousand
annoyances of the nursery and the
kitchen
there is many an unfortunate mrs
rogers among my acquaintance with
nine small children and one at the
breast who need all the soothing ten
derness erst bestowed by the lover to
enable them to forget the troubles so
wearing to the nerves by the way it
has sometimes occurred to me whether
it was not mrs rogers who was the
martyr and honest john a most fortun
ate individual to get so well out of
the scrape of being obliged to make
adequate provision for the filling those
ten small mouths and the clothing those
ten small bodies
compare for a moment the lot of
husband and wife in what is called a
well regulated family the former
takes his seat at the breakfast table
where his taste and comfort have been
silently consulted so far as is practica
bleon his wife devolves the care of
preparing the nine small children to
take their seats there also and in some
degree of regulating their conduct
breakfast ended the husband goes
frth to the workshop his counter bis
countinghouse or his office greets
pleasantly his acquaintances by the
way and passes the day among the
evervarying scenes of evcryday busi
ness life the wife meanwhile amid
incessant clamor must renew the tread
mill task of yesterdaymust wash the
same faces make the same bedssweep
the same rooms must give directions
for the succeeding meals and perhaps
assist in preparing them must settle
disputes in the kitchen and quarrels
among the nine fallen little sons and
daughters of htr jldon i stid amid all
occupations must find occasional
moments to stitchstitch stitch the
innumerable garments needed in a
family
let her look to it according to the
sapient and oftreiterated advice shove
ailudtd to that she acts thr wigh this in
time to clothe her barraased and care
worn visage in tbwe wreathed smiles
so tndispensible toward maintaining the
g od humor of her liege lord he
too has had troubles to encounter for
from trouble no one is eaeinpt but n t
of that petty harrassing kind that are
wearing away the spirits and the life of
the partner he has chosen
night comes the husband finds the
repoee ao much needed to enable him
to meet the unavoidable cares of to
morrow and sleeps as as quietly as
the babes io the wood while the
wife surfs at the slightest noie to min
ister to the comfort of the restless in
mates of the trannel bed mod the crib
alt of whom are sore to be astir at the
earliest dawn and demanding the im
msfistt rare of the mother who riots
srwv t whether she always can
is a debatable question i insist there

this event passed off on tuesday last
in a manner gratifying to all apeclafori
and participants the procession was
numerous the address eloquent and ap
propriate and the conduct of he active
participants such as to draw oot appro
batory remarks from those who have
before ridiculed like celebrations we
j believe that all who witnessed the ex

that a change is public sentiment bat

yve noticed at the square a good repre

only instance of blackguardism that we

passed and from that source we might
expect anything but gentlemanlike con

the following reflection touching this
subject
a strange spectacle is visible at this
moment in tar isa spectacle not only
stiaoge hot inexpressibly touching
there is a man in that capital of friv
olify and revolutions who has within
the compass of a lew weeks expert
tnced all the perils and vicissitudes of
i statesmanship yesterday he was re
vert need almost to idolatry today ho
is shunned as if the touch of his hand
or the sound of his voice were contam
i inatingyesterday he was the glory of
the republic to day he is the victim
who is this man he is the poet
j whose sul was intoxicated with the
i beauty of freedom and from whose lips
 cme those words of eloquence which
only a day or two back thrilled through
the beau of christendom
every citizen of trance felt u
i sincerity of this towa enthusiasmit
was attested indeed hyfthe purity the
j consistency and the dignity of a wholfe
life and it is again this man un
der whose nostrils to use an expres
sion lately uttered by the hentaine she
had recently burned the last grain of
her incenseit is against this man that
the slanders of all parties in the repub
lic are now directed ns by a species of
unanimity it is upon his head that the
jealousies of alllegitimists commun
j bonapailists the carriers the
i bourgeoiae and the aristocrats are be
mg poured out today like asheg it j
against him that the obloquies of the
j parisians are being thrown unstinting
i if to afford to future historans a new
and unparalleled example of the mutft
j bility of political fortunes of the vicis
situdes of popularity and the fickleness
of the people
but there is doubtless reason for
this sudden charge in the opinions of
french citizens oh yes there ars
reasons when it was said after the
first insurrection that lsinrtine had
conspired with the insurgents of the
th of may lamartine himself an
swered that accusation from the tribune
of the national assembly he saidev
erybody remembers it yes i have
conspired with those menl have con
spired with them as the lightning con
doctor conspires with the thunder
cloud the metaphor was splendid
and has been verified by events the
lightning conductor of the revolution
otherwise the fame of lamartine has
been melted warped literally blasted
by carrying off the terrible electricity
of the conspiracies to shield france
from peril the poet statesman called
down upon his head the lightnioga of
terrorism lamartine has secured the
salvation of the republic but only by
the sacrifice of his immense and magni
ficent popularity as has been nobly
said already of this great man by ona
speaking from the opposite side of the
channel m de lamartine was no
actuated by ambition but was a patriot
to the extent of selfsacrifice he con
sented with his eyes open to pulvarix
his name in order that be might pre
serve the national assembly thai
is the explanation of this otherwise in
explicable problemthat is the solution
ot the enigma of the downfall of the ex
ecutive commissionthat is the clue
which can alone guide our reason thro
the labannth ol these tgtraordinery
and bewildering occurrence hubert
there have been only whispering td
inaendoea ia deprecation of laamrttoes
character and in s musi on i these
tame whispers sad louendoes he has
himself thus written to the conatuß
lionnel thera is no answer there in
only a cry of indgnatica kicb rises
from the bottom of my soul and wfeiefc
pray yoa s imply to register ulti
mately the troth wifi be revealed bat
meanwhile to alphoaao de lamartine
himself ia tbo midst of his undeserved
desolation can fancy that that
mournful verse must sometimes recur
 waist he wrote ie the garden of gethsemens on the dean of hit young
daughter
religion should be a garment worn next to the heart too many people make a cloak of it 
the th annual meeting of the western antislavery society will be held at salem columbiana co on wednesday thursday and friday th th and th of august commencing at  am
let a full representation of the slaves
friends come up on this occasion from all
parts of the great world the political leaders are marshalling their hosts for a conflict
their followers are rallying by hundreds of
thousands to the support of their party banner time and money and labor are ex
pended to secure their object and shall the
friends of freedom whose faith should be
strong in the power of truth be lukewarm
and indifferent while politicians are so ear
nest in their labors so untiring in their zeal
the events of the past year should encourage
us to renewed e libra for every movement of
importance which has been made having any
bearing upon the question of slavery fore
shadows the destruction of the system and
the oppressors feel that it is so the political
parties will make a desperate effort to save
themselves from the destruction their corrup
tion has brought upon them and the efforts
of the abolitionists to maintain and enforce
the right should lie proportionably great
arrangements should be made at the coming
meeting to continue the antislavery agitation
by the lips of the living speaker and to ex
tend more widely the circulation of the so
cietys paperthe antislavery bugle let
none of the friends who can be there absent
themselves for any light cause for the pre

defeat of the compromise bill
the bill for the organization of govern
ments in oregon california and new mexico j
has been defeated in the house of repre
sentutives it originated in the senate
having been reported to that body by a select j
committee of eight members
a motion was made to lay the bill upon
the tabica summary mode of rejection j
this motion prevailed by a vote of iis
yeas to  naysa majority of  a mo
tion to reconsider was made which failed by
a majority of  the bill cannot therefore j
be taken from the table during the present j
session and is lost
the washington correspondent of the n
y express gives the following account of
tho proceedings in the house
the bill was finally reached and read by
its title
this done one half of the members were
probably upon the floor to submit a motion or
obtain a hearing
mr boyd of ky as the successful compe
titor hoped the bill would be relened to the
committee of the whole he hoped too
that it would pass and trusted in heaven it
the house would not pass it in its present
shape they would put it in a shape by which
it might pass he would warn men to be
ware ol the consequences of the rejection of
this bill and of the account they would have
to give to their constituents if they voted
against it
tne question was here called for and mr
stephens of ga moved to lay upon the ta
ble
mr boyd said he had not yielded the floor
but left it to
mr me demand of illinois who in the
same strain called upon the house to pass
the bill or to coneider it the house ac j
cording to the member was bound to pass this
bill in order to give the people a good govern
ment otherwise tho territories might be
without a government
mr cleinand yielded
m smith of la was sure that a refer
ence of this bill would do no good whatever
the bill before the house w ould not add to
the agnation in the house and the country
he regarded it as no compromise whatever
but rather as a measure for the extension ol
slavery in the territories of new mexico and j
california the house would have an op
portunity to act upon this subjectthe
committee oti territories would report bills
and tho house would have an opportunity to
ct at a proper time he hoped the house
would do so before an adjournment but for
this bill be coud not vote agreeably to hu
pledge he closed with a motion to fay upon
the table and for a call of the house
the aisles of the floor and the area in
front of the speaker were covered w ith mem
bers at this time and an intense excitement
pa vaded the hall
mr smith was urged to withdraw his
motion by mr bavjy of va mr smith de
cent d and all sides of the house entreated
him net to do so
mr buyly vociferated unfair treatment
foul play and other words not heard he
w however put down amidst vociferous
of ea of order
the speaker said he would hear no motion
and put no question unnl order was teaioreu
d members took their oeau
order rtigntd for a uiue
mr mclane said the double motion foi a
call of the holsc and to jay upon tht
isme was not in order
the speaker maintained this decision and
the iltgly motion for a call ol the house
t ie speaker aunouuced that two hundred
sod nine membei were present and the call
was suspended
mr ashuuu obtained the floor but yieli

mr stephens was anxious for harmony

taliere this bill would bring it there wen
provisions m the hill winch hs coad cot

a return to duty after seven months absence
thereby enabling me the more effectually to

able and unflinching colleague who so ably
has sustained the cause of justice and of right
against tyranny and oppression the basest
that has ever obscured the light of human

sellelevation
selfelevation can only be effected by per
sonal effort each acting for himself a
friend may speak assert and declare endear
oringto prove a third person entitled to all the j
rights common to our nature but all this in i
itself abstractly considered proves nothing j
the proof rests with the third person or sub
ject of the declamation who alone can verify
the truthfulness of the allegation
to prove ourselves equal we must be able
in a measureyea really to accomplish that
which is accomplished by otherspossess the
ability to do that which is done by others
to this end it is necessary to possess the
knowledge possessed by others
for this purpose we must use the means
used by others without which our efforts
must prove fruitless to do this will be to
effect an cud every end must have a means
which means must be adequate to the end tq
be accomplished
our aim is elevation by elevation we
mean entire equality to every right and privi
lege to which man by nature is entitled
equality then is an end which according
to the premises must have its antecedent
there cannot be an equality of persons where
there is not an equality of attainments at
tainment then is tue antecedent or means by
which the substantive or end equality is to
be attained the means then we have pre
mised are knowledge which knowledge con
sists of something it is then but necessary
to learn the nature and character of this some
thingto possess a knowledge of the tiling
itself
to this end we must obtain literary ac
quirementsa knowledge of the mechanic
arts a knowledge of agriculture mercantile
business the learned professions as medicine
theology and law and all other attainments
possessed by others
this we do not mean to say is necessary
tor all of us but we wish distinctly to be un
derstood that we in order to attain this
equality must posses the attainments in a
ratio proportionate to that of those w hom we
contend with for equality this can alone be
effected by individual exertioneach acting
for himself brethren think of thia and act

ladies antislavery fair
we are happy to be able to state that we
learn that the colored ladies of cincinnati and
columbus ohio are about entering into some
measures preparatory to the holding of an
nual anti slavery fairs ot bazaars the pro
ceeds of which will be appropriated to the
north star similar to those yearly held in
boston for the support of the antislavery
cause particularly the sustenance of the lib
erator and antislavery standard
a friend recently wrote to us inquiring
what proportion ox how much of the proceeds
of the great annual bazaars go to the support
of the north star we now for the informa
tion of that much interested friend answer
that and ail other inquiries we wish it to be
distinctly understood that there ia no part
whatever of the pioceeds of these fairs or ba
zaars goes to the support of the north star
ol this we do not complain for the best of
reasons those fairs were got up by the
antislavery ladies w ho sympathize with the
doctrines of the american antislavery soci
ety the principles advocated by the liberator
and standard long before the existence of the
star which papers are the organs ot that
society and although we are members of
the society our paper is eotirely independent
of it end we control hence although an
antislavery paper sympathizing with the
american antislavery society did ever we
receive anything from the proceeds of those
f airs it would come as a favor and not a
right t is by this means those excellent pa
pers are sustained
we do not look up to the ladies of the
american antislavery society but should
we desire assistance from any such source 
will be mainly to the colond antislavery
ladies we shall look fnr such assistance
for this end we wunld suggest the forma
tion of societies in different cities to be known
aa societies for the moral elevation of the col
ored people tiie ladies of whom shall hold
annual bazaars si radar to those held in
boston
for this s great degiee of industry is ne
cessary the ladies must bold their weekly
fireside meetings to devae the best ways and
means for the unbersßee of the object
fancy eitielea articles of wearing apparel
and needlework of every descuption sie
among the articles which constitute these ba
zaars there is no end thgt can be obtained
without the application of the means neces

are to ha elevated is a good end effimeat

j strike and riot the philadelphia sun

city near pittsburgh pa was a scene of
lireat excitement ou the st of july in con
sequence of a riot among the factory opera
tives a strike had taken place to force the
mill proprietors to let theen hour law go into
operation some of the operatives had re
sumed work in the pennsylvania mills ms
withstanding the owners refused to grant tneir
demands and in consequence the other mal
contents attacked the mill broke the doors and
windows and finally dispersed the sheriff s
pose called out to suppress the outbreak
the sheriff and several of the police officers
and other peisons are reported to have been
badly hurt the operatives it is saidgained
the day and fears were entertained that they
would proceed to further violence they
were at the last account in possession of the
null
we think the operatives in the pittsburgh
mills the factory girls and their friends carry
their claims to too great an extent as in such
casts nothing can be expected by violence j
we sympathize with the operatives in the
justness of that for which they asktime
simply time but disagree with them ia the
means used to obtain it the strikers should
persist in hutdingout though needy they may
be and thnscompel the employers to comply
with their terms but should any operatives
choose to work the effort to compel them to
desist is worse than the oppression com

from our own correspondent
london july  
dsar douglass doubtless you havt
heard ere this that the archduke john o
austria has been elected regent of germany
or administrator of the united germai
empire by the parliament assembled a
 rank fort he is the uncle of the reigning
emperor and has reached his sixtysixtl
year in his early career and during th
stormy times of the first french revolution
he was thrown into active life and in  c
he was placed in command of an austrian
army and became extremely popular when
relcasej from military duties however he
preferred living the si npje life of a mountain
eer in the sty nan hills to a residence in the
capital bat veil in the campaigns of 
frnd  but when peace was restored and
the arbitrary and oppressive ministry of met
teriupli cvctvepccd which this noble mau
eyar condemned but had no means of active v
opposing he separated htroielf entirely from
tiie court biearp an exile from vienna and
lived for mnv years in retirement at grutz
metternuji feuugg loth his popularity and
his opinions kept a strict wptch on hts move
ments he revisited the tyrol in  and
was so enthusiastically received that bis said
the v iennese press were prohibited from
publishing an account of his reception out
anecdote told of him is that at g ppbic
dinner held a lew years since e gave tht

united germany and it is added that jim
has secured him much fcf bis present popu
larity v nea the recant revolution in vi
cuna bioke out he at once reentered public
life and prevailed on metternich to resign
now that once allpowerful minister is in
exile and the archduke is regent of austria
and chief of the german empire
the latter event is unquestionably one ol
immense importance in the history of ger
nwty in berlin of course the feeling on
the subject is of a mixed character the de
putation from the german parliament arrived
in ienna on the th iost arid was greeted
enthusiastically by the citizens there to
their appeal the archduke responded form
ally and on the th inst the newly ap
pointed regeat entered the good old cit of
frankfort in triumphwhere it is said the
joyous acclamations of the people were un
precedented since then the last sitting of
the long famous german diet has been held
and the president thereof has resigned ail
power into the hands uf the regent a new

free soil
i
at a free soil convention held in norths
ampton mass ou the th ult the fol
lowing resolutions were adopted
resolved that the policy of the nations
government with reference to the extension
of slaverya policy artfully conceived boldly
and recklessly prosecuted during successive
administrationsinvolves the grossest abuse
of the powers and priuciples of the conslitu
tion
resolved that while the promoters or
human slavery are bent upon their purpose
annexing foreign territory declaring war dis
membering  neighboring republic in order to
people and cultivate h with slaves devoted
only to success and reckless both of right
and law it becomes the duty of every friend
of the constitution snd of the country ot
freedom and humanity to shake off all
lethargy to forsake ail vain confidence and
to stand up to the conflict manfully and avow
edly
resolved that the establishment or suff
erance of slavery in the territories whose
governments are about to be formed is the
grat question resulting fron the long pursued
policy of the government which now agitates
the nation that it is one which the people if
true to freedom and themselves cannot fail to
recognize in the approaching election that it
is one which the people will not leave to the
president or to their representatives in con
gress but upon which they will act by requir
ing the surest and most distinct guaianties of
boldness and fidelity from every one proposed
for their suffrages it is a question which
the people can understand and on which they
ask no counsel from their leaders or thcii
presses
resolved that this question is thnisi upon
us by th r abettors of slavery and th it bi
responsibilities of the contest are with th
and not wiih us and that we will siand lot
the defence of that soil which is now fee
and contend with slavery when it encroaches
on freedom

reiteration of his assertion that he will not be
considered the exponent of whig doctrines
it is also said that on this account the whig
managers have refused to publish it we
know nothing of this matter but think the 
story quite probable as we can see no other
reason w by the letter should not be published
it is also said that tbe gen did write a letter

because a corrupt tree cannot bring forth

invite the cooperation of the citizens of roch

to bear in mind the injunctions of jesus all

we hope no one will feel too poor nor any
too rich to enlist in this holy causa the

for this object w  propose holding a fair

remarkable case of a free american citizen being held for eleven years as a slave in the land of cuba and rescued from slavery by general rb campbell the american consul at havana
on thursday last arrived at thia port
a a passenger from havana in the
bark rapid a colored man named john
i lytle a native of philadelphia who
returns to his country after an absence
of twelve or fourteen yearsaril hin which
period his history has been a singular
and interesting one
some short time ago a gentleman o
this city while travelling in the island
of cuba stopped at the ingenio a su
gar estate of a wealthy planter named
don gaepar hernandez about twenty
miles from matanzas while exam
ining the machinery of the sugar
works he was addressed in english by
one of the apparent slaves employed
j about them and the result of a guarded
conversation that ensued was to in
form him that the slave was in truth a
free american citizen wrong folly held
in slavery his story was this he
had been shipwrecked many years be
fore on the coast of africa hi the shii
jupiter employed in the service of the
colonization society with the rest ol
the crew he had made his way along
the coast for about  miles to the
slave station at gallivas where he was
well received by the proprietor don
pancho ramon who promised him pas
sage in the first vessel to cuba from
which island it would be easy to reach
the united states the slave cargo
which he thus accompanied being duly
landed in the neighborhood of matan
zas lytle was cooped with the rest of
his color in the barracoons and soon
found himself at work as a slave on the
estate where he was thus found by a
stray wayfarer from his own country
he had made more than one unsuccess
ful attempt for his freedom and had at
this time given up tlie thought of it in
despair conscious that secrecy was
the first condition of success in any at
tempt to procure his liberation in that
couutry where he soon would have dis
appeared irrecoverably and without
trace the gentleman thus providentially
made acquainted with his situation ab
stained from giving him any other hope
than a general remark that he would
not forget him the result of the mat
ter was that after farther inquiries had
becu made the case was laid before the
secretary of state who fully entered
into it and readily responded to the
call made upon him to demand the lib
eration of the man and to urge it if
necessary with all the energy of the
government and xation on the same
grounds as though its subject had been
the highest in the land instead of a poor
and oppressed negro our popular and
excellent consul at havana gen r
b campbell of south carolina also
entered into the spirit of the instructions
which he received from the state de
partment with his characteristic zeal
and ability great caution and pru
dence were required the danger being
that no such slave would be found on in
quiry if a suspicion of the object in
view should have p eceded the effective
action of which its attainment was to
he secured the upshot of the whole
has been the arrival of the man as a
freeman at this port ns above slated
with a sum of money of   as
his wanes during the li years of his
servitude with interest besides his ex
penses home
gen campbells conduct of this mat
ter is entitled to all praise the moie
so that he is a south carolinian and
not a northern barnburner the letter
in which he announces the result of his
efforts is so creditable to him that we
have asked permission of the gentleman
to whom it was addressed to publish
the following extracts from it
on the th day of june i receiv
ed certain instructions from the secre
tary of state accompanied with a let
ter from you to him in relation to the
free negro john l lytle in the pos
session of caspar hernandez i have
this day july th received the negro
and shall tomorrow dispatch him to the
united states under the charge of mv
son lucius campbell to be delivered
over to the secretary as a freemanwith
  as his own property after
expenses of small outfit passage c
are paid i thank you for refer ring the
secretary to me as a suitable person to
accomplish your object and secure to
the negro those just rights which have
been so long and cruelly withheld from
him it has cost me some trouble time
rmney and odium also with a certain
class but these are all trifles in com
parison with the victory achieved the
rights asserted wrongs redressed and
the happiness i hope conferred on an
unfortunate man who had so unjustly
been made the creature of anothers
will and the degraded victim of the
taskmaster for although not an aboli
tionist i feel as strongly for the kid
napped black as for the oppressed of
another color
you are aware my dear sir that
my proofs were deficient and that the
courts here have already decided that
i the possession of a slave is satisfactory
j evidence of the right and justice of 
jmssession unless the negative is prov
ed under these circumstances 
deemed it advisable to secure certainly
the liberty of the negro under the most
advantageous compromise possible and
i flatter tnyself that the compromise
made will meet your approbation
 the records of the state depart
ment i am t ld will show that john
was claimed in tacons administration
but the best terms that could be made
was the freedom of the negro upon
amg the amount of the purchase
n ney in this instance and with me
gen roneaii has behaved with great
propriety 
another letter from an american
gentleman in havana received at the
same time thus testifies to the merits
of gen campbells skilful and effi
cient proceedings in the matter
gen campbell has been exerting
himself strenuously in favor of a col
ored american citizen named lytle
and l think he has succeed dnr
ably x should be much gratified that
you should lend him vur truthful
testimony among such of your friend
as imagint it very cejr lo aoefaio and
aarvy forth their principles no matter
on what sod or amid what people aod
institutional a timely compromise has
done away with tfit chance of danger
ous measure on the individual for the
removal of proof of the act the
captain general bae lent a ready co
operation in this case and again l think j
that the consul deserves much credit
for his agency reaeosable wages
with interest and expense homeward
are quite favorable terms especially
when you learn what gen tacon an
swered on n previous examination of
the earns case during bis government
also i think at the request of eome
american agent it was to the pur
port that the man should obtain bis
ransom by paying for it
gen campbells hospitable kindness
to all bis countrymen arriving in hav
ana and satisfactory performance of
the duties of hit office have long made
him eminently popular as our consul
at havana as be had formerly been in
washington in his former capacity as
a member of congress from south
carolina whatever may be the
chances and changes of parties it is to
be hoped that such an officer may long
be allowed to serve the country in the
poet which he both graces and liunors
two curious circumstances as we
understand have occurred in the history
of his case the first is that when
hernandez at first learned the man to
be an american and not an african
he required the slave merchant mar
tinez to take him hack but the diffi
culty of the defective title was got over
by reducing the price to a quarter of
the sum first agreed upon showing
that the precious pair of bargainers in
free flesh and blood perfectly under
stood what they were about the deal
er on the african coast don pancho
ramon had anted fairly by the men
and given him a letter to the house in
havana explaining his true character
the damages which have been now
paid to lytle have been we understand
contributed equally by the two
the other circumstance is that at
the time of his being landed and taken
to the barracoon lytlesent a letter to
the american consul then at matanzas
named shoemaker according to h s
recollection and had an interview with
him in which he claimed protection
the functionary was on the point of
sailing for the united states and re
plied by telling him to go and renwin
quietly at the estate of hernandez for
a month or two and he would see about
his case lytle never heard farther
from or of him and twice when he
made his way to the consulate at mat
nnzas he was told by the person iiii
charge that there was no record of the
case on the hooks of the officenow
we know nothing of the manner in
which the aforesaid consulate of mat
anzas has been filled through this per
iod but we commend these statements
of the rescued free slave to the atten
tion of those who may
tiie auction

an intelligent jury
the editor of the richmond va

an amusing picture of life in the old
dominion at westmoreland court
house he was much struck with the in
telligence of a jury in a litigated case
of long standing
about dark the sovereign arbiters
came d wn the way they went up
and stood in court the clerk called
their names and then asked them what
they hsd been about aud in whose favor
they had east judgment the foreman

ner replied
the defendant have got the case
here the counsel for the parties wanted
to know which party it was they called
the defendants the jury looked at
one another with bewildered eyes and
blank faces to fiud their wbereab uts
the lawyers still pressing the matter
several of them said for one party and
several for another at last one of th
jury said we gin it to tlie wiinuins
and then they all snid yea thats it
this decisiou led to such laughing and
swearing as we never knew over any
jury verdict tha parties threw away

both of he great political parties ol
this country are broken up th
baltimore and philadelphia conven
tions dissolved both inttheir original
elements both are without candidate
or principles upon which they can unite
even a tolerable degree of their party
strength the wide dirersity of opin
ion exhibited by the members of both
conventions was the mirror like reflex
of the sentiment of the country and o
their constituents from first to last
it waa perfectly apparent that ibe bond
of party onion had been weakened that
old issues had become obsolete in
abort that it was impossible lo unite
upon a common platiom no comprom
ise could be made without compromi
sing essential principles consequently
all endeavors to that end proved idle
the candidates finally nominated by
the conventions bth tailed to recieve

nomination and both bodies broke up
