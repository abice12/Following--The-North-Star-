the old world how the peoples petitions are
treated in the first nation tin the globe we
are glad that the subject is now fully up
again such a course as that adopted by the
senate will do more to make awalitiuaiirts than

heard by the few while the former speaks to

said
j suppose mr president as this
petition prays for the exertion of all the

extend in relation to this subject it
includes within its provision slavery

am informed that the practice has
obtained in the senate when petitions
of this character are preseuted to
raise the question of reception and
that such a motion is laid on the table
there the matter drops as this

mr hale so understandutg it sir
i wish to say a single word in vindica
tion of the course which i deem it my
duty to take on this occasion it is
with no desire to produce angry feel
ings or excited discussion but it is in
the discharge of my duty under deep
and earnest convictions of my under
standing that i attempt to discharge
that duty
wfiat is the refusal of the senate to
receive these petit jins it u saying
that there arc some subjects on which
the people shall not approach tins tri
bunal
in this day speculation is adventur
ous wc venture to inquire into all the
secrets of the material and the spiritual
world the researches of geological
science have penetrated the bowels ol
the earth and have there found the
mateiials by which it is essayed to
prove tuat
he wlio ma le the tvorld and its age renal j
to mute was mistaken
nay inquiry goes with adventurous
flight to the very throne of eternity
and undertakes to scan the laws by
which he win sits thereon governs his
own actions and t ie world he las cre
ated and sir if speculation is thus
adventurous have we in the united
states ol america an institution which
exalts itself above god defying exam
ination or iaqui y or petiti nr most
emphatically sir do i conceive that
at the present day the people ol the
united states have a peculiar right to
come and ask of this b dy a respectful
hearing of their petitions and a re
spectful hearing on this very subject
sir it is no mere abstraction it is an
element of political power in the form
ation of our constitution it is an ele
ment on which the constitution of the
other house is regulated and it is an
clement in the political discussion and
action of the present day which is in
volving the nation in a foreign and
aggressive war at an expense of forty
or fifty millions of dollars annually
and if the people of the united state
are to be thus taxed for war growing
immediately and directly out of an in
stitution of this character are they to
be told that they shall not come ami
respectfully present their petitions upon
this subject
 have thus discharged my duty tc
those who sent me here without any
expectation of influencing the action o
this body without any desire to excite
angry feeling or discussion i ask tha
the petition may be received
air berrien the practice whirl

mr calhoun rose and midln offer
ing these resolutions senators to your
consideration i have been governed by
the same reasons which induced me to
oppose the warfremthe same consid
erations which have ever since guided
me in alluding to my opposition to the
war i do not intend to advert to the
reas ns which governed me on that oc
casion further than is necessary to ex
plain ray object on the present i op
posed the war then not only because i
considered it unnecessary and easily
to te avertedn t only because the
president with ut authorityordered the
united states troops to enter a dispu
ted territory at that tunc occupied by
the mexicansnot only because the
declaration of congress was unfounded
in truthbut from higher considerations
of policy because i foresaw that it must
lead to great and serious evils to the
country and greatly endanger its free
institutions the war was declared 
and recognised ns such by the govern
ment when it was too late to avert it
i then felt it to be my duty to shape ray
course so as to prevent as car as possi
ble the danger which was threatening
our fee institutions such was my ob
ject in prop sing the defensive line at
the last sessionsuch is my object in
now offering these resolutions but i
shall express my opinion at all times
boldly and independently such as be
comes a senator who has nothing to
ask or gain and whose only object is
to do what is goed for his country
when i proposed in the senate of the
united states at the last session a diff
erent line of policy we had a large por
tion of country in our possession we
stood in a better position than at any
other time since to make it fori hold
it to be a fair principle that we may re
ceive indemnity in tbe shape of unoc
cupied territory from woods but not
from the cultivated hemes of mexicans
in offerii at the last session peace
resolutions i did it became i thought
it wculd be a great saving in men and
money but above all because i saw it
would save us from being involved to
the extent we now are the president
tok a different view he recommended
a vigorous prosecution of the war to j
congress to conquer a peace that 
is i compel the mexicans to make us
indemnity and also to pay us the ex
penses of the war i opposed it be
cause i thought there was great hazard
if the war was continued congress
th ught differently it voted men and
money at buena vista we were vic
torious vera crux fell cerro gordo
was conqueredbrilliant victories that
do great honor to our army and finally
the gates of the city of mexico fell i
prostrate to our conquering arms j
well sir have the avowed objects ol
the war been effected have we con
quered a peace have we succeeded
in effecting a treaty are we offered
indemnity no sir not a single obl
ject avowed by the president has been
accomplished n mr president the
object is farther off t an ever now
sir i ask what has caused the complete
discomfiture of our m asure
we cannot charge the failure upon
ourtr ops it is not charged to this
but to the fact that the plan of the cam
paign wals laid in error and founded on
a mistake we aimed at indemnity
if we wanted it we should have enforc
ed it when we had the power in our
liands we however endeavored to
arrive at it by a treaty which had the
mexicans refused to sign would have
completely upset the a rangenaen
they did refuse and not withstanding
all our briliiant victories the war is still
npon our hands after an outlay of
fit   we are worse off than ever
am ml looking at the conquestl
throw that aside we have lost 
or  men besides and all this for
nothing at all but mr president it
is said that a defensive line would have
been as c ally as the prosecution of the
war the president and the secretary
of war have said it but i must say
to my mind it is utterly impossible
tbe line which i proposed would hove
been covered with hostile indians and
would have required only a single regi
ment and a ship of war guard
coast for seven years texas re
mained unconquered by mexico and
that too when the mexican resou ces
and power were greater and more pow
erful than they are now and can any
man believe it would cost us more to
defend that line than to carry on the
present war we now come mr
president to the consideration of an
other campaign sir the same mea
sures are proposed as were at the last
hession we arc told it is not for con
quest that is explicitdisavowed it
is not an order to blot out the nationali
ty of mexico for the president avows
distinctly he wishes te retain its nation
ality now sir we cease te the prac
tical questionshah we carry oa foe

the matter and l mwa say there arc
many reasons now existing against it

i commercial matters and he has given
it as his opinion that treasury notes
and they are nothing more or less than
loans which must he repaidwould not
bring more than  dollars for every
 dollars which is rather more 
think than  per ent but sir these
are not the only objections formidable
as they are against the war ido not
see the slightest chance of obtaining any
thiog by it if we should be successful
in our anna which i dont believe but
if we should the avowed objects would
defeated but sir i take the other
side the more victories we gain the
greater will be our difficulty in arriving
at a peace as avowed what is to be
the effect it we proceed to repress all
resistance in mexico we overthrow
her civil government and leave her
without atfy power mr president if
that is done how are you to obtain a
peace one power can make warit
requires two to make peace if you
destroy the government of mexico
where is your second party to a peace
 ou are defeated by your own success
biu what do yeu accomplish by the very
object you disown the free republic
ycu wish to sec will be goneblotted
outa mere mass of what she was and
her sovereignty for the time conveyed
to her conquerors the president has
very much the same conviction of what
is the vigorous prosecution of the war
as i have he says that the people of
mexico are divided into factions gov
erned b military rulers and the only
way to arrive at what we desire is to
put them all down
well sir if we are to build up a re
publican form of government from
those citizens who are well disposed to
wards us and who are desirous of a
peace mr president i confess lam at
a loss to understand how an independ
nt republic can prow up under the pro
cction and auspices of its conqueror i
i can well see how an aristocratic or
lespotic government could be thus
farmed but how a free government can
cannot see i had always understood
such a government must spring from the
tiearts of the people but sir i see
these notions are antiquated and we
an now make free republics the
people of mexico do not wish it the j
reat body oftiie intelligence and wealth
ts concentrated in the clergy and they
ire disinclined to it the other large
pody the owners of the haciendas in
other words the planters might per
laps favor it but they are scattered
vithout the means of forming a firm
government and if put up would tuin
le down m a day the moment our
roops should be withdrawn the oth
r course then would be to support
ind foster the existing government j
ut it is said that would be useless and
t would fall the moment our troops were
withdrawn mr president i protest
tgainst building up any power in mexi
so for we shall thereby be obligrd to
support it again and again until at lat
ve would be compelled to take it our j
selves the conquering of hindostan
vhich we have so long deprecated i
arac on in this very way there was
io intention at first to conquer it that j
ame on by degrees till at last it ap
eared a matter of course so it would
e with mexico if that government
diould agree to make a treaty on such
erms as we ask the president him
elf agrees we shall take the very con se
have forshadowed he rays in so
nany words if measures foil we must
enforce terms which the honor of the j
country demands is not this an ac
knowledgment that if the factional gov j
eminent is not built up we must con
quer and occupy the country thus en
forcing terms not upon the government
but upon the people well the presi
dent is right this will he the result
every argument against taking a defen
sive line will have a double force when
we have spent sixty millions of dollars
more and occupy a still greater extent
of territory the men engaged in the
warthe contractors the several par
ties engaged directly or indirectlyall
this large body will be adverse to return
and their influence in favor of a cent in 
nation of the war will be found too
powerful to oppose well sir now
that we have added sixty millions of dol
lars to the former amount expended
what will you get to indemnify it
with the population which you will
have to sustain and the army of forty
or fifty thousand men as the secretary
of war says you will never get enough
to pay it and it will hare to come out
of the pockets of the people of the united
states this and the next generation
will have to bear this burden we now

afraid an our applause will be confined
to our army every nation looks upon
b hardhearted people who are
more gives to war than modern nations
howevbr much we might rejoice at the
courage bravery and skill of our troops
and the astonishing victories they have
achieved he was yet sorry to confess
that the government had lost that repu
tation for moderation and justice which
bad been its crowning attributes in its
earljr days if we shall attempt to hold
mexico as a province or incorporate it
into this union we shall find it utterly
impracticable we had never assimila
ted any of the indian tribes witn our
people when incorporating tber territory
into our union we have removed
them farther away we hare never
incorporated any people into this union
but the caucasian racethe free white
man and shall we now corrupt this
free white population by introducing
into our confederation the indians and
the mixed races of mexico he pro
tested most earnestly against such a
policy our government is for the free
whiteman
this feature was the secret of its
stability tbe spanish republics on
this continent had foiled because they
had mainly attempted to place the
colored race on an equality with the
whites in assuming that by nature all
men were equally adapted to free gov
ernment yet it was proposed to annex
the mexican states as territories and
place them on an equality with the rest
of the states he utterly protested
against the adoption of any such policy
in any form he adverted to the proofs
of history to show that the colored races
could not be blended in the same gov
ernment and in the same terms with
the white races that the colored races
are always degraded and that the
whites even in a savage state main
tain some of the elements of free in
stitutions he came next to consider i
the two points in one thap the holding
of mexico in subjection would in the
end be subversive of our free institu
tions and that no such line of policy
ought to be adopted it would be a
waste of time to argue that the incor
poration of mexico would be danger
ous to our free institutions he who
understood the american constitution
he who had studied its character he
who from the examples of
history and had marked the conse
quences where large conquests have
been held by a hostile nation as terri
torial possessions would need no other
proof to convince him that to hokl tbej
republic of mexico either as a pro
vince or as territories must lead to the
subversion of our f ee institutions in j
all the examples in which such incor
porations of territories of foreign peo
ple bearing anything near the proper
lions which mexico bears to the united
states the end had been the downfall j
of the conquering party with us
mexico would add so much to the
powers of the general government i
that it would absorb all the powers ol
the states it would becofne imperial
it would usurp the powers of the legisi
lative department all the powers oi
the government would foil into the
hands of the executive and with the
prevailing rule of party proscription
and the increasing patroiage of the
executive our institutions vould not be
able to combat the pres dential elec
tion sthey could not resist the check
mr calhoun admonished gentlemen
not to flatter themselves with the delu
sive idea that we as well as great
britain could hold great empires under
subjection and hold them in safety ot
all the governments that ever existed
england is possessed of the greatest
power of expansion withou reducing
her people to anarchy or iter officials
to corruption this was in part be
cause the executive branch of the
government and the conservative the
house of lenb were hereditary
rome never bad such a capacity tor
expulsion when the roman empire
extended east and west beyond the
barriers of italy the central power be
gan to weaken and soon it became
corrupt and anarchy and violence were
the order of the day yet england
had been going on in the extension
of her dominions without any visible
symptoms of decay yet she could
not long escape she is even now
paying tbe penalty she is saying a
penalty for her two hundred millions
of dependants which like dispropor
tionate superincumbent we ghf threat
ens to crush the foundation of tbe
superstructure yes sir instead of
indemnity from her conquests they are
a burden to her and even neighboring
ireland has taxed her resources for its
support and rim labor of her people
almost beyond their newer to bear

people canada has been in the pos

canadians are a hostile people never
will the time come from all examples
when mexico will agres to be blended
with the laws and people of this union
the nucleus of her ruling population
are from the old stock equal in every
sense to the original anglosaxon and
superior to it m that unconquerable
attachment to their sot and their own
institutions but let us admit that all
these difficulties are removed how will
it affect us to introduce some twenty
foreign states into the union with a
basis of one or two millions of pure
blood and all the rest some seven
or eight millions indians or mixed
races inferior in every respect to our
choctaws or cherokees we are
under a great mistake if we suppose
all this population are ready for our
peculiar institutions i beard a gen
tleman of high character say but the
other day that he believed it was our
appointed mission to extend our insti
tutions of civil and religious freedom
over the benighted of this continent
this is a great mistake our institu
tions are only adapted to a people ad
vanced in intelligence and civilization
and it was remarkable that in all the
revolution of nations the people had
been more indebted for any advantages
hey had secured in their forms of
government more to accident or a
combination of circumstances than to
my foretaste or previous decision of
he human mind we are indebted for
our constitution more to a conjunction
of circumstances than to the superior
wisdom and intelligence of our foie
fathers and herein lies our danger
that a conjunction ofeircmrgitanccs to
which we may be mdiffrffwrtar the
time may overthrow our institutions
vve seem to have no fear of their sta
bility the preservation of our liberty
is now lost in the glory of our arms
nobody talks now of the blessings of
liberty in our early history the great
inxiety was to retain our liberty now
he great anxiety is to convince the
world of our military power the
notto used to be that the power was
always stealing from the many to the
few and that the price of liberty was
perpetual vigilaoce now we seem to
remember these maxims not at all but
he opinion appears to be that we hold
sur liberty by a divine right i fear
hat if we do not be vigilant we shall
find this to be the greatest mistake ol
fcl and it is a great mistake to sup
pose that it is our divine mission to
nrry the principles of our liberty by
force of arms over this continent and
that nothing can affect our security if
we persist in this delusion the day oi
retribution will come and ft will bring
with it destructive consequences as
mre as i am now addressing this ame
rican senate i am therefore op
posed to the policy of holding mexico
jy right of conquest and of annexing
it either as a province or territories
or states of this government but
what are wc to do a her speaking ol
his efforts to arrest the war and its
consequences mr calhoun said be
saw not the smallest chance of disen
tangling ourselves save in the defen
sive line by taking in this way the
decision and indemnhy into our own
bauds had lime been allowed when
the president sent in his message de
claring a mate of war mr calhoun
said he should have vindicated a plan
to be pursued he would have re
lieved gen taylor he would have
had a committee to inquire and report
un the relations between us and mexico
showing that as yet there was no actual
state of war had that failed of in
due ing negotiations ha would have
held the territories on this side of the
rio grande and muiuirancd his posi
tion on the boundary winch it might
have been deemed proper to claim
which would embrace lands of so me
value to us and of no use ife mexico
but he bad been overrated where
the defensive fine shook now be he
had no opinion now to give he was
not now prepared to say where we
could designate the best line but he
would say that we should evacuate
the central provinces
mr tuvxaov jenxsew whats

they must attribute it to the rtiinm
of thirtyfive years ago thfowaa oot
the first tune he had opposed the policy
t war in the case of the proposed
reprisal epos france he had rtood
thnost alone in the senate to resist it
he was utterly opposed to it ena
mod was utterly apposed to it eng
land had interfered and no war tok
place ha admonished hie friends v
the administration that there might bn
ome conlingenoms te come which
they did not seesomething an the vi
gorous central prosecution of this war
from year to year which would seal
the deaihwarrhnt of our beloved insti
tutions and yet the party appeared to
be reversing the order of their doc
trines they were opposed to the na
tional debt and the prosecution of this
war was hourly adding to the national
debt the expenses of this campaign
would be foundn equal to the expenses
of the revolution they were opposed
to an increase of the patronage of the
executive government yet what could
so rapidly increase it as the policy now
pursued they were in favor of a
pure metallic currency yet did we not
all know that our treasury notes and
paper dock were becoming more
more the staple of our country they
were in favor orfree trade yet the war
thus sought to be prosecuted has al
ready rendered it impossible to make
any progress in free trade for many
years to come
hie alternative is pressing it in
magnanimous to retrace your steps
when you are in error it is an act of
reason to sacrifice your mere pride for
the good of the country in saying
that there is no alternative between
this defensive line of policy and that of
the president i say so because public
opinion is made up and there can bo
no peace with mexico short of an
acquisition of territory mr cajhoun
only spoke to his friends on the whig
side of the house and bore testimony
that though they had voted for the war
which he had opposed they had dene it
under promise and for the relief of
gen taylor but they had voted to
get territory at the last session and at
this session when the public sentiment
was made up the only way for safety
wow was the defensive and it must ha

joii c caliiol
this bold senatorial defender ef slavery
and faithful sentinel upon its bloody ramparts
ever vigilant unwearied and undeviating in
his devotion to the american slave system
has recently betrayed his fears in the senate
as to the effect which the present false foul
and infernal war waged against mexico will
have upon what he terms the peculiar insti
tutions of our republican government in
the speech before us and which may be found
ii the first page of out present number he
stoutly opposes the further prosecution of the
war with its present aims and designs
counsels the withdrawal of our army to a line
which he does not designate scouts the idea
of taking inhabited and cultivated lands as in
demnity from mexico explains the motives
which led him to propose peace resolutions
last winter demonstrates the absurdity ol
that miserable pretence of conquering a
peace shows that the more victories gained
the more difficulties wc shall find in making
peace shows also that we have been de
tected by our owa success argues the im
possibility ef a free government springing up
under the care of a conquering nation argues
the inferiority of the mexican people depre
cates with much apparent solemnity the ex
tinction of the mexican government and
thinks the incorporation of her people with
those of the united states would be a death
blow to our free institutions
in reading this speech the question natur
ally arises what has given this new and
singular shape to his policy what terrible
signs in the firmament moral and political
has this prophet of tyranny discovered why
docs he abandon or seem to abandon his
notions of extending slavery m mexico
from whence come those gloomy apprehen
sions which he so eloquently sets forth in the
senate happily for us we neeu not long
remainin doubt a little reflection supplies
the required information mr calhoun is a
slaveholder slaveholding has been for years
the very sun of his political system not a
measure has been proposed or adopted by
by him but has lieen thoroughly examined in
the red light of slavery in this light he re
gards men as well as measures it is his great
test of character unite with him in this and
bo will forget all other differences differ
from limn in this and he forgets and repu
diates all other points of agreement ha
regards slawuy as the very cornerstone of
our republican institutions as the most
safe and stable basis of free institutions in the
world and so far from being in any sense
an evil he considers it a positive good he
speaks as coolly about a man  fetters as
he would of a horse in harness the con
diton of the former is to his mind as pro
per as that of the latter his iron heart is
yet to throb the first time in pity for the
heartbroken slave and his lips have yet to
confess the first sting of a guilty conscience
what mr calhoun has been we may well
presume he now is and on the truth of this
presumption will depend the correctness of
the solution of hie motives for opposing the
war and abandoning his system of slavery
propagan jism he etthet sees or apprehends
danger to slavery in the prosecution of the
war and the consequent meeting out of the
mexican republic he begins to nee that to
subjugate and fasten slavery upon a people
and territory already free is a move altoge
ther too bold and one that must only react
tg ibu his darling institution for once
tin brassbrowed manetealer seems cheeked
in his nefarious designs by the wellexpressed
opinions of foreign cations for aoee ho
makes a pause to learn what the world think
of his diabolical movements and when he
hears the adverse report like the whiskered

more complete information respecting out

punch and we may do him the justice to
say that few make better use of their know
ledge than he it is not now however our
purpose to draw a picture of mr punch but
to give our readers some idea of the picture
he draws erf the present aspect of our glo
rious country
as might be expected the artist has be
stowed the greatest amount of labor and skill
on slavery that most prominent feature of the
american face to which the people old and
youngpriest and politician bow with the
utmost reverence and admiration the slave
holder is drawn to the life his person
stretched out on two chairs resting his right
leg over the back of one and his left on the
head of a prostrait bust of washington
around his person is a belt of arms contain
ing a bowie knife and a sevenbarrel revolving
pistol under bis arm is a knotted cato
nire tails on the left of him is a chest
upon which are papers labelled texasore
gondollars behind is a woman half
naked tied to a whippingpost in front of
him is a group of slaves and slavedrivers
prominent in the group are two female slaves
kneeling with their hands closely tied behind
their backs one driver is in the act of
dogging a woman another with a look of
satanic indifference is branding a kneeling
woman on the back with a hot ironthe
smoke of her broiling flesh and blood rising
from the wound off in the distance is a
coffle of slaves driven by two while men with
longlashed whips they seem to have just
landed from an american slaveship above
this scene is floating our starspangled ban
ner fused upon a lofty staff crowned with a
capacious liberty cap on the right of the
flag is a representation of lynch lawa mob
in the act of hanging a negro on the left is
a picture of repudiation illustrated by a well
drawn american in the act of stealing the
i handkerchief of an englishman above this
scene are two pictures representing our duel
ling practices still further on we have the
war with mexico stabbing shooting hang
ing robbing churches bayonets swords
guns cannons bombs all enveloped in fire
and smoke and above all this horrid con
fusion of blood and slaughter is a terrific
picture of satan brooding over the whole
scene with a grin of infernal satisfaction
now what a picture is this to be looked
upon abroad and what american has the
folly or audacity to deny its truthfulness at
the hazard of making many enemies and
losing some friends we extend our heartfelt
thanks to punch for the picture and beg him
in the name of three millions of our enslaved
brethren to continue to noticeus in his world
read journal it is not impossible that we
may wring from a sense of shame what we
have been unable to gain from american
sense of justice
colored national pres
wi have waited patiently for a full official
report of the doings of the national conven
tion of colored people and their friends held
in troy new york in the month nf october
 why such a report has not reached
us we cannot divine we think as a mem
ber of that convention we were entitled to a
copy of the report and we would respect
fully suggest to those into whose hands was
committed the publication of those minutes
that promptitude is essential to the confidence
which is necessary to carrying forward a great
cause like that in which we are engaged
we trust that no unwonhy motive has with
held from us tlioee proceedings but would
like to know the cause perhaps mr garnet
can explain
in the absence of a full report we itave
copied from an imperfect copy of minutes
furnished us by our friend w c nell the
report adopted with reference to establish
ing a national press upon this report we
wish now to say a few words
it wss our good or ill fortune to oppose the
adoption of this report in the convention
and there as in the unperfect minutes before
us our motives for opposing the report were
indirectly set down to selfishness and we
doubt not that such person as are to
appreciate manly independence mill set down
what we are now about to say to the same
unworthy motive but we shall ptak out
scutimenta nevertheless conscious that in m
doing we are discharging a duty solemnly
imposed by the high responsibflity of out
position
the report adopted by the convention seta
forth the desirableness of there being a pop
iug press under the entire control af colored
persons in this country here we agree will

oppressed and injured people proclaims it

use the one we have or shall we neglect to
aae it and go in search of another which
of the two eonzaea seems moat in harmony
with common mnoe the report ptosdea
far a foreign agent to collect money who
shall have for his services thirty cents on
every dollar which be may collect by this
we understand that as agent is about to be
seat to england to solicit money for the esta
blishment in question bui we respectfiifly
ash the advocates of this measure what
answer their agent can make when the qsew
tioo is asked him abroad what have you
done wtth the prvm which we hate already
given youf la it worn out in the service or
does it now exist f is it supported or has it
been neglected and allowed to languish for
the want of the support and countenance of
the very parsons who are now engaged in
soliciting another and may h not be very
properly said to such agent you may ask
for another with much greater probability of
success when you have shown a disposition
to use the instrument already in your bands
but to all this it may be answered we not
only want a press but a national press
and pray what is the difference between a
press and a national press and why is the
one to be preferred before the other the
report informs us that we need such a press
to tell the world of our position in the path of
human progress and is it necessary that a
press should be called national in order
to tell the world of our position in the path
of human progress a we think that that press
call it by what name you pleasemystery
ramshorn northern star or north star
best sustained most ably conducted and
thoroughly devoted to the rights and liberties
of our enslaved and oppressed fellowcountry
men will be the colored national press of this
country in every essential sense of the word
and we therefore say to our brethren use
and support the papers you already have for
it is not impossible that by catching at the
shadow you may lose the substance you
have several newspapers they are all call
ing upon you loudly for support help them
rather than seek for others if they are not
what they ought to be your support may
make them such we therefore call upon
the smiths the crummells the reasons
the zuilles beamans garnetts topps
ana penningtons and all others who wish
well to our sacred cause to unite in sustain

ence we are happy to know that the two
gentlemen last named are already interested
in sustaining the north star and we hope
others will follow their noble example
come brethren let us one and all lay aside
party differences and sectarian preferencesand
rally around the star that never setsexcept
to those who go to the slavery cursed regions of
the south and a glorious victory over cruelty
and oppression will certainly crown our right
eous endeavors

denunciation
although an abolitionist in the strictest
sense of the word yet i do not believe in
nor recognize wholesale denunciation as
calculated to advance the righteous cause nr
ameliorate the wretched condition of suffering
and oppressed humanity
it seems too much akin to the fierce north
wind of icy winter congealing with its chill
ing breath the exhausted sympathies of
earths vexed and wearied traveler forcing
him in his extremity to wrap his furerabos
sed habiliments more closely about him and
rush on with a reckless determination to stem
the fitful winds and currents that oppose his
onward and to him justifiable course too
well does it compare with the destructive
winds that sweep oer saharas arid bosom
rearing its sandclouds of indignation and
burying in its direful course every oasis of
sympathy in the breast of humanity
but forbearance sometimes it is said
ceases to be a virtue yet a resort to denunci
ation which is but the pretext for a resort
to force in very many instances is a greater
evil oft times as the tala of wrong and out
rage committed against helpless innocence is
iterated in my hearing a spirit of indignation

the burned

affecting story which i read tome months
mate in the saturday courier mid to be
founded on fact the substance of which is as
follows
the captain of as american ressel engaged
in the cotton trade hearing of the mddea
advance in the price of that article in great
britain immediately purchased an extensive
cargo and set sad having kmg and ardently
cherished the idea of one day becoming
rich and knowing that in view of the ex
trusive rise of eotton if he could but reach
that port before others his golden dreams of
wealth would he realised be resolved that
nothing should turn him from his purpose
and ab his thoughts were now heat os the ac
complishment of this one object
the third or fourth night they had been out
at sea a great light was descried at a distance
which men proved to be a ship a foe a
little nearer approach gave him and his crew
and brought than within hearing of the cries
and shrieks at terror and the rear of the sig
nal guns from the burning reml which lay
somewhat off dm arrctmi they were pursu
ing they men inmed that the fire had
made great inroads on dm ship sod beheld
die passenger and crew standing an the far
ward deck the dames at times almost curin g
round them as soon as they discovered the
approaching vowel they aft simuhanfw sly
held ap their hands and gave one long and
thrilling shout of joy which rang out on the
night winds and akng the billows of the deep
they were about to be rescuedthose fath
ers mothers tasters brothers and lovers
from a doom so unspeakably terrible and
thoughts of home and friends in distant lands
from whom a moment before they expected
to be torn forever now filled their hearts as
they stood embracing each other nearly
frantic with joy during this tune there was
a straggle going on in ihe mind of the cotton
trading captain the inst for gold haunted
him he seemed influenced by a spirit of
infatuation in that dreadful emergency be
hesitated the delay of a few hours or
moments might be sufficiently long for other
vessls to pass and then his fortune was lost
what should he do f a moment more and
the love of gold triumphed and he ordered
his crew who were as hardened as he to
paw onward those on the burning ship
not dreaming that he was going to pass and
leave them thus to perish stood gazing im
pressed with the thought that the vessel was
only rounding to until it had passed some
distance beyond them and still they could
not believe it though doubt and uncertainty
and dismal foreboding now began to agitate
their hearts as they gazed yearningly on the
receding vessel and at length when the
terrible reality forced itself upon their minds
such a wail of agony and despair as went up
from those poor beings no mortal ear ever
before heard it seemed to pierce the very
heavens and rung on the eat of the unnatural
and icyhearted captain with a terrific power
their joy was turned to agony their hope to
despair the flames rotted on the wild
winds howled and old oceans bounding
billows and foamy surges beat around the
burning ship no more nor less unpitying
than the human monster who refused for the
sake of gold to reach forth his hand to save
and he passed on reached the port in due
timeand realized a vast fortune he re
turned to this country and lived in splendoi
and affluence but that dread shriek evei
haunted him amidst all his wealth he wai
wretched which was remarked by his friends
to whom after many years he revealed th
awful circumstance
so dark and terrible a picture of the humai
character seems unnatural and incredible w
can scarcely believe that any human being
could have the inhumanity and heartlessnesi
to do so base cruel and hardhearted a deet
so revolting and shocking to all our bette
feelingsa deed which seems to stand with
out a parallel in the annals of infamy am
crime but is it so is it more inhuman b
be a passive agent in the destruction of ou
fellow beings than an active one is it vors
to suffer them to perish where we could sav
them than to go forth with sword in ham
and slaughter them is not this nation en
gaged in a work little less inhuman and dread
i ful does it hot stand passively and indiffer
ently by on the one hand while thousands
are perishing by its peculiar institutions
and is it not actively engaged on the othei
hand in the destruction of fellow beings by
slavery and by a war which riots in th
slaughter of mexican fathers and mothers
and their beautiful daughters and under pre
texts and excuses more paltry and unreason
able if possible and yet agonizing as ii

there is a class of person with whom i
have no sympathy as they seem to have
none with the world around them they can
sec no beauty in this world of ours no har
mony in the works of nature nothing praise
worthy in the works of art and apparently
afraid that jobs remark man is bom to
trouble as the sparks fly upward should
occasionally prove untrue seem desirous of
increasing the curse of sin by removing every
rational means of enjoyment and of aug
menting mans causes of sorrow till not a
snifle enlightens the countenance nor a feel
ing of pleasure gladdens the heart may we
not ask such persons whether they are acting
a benevolent part in transforming this world
into a desert barren and desolate which the
sooner we have traversed the better is it
true that we should not love and admire those
i things that are excellent and beautiful why
then did our creator form us as we are
why did he give us minds capable of enjoy
j ment why does not every sound of music
grate upon the ear instead of being pleasam
and harmonioust and why was the world
made a scene of such beauty grandeur anc

contemplations around are spread out on

drew tears from many eyes of the cruel preju

and ill treatment as a colored man the aut

f speaker saying that he felt more like talking

them and apparently produced a happy effect

responded to by the minister and a number of

which drives the colored man to the negro pew

faint beams and our hearts beat high with
hope and joy may eat thou shine like a gem
of purest water upon the darkened skies of
that land from whose hills and helds of virgin
greenness the mists of slavery have so long
arisen hanging like a blank and lowering
cloud where else the light of freedom mtel
teet and religion would have shone with trans
cendent lustre often may the menacing
clouds of calumny and hatred threaten to
obscure thy beams and dim thy radiance but
jahtne thou on unchangingly in the pure
heavens of truth and love receive thy light
alone from the eternal fountain then will
the thousands who have rejoiced in thee look
calmly on the threatening cloud and aw
its vanishing in the firm faith that thej
shall again behold thec r iji reaewuxi beauty
and unsullied brightness ho shall thou be to
the mental eyo of ppretl millions that
which thine antetype in the blue hesvens
above hath been so long to his outward gaze
point thou ever and unchangeably to a land
f freedom that tliu thy gentle beam may
keep alive in his sou one spark of that man
hood which the hoods of opresio and ihn
wave of tyranny have so long striven ut
quench
and not to the slave ak shall thy h
glance hope and confidence to the warn and
faithful hearts that beat ap ardently for hit
well being to the true champions of freedom
who fight her bloodless battles with tbs sac ml
weapon of truth and jutevbe thou as the
eonfiict deepens a cheering guiding star
may it be their to rejoice in thy beams so
g the warfare rages and to had at
length the dawn of the long anticipated
morning when the rising sun of freedom
shall light the horizon of the eofiandusd
slave and he shall tread erect in hi long

there ia one that particularly attract ray at

for the purpose of lifting op our voice in be
half of oai oppressed and plundered felloe

him who has said it ta lawful to do good or

that resolution appears to important
because if the principle propounded in i

more important one of practical religion tho
if both these question be pursued to legit

preposterous to offer such a resolution for the
acceptance of so enlightened so audience
hut on the other hand when w look around
tis and perceive the superb and aristocratic
establishments called churches with then
stately architecture their upfondid ornaments
and cushioned seats denoting their relation
ship to the ritual ordinances of a former dis
pensation we adroit at once the appositene
of the resolution the great master at
whose death the veil of the temj le w as rent
and who as far as he was concerned with
drew the veil tliat was spread over all na
iions sufficiently explained his mission to
leave no doubt upon the minds of the pure
and simplehearted as to the true meaning and
intents of his doctrine but there was then
as now another class of individuals who
claimed to bo preeminently the righteous
and although he sufficiently unmasked these
hypocritical pretensions of superior purity and
denounced them in the plainest and strongest
terms we find at the present time the same
love of outward show the same attention to
mere ceremony the same making clean of
the outside of the cup and of the platter the
same paying tithe of taint and anmse and
cummin otrd sf omitting the w eightier mat
new of the law judgment mercy and faith
the same making of hypocritical long prayers
and sad countenances and of disfiguring of
faces that they may appear unto men to
fast instead of the pure and noble ethics
promulgated by jesus christ whatsoever
ye would that men ahould do to you do yc
even so to them a lthough tlie mosaic law
contained the same sublime sentiment it wai

as thyself these precept are only so many
ports of the same principle o equity and love
hut for the time being it was necessary thai
they should be enshrouded and intenwtven
with a variety of outward forms and ceremo
nies this circumstance becomes selfevideni
when w e take into consideration the ignoranl
and beuighled condition of the surrounding
cations their superstitition their iduatrc us
lascivious andcruel practices and withal the
general tendency ef fl unguided passions ol
ruan to induce him to gratify his sensuality
and pride made it necessary to observe strictly
the outward forms and ceremonies of the law
until its inward principles were sufficiently
engrafted upon the mind of man to prepare
him for the more sublime doctrines of jesus
it is not under these circumstances to he
wandered at that the inherent ignorance and
selfishness of our rnee should induce the
greatest portion of the jews as well as ol
other nations to place their chief dependane
for their acceptance w ith the deity upon these
outward forms and ceremonies this wai
especially the case with the pharisees at th
advent of the saviour it appears that thej
wore garments of a peculiar shape and band
ages with impressive mottoes or sentences o
scriptures written upon them they were it
the habit of ostentatiously giving alms to tin
poor and making long prayers at the corner
of the streets that they might lie seen o
men and also of observing very minutely
every punctilio of th ritual law as well ai
the traditions added to it by their overzealoui
predecessors and u bile they made this pa
rade of the ceremonial and outward forhts o
religion assuming that they were so mucl
more righteous than others they were guilt
of the most grievous oppression and w icked
ness y e can hardly fail to recognize tin
wonderful resemblance in the position of tin
church of the present day to that we havt
described above and w hen we look at th
great harlot and all her daughters and re

the necessity of exposing this foul hypocrisy

we most sincerely rejoice as will every
friend of god and liberty and as would every
fettered bondman in this slavehokling republic
could they hear the glad tidings that health
through a bountiful providence has been re
stored to william lloyd garrisonand that he
is again in the field at the head of his storm
beaten sheet the liberator seventeenyears i
of cloudy days and dreary nights have rolled 
away since all alone with powerful hand
and dauntless heart he launched his bark upon
the menacing billows of our proslavery public
opinion under his broad banner of immedi
ate unconditional and everlasting emancipa
tion many essayed to follow but like a
disciple of old some alas too many havei
found their fears greater than their faith and j
they have sunk to rise no more of these
however we mean not to speak
garrison is again in the field and in the
thickest of the battle
with all the gritty hgiont that troop
under the sooty ffag of slavery
may god grant him continued life and
health till he shall see the travail of his noble
soul w hen the sighing of the poor and the
crying of the needy shall have forever ceased
throughout our slave cursed land
we copy with ineffable pleasure his first
words on resuming his editorial duties j
in resuming the editorial pen after so long
an absence from my post my first duty is to
express to my numerous friends on both sides
of the atlantic the deep gratitude of my heart
tor the lively solicitude which they manifested
during my severe illness at the west and the
warm congratulations which they have since
offered on my recovery such demonstrations
of affection and confidence would more than
counterbalance a century of abuse and perse
cution on the part of the enemies of god and
man the earnest hope that i might survive
this powerful attack of disease has been based
on the expectation that if my life should be
spared i would consecrate it anew to the
cause of suffering humanityto the overthrow
of all forms of despotism whether spiritual or j
corporealto the promotion of peace and lib
erty throughout the world that expectation
i hope never to disappoint it shall bo to me
a trumpetcall to the field of moral conflict
inspiriting me to higher and better efforts to
jkromole the welfare of my raceto reunite
jorever the broken ties of human brotherhood
it is extremely painful to be impotent in such
a field or absent from it even for an hour
how much remains to be done how swarm
the toes of liberty and equality how nu
merous are their banners how extended their
ranks how malevolent their purposes over
what continent kingdom people or tribe do
theynot hold mastery what vigilance and
determination what energy and enterprise
do they not exhibit what resources inven
tions machinations are theirs they rule
with a red ofiron though they cause hu
man blood to flow like water it does not
satiate tlieir appetite though they have ob
tained universal conquest they sigh for another
world to subjugate butas sure as light is
more pleasant than darkness and truth is
stronger than falsehoodthey are yet to he
put to flight and their reign of cruelty is to
terminate their weapons are those of the
cow ard the suicide the assassin such can
not always prosper their courage is ouly
beastly it has no moral quality and in con
flict with spiritual heroism it quickly becomes
pusillanimous their power is only an ag
gregation of selfdestructive materials and
constantly exposed to spontaneous combustion
one brave disinterested worldwide spirit
whose faith is an eternity of steadfastness
and whose love is godinspired can carry dis
may through all their ranks it is only for
the sacramental hast of gods elect to lie
up and doing in a spirit worthy of their cause
and profession to usher in that glorious day
when the great human family now isolated
and hostile
like kindred drop shall mingle into one
having been so lung out of the conflict
some time must elapse liefore i can wear m v
armor easily and v igoroualy wield the wea
pons of reform i still feel both mentally
and physically the effects of my recent illness
and must proceed in niy labors with much cir
eunwqicction lest by too great mental excite
ment a relapse ensue and my last condition
be worse than the first asking the indul
gence of all w ho feel an interest in the char
acter of the liberator and who desire to see
it kept a terror to evil doers and a praise to
them that do well i shall aim to infuse into
its columns noble thoughts great sentiments
and glorious conceptions such as the teeming
mind of awakened humanity may place with

bibleb fob the slaves
by ntedeaick douglas
the above a watchword of a recent but
quite numerous clrss of persons whose osten
kiwe object seems to he to give bibles to the
american slaves they projise to induce
the public to give of their abundance a large
sum of money to be placed in the hands of the
american bible society to be employed in
purchasing bibles and distributing them among
the slaves b this spparently benevolent and
chmtian movement they desire to unite all
persons friendly to the long unbruted and long
neglected slave the religious press have al
ready spoken out in its favor so full of prom
we and popularity is thw movement that many
of theleadert in church and state ore pressing
into it rhflorehas which have all alor g slumbered
unmoved over the rnel wrongs and bittgr
woes of the slave which have been as deaf as
death to every appeal of the fetietud bondman
for liberty arc at art startled from their
heartless stupor by this new art of bibles fog
the stares miwhecrs ef rafigi md foamed
doctors of dmnsty who wmk aotfift a finger
to give the stave to hanedf ere now engaged
in the professed work of firing to the slave the
bible into this enterprise have been drawn
same who have been known aa advocates for
fsnancipatkn
one anttstavery editor has abandoned
hw position at the head ef a widrly riveufoting
journal and has gone forth to lecture and so
licit dooatiocs in its behalf even the ameri
can bible society which a few years ago per
emptorily refused to entertain the offensive
subject and refused the offer of ten thousand
dollars has at last relented if m repeated
ami now condescends to reedre money for this
object to be acre we bare had no public
assurance of this from that society it is
however generally inferred by the friends ol
the movement that they will consent to rerxtvf
money for this purpose now what does all
this mean f art the men engaged in this
movement sane snd if so can they be honest
do they seriously believe that the american
slave can receive the bible do they believe
that the american bible society cares one
str w about giving bibles to the slave do
they suppose that slaveholders in open violation
of their wicked lass will slow their slaves
to have the bible how do they mean to get
the bible among the slaves it cannot go
itself it must be carried and who among
them all has either the faith or the folly to
undertake the distribution of bibles among
the slaves
then again of what valu is the bible to
one who mav not read its contents do they
intend to send teachers mto the slave states
with the bibles to teach the slaves to read
them do they believe that on giving the bible
the unfettered slave will all at once by some
miraculous transformation become a man of
letters and be able to read the sacred scriptures 
will they first obtain the slaveholders consent
or will they proceed without it and if the
former by w hat means will they seek it
and if the latter what success du they ex
pect  upon these pbints and many others
the public ought to be enlightened before they
are called upon to give money and influence
to such an enterprize
as a mere indication of the grow ing influ
ence of antislavery sentiment this movement
mav he regarded bv the abolitionists with
some complacency but as a means of abolish
ing the slave system of america it sterns to
me a sham a delusion and a snare and can
not be too soon exposed before all the people
it is but another illustration of the folly of
putting new cloth into an old garment and
new wine into old bottles
the bible is peculiarly the companion ol
liberty it belongs to a new order of things
slavery is of the old and will only be made
worse by any attempt to mend it with the
bible the bible is only useful to those
who can read and practise its contents ii
was given to freemen and any attempt tc
give it to the slave must result only in hollow
mockery
give bibles to the poor glares it sound
well it looks well it wears a religious as
pect it is a protestant rebuke to the pope and
seems in harmony w ith the purely evangelical
character of the great american people ii
may fortell some movement in england tc
give bibles to our slaves and this is very
dtsirablc now admitting how ever difficull
it may be to do so the entire honesty of all
engaged in this movement the immediate
and only effect of their effort must be to turn
off attention from the main and momentous
question connected with the slave and absorl
energies and money in giving to him the
bible that ought to be used in giving him tc
himself
the slave is property lie cannot hole
property he cannot own a bible to give
him a bible is but to give his master a bible
the slave is a tilingand it is the allcorn
manding duty of the american people t
make him a man
to demand this in the name of humanity
and of god is the solemn duty of every living
soul to demand less than this or anything
else than this is to deceive the fettered bond
man and to soothe the conscience of the slave
holder on the very point where he should b
most stung with remorse and shame avia
with all tampering with such a question
away with all trifling with the man in fet
ters give a hungry man a stone and tel
him what beautiful houses are made of it
give ice to a freezing man and tell him of it
good properties in hot weal her throw
drowning man a dollar as a mark of your goo
will but do not mock the bondman in hi
misery by giving him a bible when he can
not read it

degree one of the choicest elements of
modern saintshipto wit be was or
was reputed to be vsry rich for
luckily it is not in these days as n
was in the semtbarbarous ones when
h was said that ii was easier lor a
camel to pass through tho eye of a
needle than for a rich man to enter
the kingdom of heaven indeed the
turnpikes and travailing expenses
along the strait and narrow rood are
so much greater aow than they were
i then that nose hot a tolerably teem
man has much chance of getting there
at all but rich as he was the doctor
had the hnmitrty to think that this eras
j one of the graces of his christian cha
racter which might be increased to
advantage and so he plunged into the
speculations of our sooth sea days in
 at that time providence had
cast his lot we believe we speak the
language correctly for some wise
purpose in one of the slave states
tennessee we believe it did seem at
one time as if the object providence
had in view in this dispensation was
to show that slaves could be held for
their own good for then it was that
dr ely bought his slave ambrose
from pure motives of humanity and to
prevent lum from falling into worse
i hands the praise of the doctor was
in all the churches for at that time the
laboring point with the proslavery
piety of the land was to show that
slaveholdiug was not sinful because
j slaves might be held for their own
good and here was a case in point
happy dr ely who was raised up to
settle this nice point b theology for
ever happier ambrose who was the
chosen vessel of this great salvation
but unluckily for the peace of out
proslavery zion the bubble burst
and the speculators found themselves
in the suds it broke after leading the
whole people a weary way as it danced
with its rainbow hues before them
leaving nothing but the empty breatl
and foul water of which it was com
posed all king biddles puffing onh
increased its tenuity with its size anc
made its bursting the worse if not th
sooner it was in vain that he saw
in clear dream and solemn vision
i the presidential chair before him with
i a ladder of cotton bag  leading uf
i thereunto and he himself placed there
j in as the saviour of the south and st
of the country it was a lie and a de
lusion all ruin spread over the
south as well as over the north anc
the united states bank broke like
i rotten stick as itwas when interposcc
to check its progress among the
rest dr ely became bankrupt ii
company with many better men anc
perhaps with some no worse than him
self his lands hereditaments anc
personality were dispersed under the
hammer among his other chattel
personal household stuff mules asses
and farming utensils poor ambrose
i was sold to the highest bidder and wa
despatched to be grown into cotton oi
ground into sugar in alabama louis
iana or the lord knows where anc
thus this beautiful demonstration of the
curious problem of the holding of slave
for their own good was broken off ir
the middle truly mysterious are th
ways of providence
but it has lately evolved how it wa
that he got the means for carrying oi
these speculations it appears from
report of a decision in the court o
common pleas in philadelphia tha
in  dr ely was made trusts
 under the will of samuel carswell o
an estate consisting of three huudre
shares in the united states bank wortl
about  after a few months
he transferred all this property fron
himself as trustee to himself individually
in  he borrowed  on hi
own private account of the bank o
the united states pledging these threi
hundred shares standing in his ow r i
name but rightfully belonging to mis
carswell of whom he was the guar
i dian as well as thtrustee as col
lateral security at the maturity o
his indebtedness in  not beinj
able to meet it two hundred and fift
of the three hundred shares were sol
j to cover it in  miss carswel
married and her reverend guardiai
was called upon to render an accoun
of his stewardship whereupon hi
proposes to pass over to her for he
property which had been sold twi
i hundred and fifty shares of the unitei
states bank then worth about si
i dollars a share they having beei
wortli about lo a share when he by
them in other words hi
offered to give his ward about lol
ifor property for which he had himsel
received about  this modes
 proposal being declined and the matte
h coming before the orphans court
decree was entered against dr ely
for about  upon which he ap
plies to the common pleas for th
benefit of the insolvent law tlv
fact of the embezzlement was no
i denied but it was contended that i
having been committed before the law
i excepting such malefactors from th
benefit of the insolvent act and sub
f jecting them to condign punishment
was passed he was not affected by it
and further that a trustee is not
bailee agtn or depositary ruentionci
in the act the court decided in th
doctors favor cn the first ground
i so that he is now whitewashed s
 whited sepulchre wc fear he alway
was and is in a condition to tak
charge of anybody elses money tha
may be fool enough to trust him
now we are a little curi us to kno
how this development will affect th
i standing of this holy man in the church
we sh mid like to know for instance
if this reverend rascal this solerni
swindler should come to boston as
minister of the gospel whether then
would be a single orth dox congrega
tion or other evangelical pulpit closet
against him on account of its disho
nesty we do not think that thm
would be we are sure that then
ought not to be for we know that there
is not one at least of consequence
enough to be seen that would shoj
its pulpit doors against him because h
cheated poor ambrose out of his body
and soul or if he had done it to five
hundred like him it was a sertoun
thing no doubt to dr elys ward tc
find her portion devoured up by a dis
honest guardian but it was a muck
more serious thing to his slave to be
himself devoured dp bodily but ii
the one should excite a transient feel
ing in the american church universal
the other will scarcely stir a holy
muscle there are hundreds and thou
sands of ministers who are continually
guilty of greeter end worst dishonesty
than dr ely in thia instant who are
till welcome in all northern mdpita
jwudmnntate in all national snrta
nan conventions assemblies and con
ferences worse and greater disho
nesty because they rob their victims
not only of all that they pmwoss or can
acquire bat of themselves and strip
them nf all hope of all resistance oi
all redress we will not then be tx
severe on the boston ministers if in
the local canfusion and dissolution of
common morality which slavery has
produced they should give to dr ely
who comes to them smacking his lips
over the portion of the orphan commit
ted to hiiu the same right hand of felj
lowship that they extend to the rever

statistics amd history of
slavery
i will first call year attention to th history
and statistics of slavery is  th re were
but  slaves ia the union ut 
 at the present day thsu number
probably b not for from  in 
mr gerry estimated their value at 
 in  mr clay fixed it at 
 they are owsdd by a population
of perhaps about  pereoas and repre
sented by about  voters
at the time of the decliration of indepen
dence slavery existed in all the states it
gradually receded from the north in the
religious colonies of new england it was
always unpopular and odious it was there
seen and felt to be utterly inconsistent with
the ideas and spirit of their institutions their
churches and their state itself after the
revolution therefore it speedily disappeared
hire perching by default there abolished by
statute thus it successively disajroeared from
rhode island massachusetts sew hamp
shire new york pennsylvania and new
jersey by the celebrated ordinance of 
involuntary servitude except as a punishment
after legal conviction of crime was forever
prohibited ia the northwest territory thus
tha new states formed in the western paral
i ds were by the action of the federal govern
meat at once cut off from that institution
brides they were mainly settled by men
from the eastern states who had neither
habits nor principles which favored slavery
thus ohio indiana illinois michigan wis
consin and lowa have been without any legal
slaves from the beginning
in the south the character of the people
was different their manners their social and
political ideas were unlike those of the north
the southern states were mainly colonies ot
adventurers rather than stabiishraouts of
men who for conscience sake fled to the wil
derness less pains were taken with the
educationintellectual moral and religious
of the people religion never held so promi
nent a place in the consciousness of the mass
as in the sterner and more austere colonics of
the north in the southern statesnew
jersey delaware maryland virginia the
carolines and georgiaslavery easily found
i a footing at an early day it was not at all
repulsive to the ideas the institutions and
habits of gaorgia and south carolina the
other southern states protested against it
they never
consequences follow causes it is not easy
to avoid the results of a first principle the
northern states in all their constitutions and
social structures consistently and continually
tend to democracythe government of ali
for all and by all to equality before the state
and its laws to moral and political ideas ol
universal application in the meantime
the southern states in their constitutions
and social structure as consistently tend to
j oligarchythe government over all by a few
and for the sake of that few to privilege
favoritism and class legislation to conven
tional limitations to the rule of forcb and in
equality before the law in such a state ol
things when slavery comes it is welcome
in  south carolina and georgia refused
i to accept the federal constitution unless the
right of importing slaves was guaranteed to
them for twenty years the new states
formed in the southern parallelskentucky
tennessee alabama mississippi retaining
the ideas and habits of their parents kept als
the institution of slavery
at the time of forming the federal consti
tution some of the southern statesmen were
hostile to slavery and would gladly have gol
rid of h economical considerations prevail
ed in part hut political and moral objection
to it extended yet more widely the ordi
nance of  the work mainly of the same
rnanwho drafted the declaration of indepen
dence passed with little opposition the
proviso for surrendering fugime slaves came
from a northern hand subsequently oppo
sition to slavery in the north and the south
became less the culture of cotton the war
in europe creating a demand for ihe produc
tions of american agriculture had rendered
slave labor more valuable the day of our
own oppression was more distant and forgot
ten so in  when congress purchased
from georgia the western part oi tier territory
it was easy fr the smith to extend slavery
over that virgin soil in  louisiana was
purchased from france then or in 
when it was organized into two te ritories it
would have been easy to apply the oidmance
of  and prevent slavery from extending
beyond the original thirteen states bui
i though some provisions restricting slavery
were nude ihe ideas of that ordinance were
forgotten since that time five new state
have been formed out of territory acquired
since the revolution louisiana missouri
arkansas florida texas all slave stales
the last two with constitutions aiming to make
slavery perpetual the last of these was
add d to the union on the d of december
 two hundred and twentyfive years after
the day when the forefathers first set foot on
plymouth rock while the sons of the pil
grims wete eating and dnoking and making
marry the deed of annexation was completed
and slavery extended over neatly 
square miles of new territory whence the
seimbarbarous mexicans had driven it cut
slavery might easily have bsen abolished at
the tune of the declaration of independence
indeed m  the continental congress in
t hair celebrated non importation agreement
resolved ircttr to import or purchase any slaves
aforr the last of docenaber in that year in
 they declare in a report that it m
not possible fr men who exercise thelf rea
son to baiteve that the divine author of our
existence intended a part of foe human race to
hold aa absolute property ia so unbounded
power over others incited the declaration
itself is a denial of the national right to allow
the existence of slavery we bold these
truths to be selfevident that all men are crea
ted equal that they are endowed by their
creator with certain unalienable rights that
among these are the right to life liberty and
the pursuit of happiness that to secure these

it being admitted that the colored
people of the united states arc
pledged before the world and in the

for advancement in civil and social
life it is clear that our own efforts
must mainly if not entirely produce
such advancement and if we are to
advance by our own efforts under the
divine blessing we must the
i means which wtu direct such efforts to
a successful issue
of the means for the advancement
of a people placed as we are none are
more available than a press we
struggle against opinions our war
jfare lies in the field of thought glo
rious struggle godlike warfare in
training our soldiers for the field in
marshalling our hosts for the fight in
leading the onset and through the
conflict we need a printing press be
j cause a printing press is a vehicle o
thoughtis a ruler of opinions
among ourselves we need a press
that shall keep us steadily alive to out
responsibilities which shall constantly
point out the principles which shoult
j guide our conduct and our labors
i which shall cheer us from one end o
the land to the other by recording oui

defeats and our steadily approaching
triumph or rather the triumph of tilt
glorious truth human equality
whose servants and soldiers we are
if a press be not the most power
ful means for our elevation it is tin
most immediately necessary educa
tion of the intellect of the will and o
character is doubtless a powerful
perhaps the most powerful means fo
our advancement yet a press ii
needed to keep this very fact befort
the whole people in order that all may
constantly and unitedly labor in this
the right direction it may be tha
some other means might seem evei
more effectual than education evei
then a press will be the more ncccs
jsary inasmuch as it will afford a fieh
in which the relative importance of tin
various means may be dtecussed ant
settled in the hearing of the wholi
people and to the profit of all
the first step which will mark on
certain advancement as a people wil
be our declaration of independent
from all aid except from god and oui
own souls this step can only b
taken when the minds of our peoph
are thoroughly convinced of iti neces
sity and importance and such con
viction can only be produced througf
a press which shall show that althougl
wc have labored long and earnestly
we have labored in too many direc
tions and with too little conceit o
acti n and that we must as one man
bend our efforts in the one righ
direction in order to advance
we need a press also as our ban

pass by may read why we struggle
and what we struggle for if we con

the committee appointed to draft i
report respecting the best means o
abolishing slavery and destroying cash
in the united states beg leave mos
respectfully to report that they hav
had the important subjects referred t
them under consideration and havi
carefully endeavored to examine al
their points and bearings to the best c
their ability and from every view the
have been able to take they have ar
rived at the conclusion that the bes
means of abolishing slavery is the pro
clamation of truth and that the bes
means of destroying caste is the men
j tal moral and industrial improvemen
of our people
first as respects slavery you
committee find this monstrous crime
this stupendous iniquity closely inter
woven with all the great interests
institutions and organizations of th
i country pervading and influencinj
every class and grade of society sc
curing their support obtaining thei
approbation and commanding thei
homage availing itself of the advan
tage which age gives to crime it ha
perverted the judgment blunted th
moral sense blasted the sympathies
and created in the great mass th
overwhelming majority of the people
a moral sentiment altogether favorabl
to its own character and its own con
tinuance press and pulpit are aliki
prostituted and made to serve the en
of this infernal institution the powe
j of the government and the sanctity c
religion church and state arc joine
with the guilty oppressor against th
oppressed and the voice of this grea
nation is thundering in the ears of ou
enslaved countrymen the terrible fiat
you shall be slaves or die l the slav
is in the minority a small minority th
oppressors are an overwhelming ma
jority the oppressed are three mil
lions their oppressors are seventeei
millions the one is weak the othe
is strong the one is without arms
without means of concert and withou
government the other possesses ever
advantage in these respects and th
deadly aim of their million musketry
and loudmouthed cannon tells tin
downtrodden slave in unmistakeabb
language he must be a slave or die ij
these circumstances your committe
are called upon to report as to the bes
means of abolishing slavery am
without pretending to discuss all th
ways which have been suggested fron
time to time by various parties and fac
tionsthough did time permit
would gladly do so they beg at one
to state their entire disapprobation o
any plan of emancipation involving i

our condition before us it is impossible
for us to contemplate any appeal to the
slave to take vengeance on his guilt
master but w ith the utmost reprobation
your committee regard any counsel o
this sort as the perfection of folly
suicidal in the extreme and aboininabh
w icked we should utterly frow n dowi
and wholly discountenance any attempt
to lead our people to confide in brute
force as a reformatory instrumentality
ah argument pat forth in favor of in
iurrr ctiofi and bloodshed however wcl
intended is either the result of an un
pardonable impatience or an atheistic
w ant of faith in the power of ti uth aa t
means of regenerating and reforming

and infallible means within our reach
with which to overthrow this tou sys

onstration that slaver exists in this
country because the people of this
country will its existence and they
deem it equally clear that no system

the earnestly expressed will of the
people it were quite easy to bring ti
the support of the foregoing proposition
powerful and conclusive illustration
from the history of reform in ai ages

our age is an age of great discovc

to its destrhetion i his every slave

republic of liberia
declaration of independence
we the representatives of the peo
pie of the commonwealth of liberia ii
convention assembled invested with au
thority for foiming a new government
relying upon the aid and protection o
the great arbiter of human events d
hereby in the name and on behalf o
the people of tins commonwealth pub
lish and declare the said comm nwealtl
a free sovereign and independent
state by the name and title of tin
republic of liberia
while announcing to the nations o
the world the wew position which th
people of this republic have felt them
selves called upon to assume courtesi
to their opinions seems to demand t
brief accompanying statement of lh
causes which induced them first tr
expatriate themselves from the land o
their nativity and to form settlements
on this barbarous coast and n w v
organize their government by the as
sumption of a sovereign and indepen
dent character therefore we respect
i fully ask their attention to the following
facts
e recognize in all men certain
i u 
these are life liberty and the right to
acquire possess enjoy and defend pro
perty ry the practice and consent ol
men in all ages some system or firtn
of government is proven to be neces
sary to exercise enjoy and secure these
rights and every people has a right to
institute a government and to choose
and adopt that system or form of it
which in their opinion will most effec
tually acc nij leb these objects and
secure their happiness which does not
interfere with the just rights of others
the right therefore to institute govern
ment and all the power necessary to
conduct it n inalienable right and
cannot he restated without the gruaarst
injustice
we the people of the republic of
liberia were original the inhabitants
f tha united htat t uf north a marts a
ik some parts of that eowatrjr
were debarred by law from ab tb
rights and privileges of men in other
parts public sentiment more powerful
than law frowned us down
we were everywhere shut out from
all civil office
we were excluded frem all partici
pation ia the government
we were taxed without our consent 
we were compelled to contribute to
the resources of a country which gave
us no protection
we were made a separate and dis
tinct class and against us every ave
nue to improvement was effectually
closed strangets from all lands of a
color different from ours were preferred
before us
we uttered our complaints but they
were unattended to or only met by
i alleging the peculiar institutions of the
country
all hope of a favorable change in
our country was thus wholly extin
j guished in cur bosoms and wc locked
with anxiety abn ad tor some asylum
from the deep degradation
the western coast of africa was
the place selected by american btnev
olence and philanthropy for our future
home removed beyond those influ
i ences which depressed us in our native
land it was hoped we would be enabled
i to enjoy those rights and privileges
and exercise aud improve those laeul
tics which the god of nature has given
us in common with the rest of man
kind
under the auspices of the american
i colonization society we established
ourselves here on land acquired by
purchase from the lords of the soil
in an original compact with this so
cietv we tor impoitant reasons dele
gated to it ceitain political poweis
j while this institution stipulated that
whenever the people should become
i capable of conducting tne government
or whenever the people should desire
it this institution would resign the
deleted power peaceably withdraw
its sftpervisi n and leave the people to
the government of themselves
under the auspices and guidance oi
this institution which has nobly and in
j perfect faith redeemed its pledges to
the people we have grpwn and pros
peied
from time to time our number has
been increased by emigration from
america and by accessions fr m na
tive tribes and fr im time to time as
ci cumstanccs required it we have ex
tended our borders by the acquisition
 of land by honorable puchase frou
j the natives of the country
as our territory has extended anri
our population increased our coin
i merce has also increased the flags
of most of the civilized nations of the
earth float in our harbors and theii
merchants are opening an honorabh
t and profitable trade until recently
these visits have been of a uniformly
t harmonious character but as they hav
i become more frequent and to mori
numerous points of our extending coast
questions have aisen which it is sup
posed can be adjusted only by agree
nient between sovereign powers
i for years past the american colo
nization society has virtually withdraw n
from all direct and active pait in the
administration of the government ex
i i cept in the appointment of the gover
nor who is also a colonist for the
i apparent purpose of testing the ability
of the people to conduct the affairs oi
government and no complaint of crude
f legislation nor of mimanagement noi
of maladiniiiistration has yet beer
heard
in view of these facts this institu
tion the american colonization soci
ety with that good faith which ha
uniformly marked all its dealings with
us did by a set of resolutions in jan
i uary in the year of our lord one
thousand eight hundred and fortysix
dissolve ail political connection with
the people of this republic return the
power with which it was delegated
and left the people to the government
i of themselves
the people of the republic of libe
v ria then are of right and in fact a
fiee sovereign and independent state
possessed of all the rights powers and
functions of government
in assuming the momentous respon
abilities of the position they have
taken the people of this republic feel
justified by the necessities of the case
i and with this conviction they throw
themselves with confidence upon the
candd consideration of the civilized
world
liberia is not the offspring of grasp
ing ambition nor the tool of avaricious
speculation
c no desire for territorial aggrandize
went brought us to these shores nor
p do we believe so sordid a motive en
tered into the high considerations ol
th se who aided us in providing this
asylum
liberia is an asylum from the most
grinding oppression
in coming to the shores of africa
we indulged the pleasing hope that wc
would be permitted to exercise and im
prove those faculties which impart to
man his dignity to nourish in our
hearts the flame of honorable ambition
to cherish and indulge those aspirations
which a beneficent creator had im
planted in every human heart and to
evince to all who despie ridicule and
oppress our race that we possess with
them a common nature are with them
susceptible of equal refinement and
capable of equal advancement in all
that adorns and dignifies man
we were animated with the hope
that here wc should be st liberty to
train up our children in the way they
should go to inspire them with the
flame of a lofty philanthropy and to
form strong within them the principles
of humanity virtue and religion
among the strongest motives to
leave our native landto abandon for
ever the scenes of our childhood and
to sever the iws endeared connexions
was the desire fi r a retreat where free
from the agitations of fear and moles
tation we could in composure and
security approach in worship the god
of our father
thus far our highest hopes hnvs
been realised
liberia is already the happy home of
thousands who were once the doomed
tut hits of eppreaeton and if tell unmo
lested to go on with her natwtal and
i spontaneous growth if her movements
be left faee from the pereiysmg in
trigues of jealous ambition and unscru 
puloua avarice she trill throw open a j
wider and yet a wider door for thous
ands who are now looking with an
anxious eye for some land ot rest
our couits of justice are open equally
to the stranger and the citizen for the
redress of grievances for the remedy
of injuries and for the punishment ol
crime
our numerous and well attended
schools attest our effoits and our desire
for the improvement of our children
our churches for the worship of our
creator everywhere to be seen bear
testimony to our piety and to our ac
knowledgment i f his providence
the native african bowiig d wn
with us before the altar of the liviivg
god declare that from us feeble as
wc aie the light of christianity has
g ne forth winle upon that curse o
curses the slave trade a deadly blight
has fallen as far as cur influence ex
tends
therefore in the name of humanity
and viitue and religion in the name
of the geat god our common ci tutor
and our common judge we appeal to
the nations of christendom and ear
nestly and respectfully ask ot them that
they will regard us with the sympathy
and friendly consideration to which the
peculiarities of our condition entitle us
and to extend to us that comity which
marks the friendly intercourse of civil
ized and independent communities

death of that truly devoted friend of the

me for intruding so much on your time
hut i felt constained to give vent to
mv full heart in penning a few lines
relative to the departure of one wb si
loss is so deeply felt by this community
and bv ethers he was taken last
sabbath just before the time for even
inrr service and died about  oclock
the same night he preached in hi
usual impressive manner on sabbat
morning from the text   am noi
alone for the father is w ith me it
his closing remark upon death he sail
the christian was not alone hark
said he what voice is that i hear it
is the receding voice of the watchman
just before the morn saying alls
j well all s well oh i felt as i hr id
his cold hand while being paralyzed by
l the chill of death and looked upon that
i beautiful face as the change of death
was passing over it if those lips could
i speak they would say alls well
but that was not permitted he was
j speechless from the time he was taken
j until the last lie was taken with
paralysis occasioned by disease of the
heart but breathed his last calmly
without a struggle so vve could hardly
believe he had gone he was to have
preached in the evening from the text
we all d i fade as a leaf and said as
the congregation were about leaving
remember my friends the withered
leaf will preach to you this evening
oh it seemed prophetic for how cm
i phatically it did preach
but his work was done and well
done there was no man that would
so fearlessly speak the whole counsel
of god and reprove sin all sin as he
the people of this village can bear
testimony to that i ever felt satisfied
in sitting under his ministry that i was
listening to one who made no compro
mises and who would do his dutv rc
gardlcs of consequences he thought
not a moment about worldly expediency
but when he heard the voice of his mas
ter saying this is the way walk ye
in it he conferred not with flesh and
blood hut went forward the oppresed
the fallen and exposed of every class
have lost a friend indeed oh that we
may be anew consecrated to that work
j to which he was so devoted
rev h g ludlow in an affecting
f manner pronounced an eulogy upon
him as a man and a christian and such
an one as i never heard before he
said he  was a nobleman in every sense
of the word he was ttuly a holy man
never did i know a man like charles
van loon may his spirit fall on us
all he was so affected that he could
hardly proceed
mr waldo feels his loss deeply
they sympathized with each other in
the moral reforms of the day and were
like brothers while lie gazed upon
that lovely countenance cold in death
it seemed as if his heart would break
y e never shall look upon his bke
again nor can his pulpit be filled by
another like h m you w ill excuse my
saying so much but you know not how
