honor to john gorham
palfrey
the following article from the boston
courier we have reason to believe is from
the pen of charier sumner esq of boston
the feeling with which mr palfreys
c mrse in congress was at first regard
ed by many persons seems to be yield
ing rapidly to a calmer mood passion
is subsiding reason is beginning to
assert her control with reason comes
justice and there are not a few now
who regret the intemperance of con
demnation into which they were plunged
by the unchecked prejudices of party
it is pleasant to observe these changes
and especially lo note the expressions
of candor which how from the better
natures of men it is not to be dis
guised however that there is still much
difference of opinion the politicians
outandout thick and thin hacks of
partv with some rare excepti ns con
demn mr palfrey there are others
who while regretting that he was not
able to vote according to their convic
tions vet confess their admiration of his
tinmnvss and their gratitude for his
hiigfc example of an unyielding devotion
itu the conviction ol duty there are
others ull particularly beyond the
pressure of button opinions w ho regard
lis course with unqualified approbation
and confidence in the present lull of
disturbing passions it may be proper to
cons der the character of his votes in
order to sec how they should be justly
regarded
ths first was on the speakership
mr palfrey voted against mr w in
throp in doing so he sacrificed the
satisfaction which he would doubtless
jhave derived from aiding in the eleva
tion of a son of massachusetts as well
as n personal friend the sentiment of
state pride a motive of very humble
character ami of friendship w ere dis
regarded and why briefly for want
of confidence in mr winthrop on cer
tain matters deemed to be ofhigher im
portance than any vure party sweats
mr palfrey is earnestly opposed to the
mexican war he knew mr winthi op
had voted for the bill by which it was
recognized and by which the dread
powers of war w ere placed in the hands
of the president he knew that on the
floor of congress mr winthrop had
promised to vote supplies for the prose
cution of the war to obtain peace by
the sword lie knew that while many
prominent w ings had publicly regretted
their support of the winthrop
had failed to relimjufstftna early error
in ahorfr mr palfrey knew that mr
wmlhrop unlike his colleagues of the
massachusetts delegation was ranked
in that anomalous body sometime
known as war whigs  could an
earnest and uncompromising opponent
of the war be expected to aid in en
trusting to his hands the organization o
the house destined to affect so mate
rially the great issues of peace 
war
the north star
r but st ill further mr palfrey is op
posed to the extension f slavery h
is also m favor of tfu peculiar mas
sachusetts measures which have sooflei
been discussed in our common wcalti
and on which oar legislature ha de
i dared itself by most explicit resolu
turns viz the abolition of slavery in
the district of columbia the protection
of our free black fellow citizens in the
ports of south carolina and louisiana
and the constitutional restraint of the
slave power mr palfrey did not re
gard these resolutions as mere words
lie considered them as binding his
own intimate convictions were in har
mony with them he placed obedience
to them above any mere party success
it was known that mr winthrop du
ring his service in congress had inad
i equably represented the sentiment vi
i these resolutionsand that he had hes
itated to grapple with the monster evil
which they w ere intending to reach it
was known that he declared his unwil
lingness to make the extension of sla
very a test question and that by this
very declaration he had opened the door
to the insidious spirit of compromise
mr palfrey doubtless felt that such a
person would not wield the high power
of speaker in a manner calculated to
promote those measures which he re
garded as of suah paramount impor
tance
in his views mr palfrey must have
felt sustained by the opinions of the
larger part of his constituents he
was selected with reference to his pe
culiar sentiments on the war and sla
very it was through the favor which
those sentiments found that he was
chosen at a time when probably no
other person calling himself a w hig
could have been elected in his district
his constituents expressly said to him
beware of compromises they charg
ed him expressly to watch the two
questions of the war and slavery to
be ever true firm and indexible on all
matters by which these might be af
fected mr palfrey assumed his new
duties as is well known with great re
luctance but with the determination to
discharge them firmly laboriously up
rightly without fear or favor or hope
of reward
in voting against mr winthrop he
declined to follow the dictation of par
ty but he testified his loyalty to his
own convictions of duty and to those
sentiments which first commended him
to his constituents and which they re
cognized at the time of his election
as cardinal principles higher than
party
the objections to this course are
twofold first that he interfered with
the election of a son of massachusetts
but this objection is petty and evanes
cent when we think that principles
not men is the proper rule of political
conduct the second objection is that
he endangered the success of the w big
party in the organization of the house
and indirectly promoted the cause ol the
democratic candidate this has been
so often repeated by politicians that
many careful persons not especially fa
miliar with the exact state of things at
washington have received it as true
it is however a mistake the demo
cratic party was in a fixed minority it
could not have succeeded except by
the treachery of whigs in voting for
their candidate it was doubtless the
hope of mr palfrey and many others
if the opposition to mr winthrop had
prevailed to rally in support of mr
caleb b smith of indiana a gentle
man possessing largely the confidence
of the whig party and of the most de
cided opinions on the subject of the war
and slavery if it should be said that
he could not have received the support
of the socalled southern whigs the
answer is twofold first this cannot be
certainly known until tried and second
if they had opposed his election as it is
supposed they would have done in or
der to protect slavery they would have
amply shielded by their example those
northern members who voted against
mr winthrop in order to protect peace
and freedom but it is not necessary
to venture into speculation on this head
vo democratic candidate could have
been elected this was seen and virtu
ally confessed by mr holmes a dem
ocrat of south carolina who left the
house on the third ballot and thus aid
ed in the election of mr winthrop if
there had been any hope of the election
of a democrat by protracting the dif
ference among the whigs would t a
democratic member have helped mr
winthrop clearly not mr hollaed
is a wise slaveholder and he distinctly
aw that the chances of his own party
were desperateand out of his ow n
party he preferred not mr smith but
mr w inthrop
it might be added however that even
if the final success of a w big candi
date hud been endangered ya conclu
sion which is denied yet mr palrsj
could hardly be asked to sacrifice his
cherished convictions he might justly
say i will support hig candidates
so long as they represent my principles
and those of mv constituents but no
longer and he might well inquire
if the greater good would not accrue to
the cause of truth even bv a solitary
and unsuccessful maintenance of his
principles than by any surrender to the
policy of party or the constraint of a
regular nomination the firm upholder
of truth although he stands alone
awakens respect oftentimes a senti
ment akin to reverence in ceasing to
be a vulgar fraction of a party he be
comes a mij giving the world assur
ance of a man a new influence
attaches to his name and his acts de
rive unwonted force from his peculiar
and perhaps controlling position
from this survey it seems clear that
i mr palfreys vote against mr win
throp docs nut afford any just ground
right of no sexthith t of no nnirmlo  tiik father ok f all am all wl rk brethren
for censure those who do not cor
dally approve it cannot with pro
priety condemn the act when all tin
circumstances are considered w hich an
connected with it
it has been said however that hi
vote in favor of mr campbell a slave
holder for clerk was inconsistent witl
his opposition to mr winthrop thi
is a mistake the clerk has no influ
ence over the appo ntincit ot commi
tees he cannot in any sajr affeci
these two matters the war and sla
very which mr fallrey was especially
charged by his constituents to watch
mr palfrey has not subscribed to the
dogma of the liberty party never tc
vote for a slaveholder his principle
is never to vote for a person who
may interfere with his principles
there is no reason tfieref in tha
cne why he should not follow the lead
of his party
but his vote against the y big can
didate for postmaster of the house
seems to have aroused more angry
feelings than even that on the speaker
ship is it not stranger the otlice ol
postmaster of the house is humble
enough its salary is not large its
duties are irresponsible and petty it
is understeod that mr palfrey when
he became secretary of our common
wealth determined for himself the rule
of conduct which guided him on this
occasion he declined to use his in
fluence in dismissing from office under
him any persons who were faithtul in
the discharge of their duties merely on
grounds of a difference of political opin
ions this rule certainly commends
itself to all whose sense of justice is
not entirely benumbed by party it
ought to win applause especially of
the whigs representing as they pro
fess the better sentiments of the com
munity and sharply condemning that
system which is maintained by the
cohesive attraction of public plun
der it is proper that with a change
of policy as indicated by a change of
parties the important functionaries who
may impress their peculiar opinions up
on the country should be changed
but it is not just or proper that the
humbler officeholders who cannot in
any way influence those matters on
which parties hinge should be driven
with every political change from the
duties to which they have just become
accustomed and in this way perhaps
be deprived of their daily bread party
is tyrannical when it visits in this way
the homes of the lowly and poor it is
as heartless as herod murdering the
innocents in refusing to aid in en
forcing the decree of king caucus
against the humble and faithful officer
of the h use who was well known to
he dependant upon his place for the
means of support ot a large family
mr palfrey acted in accordance with
his course on a former occasion at
home and we think in harmony with
the feelings of all w ho do not subscribe
to the savage sentiment that to the
victors belong the spoils for his
singlehanded oppositi n to the intro
duction of this principle into the practice
of the whig paity he deserves our
best thanks
who is there after this review of
mr palfreys course that is ready to
cast the first stone it appears that
on the three different occasions which
have been considered he acted strictly
in harmonv with his former opinions
and conduct opinions and conduct
especially sanctioned by his constituents
at the time of his election that he acted
under a high sense of duty determined
to be faithful to his conscience rather
than to anv behests of party that on
one of the important questions he was
guided by his uncompromising opposi
tion to the mexican war and slavery
while on another he was filled with
the determination of doing his duty to
a humble officeholder even at the cost
of great personal displeasure towards
himself surely such an example is
worthy of regard it is calculated to
arrest the attention of the country it
may be the harbinger of a better pe
riod when the egotism of party shall
be controlled and adherence to prin
ciples shall be regarded rather than
the political elevation of men such
an example is worthy of massachusetts
nurse of the men who throughout our
historv have elevated the true cha
racter of our country it is one of her
brightest possess ons more precious far
thau all the distinctions of office or
the rewards of politic al success hon jr
then to joun gorham palfrey and
may his country learn to prize the
virtue which is inseparable from his
name

been hostile to the war mr clay is
a private man and therefore has not
been called on to take any official stand
in relation to this matftr but in de

memorable event in american history i
he was tootled at table and made a re
ply which was tku reported in the
newspapers at the tune alt ho lead
ing a life of rctiregicm i am not wholly
unobservant of the proceedings relating
to the condition welfare and prospects
of our country and when i saw
around me tonight gen brooke and
other old friends i felt half inclined to
ask for some nook or comer in the army i
in which i might serve to avenge the
wrongs done to my country  have
thought that  might yet be able to cap
ture or slay a mexican i shall net be
able to do so however this year but
hope that success may still crown our
gallant arms and the war terminate in
an honorable peace to add yet
more to the shame of america this
speech was delivered at the dinner of
the sons of new england on the d
december met to celebrate the landing
of the forefathers of new england on
plymouth rock poor men in that
puritanic blood of theirs was there no
tinge from the heart of the pilgrims
could they not on that day amid the
feasting the wine and the revelry
amid the politicians and the generals
and the great applause could they
not for a moment think of those out
casts of the world who came in the
name of justice to found a state oh i
no how could they think of that i
there stood one of the foremost men of j
america noping to capture or slay a
mexican the son of some woman that
never injured himwho might go down j
heartbroken and refusing to be com
forted in sorrow to her grave alas
could he have known itvain man how
soon is he doomed to weep at the in
scrutable ways of providence by
which his own son the dear one lies
slain in battlenot slain by a great
statesman but by some vulgar bullet of
a nameless soldier who fought for his
country her altars and her homes
while the american volunteer fell inglo
rious and disgraced a willing murder
er in that war so treacherous and so
cruel the father who had hoped to
slay a mexican shall find but sad
consolation kissing the cold lips of his
only son is providence so inscrut
able he who would deal death upon
the sons of other menshall he not ieel
it in his own home
but the great champion of the north
that man of giant intellect w hich dwarfs
his thrqe competitors to littleness him
self perhaps unequalled among living
men in magnificence of understanding i
he who has stood on plymouth rock
and his words which found a footing
there have gone as pilgrims to he fore
fathers of mighty deeds at least in
humbler men how broke the thunders
of that unequalled eloquence which so
oft before had shaken every heart t
did he thunder in the senate and
lighten over all the land till wondering s
nations saw it from afar eet us look
at this he had condemned annexation i
it struck a blow at the influence of our
institutions
thank god i did not slumber over that
danger he had condemned the war
it was illegal unconstitutional un
just a war of pretexts a presiden
tial war the presidents action was an
impeachable offence the mexicans
were weak distracted the prey of mili
tary tyrants she has had nothing
that deserved to be called a govern

very much nullified an important pro
vision of the constitution vet mr
webster could say at philadelphia
dec id 
nevertheless war i upon us ar
mies are in the field navies are upon

ble and satisfactory manner to bring
the war to a conclusion if possible j
b u t while the war lasts this j
unjust and unconstitutional war while
soldiers are on the land and seamen on
the sea upholding the flag of our coun
try you feel and i feel and every
american feels that they must he suc

have done honor to the country to which
they belong where can we j
look for such steadiness calmness bra
very and modesty as in these volun
teers the most distinguished inci

the good conduct of the militiaof new
raised levies from am ngst the people
is perhaps that of the battle of bunker
hill i might go further
and say that at bunker hill the newly
raised levies and recruits sheltered
themselves behind some temporary de
fences but at monterey the volunteers
assailed a fortified city
nor was that all but the day before
addreaing a body of volunteers mis
guided young men who had probably
never considered the justice of the war
nor asked whether they were to fight
for slavery or freedom he could cheer
and encourage them to fight in a war
which he declared illegal and threat
ened to impeach the president for be
ginning could bid them go and uphold
the stars of their countrys banner
such was the conduct of that man on
whom nature has lavished so prodigally
her gifts a kingly intellect and a heart
of noble make in the senate what
did he to end the war to iinpearh tin
president nothing so far a oppo
sition to the war is concerned no
in the wall could hare lain stiller or
more snug all winter he sat in hi
seat busybut with other things the
instigators of the invasion passed by
and said see webster is the friend of
the war had he not a son invested in
that enterprise
such is the conduct of the four most
eminent men of america no oue ol
them opposes the war does any one
say a good word against ithe is sure
to eat that word the next day the war
is thought  glorious and called  patri
otic men are bid to fight the vrar of
their country  right or wrong how
few remember that to fight on the wrong
side is to fight against the country the
glory of the enterprise what does it
amount to why if the united states
were to conquer all mexico viewed as
a military exploit the glory of the deed
would be nothing as well might the
horseguards of london claim glory
because they had chased a crowd of
women from billingsgate and driven
them up ludgate hill vvc make no
doubt that a private company for the
conquest of mexico might be got up in
boston which iniwo years time would
conquer the whole of that country and
keep itperhaps for ever the glory
which twenty millions of anglo saxons
are likely to get from conquering the
miserable population of mexico is glo
ry in the wrong column even when
looked at with the unscrupulous eye of
a soldier it seems surprising all men
cannot see that such a glory is only a
shame one day the people must awa

reckoning with the memories of our fa

selection st
the colored convention
report of the committee ox educa
tion
the committee appointed to make a
report on the state and wants of educa
ional privileges of the colored people j
uid the educational advantages of col
jred persons in the united states beg
io report that they have endeavored to
consider the subject presented to them
o report upon with that care and
houghtfulness demanded by so impor
ant a subject so wide reaching is
he theme of such deep import viewed
in every respect that they feel fully
conscious of their inability to meet it
in the various important aspects in
which it presents itself yet conscious
af the importance of this subject we
present the following suggestions
 in the first place we would offer
is a very important item in the consid
eration of the question of education
and the advantages connected there
with the primeval duty of mental cul
ure as involved in the fact of posses
sing mental powers which have been
bestowed upon us by the almighty it
is this consideration rightly viewed
which presents the magnitude of this
subject and the obligations arising
from it in the most positive manner
the questionings and doubts expressed
ever and anon as to the importance of
education are here entirely stopped
all dubitation here is destroyed in
the very fact of being endowed with
intellectual powers god clearly signi
fies that he intends that they shall be
appropriated and developed there is
no waste no superfluity in the econo
my of god viewed in any department
in the spheres of his government
and agency no agent whatever exists
divorced from some special end and
mission everything that lives breathes
aud exists as a sentiment of spiritual
existence was made and designed for
growth for developement for expan
sion not for inactivity not to lie in
dull abstraction and to rot did god
bestow upon us the enlarged capacity
of mind and the noble powers of rea
son the talent of intellect was given
to man to produce its proper fruits and
its legitimate results the same as any
other talent he has bestowed upon us
the responsibility which god has thrown
upon our moral being and for which
he will call us to account is as weighty
in this regard as any other for which
we will have to answer when called to
our proper account
the duty of colored mens attending
then with peculiar interest to the sub
ject of education is not a doubtful or a
questionable one it is a matter wound
up in our very existence it is involved
in the very constitution given us the
duty and responsibility are coincident
with our very being
 but how should this education
among us be advanced in what man
ner should it be promoted what
should be the spiritthe controlling
animus of our endeavors to further it
and make it a common commodity
yve reply here the education of col
ored men should not be dwarfed to the
cribbed the narrow thing it now is
the education of the mind of colored
youth up to this time has been shame
fully limited contracted in very deed
it has not reached the dignity and the
elevation of education it has been
rudiment a notings and superficial
glancing to comprehensiveness it
t has never yet made any pretensions
to profundity not the most distant ap
proach la proof of this we need but
mention the fact that our schools are
of the commonest order among us
throughout the union while it is indeed
true that in several places we see clear
 nut evident signs of amendment
i these facts should not longer be
permitted to be existent we are
i bound to put forth efforts for enlarged
advantages whatever mesas sad
availabilities for iimnlal culture an
be obtained it i our dutv to wei k and
secure them the nhiration mu
peik should be carried n in the most
earnest manner with the urgt t ex
pectations to the dcelopement ol ail
the powers and by the appropriation
of all the means that nature and schol
arship may afford there should be no
stint no contracted ness nor prejudice
to hinder in this respect nor should
we fail to declare that the old stale
objections iterated on one side and an
other against classical learning be
cause it is greek or homan is little
and trifling whatever availabilities
are within our reach arc providentially
afforded that we might use them and
consequently neither the stars iu the
concave of the skies nor the humble
floweret of the vale nor the sand upon
the sea shore arc to be despised k
neglected as means aflohed by the
almighty for culture and devt lopeinent
and so w hen a volume of science or a
relic of ancient wisdom or a fragment
of antique science or eruditi n i pre
sented it is a means afforded by prov
idence for growth and intellectual ex
pansion and no man has a right to
eschew any advantages afforded by
nature or providence which is adapted
to expand the intellect and therefore
it is that all the works of genius
whether modern or ancient whether
the fruit of english or of homan of
german or of grecian minds are to be
thankfully received by us and skill
fully appropriated for the advancement
of our children and ourselves in scien
tific historical and classical learning
 the committee beg to present the
importance of education from a con
sideration of its necessity to a full and
harmonious expression of the man
our people can never be a people
the matured and grown men among us
can never be men in one quarter while
there is nothing hut physical develop
ment as nmong our brethren in bonds
or w hile in another there is nothing hut
religious expansion or while in a third
there may be nothing hut intellectual
growth man is neither animal exis
tence nor a spiritual being nor yet
an intellectual creature alone put
man is a compound being a being ol
mind soul and body and that is not
a true development which pertains to
one of these alone to the neglect of
the others nor is he a full and com
plete man who has onesided develop
ments now this has been the fault
of the culture of the colored race
in this land our culture lias never
yet anywhere or at any time been a
full and harmonious one everywhere
there has been an unnatural and inor
dinate demand for physical exertion
and consequently everywhere therr
have been unnatural inordinate phys
ical developments the religious de
velopment among us has been but n
creed sufficiently uninformed lacking
the genial alloy of learning scholar
ship and the light of erudition the
consequence has been tnat while we
are a hardy and vigorous race in the
main while we are a people accounted
religious we are lacking intelligence
scholarship and science and although
as it respects two elements of our
being we may compare with our fellow
creatures around us yet in respect to
the power the force and the authority
of learning w e are vastly inferior
now the history of the human spe
cies evinces the fact that a degraded
people can never escape the degrada
tion and reach a position of equality
while there is a chance even for the
imputation of inferiority the reason
ableness of such a charge is nothing to
the blank vision of blind prejudice
argument will not sutfice when ca
pacity undoubted capacity is exhib
ited then and then alone will the
contempt and the outrages arising
from actual or imagined inferiority
depart even as the pageantry and the
pomp of a dreamy revery is dispelled
by a human beings contact with the
rigid aud severe duties of life
 it now only remains that your
committee should remark that the
remedy for the ills and evils of our
present system of intellectual culture
are not nonexistent in our midst it
is evident that it is not presented in
our common school system which it
self is far from being complete and
fully furnished we have a general
system of highschool instruction w bieh
is able to meet the genera want in
a population of  people we
have two highschools one at cincin
nati one at new york neither of w hich
will compare fovorably with the ordi
nary highschools established among
the whites the colleges of new eng
land and the west which are opened
to us do not meet the needs of our
people because first there is no pre
vious opportunity offered for that early
almost childish culture which is abso
lutely necessary to the formation of
true high scholarship and for which
white children possess superabundant
facilities secondour young men
who do prepare themselves for college
are too poor to sustain themselves
through a collegiate course and while
at college are separated from their
people inasmuch a there is no point
of interest or of contact between the
colleges of our country and the colored
people of the union but rather the
utmost distance thirdly such u
the force and urgency of caste pene
trating every phase of life social ec
clesiastical civil and domestic that
college life has its peculiar restraints
to young men thrown in the midst of
hundreds who have a concealed repug
nance to colored men and with few
and perhaps none to sympathize
what then shall be done to remedy
the evils now entailed what to n
crease the number of students in the
land

k olved that one of the best evi

resolved that the anxieties of col

tainments
resolved that the day of equality
heretofore has been very considerably
retarded by the lack of men enpabie in
their own persons and their own ac
quirements to refute the imputation of
inferiority and to demonstrate the most
enlarged capacity
resolved that the complete and
entire extirpation of caste is dependent
not alone upon the enunciation of prin
ciples hut likewise on the living repre
sentation of the facts of mental ability
in our midst and the entrance of capa

questioned power and energy in all the
spheres of the ught research and acti

resolved that it is the opinion of
this convention that the aim and en

forth he to present an early generation
f scholars capable of trending tfm
platform of science erudition and learn
ing with as much conscious ability a
any men in the land
resolved that in order to facilitate
this design and object it ia cxpedunt
that special means should be resort d
to whereby the expense the strange
ness the timidity and the restraint
which now limit the number of collegi
ates from among us may be neutralized
and effectually remedied
resolved that the founding of a
collegiate institution on the manual
abor plan well endowed placed in
mine central position is calculated to
essen the restraint aiuhiuiidity which
nust long exist from the existence of

mr quincy was not among the earliest
friends of the antislavery cause neither
dd lie come in at the eleventh hour for
that hour has at last conic though
every man who shall faithfully labor
th remainder of the day shall be en
titled to his penny it was in the very
darkest hour of the cause when the
mad less of monocracy had become
contagious all over the land and all
parties and sects were thirsting as it
were for the blood of the abolitionists
whoa ft iston relined enlightened be
nevolent boston was forever disgraced
in history by the lawless conduct of
live thousand gentlemen of property
and standing on which it is not neces
sary hero to dilate it was at such a
crisis the mind of mr quincy was
anused t the investigation of the sub
ject of slavery and the principles of the
abolitionists unm ved by popular
clamor uninfluenced by family ties
uhorrified by the certainty of losing
caste having satisfied his judgment
and conscience in the premises he
boldly avowed himself to he an aboli
tionist of the most ultra stamp the
determined foe of slavery under all
circumstances the glad associate of
men who were without reputation for
bleeding humanitys sake it was truly
a sublime act a glorious achievement
since th it hour the antislavery cause
haspas led through many vicissitudes
had many extraordinary phases been
betrayed on the light and on the left
lost many of its earliest adherents
through shameful apostacy but at no
tino lias mr quincy faltered ii his
c ur c or swerved one hairsbreadth
from tin siraight line of uncompromi
sing abolitionism his integrity is
wuh ut spot or blemish his courage
eqail t any emergency his vigilance
in the dete nt m of danger to the cause
through th awardice of some and
the timeserving spirit of others sleep
less aid unwearied ins readiness to
metet the big iet re luiromciits of auti

if mr qumcy hud cherished any
reg irj for his g lod name and tame
in a popular sense most certainly he
would not have thus identified hiinselt

while traveling from rochester to victor
a few days ago we listened to a eoavcraarioi
bet wees two perms of apparent ge utility am
intelligence on the subject of the unite
states war against mexico a wide differ
enee of opinion appeared between them th
one contending for the rightfulness of th
war and the other against it the main r
gument in favor of the war was the meanness
and wickedness of the mexican people and
to cap the climax he gave it as his solemi
conviction that the hand of the lord was in tin
wort that the cup of mexican iniquity wa
full and that god was now making use o
the anglo saxon race as a rod to ehastiw
them the effect of this religious outhurs
was to stun his opponent into silence hi
seemed speechless the ground was too higl
and holy for him be did not dare reply to it
and thus the conversation ended when me
charge their sins upon god argument is idle
rebuke alone is needful and the poor man
lacking the moral courage to do this sa
silent
here then we have religion coupled wit

rebellious people what say our evangeli

timed and eloquent tribute from the pen of
william lloyd garrison to the worth of that
fearless champion and fearless writer in the
cause of human freedom edmund quincy
we most heartily unite in this grateful com
mendation regarding him as one of the
best in our ranks we think him the least ap
preciated by the rest of abolitionists com
ing from the ranks of the favored few in our
land it is not remarkable that be should be
regarded with a little ooolaeeo by the rank
and file of our noble army made up as they
are of humble men end women strangers to
his habits and mode of life mr quincy was
one of the first abolitionists in this country by
whom we were kindly welcomed and taught
to furget our despised complexion we were
newly from the slave plantation rude in our
manners rough m our appearance and awk
ward in our movements and altogether mtae
rustomed to refined and educated society and
when to invite a colored naan hts the hum
blest abode of white persons required great
moral courage he did not hesitate to welcome
us to his home and hosphahtyshowing him
self more of man and less an aristocrat than
the heartless herd who are now calling him
this meaningless name to destroy his asu

it is far from our purpose in managing the
editorial department of the nceth star to
assail the eye of our readers especially our
transatlantic readers with all the low black
guardisms and vile abuse w hich the american
press may see fit to lavish upon us we wish
to keep our columns as free as possible from
the course vulgarity and malignant peraon
i alities which distinguish a very large and
we are sorry to say influential portion of the
american press but our readers will par
don the departure from this rule by the pub
lication of the following article from the de
mocratic review for january as it comes
from a source which may be said to represent
the respectability and refinement uf the dem
ocratic party as well as the public opinion of
our country at large
the canard steamer line from boston to
liverpool are coming hereafter to mew york
as the proprietors are alarmed at the rivalry so
suddenly ewdeuced by the appearance oi ute
american line of steamers truin n t ew york
via southampton to bremen so far these
transatlantic steamers have been wholly sup
ported by american patronage which it once
withdrawn will throw them probably ou their
beamends and this is a result likely to
occur from present symptoms if the aiuen
can line prove itself to be equal in safety ai d
seel and who can doubt that american
skill is not equal to british any day on sea or
land it is beyond all question certain that
 every truehearted american will cheerfully
lend every encouragement to his country
enterprise there is another reason stronger
still why we should give a rebuke to thu
english cunard line which in the day of its
ascendancy dared to venture upon a brutal
display of hostility to american prejudices
i that should be remembered now
only last year that black vagabond
douglass who spent his time in england
propagating his filthy lies against the  mtet
stales which were greedily swallowed bs
english hypocrites and fools returned to thu
country in the cambria under the espccia
protection of capt judkins who first insislec
that this offensive negro should sit at table
with american gentlemen and failing it
this he magnanimously gave up to his odor
ous protege his own bed and state room tht
year before that capt judkins whose black
propensities are strong in the ascendant au
j thorised this selfsame negro to hold forth or
his deck against the cruelty and infamy oi

breath and refused to live cheek by jowl

remonstrances being being temperately made
by some american gentlemen this msoleni
cub of the sea capt judkins threatened u
put them in irons ought we not to get hirr
j up a public dtnner and a cold bath to boot
j on his advent in new york this suggestion
we learn is under meditation
j here we liave it capt judkins dared it

therefore this reviewthis great defender o
democratic liberty gently recommends thai
captain judkins be thrown in the dock on his
arrival at new york we own that we liavs
said some hard things against america ami
that we have helped to expose the bittei
spirit of persecution to which colored person
are subjected throughout this country but
we are confident that we have said nothing
half so well calculated to drsgrace our nation
in the eyes of the civilized world as thb
same article in the democratic review had
the new york express sun or herald used
the language above we should not have taken
any notice of it their proslavery malice
being widely known and well understood
and being also understood to belong to that
bloodhound class of american newspapers
whose business it is to hunt negroes for their
southern masters from such as these we
might well expect such things but not from
the democratic review this periodical has
lor some time been regarded as a decent and
respectable print and it is therefore some
what surprising to find it dealing in course and
vulgar abuse and coolly counselling the
citizens of new york to lynch capt jud
kins give him a cold bath that is
shove him into the dock we recommend
the idea to punch he might give us a fine
picture of jooathan in the act of giving capt
judkins a cold bath
there are one or two falsehoods in the
article above though of no great import
ance we may as well correct them at once
capt judkins never invited or insisted id
our sitting at the table with white a unt
ie an gentleex nor did be threaten to
put the slaveholders in irons tiu these
american gentlemen got up a mob which
might have endangered the lives ot these
selfsame gentlemen but we suppose tills
democratic defender of mobs w ho would
throw capt judkins overboard and who
recommends the deed will be as ready to
defend the mob or mutiny at sea as he is to
recommend lynch law in new york this
is a great country
we give our readers another specimen of

pleasure we hope soon to lay before our
readers editorial correspondence from our ab
sent coadjutor
this number rods the fourth volume and
with it our connexion as editor of the mys
trry for upwards of four years the paper
has been afloat upon tin breeze during which
time excepting three months when it was
edited by the committee we have stood at
the helm of our steady little barque steering
right onward for the cimtinent of liberty and
equality if ever we have touched success
fully any of her ports we leave those who
have been the constant observers of our move
ments to decide
we commenced the enterprise alone on
the th of august  and as many know
after nine months transferred over to a com
mittee the proprietorship the position that
we assumed was to claim for our oppressed
fellow countrymen both bond and free every
right and privilege belonging to man holding
as an indispensible prerequisite that whatev
er is necessary for the elevation of the whites
is necessary for the colored in order the
more fully to illustrate tlie truthfulness of this
i position wc had frequently to touch subjects
that at oce affected the pride and interests ot
our brethren who often in consequence look
ed upon us more as an injurer than a friend
put our determination being perseverance
and our course onwardwe had not long been
toiling with the popular tide and current of
our peoples errors until the young people
particularly of the west were aroused to a
quickening sense of their condition and in
many cases inexcusable positions in society
and wo at oie timi had the astoiishnvmt as
j well as the pleasure of seeing eleven papers
spring up iu different parts of the country all
of which joined issue with us advocating the
very same doctrines or commending oui
i course among the number were the dis

in addition to which in every direction the
launched forth upon the mental ocean natural
ly enough concluding that if we an inexperi
enced adventurer were capable of taking tin
helm and striking with certainty many of tlx
ports of importance to us as a people tin
same results might as probably follow like ef
forts on their own part and we can safely
say in tn period of our modern existence war
the talents of the colored people male and fe
male developed to such an extent as since the
existence of our paper and now those who
before had not tho confidence in theutslvcs
and would scarce venture a thought look upon
such efforts as a matter of course
there were quite too many papers accord
ing to our number and circnmstanscs but it
only served to show what an interest from the
course pursued was excited in our present
condition
we have ever since gone on steadily and
stealthily until the present dale fulfilling to
the letter our promise as editor and assisting
the publishers in the fulfillment of theirs
though as we have frequently noticed gave
our services gratuitously to the cause as well
as a portion of our private means earned by
our daily business but all our above referred
i to coteinporaries have long since ceased to ex
ist with some others of a later period
we admit that we have fallen far short of
what might have been effected in the same
lime the paper frequently appearing quite cold
and spiritless but this could not be avoided as
we had our daily labor to perform to earn our
bread
the mystery is still afloat with the solemn
promise of the publishers to keep her tiding
on the broad waters of destiny doing battle
in the great struggle for liberty and right ele
vation and equality god and humanity as ui
days bygone
the publishing committee with and for
whom we have labored for years faithful to
their trust and prompt to a man have done
i much for which we feel proud to have i in
power to say arc well w orthy of their
task andean still do more and from our very
heart as our successors in the editorial career
we commend them to tlie readers of the mys
tery
as to the efficacy and merit of our own ef
forts we leave the public to determine as we
have no other endorser
it becomes necessary that we should retire
from our present position not that we are a
traitor to the cause of humanity but turn
this to w hat we hope a nwe useful and pro
ductive port of the moral vineyard we leave
the mystery for a union with the far famed
and world renowned frederick doicla as
a colaborer in the cause of our oppressed
brethren by the publication of a large and ca
pacious paper the norm star in rochester j
n y in whiptp our whole time energy and
services will be given which cannot foil to
be productive of signal benefit to tlie slave and
our nominally free brethren when the head
and heart of douglass enters into tlie combi
nation we feel loath to leave our mystery
but duty calls and we must obey
to all our friends and acquaintances we re
turn thanks for the kindness and many fovors
shown us while occupying the editorial chair
of the mystery and in whatever we may have j
erred consider it of the head and not the
heart
we could not conclude and do justice to our
own foehngs if we omited to notice the edi
torial corps in particular we have ever
received from them especially at home that
degree of courtesy and respect common to the
rank and have been received and commended
moor position beyond ail expeemtion and

to tbe profession if we roast with half tbo

 mr yashon applied  the court lor a rulo

lion appears to he directed to this point two

enforcing the better observance of this ordi
nance of the church if we trace this instij
tuiiuii as fir hack as we are able we shall
find it first mentioned in the account of the
creation given by m sa to the liiidrei of
israel as the foundation of toe law moses
says
and god blessed the seventh day and
sanctified it because in it lie had rested from
alj ilia works which god created ami made
t t wn tins circumstance moses founded the
severe but necessary institution of the sab j
hath exodus xwi  severe though
it was it was nevertheless just because
ncccsary for the purposft which its great
author had in viewthe perfection and ulti
mate happiness of the human race when
we consider the extensive operation of this j
principle in the mosaic polity the minuteness
of its details and the severity of the punish j
ments attending its infraction we cease to
wonder that the jews after their return from
captivity should regard it with a kind ol
superstitious reverence almost amounting to
awe it was this extreme feeling of dread
after the tifrrible judgments which they had
undergone for their departure from the insti
tutions of moses which toroed them under all i
their conquerers and under all circumstances
to agitate for the enjoyment of their own laws
and customs this constant agitation and
determined maintenance of jewish
chiefly under the roman empire first brought
the sabbath into general note and no doubt
finally caused the adoption of what has been
technically called the christian sabbath
very early after the jews returned from bab
ylon it became customary for them to assem
ble on the sabbath day for the purpose of
tending and hearing the law and when the
christian religion was introduced they still re j
mamed zealous of the law acts xxi  j
and no doubt kept the sabbath nearly as
strictly as they had previously done and
although the docilities of christ and his ajos
ties have been so long extant and arc pretty
conclusive upon the subject it docs not ap
pear at present to be rightly understood
when jes us christ commenced his ministry
the pharisee of that day found great fault
with him and his disciples for not kecpii g the 
sabbath so strictly as th y were in the habit
of doing bat he tola them that they were
altogether mistaken in regard to this mutter
that it was not only  lawful to do good on
the sabbath day but even works of gomrnon
necessity were lawful that the pharisees
themselves while they complainedof him
healing the sick would do anything that
tended to the preservation of their own cattle
thus it being necessary that ins disciples
should eat made it also lawful to gather tin
eoru on the sabbath day that they might eat
ho showed them that even david upon a
case o necessity had entered mto the house
of god and lad eaten the shew bread
and bad given to tlswe who were with him
which was equally unlawful and could only
e justified by the necessity of the case now
gentlemen i ask the pharisees of the present
day if it is not e pally necessary that tc should
m t to agitate for the freedom of th oppressed
and downtrodden stave on the only day in the
week whsi the mass of the people are at lib
erty to h ar even if it be the sabbath  but
these were nut the only case of sabbath
breaking winch the savior showed them that
were habitually occurring before their eves
and apparently wnkcut observation the
priests were constantly in the habt of dcse
cratmg the sabbath and wete blameless
they were obliged to hi fringe one part if the
law that they might be able to keep another
entire but jesus told us that jhe sab r
was marie for man and not roan lor the sab
bath if we an to keep the samiath ac
cording to the traditiois of the pharisees
of tire present day lustead of follow log the
instructions of the saviour ought they not u

yesterday at northville in uus county
a locofoco exjudge and a whig presby j
tcrian deacon were in conversation on the
subject of the mexican war the deacou ex
pressed the opinion unqualifiedly that the
war was justifiable on the part of the united j
states and he thought that our national
honor required that ice should prosecute it
vigorously until wc compel tha mexicans to
pay the expenses of it and give us an hon

of course the exfunctionary of state sub
scribed to all this and said further that we
ought to push the matter through right of
wrong

since a man near niles in the western part
of the state was shot down robbed and his
body left to rot in the woods not long since
a colored man in this city had hi brains beat
out while in his own bed by a drunken
rowdy on christmas eve at pontiac an
altercation took place between two men one
stabbed the other and he died next day last
saturday evening in the shadow of a chris
tian church in the most respectable part of
the city a young man was stabbed to the
heart and without a groan fell down a
corpse  was well acquainted with him he
was a native of germany and a very indus
trious and worthy young man his murderer
was from the same country these terrible
murders have thrown the city into consterna
tion and we bid fair to rival new orleans
many think these outbreaks of passion and
revenge have been occasioned by abrogat
ing the death penalty and the legislature
will be flooded w ith petitions to reinstate it

roads in the country and one of the large

for the effoit of south carolina it ie

claimed the right of sending represen
tatives to cougress on account of their
slaves mr patterson of new jersey
contended that as the slaves had iki
representative or vote at home theii
masters ceuid not claim additional votes

nearer all the speakers in the conven
tion except the members from so till
carolina and tsorfis referred to the
slave trade mith horror mr gerry
j of massachusetts declared in the con
vention that it was as humiliating tc
j enter into compact with the slaves ol
the southern states as with the horses
i and mtiles of the north it was con
tended that if slaves were men then
they should be taxed as men and havt
their vote as men if mere property
r j they should not entitle their owners t
a vote more than other property i
might be proper to tax slaves be
cause it has a tendency to discoarag
slavery hut to take them into accouni
in giving representatives tended to en
courage the slavetrade and to make
it the interest of the states to continue
that infamous traffic it was said
that we had just assumed a place
among independent nations in conse
quence of our opposition to the attempts
of great britain to enslave us that this
opposition was grounded upon the pre
servation of those rights to which god
and nature had entitled us not in par
ticular but in common with all the rest
of mankind that we had appealed tc
the supreme being for his assistance
as the god of heaven who could nd
j hut approve our efforts to preserve the
rights which he had imparted to his
creatures that now when wc had
scarcely risen from our knees from
supplicating his aid and protection in
forming our government over a free
peoplea government formed pretend
ingly on the principle of liberty and
for its preservation in that govern
ment to have a provision not only put
ting it out of its power to restrain or
prevent the slave trade even encour
i a ri n g that most infamous traffic and
giving states power and influence in
j the union in proportion as they cruelly
and wantonly sport with the rights ol
their fellow creatures ought to be
considered as a solemn mockery of
and an insult to that god whose pro
tection xve had then implored and
could not tail to hold us up in detesta
tion and render us contemptible to
every true friend of liberty in the
world
luther martin the attorney gen
eral ol maryland thought it incon
sistent with the principles of the
revolution and dishonorable to the
american character to have the im
portation of laves allowed by the con
stitution
j the northern states and some of
the southern wished to abolish the
slave trade at once mr pinckney of
south carolina thought that state
would never accede to the constitu
tion if it prohibits the slave trade
she would not stop her importation of
slaves in any short time said mr
rutledge of south carolina the
people of the carolinas and georgia
will never be such fools as to give up
so important an interest religion
and humanity have nothing to do with
this question interest alone is the
governing principle with nations in
apportioning taxes he thought three
slaves ought to be counted as but one
free man while in apportioning rep
resentatives his colleagues messrs
butler and pinckneydeclared the
blacks ought to stand on an equality
with the whites mr pinckney would
make blacks equal to whites in the
ratio of representation he went
further he would have some security
against an emancipation of slaves
and says mr madison seemed to
wish some provision should be included
in the constitution in favor of pro
perty in slaves south carolina
and georgia said mr pincknev
cannot do without slaves the im
portation of slaves would be for the
interest of the whole union the more
slaves the more produce to employ the
carrying trade the more consumption
also
on the ether hand mr bedford of
delaware thought south carolina
was puffed up with her wealth and her
negroes mr madison cool and far
sighted always referring to first prin
ciples was unwilling to allow the
importation of slaves till  so
long a term w ill be more dishonorable
to the american character than to sav
nothing about it in the constitution
j mr williamson of north carolina
in  thought slaves an encum
brance to society and was both
in opinion and practice against sla
 rolonel mann of virginia in
the convention called the slave trade
lan infernal traffic and said that
slavery discourages arts and manu
factures t the poor despise labor when
performed by slaves they pro
duce the most pernicious effects on
manners every master of slaves is
j bom a petty tyrant they bring the
judgment of heaven on a country
mr dickinson of delaware thought

all the north an at first opposed fro
slavery and the slave trade both par
ties seemed obstinate the question of
taxes on exports and of navigation
laws remained to be decided gouv
eraeur morris recommended that the
whole subject of slavery might be re
ferred to a committee including the
clauses relating to tlie taxes on exports
and to the navigation laws these
things may form a bargain among the
j northern and southern states says
luther martin i found the eastern
t states notwithstanding their aversion
to slavery were willing to indulge the
j southern states at least with tempo
rary liberty to prosecute the slave trade
provided the southern states would in
their turn gratify them by laying no re
strict ion on navigation acts the
north began to understand if the con
templated navigation laws should be en
i acted that as mr grayson afterwards
said all the produce of the southeri
states w ill be cairied by the northers

j a declared tlie western and mid
dle states will be ruined if not enabled
to defend themselves against foreigi
i regulations w ill be ruined if they do
not have some navigation laws giving
i americans an advantage over foreign
vessels mr gorham of massachu
setts said the eastern states hac
i no motives to union but a commercia
one the proffered compromise
would favor their commercial interests
it was for the commercial interest of tlie
south said mr pinckney to have iu
restrictions upon the commerce bui
considering the loss brought on th
eastern states by the revolution anc
their liberal conduct taward the viewt
of south carolina in consenting to al
low slavery and the importation o
slaves he thought that no fetters should
be imposed on the power of making
i commercial regulations and his con
j stituents would be reconciled to the lib
erality so the north took the boon
and winked at the infernal traffic

them for at that time cotton was im
ported from india not having become
a staple of the south when the arti
i cle which binds the free states to deliv

voted on it was a new feature in
american legislation not hinted at in
the articles of confederation hos
tile to the wellknown principles of the
common law of englandwhich always
favors libertyand the usages and
principles of modern civilized nations
vet new as it was and hostile it seems
not a word was said against it in the
i convention it was agreed to new
con yet the northern delegates
says mr madison owing to their par
ticular scruples on the subject of sla
very did not choose the word slave to
be mentioned in the conventions
of the several states it seems no re
monstrance was made to this article
luther martin returning home said
to the house of delegates in mary
land at this time we do not generally
hold this commerce in so great abhor
rence as we have done when our lib
erties w ere at stake we warmly felt for
the common rights of men the danger
being thought to be past we are daily
growing more insensible to their
rights
w hen the several states came to a
dopt the constitution some hesitancy
i was shown at tolerating the slave trade
or even slavery itself in the massa
chusetts convention mr neal would
not favor the making merchandise of
the bodies ot men gen thompson
exclaimed shall it be said that after
we have established our own independ

ted the slave trade in most pointed
terms slavery was generally detes

states could not claim the sad privilege
of their parents that the south itself
would soon hate and abolish it sla
very is not smitten by an apoplexy
said mr dawes yet it has received
a mortal wound and will die of consump
tion this reflection with the to
bacco and navigation laws turned
the scale patrick henry was no son
of new england but knew well on what
hinges her political morality might turn
by what means and which way
in the new york convention mr
i smith could not see any rule by which
slaves were to be included in the ratio
of representation the very operation of
i it was to give certain privileges to men
who were so wicked as to keep slaves
to which mr hamilton replied that
  without this indulgence no union could
possibly have been formed but
considering those peculiar advantages
i which we derived from them the
southern slates it is entirely just that
they should be gratified the south
ern states possess certain staples to

j in the pennsylvania convention mr

laid the foundation for abolishing sla
very out of this country though the
period was more distant than he could
i ci klic mr states will
be under the control of congress in this
 particular and slavery will never be in

lapse of a few years and congress will
have power to exterminate slavery from

the proslarery character of tne con
stitution mr iredell in defence said
the matter of slavery was regulatec
with great difficulty and by a spirit o
concession which it would not be pru

it is probable that all the member
reprobated this inhuman trafic ii

mr mcdowal looked upon the slav
trade as a very objectionable part o
the system mr goudy did not wisl
to be represented with negroes
is the south carolina convention gen
pinckney admitted that the carolina
and georgia were so weak that the
could not form a union strong enougl
for the purpose of effectually protecting
each other it was their policy there
j fore to form a close union with th
eastern states who are strong thi
i eastern states had been a jhe greates
sufferers in the revolution they hai
lost everything but their country am
their freedom we the carolina
and georgia should let them in soim
measure partake of our prosperity
but the union could come only from a
compromise we have secured ar
unlimited importation of negroes foi
i twenty years we have obtained
a right to recover our slaves in what
ever part of america they shall take
refuge which is a right we had not be

lur the security of this species of pro
i perty it was in our power to make wc
would have made better if we could
i hut on the whole i do not think them
bad no one in south carolina il
seems thought slavery an evil
thus the constitution was assented
to as the result of accommodation
thouch containing clauses confessedly
founded on unjust principles the
north had been false to its avowed con
victions and in return higher tonnage
duties were imposed on foreign than or
american bottoms and goods import
ed in american vessels paid ten pet
cent less duty than the same goods
brought in those owned by foreigners
the navigationjlaws and the to
bacco wrought after their kind south
carolina and georgia had their way
i the north said gouverneur morris
j in the national convention for the
sacrifiea of every principle of right
j of every impulse of humanity had
i this compensation to bind themselves
i to march their militia for the defence
of the southern states for their defence
against those very slaves of whom they
complain they must supply vessels
and seamen in case of foreign attack
the legislature will have indefinite
power to tax them by excises and duties
on imports
still with many there lingered a
vague belief that slavery would soon
perish in the first congress mr
jackson of georgia admitted that it
was au evil habit mr gerry and
mr madison both thought that congress
had the right to regulate this busi
ness and if they see proper to make
a proposal to purchase all the slaves
but the most obvious time for ending
the institution had passed by the feel
ing of hostility to it grew weaker and
weaker as the nation became united
powerful and rich its mortal wound
was fast getting healed
slavery sergeant talfourd puts
the following words into the mouth of
huon as expressive of the feelings of a
nobleminded slave tribune
that i were dead oh what is
death compared to slavery brutes

for it when heaven set man above

rev james t woodbury of acton
mass brother of the hon levi wood
bury when delivering lectures on the
subject of slavery not unfrequently ad
verts to the circumstance which drewr his
attention to the subject during his
stay in the capital of the united states
he had a wish to visit the tomb of wash
ington he was attended by an aged
negro whose business it has been for
many years to guide travellers to that
consecrated spot this old man was
formerly the slave of general washing
ton mr woodbury asked him if he
had any children
i have had a large family he re
plied
and are they living inquired the
gentleman
the voice ofthe aged father trembled
with emotion and the tears started to
his eyes as he answered
i dont know whether they are
alive or dead they were all sold
away from meand i dont know what
became of them i am alone in the
worldwithout a child to bring me a
cup of cold water in my old age
mr woodbury looked on the infirm
and solitary being with feelings of deep
compassion
and this thought he is the fate of
slaves even when owned by so good a
man as general washington vn ho
would not be an abolitionist
slavery and the slave trade
we extract the following from the eight
annual report of the british ami eoreigi
antislavery society
the emancipated colonies
however much it may be disputec
by interested pers ns the cornmittet
are of opinion that the great draw
back on the general prosperity of tht
emancipated colonies will be lomid in
the present laws affecting labor and
the blind rage which exists among n
certain portion of the west india body
for the introduction of large masses ol
immigrant laborers into them the
laws are so constructed as to drive
labor almost exclusively into one chan
nel and to place the laborers at the
mercy of their employers this of
eourse creates discontent and may
soon lead to consciences opposite to
those which are intended the otre
duction of immigrants at the expanse
of the colonial treasuries imposes bur
dens too heavy for them to bear the
large drain upon the resources of the
people over and above that which the
civil service requires impoverishes
them the gains flow at present into
the hands of comparatively few hut
this state of things cannot continue
long
with respect to the conduct of the
emancipated classes their general
freedom from crime and their advance
in knowledge and respectability it is
most satisfactory to be able to report
not only favorably hut triumphantly
the committee would gladly produce
the proofs but the limits of their report
will not permit them
the introduction of slavecrown
produce into british markets
the committee did not anticipate at
the last annual meeting of the society
that the principle on which slavegrown
sugars had been excluded from the
british markets would have been so
readily abandoned they need not
recall the painful subject to the atten
tion of their friends further than to
state that after using their best efforts
to avert a step which in their deliber
ate judgment could not fail to inflict
additional injury on africa and grie
vous wrong on the slave population in
south america and the foreign west
indies they found nothing remaining
for them to do but to enter their decided
protest against it the measure which
filled them with grief was received in
cuba and brazil with exultation the
value of slave property immediately
rose the investment of fresh capital in
estates cultivated by slaves followed
and a new impulse was given to the
slave trade to counteract as far as
possible the injnrious tendency of this
measure the committee have felt it to
be their duty earnestly and urgently
to call on their friends and the iriends
of the slave to refrain as far as prac
ticable from the use of slavelabor
produce and to recommend the same
practice to others as an import am
auxiliary means to promote the extinc
tion of both slavery and the slave

siavfhoiding missionaries among
the indians richard mendenhall a
friend stationed among the shawnee
indians writes to the xaliotutl fro
i under date of friends shawnee
school indian territory  mo ijoth
 that slavery exists in that terri
tory as far north as the th degree of
north latitude a few slaves are held
j by a single indian chief who he says
is the only indian in that part of the
territory so far as he knows who
either holds or employs a slave he
says many ot the indians are opposed
to slavery and will not deliver up fu
gitives w hile others w ill for a reward
or fearing the fate of the seminole
apprehend and give them up thus
proving that they are receiving the
vices if not the virtues of civilization
but the writer continues it is
white men in the service of the goverrv
ment of the united states and niisaion
aries that have introduced slavery
here and some may he startled at
the information that missionaries have
slaves but startling as it mav he such
is the fact i presume that no one will
be more surprised than  was on o m
ing here to lind such a state of things
i there is a very extensive missionaiy
j establishment here under the eaic of
the methodist church south and
strange as it may appear they have
some half dozen or more slaves to
assist in civilizing and christianizing
the indians is not this the climax of
inconsistency and this system of oper
ations is not without its results for
some of the children who have been at
this mission have that aversion to labor
which is so common among w hite peo
ple in a slaveholding community w hirl
is a sad state of things for it is highly
important that these indian children
should he trained to habits of industry
my object in bringing this ruhjei t
to public notice is that something may
he done for the removal of slavery from
this part of the territory cannot his
subject he laid before the proper autho
rities j t washington after thu
briinin it to public notice i shall look
to the friends of in the cast to
attend to it
u this object should be parried out
it might subject me to hitter persecu
tion here and perhaps oblige me n
leave the territory but after mature
deliberation i have determined to
bring the subject to public notice at all
hazards lam engaged in labors of a
public natun for the good of a much
injured people and athough my lot is
at present cast among the iudiaus vet
i am no less a friend to the sable sfns
