argument
of charles sumner esq against the con
stitutionality of separate colored schools
in the case of sarah c roberts vs the
city of boston before the supreme courl
of mass dec  
continued
 the courts of massachusetts
have never recognized any discrimina
tion founded on olor or race in the j
administration of the public schools
but have recognized the equal rights of
all the inhabitants
there are a few decisions of our
court bearing on this subject but they
all breathe one spirit the sentiment
of equality animates them in the casef
of commonwealth vs davit  mass
r  while declaring the equal
rights of all the inhabitants both in the
grammar and district schools the court
said the schools required by the
statute are to be maintained for the
benefit of the whole town it is the
wise policy of the law to give all the in
habitants equal privileges for the educa
tion of their children in the public schools
nor is it in the power of the majority to
deprive the minority of this privilege
every inhabitant of the
town h a right to participate in the
benefits of both descriptions of sshools
and it is not competent for a town to
establish a grammar school for the ben
efit of one part of the town to the exi
elusion of the other although the mon
ey raised for the support of schools
may be in other respects fairly appor
tioned
in the case of fvithington vs eve
leth  pick  the court said they
were satisfied that the power is given
to towns to determine and define the
limits of school districts can be execu
ted only by a geographical division of
the towo for that purpose a limita
tion of the district which was merely
personal was held invalid this same
principle was again recognized in per
ry vs dove  pick r  where
the says towns in executing
the power to form school districts arc
bound so to do it as to include every in
habitant in some of the districts they
cannot lawfully omit any and thus de
prive them of the benefits of our invalu
able system of free schools
the constitution the legislation and
the judicial decisions of massachu
setts have now been passed in review
wo have seen what is contemplated by
the equality secured by the constitu
tion we have seen also what is con
templated by the system of public
schools as established by the laws ol
the commonwealth and illustrated by
the decisions of the supreme court
the way is now prepared to considet
the peculiarities in the preseut case
and to apply the principle which w
have thus recognized in the constitu
lion in the laws and judicial decis
ions
iv the exclusion ot colored chil
dren from the public schools open tc
white children is a source of partial
inconvenience to them and their pa
rents toj which white persons are not
exposed and is therefore s violation
of equality the black and the whit
are not equal before tie law
ll appears from the etatement of facte
that among the rules of the primarj
school committee is one to this effect
scholars to go to the school neares
their residence application for ad
miesion to our ectioole with the excep
tion and provision referred to in th
proceeding rule are especially enti
tied to enter the schools nearest tbeii
residence the exception bore ii
of those for whom special provisioi
has beet made in separate schools
that is coloredchildren
in this rulewithout the exceptiot
right is of no sextruth is of no color
it seen a part of the beauty of our
public school system it is the boast
of england that justice through the
multitude of courts is brought to ev
ery mans door it may also be th
boast of our public school system
that education in boston through th
multitude of schools is brought to ev
ery white mans door but it is not
brought to every black mans door
he is obliged to go for itto travel
tor itoften a great distance the
facts in ths present case are not s
strong as those ot other cases which
have come to my knowledge but
here the little child only five yean
old was compelled if she went to the
nearest african school to go a distance
f  feet from her own dwelling
while the nearest primary school wa
only  feet and in doing this she
would pass near no less titan five dif
ferent primary schools forming pan
of our public and open to
white children all of which were clos
ed to her jsurely this is not equality
before the law
this simple fact ia enough to deter
mine this case if it be met by the
suggestion that the inconvenience is
trivial and such as the law will not no
tice  reply that it is precisely of that
character which reveals distinctly an
existing inequality and therefore the
law cannot fail to notice it there is
a maxim of the civilian duntoulin
whish teaches that oven n trivial fact
may give occasion to an important ap
plication of the law modica enim cir
cumstantia facti indued magnum juris
dirersitatim also from the best exam
ples of our history we learn that the
insignificance of a fact cannot obscure
the grandeur of the principal stake
it was a paltry tax on tea laid by a
parliament in which they were not rep
resented that aroused our fathers to the
struggles of the revolution they
did not feel the inconvenience of the
tax but they felt its oppression they
went to war for a principle let it not
be said then that the inconvenience is
so slight in the present case as not to
justify the appeal i now make in be
half of the colored children for equal
ity before the law
i tnay go however beyond the facts
in this case and show that the incon
venience arising from the exclusion ol
colored children is of such a charac
ter as seriously to effect the comfort
and condition of the african race in
boston the two primary schools
open to these children are in belknap
street and in sun court i need not
add that the whole city is dotted with
schools open to white children the
colored parents anxious that their chil
dren should have the benefit of educa
tion are compelled to live in the neigh
borhood of the schools to gather about
them as near the east people come
from a distance to rest near a fountain
or a well they have not practically
the srme liberty of choosing theii
homes which belong to the white man
inclination or business or economy
may call them to another part of tht
city but they are restrained on account
of their children there is no such
restraint upon the white man for he
knows that wherever in the city incli
nation or business or economy iiibj
call him be will find a school open t
his children near his door surel
this is not equality bofure the la
or if a colored person yielding t
the necessities of his position remove
to a distant part of the city his chil
dren may be compelled at an incon
venience which will not be called trivi
al to walk a long distance in order t
enjoy the advantages of the school
in our severe winters this cannot be
disregarded by children so tender in
years as those of the primary schools
there is a respectable colored person
am told who became same time since
a resident at east boston separated
by the water from the main laud
there are of course proper public
schools at east boston but none that
were then open to colored children
this person therefore was obliged t
send his children three in number
daily across the ferry to a distant af
rican school the tolls for these chil
dren amounted to a sum which formed
a severe tax upon a poor man
this is the conduct of a colored pa
rent he is well deservingof honoi
for his generous efforts for his children
as they grow in knowledge they will
rise and call him blessed but at the
same time they will brand as accursed
the arbitrary discrimination of coler
in the public school of boston which
rendered it necessary for their father
out of his small means to make such
sacrifices for tbeir education
such a grievance even independent
of any stigma from color calls for re
dress it is an equality which the con
stitution and laws of massachusetts re
pudiate but it is not on the ground
of inconvenience oaly that it is odious
and this brings me to the next point
v the separation of children in
the public schools of boston on ac
count of color or race is in the nature
of caste and is a violation of equali
ty
the facts in this case show express
ly that the child was excluded from the
school nearest to her dwelling the
number in the school at the time war
ranting her admission on the sole
ground of color the first majority
report presented to the school com
mittee to which reference is mnde in
the statement of facts gives with more
fulness the grounds of this discrimina
tion saying it is one of races not ol
tolar merely the distinction is one
which the almighty has seen fit to es
tablish sad it it founded deep ia the
rochester n v friday february  
physic mental and moral natures o
the two races no legislation no s
cial customs can efface this distinc
tion words more ajt than these t
describe the heathenish relation o
caste could not be chosen
this will be apparent from the verj
definition of caste this is bor
rowed from the portuguese word cotta
which signifies family breed race
it is in india that is is most often ap
plied it is there that we must go in or
der to understand its full force a re
writer or the subject
says that it is not only a distinct in
by birth but it is founded on the doc
trine of an essentially distinct origin i
the different races which are thus un
alterably separated itoberts ot
caste p  this is the ver
ground of the boston school commit
tee
but this word is not now applied foi
the first time to the distinction betweei
the white and black races alexandei
humboldt in speaking of the negrne
in mexico has characterized them a
a caste and a recent political and ju
ridical writer of france has used tht
same term to denote not only the dis
in india but those of oui
own igpntry charles comte traitt
de legislation tom  p  
in the course of his remarks he refer
to the exclusion of colored children
from the public schools as among the
humiliating and brutal distinctions by
which their caste is characterized it
is then on authority and reason that
we apply this term to the hereditary
distinction on account of color which
is established in the public schools ol
boston
it is when we see this discrimination
in this light that we learn to appreci
ate its true character the brahmins
and the sudras in india from genera
tion to generation were kept apart
if a sudra presumed to si upon a bra
mins carpet he was punished with
banishment it is with a similar inhu
manity that the black child who goes
to sit on the same benches at school
with the white child is banished not
from the country but from the school
in both cases it is the triumph of caste
but the offence is greater with us be
cause unlike the hindoos we ac
knowledge that men are born equal
to be continued
from the national standard
right op buffkege
citizens in addressing you in favor
of a disfranchised portion of the legal
taxpayers of new jersey i feel from
the success our enterprise has already
been crowned with that intelligence
humanity and justice may be styled
characteristics of the citizens of this
state
knowing then that i atn speaking
to an and humane people
who believe in that noble sentiment set
forth in the declaration of independ
ence that all men are created free
and equal c i take the liberty ot
speaking freelo to you being one of
the disfranchised and i do not believe
your hearts are so callous as not to
listen to the voice of the oppressed
although the above declaration de
clares that all men are created free
and equal those noble words in their
common acceptation do not and can
not apply to me disfranchised people
i am now speaking of because indi
rectly you deny the disfranchised are
men you say all men are created
free and equal and at the same time
you deny that equality which is noth
ing more nor less than denying our
manhood if we are not free and equal
according to the declaration of inde
pendence we are not men because
all men are created free and equal
we confess there is something about
this we never could understand we
are denied our rights as men at the
ame time are taxed in common with
yourselves and obliged to support the
government in her denunciations it
we are not men why are we dealt with
as such when we do not pay our taxes
or when we infringe the laws when
ever we become a delinquent in the
one or a transgressor in the other
there is then no question about our
manhood we are treated as men to
all intents and purposes if we are
men when our taxes are due and men
when we transgress the laws we are
men when our taxes are not due and
when we do not transgress the laws
there are many reasons why color
ed men should be enfranchised we
have been reared in this state and are
acquainted with her institutions our
fidelity to this country has never been
questioned we have done nothing to
cause our disfranchisement on the
contrary we have done all a people
could do to entitle them to be enfran
chised
it is said there is not sufficient in
telligence amongst us to warrant the
restoration of those rights and that
we are not sufficiently acquainted with
the government fee but they do no
say we have not sufficient intelligence
and knowledge of the government to
warrant us to pay our taxes because
we cannot thoroughly understand how
the money goes
if we who have elwaye been with
you do not understand something of
the regulations of tb country how
miserably ignorant are the thousands
of voters who arrive in this country
annually who know nothing of this
government and but little of any gov
ernment there to no just plee and
apology for you to shut every avenue
to elevation ad than complain ot de
gradation what eua can be expected
u fretm
while we are looked upon as things
and treated worse than unthinking
animals
in the reaolution colored soldiers
fought side by side with you in youi
struggles for liberty and thire is noi
a battlefield from maine to georgia
which has not been crimsoned by out
blood and whitened by our bones in
 a bill passed the legislature o

jackson called out colored troops from
louisiana and alabama and in solemn
proclamation attested to their fidelity
and courage
but sums of our enemies say we
had better go to africa we ask
why they say we cannot rise
in this country the prejudices are too
strong to be overcome that we had
better be kings am ing beggars than
beggars among kings as ueither ol
the positions is enviable we will not
quarrel about the beggarly or kingly
conditions we think thess titular
philanthropists who try to make the
people believe we can never rise in
this country and that money must be
raised by appropriation or otherwise
to expatriate us would do well to hold
their peacegive their extra change
to the pooremigrate to the countiy
of their forefathers as quickly as pos
sible and take their incendiary reports
along with them
they say this is not our country
we would ask who does it belong to
if this country is yours and was gain
ed by conquest then we are parliceps
criminis and are equally entitled to the
spoil
africa is urged upon us as the coun
try of our forefathers if this is good
sophistryand we think it will pass
then it follows that all men must go to
the country of their forefathers in this
case the blacks will go to africa and
the whites to europe and where will
the mixed races go we suppose in
such an event they would occupy the
intermediumihat is the mediterrane
an sea what would become of the
indians would they go to the coun
try of their forefathers if so where

any place the white man chooses to go

the country a man is born in is his

oppress a colored man for a white
mans sake is no humanity for us and
the man that will refuse to assist suf
fering humanity on account of color
i undeserving of the name of man

derstand and act as men we do not
need another mans ears lo enable us

restrains our reason by shutting up
the avenues for information and that
prevents us from passing certain ima
ginary lines to visit a sick mother or
a dying wife do transcend the proper
bounds of men and belie that noble
sentiment that declares all men are

our design in speaking frankly is
not to upbraid you but to show you

newcastle
on thursday evening the friends
and supporters of the antislavery move
ment rnet at the music hall in this
town at a public tea meeting to afford
mr brown the american fugitive slave
an opportunity of addressing them on
the subject of slavery and to present
him wiih a testimonial of their esteem
and regard between four and five
hundred sat down to tea the rev j
pringle was called to the chair he
congratulated the meeting upon the cir
cumstances under which they had met
having amongst them an indiv dual be
longing to a race of men who hid long
been unrighteously and cruelly oppres
sed he believed the cause they had
rnet to advocate was of the highest im
portance and intimately connected with
the moral and religious advancement of
society
the rev t pottenger participated
in the general feeling of satisfaction at
meeting mr brown on the present oc
casion and giving him a cordial wel
come although there were many
things in our own country which as a
patriot and a christian he deplored
one of the things that endeared it to him
was that it was the land of the free as
well as the brave all kinds of slavery
deserved universal censure but that
was the most outrageous which was
pa ronized and propped up by professing
christians
mr brown on rising was enthusi
astically cheered he fell thankful
especially to the ladies of this town for
the kind manner in which he had been
received as a representative of the
slaves of america long before be ar
rived in this country he had heard that
newcastle wds headquarters for anti
slavery in great britain and when he
returned he should follow in the foot
steps of others in giving his humble
testimony to their efforts not only in
behalf of the american slave but in
the cause of freedom throughout the
world he gave an account of the
rise and progress of the anti slavery
movement benjamin lundie a qua
ker was the first to raise the banner ol
freedom in america in the year 
and to advocate gradual emancipation
for the slave travelling through
massachusetts he became acquainted
with william lloyd garrison then a
printer about  years of age who as
sisted him in the management ofhtf
newspaper but garrison who took a
higher ground and advocated immedi
ate emancipation shortly after remo
ved to boston where by means of thr
press he first agitated the question h
then visited england and returned tc
america with that renowned champioo
of civil and religious liberty mrgeorgt
thompson who in spite of immenct
opposition aroused the attention of the
community to the enormities of the aye
tern mr brown then related the sub
sequent progress of the abolition move
meat down to the present time he
was himself indebted to the antislave
ry society tjf america for the positioc
he now occupied it was engaged to
employing such men aa frederick
douglass as lecturers in supporting
fugitive slaves end in creating a feel
ing which would eventually abolish
slavery altogether with the bible
for a textbook and england for thi
platform he had no doubt of the result
j much had hems already accomplish

gen taylors message to congress is
permitted to reach us in which the
treason to liberty of the ad
ministration is fullv exposed that
message which we publish today it
will be seen not only takes the cass
ground of nonintervention in relation
to the territories but goes against the
establishment of any territorial gov
ernment for new mexico which shall
include that part of that country to
which texas has set up an iuiquitous
and unfounded claim for the purpose
of extending slavery over it texas
if confined to her own proper limits is
six or seven times as large as the whole
state of new yorkvastly larger than
any one state ever should be permitted
to be and the additional territory she
now claims is larger than all new eng
land and includes the capital and best
settled portions of new mexico tex
as as sbe is must inevitably be divi
ded on account of her unwieldy size
as a state and the only possible object
of giving her more territory would be
to extend slavery where it otherwise
would not go
the new york tribune thinks to
admit california as a free state and to
leave the settlement of the slave ques
tion to the territories themselves is as
much as a louisiana planter could
he expected to concede indeed
so said the free soilers long ago and
they said it was all he probably would
cooceed and when they said that
gen taylors influence would be
thrown against the wiimot proviso
they were denounced for it but it is
now matter of record and all the lying
pretentions of the taylor papers about
his favoring the proviso are at an
end
but the tribune very well remarks
that although the message concedes as
much as a louisiana planter could be
expected to conoede it by no means
follows that it should satisfy north
freemen er their representatives
if texas ie allowed to her hi
country  p wul be to slavery
whole no 
remaining territories of new mexico
i ind eastern california then slavery
will be introduced there and become
astablished tliut when a state gov
ernment shall be framed the attempt to
exclude it will be unavailing m the
tribune well says in reference to this
question
new mexico is this day in m oent
peril of subjugation to slavey her
people are few scattered effeminate
and spiritbroken by conquest texas
can crush her in a month if secured
annuity in so doing withdrew from

of north latitude considerably further
north than it now has a tool hold in any
part of the union the swindling an
nexation resolves indeed hold out a
show of excluding slavery north of d
 but that is a deliberate fraud the
resolve only ays such slates as may
he formed out of territory north of d
m shall be free stales and tvxas
and her councilors will take precious
good care that no states shall be
formed in that way though she should
i be split iuto a dozen the triumph of
i texas in the pending struggle would
give to slavery a new domain larger
than jyeto england whereon there is
not now a slave and has not been these
twenty years there is nothing ab
stract theoretical conjectural about
this matter the triumph of
texas is the discomfiture
of freedom inevitabty the work
of freedom today is the preservation
of new mexico and to that every thing
else should give way
but the wilmot proviso is the per
manent medicine of the state the
grand heroic antidote for the civil
passions that most excite the national
rapacity and corrupt the national
heart give a proviso that there shall
nevermore be slavery in any territory
of the union and the south would
keep us carefully out of all wars of
aggression and conquest thereafter
we need that as guaranty of tranquii
ty a security against greediness for
all time to come nonintervention is a
play upon words for what
shall be the law of the territory in
question prior to any action on the sub
ject by its people may a slaveholder
take and legally hold his slaves there
if yes then you haqe slavery estab
lished under the name of noninter
vention if no then you have anti
slavery and in essence the wilmot
proviso why will grave men plav at
hideandseek with such terms as this
nonintervention
mr charles dickenss substi
tute for public execution
mr charles dickens has written a
second letter on public executions
his positions in reference to their de
moralizing nature he states to be
firstthat they chiefly attract as
spectators the most depraved of man
kind in whom they inspire no whole
some emotions whatever secondly
that the public infliction of a violent
death is not a salutary spectacle for
any class of people but that it is in the
nature of things that on the class by
whom it is generallywitnessed it
should have a debasing and hardening
influence these positions he sup
ports by his experience at the late
execution to prevent such spedacles

solemn form of certificate tod same in

crime such a murderer was banged in
their sight there should be another
certificate from the officers of the
prison that the person hanged was that

scervant jones
would any northern christian believe it
possible that a true disciple of him who came
to preach deliverance to the captive and the
opening of the ptison to the bound could as
sign aa a reason for wishing to sell forty hu
man beings a pious and benevolent desire to
be a missionary mr jones does this and
apparently in all sincerty slavery has blind
ed him
in the hope of seeming a purchaser he as
sures all who read that his forty servants are
mostly young and likely and rapidly increas
ing in number and value he thus virtually
claims the right to seize upon and hold as his
own every child jhat may be born to any ol
those whom he calls his servants and he pro
poses to transfer that right to the purchaser
of his human chattels yet he seems un
conscious that iii so doing he is giving the
highest sanction in his power to a practice
which the scriptures rank among the highest
crimesto manstealing slavery has blind
ed him
he takes credit to himself as being willing
to tell bia servants at a reduced price provid
ed the purchaser is a kind raaser lie has
probably uever thought of the question wheth
er it is possible for one who deals in mortal
men as merchandize to be kind and he seems
equally oblivious of the fact that whatever
may be the character of the buyer the per
sons bought may by his death or insolvency
speedily be thrown into other hands slavery
has blinded him

and that being brought under subjection anc

and been made sensible that a blessing is ir

righteousness few io numbers and wear
in human power we have passed through
baptism of trials and as we believe unde
divine guidance have been enabled to pam
through it unharmed and at a ibrraer meet

with gospel simplicity and truth recog
nizmg ourselves as members of the humai
family at large and children of one conmiui

alleviating the distresses and sufferings of ou
fellow men to the exient of our abilityam
of testifying against the wrengs and injuriei
inflicted by arbitrary power upon the unfortu
rate and helpless in all parts of the world
we rejoice to know that our feelings of com
miseration for these wrongs are deeply svm
petbised with by a large and increasing num
berof aincere hearted philanthropists who
fforts for their amelioration are an honor t
humanity regarding well jjiiecled efforts o
this nature with a waim approuai we are de
sirous of lending our aid to iheee measure
of christan benevolence w hich aim at tb
restoration of the rights of man and at th
raising up of the downtrodden image ot god
we are firm in the bslief that man must am

tbe oppressed millions of europe to throw oi
a portion of the weight of tvranny they fel
no longer able to endure they are agau
crushed to the earth we can do no mori
than pity their sad fate it is a strong cor
roboration of the truth of the testimony tha
they that use the sword shall perish by th
word we fed not to blame them they
will yet have better feelings and more en
lightened views in how clear a light do the
advantages with which we are surrounded
appear when contrasted with the sufferings
which are the portion of the great mass ol
the human family and it is earnestly to bt
desired that we may oe fully impressed with
tbe feeling of the responsibility that rests
upon us in view of these blessings if wt
are imbued with love to god and his children
can we monopolize those blessings to our
selves must we not feel the necessity ol
imparting them liberally to others may we
be concerned individually to look at ihw mat

or uninterested observers of the efforts made
towards reform in the religious worldhere
as io the nation at large has been great com
motion and here as there signs of improve

we have seen and felt that commotion in
our own society sud been made sensible that
some of the most cherished ties of friendship
have been partially broken but we feel that
the spirit of love still reigns and that al
though affi lilies may be weakened they are
not destroyed and e withhold not the hand
of christian fellowship from those whom
though not disunited with us in an outward
religious connection we ha ve never ceased

my dear fbiend you have asked m
for some account of my trip to boston ant
 avail my self of the first leisure moment sinct
my return to comply with your request
 had long desired to bo in boston during
one of their antislavery festivals but nevei
until this season had a convenient opportum
ty of realising my wish at the first open
ring of the meeting i must confess to somr
feeling of disappointment the place of as
setnbling was as you know faneoil hall
capacious edifice admirably adapted to largi
popular gatherings but illy suited for thi
business meetings of a comparatively loca
society one consequence was in this case
that the attendance though quite respectabli
tu nnmbers for the beginning of a meeting
appeared in the midst of so much unoccupiei
space to be discouragingly small added t
this was the meagre number of speaker
around the platform garrison whose pres
nee seems almost indispensable on such oc
c isions was confined at home by sickness
and it was said would probably not be abl
to attend any of the meetings tne foster
were absent as were also douglass re
mood w w brown c c burleigh am
others whose voices have been wont at time
like this to wake up the echoes of the ol
cradle of liberty then the atmospheri
temperature was at quite too low a figure fo
a good meeting i have never yet seen an
considerable degree of life or warmth in a
assembly where the temperature ranged muc
below  degrees fathrenheit

was samuel may jr an unpretending an
somew hat diffident man but one who by if
dignity of his manner and good sense an
pertinence of his remarks on this oecasioi
commanded general attention and made
wholesome impression he was followed t

who had been living in south carolina ti
about two years since when he wasconvicic
by a lynch court of being an abuliuonis
and of having attempted to teach some slavi
to read the bible and was adjudged for the
offences to be tarred and feathered and banisl

tence was duly executed mr edmunds p
idled his story with great e mphetty an
impressivners and was listened to by tf
audience with marked manifestations of syn
paihy parker pdlsbury and wendell phi
lips successively followed mr taking h

outrage as an admirable comment on the valt
of our union and the character of our coi
federates and such a torrent of scorchinj
scathing indignation as they gave utterance i
on this occasion  have rarely had the priv
lege of hearing the audience seemed to t
in general sympathy with the speakers ar
with slight exception sustained them wit
manifestations of their approval
but it was not until the next daythe set
ond day of the meetingthat the ball wj
fairly opened by this time the feelings
the people began to rise toward bloodhea
the seats in the body of the hall were gei
erally occupied while many persons stood i
the aisles new speakers also came upo

of defending the fiee soil party whiett i
the course of the discussions had been severe

the old pioneer societyhe had been fc

and was proud to cooperate in its ranks bsi
at the same time be fell at liberty to act wit
t tbe free soil party and gave some of hi
reasons for so doing these reasons seemei
to be satisfactory to a number of peisons whi
stood in the outskirts of the meeting am
who testified their approval in the usual way
but they elicited no especial rejoinder iron
those to whom they were more particular
directed christopher list formerly of phil

he bore high testimony to the antislaver
character and efficiency of win lloyd gurrt

the article from the christian citizen
to which our correspondent at johnston r
 refers was inserted in our paper during
our absence from home its highly compli
mentary character was not the reason for its
insertion in the north star it is the custom
of our publisher when we are absent on sn
antislavery tout to copy notices of our labora
from other papets the notice from the
christian citizen is but one of the many that
have appeared in the north star from time to
time ii cannot be expected of us to explain
the reaaona for the different kinds of notices
called forth by our speeches our anti
slavery position is we hope pretty well un
derstood at least among abolitionists we
can only say that on all occasions we bear
i an unequivocal testimony against a proslavery
church a slaveholding government and tbe
blood stained union of these states this
we do in such language ss we are able to
command and which in our judgment seems
best ealculated to convince jhe minds and to

should be brought before the entire nation
that time has now arrived not withstand
jag that the slaveholders of the sooth will

schemes with a view to stay the progress o
these opinions and principles and in fortify

 of heaven we can say with one of old
truly the lord is with us this dread
ed agitation so feeble in its commencement
now rocks the land from end to end thr
vexed question of slavery has forced itse
into the councils of the nation and like the
rod of the hebrew deliverer ii has swallower
i up all other topics scarcely a day har
passed since the meeting of the present con
t gress but that the baled subject has been thr
 theme of fiery discourse our entire ex
change comes to us laden with leaders ant
speeches on this once obscure and strictly
avoided topic the public mind has reaohec
a point of interest and excitement unprece
denied the sout hdemands the extensior
of slavery into ihe new terriiories while
the north sternly insisis upon its exclusion
but words pass on borh sides and the wave
r of agitation rise higher and higher it is ai
j this juncture that the cifty clay with his
characteristic temper and skill has thrown
himself on the turbid waters of debate he
comes as he is wont to do with that soft and
gentle diction and in that spirit of concilia
tion and compiomise for which he has been
 so long and so highly distinguished he
wishes as usual to revive the expiring em
bers of to soothe all asperities
to allay all sectional jealousies and to knit
j the nation into a firmer bond of union he
has presented a stung of resolutions to the
senate for the purpose to use his own lan
guage of making an amtcable arrange
i tnent of all questions in controversy between
fae free and the slave states growing out oj
the subject of slavery this object it must
be admitted is a comprehensive one and it
displays no small ambition that any one man
should essay to accomplish it but let this
pass v ill he succeed is the question we
think not the plan which mr clay pro
poses like all southern compromises gives
everything to liberty in words and secures
everything to slavery in deeds he is most
generous in giving away that which he does
not possess but is never betrayed into the
weakness of bestowing that which he has the
power to retain the first resolution of his
compromise goes the enormous length of pro
pping the admission of california into the
union without forcing her to open her golden
j domain to the foul and corrupting system o
what s magnificent concession is
here ought not every northern man to
bow with grateful emotion to the magnani
mous man by whom it is proffered this
liberal and generous concession to be fully
appreciated must be viewed in the light of
certain notorious facts the first fact is that
i california has already with singular unani
raity adopted a constitution which excludes
i for ever the foul system of bondage from her
borders the next fact is that she has
already received from the present adminis
tration of the united states goverument es
pecial marks of its approbation another
fact is with the growing population of cali
fornia her vast extent and boundless wealth
she is of herself sufficiently strong to com
mand respect witnout asking the favor ol
any and ihe last and most important fact ol
all is that the north has the disposition and
power to admit her into the union with oi
without the generous compromise so nobly
and complacently presented by that father ol
compromise henry clay mr clays
proffered liberality is about as noble as that
of a highwayman who when in the power
of a traveller and on his way to prison pro
poses a consultation and offers to settle the
unhappy difficulty which has occurred be
tween himself and the latter by accepting
the half of the contents of his purse assur
ing him at the same time that if his pistol
had not missed fire he might haye possessed
himaelt of the whole this assuming to
concede as a mark of liberality the right of
a state to enter this union without being
compelled to have the foul curse of slavery
fastened upon her would be about as ridicu
lous as it is disgraceful but that the slight
est token of concession on the part of the
south to the north is hailed by so many
doughfaces with marks of humble gratitude
the impudence of slaveholders exceeds ev
erything they talk abont the rights
of slavery just as if it were possible for
slavery to have rights the right to intro
duce it into the new territories the constitu
tions right ac shame on such insolent
pretensions slavery has no arohrs it is
a foul and damning outrage upon ail rights
and has no right to exist anywhere in or out
ol the territories the earth is the lords
and righteousness should cover it and
be who concedes any part of it to tha intro
duction of slavery is an enemy to god an
invader of hn dominion and a rebel against
bis government
the next resolution of mr clay adopts
practically the nonintervention doctrine so
oniverstlly held up to ridicule by the whig
press of th north as the offspring of tbst
prince of sycophants gen cass they are
tokwa j
resolved that the western boundary of the
stsie of turn ought to bo fixed on the rio
i del norte commencing one marine league
from it mouth tod running up that river t
the southern line of new mexico thence
with that tine eastwardly and oo continuing
i in the mow direction to the line established
between the united siatee end spain ex
cluding any portion of new mexico wbethei
lying on the earn or weet of that river
resolved that it be pioposed to the state
of texas that the united states will provide
i foi the payment of all that portion of the
r legitimate and bona jfcfe public debt of that
state contracted prior to its annexation b
the united slates and for which the duties
on foreign imports were pledged by the said
r state to its ciditor not exceeding the sum
of in consideration of the raid duties
so pledged having been no longer applicable
to that object after the aaid annexation bu
 taving thenceforward become payable to tht
i united states and upon the condition also
u t the state of texas shall by some aol
j ema and authentic act of her legislature n
of a convention relinquish to the uniteo
states any claim which it has to any part ol
new mexico
no comments on the foregoing resolutions
 are needed from us we put them on record
j merely as links in the chain of this compio
b lt will be seen that mr clay does
not concede the justice of the claims which
b texas has recently set up for a large portion
k of new mexico so far so good
e tne fifth and siith resolutions are as fol
low
a
resolved that it is inexpedient to abolish
slavryin the district of columbia while
that institution continues to exist in the stale
o ol mjry land without the consent of that state
p wiihoqji the consent of the people of the
ditrict and without just compensation to the
ownets of slaves within thu district
but revolved that it is expedient to
prohibit within the district the slavetrade
e iu slaves brought into it from states or places
f beyond the limits of the district either to bt
sold therein as merchandize or to be trans
e ported to other markets without the distiict
d of columbia
 if the abolition of slavery is to depend
 upon the assent of the slaveholders of mary
e lajad and the other contingencies specified ii
iacaay to see that slavery la the district ol
columbia cannot be reached until the lasi
j vestige of slavery has disappeared from tht
state of maryland when that event lakes
place there will be no necessity for compio
mise and so far as these resolutions hav
e any bearing at all their effect will be to cloj
the wheels of emancipation
it what is said about abolishing the slave
a trade in the district of columbia is a mere
n rum since the slavetraders of maryland can

the seventh resolution in the series is at

n hardened as we have had reason tq believi
n mi clay to be and inconsistent as he alwayi
s is we scarcely expected such a resolution
e from him as the foregoing at this time ant
k in sucli a connection when the sympathy
s of the nation has by his eloquence and tha
 of others just been wrought up to the great
t est intensity for the hungarian fugitives from
g oppression that he should propose such i
e resolution at suck a time for hunting dowi
e fugitives in out own land whd are fleeing
s from a bondage and tyranny far more terrible
 than that of austria is almost as shocking ti
e our sense of propriety as i
n is revolting to our moral perceptions of rig h
t and wrong
 b ut we give mr clays eighth and las
 resolution that the reader may judge for him
 soil as to the benefit which freedom will de
s live from this mis named compromise t
v us the whole seems like the handle of a
t jugall on one side
t resolved that congress has no power it
prohibit or obstruct the trade in slavestaiweer
the tlaveholding states but that the admia
 sion or exclusion of slaves brought from om
i into another of them depends eiclusivelj
l upon their own particular laws
this resolution declares what is not true
if there be any meaning in words the con

faroe rick douglass ln the north star
of the ihjnst  find a petition to qaeen
victoria from the women of ireland and also
a letter from belfast to thyself janat thou
spare a little space for a few remarks upon
them
none can regret more than i that the
treaties between brazil and spain respect
ively and giest britain for the abolition ol
the african slave trade have not been fulfilled
by the people of the former countries and 
would rejoice if the british government
could adopt some pacific measures to accom
plish this grand object but ido not believe
that any measure which does not strike at the
root of slavery itself can ever destroy the
slavetrade one of the fundamental princi
plea of the british and foreign antislavery
soicety is thus expressed that so long
as slavery exists there is no reasonable pros
pect of the annihilation of the slavetrade ano
of extinguishing the sale and barter of bumai
beings dtc i believe this a great tiuih
which should be kept constantly in view by
every laborer in the antislavery cause
it is well known that the combined fleet
of great britain france and the uniteo
slates have not only tailed to put down th
african slavetrade but have actually in
creased its horrors the women of ireland
in their petition implore the quecn to re
quire her ministers to adopt such meajurts a
they shall deem requisite to enforce the fulfil
inent of the solemn treaties with spain por
ugal snd brazil for the total abolition of thu
nefarious traflße ac thy belfast corre
spondenl acknowledges that many peison
refused to sign the petition because they
considered its language too strong and at
indicating the propriety of a resort to wariikt
measures this she says we shoulo
regret as much as they provided the grealei
evil can be removed without resorting to so
dreadful an alternative
it is evident from this language in connec
tion with this petition that the signers con
template war against the offending nations
at least as an alternative in case other meas
ures fail will not american abolitionists
geneially regret that their warmhearted and
benevolent irish sisters should for a singh
moment sanction the unchristian dogma thai
the end justifies the means
i like much better than this the memoria
to the queen recently circulated in england
and now awaiting with  signatures ol
british women a suitable opportunity foi
presentation after portraying the oonlinuec
atrocities of the slavetrade these petitioner
say but while respectfully directing theii
majestys attention to the spaniards and bra
zilians as the immediate perpetrators of tht
crime we cannot conceal from ourselves tht
fact that the late enormous increase of tht
slavetrade has been coincident with the in
creased consumption of slave produce in ihit
country the sugar act was passed ii
 and the results are before the world
t hut the good and evil how fearfully dispru
i purtionale there has been a plentiful sup
ply of cheap sugar in the markets of ihi
country and an increase in the slavetrade o
more lhan three hundred thousand souls pei
annum to produce it but are we so dead t
feeling as to desire that the homes of africs
should be ravaged to add to the luxuries of i
british teatable breathes there a womai
in our land who would have her own cuj
sweetened by throwing gall into ihe cup of i
fellowcreature we are aware that it u
difficult to apply a remedy to evils which pre
vail in countries beyond the jurisdiction o
great britain but we earnestly pray tha
every legitimate and peaceful means may b
resorted to on the part of your majestys go
vernuient to enforce on the governments o
brazil and spain fbe fulfilments of theii
solemn engagements by which they art
bound riot to permit another cargo of negroei
to be landed on their shores and to give lib
erty to all those slaves who have been unlaw
lully introduced and as nothing can bt
more clear than that slavery is sustained b
 the purchase of its productions we propost
for ourselves an immediate and widespreac
abstinence from the slave productions of cubi
aud brazil and in this we venture to hop
for the high sanction of your majestys ex
ample and that you will be graciously pleased
to exclude these productions from the roya
household
permit me again to refer to the belfast pe
tition in reference to the fact that the sum
of  was paid by great britain tv
obtain the treaties for the abolition of the
slavetrade the petitioners testify their eagei
desire to have the bargain which their
fathers and brothers paid for scrupulously
enforced perhaps the ladies would be
startled if they were told that they them
selves and their fathers and husbands are
now paying the brazilians and cubans for
committing the identical act of which their
petition complains yet such is undoubtedly
the fact
agpin the petitioners wish these un
grateful nations spain and brazil may be
practically taught without further delay that
the british people will not submit to dis
graceful fraud this sounds like a noble
determination but what does it mean
heretofore the british people and the irish
 have made themselves parties to this
disgraceful fraud by purchasing its fruits
thus giving ibe immediate pcipetrators the
inducement to commit it have they now
determined to cease this guilty connection
sod no longer submit to be participants with
those brazilians snd cubans who disregard
ing alike the laws of their own governments
and the treaties with great britain continue
to putchaee those foully wronged and per
secuted people the victims of the african
slavetrade tor the purpose of supplying the
people of great britain and ireland with
cheap sugar and coffee i fear their lan
guage will not justify an affirmative answer
on the contrary it would seem bat rather
than banish this sugar and coffee from their
table and thus peacefully contribute to effect
the object of their petition they would be
willing to resort to the dreadful aileron
tive of overwhelming the people of brazil
and cubathe guilty and innocent alike
with the cruelties and miseries of war

tfc aaaaai meeting of the massed
u ailmliwjr society
we copy with pleasure from tha libera
tor the following resolutions adopted st the
recent meeting of the old pioneer society
they are well draws and instinct with light
nd life
resolved ttst surprised as we are at the
simplicity of the northern press and north
ern members of congress to urging so in
cessantly upon southern disuhmmisi that
heir course will defeat their object since in
tne l mon and under the constitution is the
ony security for the permanence and quiet
enjoyment of slave property we are still more
disgusted st the unblushing impudence with
which these same ediurs and politicians rise
i rum their servile knees m ask of ihe abuli
tionists the suppoit of that very instrument
which they have just proved tuba the cor
nerstone of bondage and a eomlort to the
oppressor
resolved that we look upoo it as one
source of rejoicing even in the atrocious sys
tem of slavery that the agitation for its ovar
ihrow seems destined to waken to life the
torpid conscience of the nationto quicken
its sense of justice and to recall pure religion
 the desecrated temples and whited sepul
chres which have so long passed lor its
shrine
resolved that one chief reason why we
enter our lebuke against ihe chubch is that
having so long scattered the seeds of retorm
she sits still now that the fields arc white for
the harvest that she disowns the principles
which have sprung from her bosom brands
hem as infidel and gathers into her fold those
nmid sheep whom she can still govern lest
hey be corrupted by the running to and
iro and mcteaso of knowledge which her
prophets have foretold that claiming to have
on her bi east plate of righteousness sue re
luses to have anything tu do with the battle
claiming to hold the sword of the spirit she
keeps it nicely sheathed while other men
contend tor the faith once dehveisd to the
saints and in view of these facta we pro
nounce her claim to be the church of christ
tu uije blasphemy
resolved hat in view of the antislavery
progress ot the past year it must be matter
of surprise to all coming time ihat in a nation
prung from english and puritan ancestry
ihe political arena should he the first to
iwaken to its duty on a great moral question
ind that an agitation like that of amislavery
should owe its progress and suocess far mure
to the forum than the pulpit to theselfish
broils and timeserving motions at washing
ton than to those who assume to fill the pul
pus of cooper and mahew and to teach the
gospel of christ
resolved that we look on the present
session of congress as the most useful since
the organisation ot the government and con
sider its character the result not only of u
virtue and independence of a tew leading
minds there but of that awakened public
opinion of the tree states of which wasb
mgton is but the echo and this conviction
gives fresh animation to the zeal with which
we set ourselves again to the work of re
educating a corrupt and besotted people
resolved that we seek a dissolution of
this uuiou first as a measure of individual
duly  cease from sustaining a great evil
secondly to secure free action and expression
lor that degree ot antislavery feeling which
even now exists in the nation and which is
either soothed by the pride cajoled by ihe
professions or intimidated by the power of
ihe great national parlies and seels thirdly
by abstaining irom all guaranties lu the mas
ter to leave ihe balance even between ihe two
races fourthly to bring closer to the south
ern conscience the indignation and moral re
buke of the age now contused and restrained
by a fusion of these states and lastly to
bring to bear on the institution of slavery
hose principles of the relative value of free
and slave laboiof ihe unchangeable connec
tion of national prosperity wnh popular pro
gress and ihe elevation of ihe masses winch
has swept chaiteiisro tfom europe and will
put an end it here whenever the break
water of this union which now shields the
oulh from their reach is removed
resolved that in the lamented death of
david ruggles we mourn the list of an
early active sagacious and persevering friend
i the antislavery causeof oiih whose
professional ability makes his decease a public
loss and whose position and success wete
doing much to weaken the cruel prejudice
against colorof one whose career proves
the power of individual intellect and eiiergy
in making their way under the most trying
disadvantages of race and position and of
personal infirmity and ill health and that we
commend ihe con inet and character of dr
ruggles to the study of a pro slavery com
munity as evidence of the vigor of a race
borne down by so many burdens and to uni
colored frieuds as a model the imitation of
which cannot fail to secure their elevation
and improvement
kicoived i hat it is with deep regret we
perceive that the poet longfellow has prmti
ruled his fine poetical genius to eulogize the
bloodstained american union as freighted
with the hopes and interests of humanity as
being a noble ship invulnerable to the rock
and proof against the storm built in the most
skilful and workmanlike manner whereas

monstrates it to have been

tnr following is a short but happy and
and complete reply to the brilliant hallucina
tions of carlyle on the subjeet of west
india emancipation and the character of the
negro population of thoee islands the il
luminated madcap carlyle should blush in
view of his effort to create contempt and
hatred towards a people who have already
suffered the greatest inflictions ever imposed
on any race by pride selfishness and cru
eltyr t
from the british antishivery reporter
mr cailyle whose anglogerman cru
dities and mystified philosophies have so
tickled the fancies or heated the imaginations
of not s few amongst us as almost to create
a school hss recently so far diverged from
his usual course as to inflict upon the reading
world an occasional discourse on the ne
gro question the most salient parts of which
will be found in another part of the reporter
d this production proceeded from any
other pen than carlyles we should have
allowed it to puss in ailence but because it is
attributed to him it must forsooth be no
ticed now what is the staple of his die
course stripped of its inflated verbosity
and pul into plain english it affirms that the
emancipated slaves of the british colonics are
an idle and inferior race of men whom qud
hascreated to be tbe servants or slaves of white
men who in ihe enjoyment of their freedom
are content to live oc pigs food that
providence designed them to grow sugar and
cojfce sod spices for the rest of the world in
stead of shaping out their own course and
hat if their be no other means of seeurinr
this the whip must be employed to compel
these indolent two legged cattle to produce noble elements of cinammon sugar coffee black pepper and grey for their born lords in the meantime before the beneficent whip and the wholesome state of slavery can be restored our philosophic teacher suggests that not a square inch of soil in those fruitful isles purchased by british blood shall any black man
hold to grow pumpkins for him except 
terms that are fair to bn tian that is not j
pumpkin quashee not a square yard of soi
till you agree to do the state so many days oi
service in this strain the profound car
lyleas be is styled raves on to reply ti
him would be simply to reopen the question
which the common sense and common con
science of mankind have lone ago settled
that the slaveholders of the united states
brazil and the spanish colonies will a ware
him an ovation there can be no doubt bui
that the sensible portions ot mankind will si
tach any importcnce to his oracular utter
ances we can ot for a moment to believe
so far aa the emancipated classes in th
biiish colonies are implicated m this dis
course we beg ty say that mr carlyle
delineation f them ia perfectly untrue anr
we shall be much surprised if he do not fin
more than his match in some of the black
quashees of whom he affects to speak will
such lordly disdain the negroes in thi
british colonies are free no will they evei
be reenslaved mr carlyle and the wes
india bodythat part of them at leastwhon
he so perfectly representsto the conlrar
notwithstanding they will cultivate sugar
or coffee qr pumpkins as it may please them
for masters or for themselves as they may
choose but they will be no longer coerced ti
do either a sounder philosophy than thai
inculcated hy mr catlyle will be found in iht
opinion expressed by sir charles grey the
present governor of jamaica whu says in
one of hit latest despatches the negroe
appear to me to be generally as free from re
bellious tendency turbulent feelings anti
malicious thoughts as any race of laboiers 
ever saw or heard of my impression is
indeed that under m system of perfectly fan
dealing and of real justice they will comen
be ao admirable peasantry and yeomanry
ablebodied industrious and hardworking
frauk and welldisposed hitherto they
have not had justice done to them they havt
not been fairly dealt with yet amidst alt th

surrender ot fugitive slaves
the readers of the north star have al
ready seen the bill introduced into the
united states senate by mr mason of vir
ginia providing for the recapture of fugitiv
slaves the subject was again brought up
before that body on the th ult and furlhei
considered we give below a few extracts
from the speech of mr mason together with
the amendment offered by mr setvard ol
this state on the presentation of thi
amendment hangman foote got the floor
and be s pane rod mr seward all over with hit
wordy indignation and contempt mr sew
ard look no notice of his windy assailant
altogether the best course with such an op
ponentf n
here are the extracts from mr mason
speech
what are the provisions of the fundamen
tal law ir the fuuith article of the consti
tiou there are two clauses providing for tin
extradition of certain classes of persons es
caping from one slate to anotherclause
that lie in juxtaposition conceived at th
same time and written upon the same page
and each of them i submit not only to
senators but to the worldeach of them
plain distinct unequivocal in its import and
the ends designed to be attained now sir
even should t succeed though in a plain and
humble manner to direct the attention of th
country to the existing state of things n
relation to these clauses of the constitution
and not startle these people into rebellion
against the government of their own stales
this law if passed will remain i am afraid
a dead letter npoe your statutebook as th
present law is it is provided in the fourth
article of the constitution as fellows
a person charged in any state with
treason felony or other crime who shall flee
from justice and be found in another state
shall on demand of the executive authority
of ihe state from which he fled be delivered
un to be removed to the state having juris
dicton of the crime
this is the first clause of extraditiona
clause operating in all the statesmade foi
benefit of all the states and each of the
stites is alike interested in having it exe
cited
wnat is the other clause
no person held to service or labor in one
state under the laws thereof escaping to
another shall in consequence of any law oi
regulation therein be discharged from such
service or labor bet shall be delivered up on
the ilaim of the party to whom such service
or labor may be due
clauses sir having a kindred purpose
the one designed to effect the surrender ot
lugilives from justice the other designed to
effect the surrender of fugitives from labor
each clause imperative upon the governmem
framed under that constitution and upon th
states who are parties to it but this latter
clause mr presijent which provides for the
extradition of fugitives from labor is a clause
that accrues to the benefit of some of the
states and not to all it accrues to ihe ben
efit of those who unhappily are now in the
minoritya minority not in the number ot
slates but a minority in the number of the
people the slaveholding states air are
alone interested in the faithful and proper ex
ecution of this second clause for extradition
and we are to look to the majority to execute
that law against which their people havi
been for more than a quarter of a century in
revoltay sir in revolt i think lam war
ranted then in the apprehension expiessed
that no law which can lie passed by the con
gress of the united slates w ill sfford the
remedy which this law is intended to supply
unless it is sustained and supported by iht
people to whom it is addressed
sir let me present another view of this
question the clause which i have read
was intended upon the faith and honor of all
the statesto secute to the owners of these
fugitives from labor the surrender of auch
fugitives when they escaped into othei
stales this is not the only law of the
consulution bearing upon slave properly
far from it these very stales now non
slavehuldiug states when they became par
tial to that compact not only with their eyes
open and their interests awakened conceded
to the slaveholding states important privi
leges and advantages but for which they de
rived ample equivalents these veiy people
who are now so sensitive to freedomwhose
unwilling ears will not bear the name of slave
these very people negotiated upon the basil
of stave property and received ample consi
deration for the privileges we now vainly in
voke why sir they yielded to the south
ern states a repiesentaiion based upon tbit
property they did more sir they agreed
by this compact to withdraw from the con
trol of congress altogether for twenty years
the right to prohibit the introduction of slaves
from abroad and they went further anti
bound themselves under the solemn stipula
tions of the instrument that when slaves es
caped from ooe state to another they should
be delivered up and for this and every con
cession they received most ample equivalents
they received that equivalent alluded to bj
the senator who sits before me the senatoi
from south carolina mr btitltaj the
substitution of an ordinary majority for a
majority of two thirds in all laws affecting
commerce and navigation and many of then
received still mere extraordinary equivalent
ia a concession to all the states whatevei
their aise may be of en equality of repre
sentation in this body ooe of the greatest
difficulties that stood in the way of those whe
framed tbit instrument was the demand upor
the part of the eastern states or many ol
them at least for an equality of representa
tion in the senate and not only was lhi
equality conceded but the further securitj
was given that such equality should not im
destroyed by any future amendment to lh
constitution without the consent of the state
to be affected by it
he again sets forth the rights of slave
holders aa follows
now mr president what are the right
secured by the constitution to the ipastei
whose slave escapes from his service into an
other state desiring sir to be very sc
curate upon this subject i have written dowi
what i understand to be the right of the
owner in the recapture of a fugitive slave
within the limits of any and every state ui
ihe union
mr m here read from a paper as follows
the constitution of the united stale
secures to the master the same right of pr
perty in his slave and to be enjoyed and ex
ercised to the saim extent and with the same
incidents when thj slave escapes to another
state which he held in the state from which
he fled so fat as recapture is concerned
he may take him wherever he is found by
virtue of ownership and without any war
rant or other process in law
none has a right to interpose between thr
claimant and the fugitive or to inquire whe
the slave be his or whether he is a slave at
all far less to molest or hinder him in the
capture
he may enter peaceablv any enclosure or
dwelling where such slave may be found tor
the purpose of taking him and this witheut
committing a trespass
he raav use whatever force may be neces
sary to eff ct the capture without committing
hereby a breach of the peace and if forct
e offered by the slave or others he mat
iesist it to any extent that may be necessity
to secure the possession of his property
these rights and this authority are incident
to the rights of property attd the law of tltr
constitution secures the owner in the exer
cise of them against any hostile law of the
state to which the slave may flee should
such law be
the constitution does not confer these
rights they are antecedent to the constitu
tion and arise as incidents to property undet
ihe laws of the slate whence the slave es
capes they have their sanction in the law
if the domicil
the constitution however as the supreme
lw recognizes thss right of property and
iarrtes its obligation and its incidents for all
ihe purposes of reclamation into every state
in the union and makes the law of the
lomicil quo ad hoc the law of every state
in the union
mr seward gave notice that he would at
ihe propei time move the following amend
ment to the bill viz strike out all after the
enacting clause and insert the following

to reply that whether her coming in her
with a colored man would dissolve the union

of laughter which the speaker could with
difficuly repress sir let me tell gentlemen
in perfect seriousness and candor that i have
a deep and abiding conviction derived from
letters addressed to me fiom various quartets
and from my own knowledge of the effects ui
this slavery agitation that the cnutse we are
pursuing in that direction we shall all of ua
find reason when per ha pa it shall be too late
to regret i do not believe air that there ia
anv want ot patriotism here but  do believe
that there is a want of a proper appreciation
and conviction of existing and impending
danger and i do hope air that we shall
not have mias mott and what ia the other

men about him under a burst ol laughter at
the phrase other man tom iatt he

abolitionism this individual who writes to

am  prepared to say that he will not m thie
hall with himself as chairman and mias molt
aa secretary reecho sentiments on this slave
ry question akin to those ot certain gentlemen
herebut not thank god to me
the speaker here asked to be allowed to
state the application the chair understood
mr burleigh to be a gentleman who had lec
tured extensively on slavery and on the
subject of peace a voice on what l on
the subject of peace he was expected here
tomorrow and the church where he was ex
pected to lecture being engaged the use ol
this ball wa asked for that mr burleiuli
might lecture on slavery if it was the
wish of the citizeus of aibany to hear a lec
ture on peace also they would piobably be
gratified
mr monroe sir i am very glad to hear
that he ptoposes to lecture on peace slave
ry i propose to lecture on myself ligh
ter sir i should be veiy glad to have the
gentleman from orleans mr burroughs
go in and hear that lecture on peace laugh
ter he told us the other day on this floor
that if the question ever came to be one ol
slavery or peace he desired no peace i hope
sir lie will go in and listen to the lecture on
that subject
mr burroughs interposed the gentle
man did notcorrectly state ins language

upon it that i shall give him an early oppor
tunity to withdraw them
mr burroughs did not withdraw one

the speaker called to order
mr monroe had no doubt he was out of
order for he was speaking on behalf of the
union
the speaker the question is on granting
the use ot the hall
mr monroe i understood the speaker
to say that the lecture was to be on the sub
ject of slavery or peace and i was stating
that on the subject of slavery  propose to
lecture myself
mr l yv smith moved that the use of
the hall be granted to the gentleman to deliver
a lecture on slavery laughter
mr monroe the gentleman need not
trouble himself i am obliged to him but my
constituents have made it entirely unnecessa
rymy constituents have given me a seat
here m constituents who have an abiding
attachment to the constitution and who are
in favor of the unionihey sent me here 
have a right speak without any special
permission i have only to say that  have
confined mysell to the resolution as far as
possible i hope me use of this hall will not
be granted except for purposes connected
with legislation in which all of ua take an
interest i am opposed to granting the use ol
this hall for all purposes and esperially for
the purpose of allowing mus mott and my
friends friend to lorrn a union here laugh
ter
mr l w smith said that such applica
tions were not unusual a few days since
the use of the hall was granted to an agent of
 the colonization society last year to a color
ed lecturer on slavery this hall was the
property of the people and the spirit of our
institutions favored the dissemination of light
and truth the gentleman was mistaken if
he supposed he could change this practice it
j seemed to be the drill of the gentleman from
new york to alarm the house with a dread of
the action of the south and seemed to have
seized the occasion of this simple motion to
grant the use of the hall to an individual ot
whom he knew nothing he hoed leave
would be granted the precedent haa been
established and it was now too late to dta
i criminate

wo give the following extract from a
letter of our esteemed friend gerrit smith
published in the liberly party paper it
respects the recent general antislavery
convention at syracuse we insert it with
much pleasure as an act of justice to him
in view of our strictures on his course in
that convention
thu morning of the second day  brought
a chatge against mr foster he convinced
me that it was false i expressed my re
i gretat having brought it and fullv rettacied
it  have no doubt that mr ster was
rightalthough the president and every one
ot the many with whom  spoke on the sub
ject had understood him as  had but we
were mistaken mr foster whom  believe
to be a man of truth knew his own wotds
and their intended meaning better than we
did
the evening of the second day  offered
two resolutionsfeeling just aa liee to offer
them as it i had been in a liberty paity con
vention at that lime i neither asked nor
as my noble brother douglass has it de
manded the vote of either the convention
or the assembly upon them i confess how
ever that immediately after i had com
down from the desk to my seat i did join in
the call of many voices for the vo e of the
assembly  confess too that  knew that
the enrolled members alone had the right n
vote but the great assembly evinced mud
eagerness to vote w hy should it not b
graified i confess moreover hat i war
curious lo know how that large company ol
whigs and democrats be sjc viewed
my resolutions  over and oved again sairi
that the vote of the assembly would not be
the vote of the convention and that the
convention would be to no extent responsi
ble lor it that this vote can he defended by
paliamentary or other rules is not to be claim
ed it waa an irregular proceeding and i
at all blameworthy  do not disown my shut
of tbs blame
the morning of the third day mr pills
bury made a speech i was charmed will
ita beauty and vigor there waa however
a passage in it which was exceedingly offeu
sive toliberty party men  rose and pro
tested against tt instead however of re
uacting it he said to me if the cap fin
you you can wear it i should not hav
risen but that i supposed mr ptllsburv in
tended to abuse and insult us liberty ratty
men  have since been assured by mr
may and mr burleigh that he intended im
such thing and that tie was only expressing
iu strong and figurative language bis cunvtc

said in it to irapogn the raotivee of any friend
of the american antislavery societynot
one word to call in question his sincere devo

referring to the report of the treasurer aaya
that the receipts of the society for the past
year have been  including  from
ihe late bazaar the disbursements were

is a long document ai d goes at length into
all the subjects usually diacussed
the pioceedings of congress are first ta
ken in hand the inauguration of president
taylor is termed the induction of the slave
power into the seat of government in te
gard to the present alaveholding speaker of
the house the report says it is a cuiioua
instructive fact that in the composition of
c mmitteea mr cobb has given more weight
to the antislavery element of the house than
was done by his northern piedecessor
the free soilets ae alluded to and their
earlv dissolution predicted ihe political unions
i i massachusetts and new york are spoken
of as fruitless in their results and the free
democracy is severely rapped for allowing
the defeat of mi palfrey who the report
says is the righiful head of the political par
ty opposed to slavery the fact is stated
that for eleven years an escaped slave has not
been recaptured in massachusetts and this is
attributed to the antislavery agitation
fugitive slaves our readers will re
member the last great contest over a man
claimed as a fugitive from slavery before
judge edmunds of this cay the slave was
arrested by a mr lee rum maryland with
out piecept and gagged and chained and
would have been taken out of the stale had
not mr lee been stopped by the arm of our
state law the slave so called wan brought
before his honor judge edmonds on habeas
corpus and discharged on the ground that
mr lee could not prove that maryland was a
slaveholding state he proved that he had
held him as a slave but failed to prove that
such holding was authorized by the law of
maryland it appears from the following
that the slate is taking up the case
important movement a resolution
passed the house ot delegates yesterday au
thorizing the attorney general of maryland
to test before the supreme court if necessary
the lower of a magistrate ol newyork city
in discharge from custody a fugitive slave
the case in point is that of mr lee of fred

the anglo saxon race elihu burritt
lias one of his telling articles in ihe last num
ber ol the christian citizen he says that
the anglosxoo race numbers  of
human beings planted upon all the islands
and continents of ihe eadh and increasing
everywhere by an intense ratio of progres
sion he estimates if no great physical rev
olution supervenes to check its propagation
that in less than  years it will number
 of souls all shaking the same
language centered to the same literature and
religion and exhibiting all its inheient and
inal enable characteristics the population
of the earth is fast becoming anglosaxonized
by blood but the language is more selfex
pansive and aggressive than the blood of that
race he concludes with the following glo
riou vision
thus the race by its wonderful self
expansive power of language and blood is
ifust occupying and subduing to its genius all
the continents and islands of the earth the
grandson of many a young man who rde
these lines will probably live to see the day
when that race wilj number  ol
i human beings perhaps they may comprise
a hundred nations or distinct governments
perhaps they may become a grand constella
lation and commonwealth of republics per
vaded bvthe same laws literature and reli
gion their unity harmony and brotherhood
must be determined by the relations between
great britain and the united states theii
union will be the union of the iwu worlds
if they discharge their duty to each other and
to mankind they must become the united
heart of the race they represent feeding its
myriad veins with the blood of moral and po
litical life upon the slate of their fellow
ship then more than upon the union of any
two nations on earth depends the well being
of humanity the peace and progress of the
world

the man who was suspicious
a tale with a moral
in a recent number of an english
magazine we find the following sketch
written by alfred crowquill our lim
its will not permit us to give the long
and less interesting introduction but
will simply say that a moderately
wealthy but very happy and contented
country gentleman had gathered his
family and friends around a bright and
ruddy fire on christmas eve and in
accordance with his long established
custom relates the following story
you all know the sheep sheds in
our lower croft by windy gap said
he before i built those sheds when
it first came into my possession i had
often endeavored to reclaim it but at
ter many vain attempts i gave the ob
stinate bit up in despair and put it to
its present use it is a desolate look
ing nook and in its appearance carries
out to a miracle the scenes of happi
ness enacted upon its site
william mawby was born there of
parants well to do in the world with
everything about their farm in a thriv
ing slate as a mere child he was of
a peevish solitary nature this i have
heard from good authority for i only
became acquainted with him as i en
tered my first school and he was just on
the point of leaving it
consequently when i returned
home for good to my parents roof he
was a grown man and i a mere strip
ling as so short a distance divided
his fathers farm from ours i soon fell
over him and renewed our acquain
tance his occupation was a foreshad
owing of his miserable character he
was diligently inspecting a hedge that
divided a close from the main road he
thought that he had discovered evident
traces of some one having passed into
the field through the said hedge
i laughed at his wise and serious
face drawn into a loik of profound
wisdom for so trifling an occasion
my young friend said he men
are ruined by trifles it is not the
broken hedge i value but i suspect
the trespassers passed through that gap
on some unlawful purpoes but ill be
even with them now my suspicions are
aroused
i with that he tapped the side of his
nose and went on his way most sus
piciously uncomfortable
tne next aay to the amusement of
the village u large board appeared star
ing over the hedge with the announce
ment ofall sorts of penalties and spring
i guns to the unwary trespassers his
old father was a merryhearted plain
old man who never put himself under
the infliction of doubts for he believed
that men were all petty considerably
honest as the world went and he had
not the slightest idea that ne was better
thati anybody else consequently he
smoked his pipe in calm contentment
and let the world wag
his suspicious son soon disturbed
blissful equanimity for much to his
annoyance he found padlocks placed
j upon things that had hitherto been open
i to all his neighbor had to wait for
his glass of ale while he found his son
n and his son found the key for he was
not always sure where he had hidden
it
poor williams principal torment
was his suspicion of his own father
his lynx eyes soon fathomed the soft
easy temper of his parent and saw a
thousand ways wherein his disposition
might be turned to account by the cun
ning dealers on market days when the
ale was uppermost at their simple
 friendly dinners in winch the old man
delighted and which it would have
been difficult to wean him fromas
though yielding and good natured he
was too tough and independent to be
dictated to by anybody another
painful thorn in his side was an aged
aunt lo whom the old man took a well
stored weekly basket she lived on a
small stipend in the market town she
had two daughters the old man often
took his sobering cup of tea with them
on his return he might leave them
something comfortable the thought
was tormenting
his suspicion carried him every
market day to dodge his father with
the show of sincere affection which
the unsuspicious old man with his
heart glad reported to his simple dame
who rejoiced with him over their im
agined treasure
he was at the time about eight and
twenty and dodge as he would he
could not escape a pair of bright eyes
and rosy cheeks that caught him in the
before mentioned market town on one
of the suspicious visits
he soon scraped an acquaintance
after having by great assiduity found
out that her father was a retired miller
of good fortune and that she waa an
only child he thought this a safe in
vestment his position and appearance
soon gained him pernfission to continue
his visits which were in tact continual
for he was always under the apprehen
sion that when the cat is away the mice
will play and that some other might
snap up his valuable mouse he did
not feel quite assured about the old
mans possessions so made it his busi
ness in a thousand tortuous ways to
make inquires
this could not go on quietly but it
at last reached the old millers ears
who good naturedly put it down to the
young mans prudent foresight but on
inquiry he discovered that it proceed
ed from a doubt of his respectability
and veracity the miller was a
shrewd old man but whether the
young suitor might not be wanting in
some of the qualities he thought neces
sary for the girls happiness
the old banker was a chum of the
millers through whose instrumentality
he had invested large sums in excel
lent mortgages he allowed himself
to be pumped by mr mawby with the
connivance of the miller and conse
quently by winking replies to hie eager
inquiries made out the miller to be
little less than insolvent
williams affectioas sank down to
zero awho it had for months been burn
ing according to hit own account like
two or three etnas combined his
suspicions then were true what aa
escape thought he so it wm for the
fortunate girl he proceeded to bis
intended ones boose it being dark
he crept over the garden palings and
sneaked up towards theshuttir he
vainly attempted to peep through the
crevices here while endeavoring to
make out a murmured conversation in
which he thought he heard his name
mentioned he was pioned by the mil
lers dog who poor brute was cursed
with the youths fault of suspicion and
suspecting that he was a thief had
seizedhirn accordingly here was rath
er an awkward denouncement and he
had no right there the path to the door
lay another way in his anxiety he
had trampled down the flower bed he
stammered out some excuse upon his
release and departed home crest fallen
hoping that they did not suspect his
suspicions
the next morning he received a
very polite note from the miller beg
ging him not to repeat his visits as the
dog appeared to have taken a sudden
dislike to him in which he was joined
by himself and daughter at the same
time to ease his mind as to the state of
his affairs he begged to say that any
respectable young man who pleased his
daughters taste might have loooo
down on the wedding day and as much
more at his death
for once william suspected right
viz that he had made a sad fool of
himself
not many years after this he lost
his simpleminded mother her death
gave him plenty of exercise for his
miserable faultfor he was continually
laying traps for the servants as if they
had been so many mice to catch them
out in their little speculations uutil his
espionage mude all around him so un
coinf triable that many of the old do
mestics left the farm in disgust
whenever he met me he was full
of some deeply laid plan to and out
some miserable suspected one and
often in the midst of his selfsufficient
tale he would start off on a sudden
without any apology because a sus
picion had flashed on his mind that he
had not locked his corn bin or preserve
cupboard before he had left home
his whole occupation seemed to be
to find out things that would make hinr
uncomfortable the food preserved
for his own table he constantly dotted
or nicked that he might see upon theii
being brought to the table again mhe
ther any one had ventured to purloir
even the smallest particle
he had a habit of laving straws ir
keyholes that would be displaced upor
the slighest attempt to insert a key
and discover the intended thief i havi
known him to walk to a considerabli
distance and then return and push tin
door to assure himself that the lock ha
shut
he once got in his own trap on
night late he nad an engagement to gi
to some neighboring dance so he sen
all the servants to bed and locked th
front and back door and to make al
secure hid the ponderous key on hi
return he could not for the life of hin
think of the hiding place he therefor
had some hours to walk up and dowi
in the night air before the day dawn
when the imprisoned servants discov
ered him feeling about in hen coops an
under hatches lor the missing key a
last his hidingplace struck his memo
ry and he had the mortification c
withdrawing it before the tittering ser
vants who thus discovered his suspic
ions and the retribution on himself ii
his long night watch
his father who had now grown to
aged to attend the farm left it entirel
under his control his suspicion
had nearly finished him offfor h
suspected during his harvest that hi
shocks were pulled and robbed in th
night he therefore hired b clown t
sit up as a watchman armed with ai
old doublebarrelled gun loaded will
slugs the first night his suspicion
would not let him sleep this watch
man might be bribed to connivance am
he get laughed at he was soon dres
sed and creeping along the hedge
where his suspicions were verified b
hearing low murmuring voices hi
crawled close in their vicinity am
there i i covered that it was the poo
fellows wife who had brought hin
something comfortable for his supper
he crept back cautiouly but stumblinj
over the root of a tree roused the at
tention of the watchman who dial
lenged him immediately he lay stil
for a moment hoping he should escapi
observation in the darkness of tin
night but upon his first attempt to raisi
himself lie received about a dozet
slugs in his arm and back for hit
watchman was a better shot than hi
suspected the picking out of lhes
by the village surgeon was a positivi
satisfaction to the many to whom hii
character had become pretty wl
known
thus he went on until his father
death left him entirely alone for hii
suspicious mind never allowed him t
form a friendship which can only b
true and valuable where there is i
mutual confidence and an openness o
character he by his suspicious na
ture had locked himself within himself
which is the most fearful of imprison
ments
his fathers wealth enabled him t
please his fancyso to set hismind a
ease he sold his farm that he might
as he thought be freed from a hest o
pilferers he built himself a house
iu the croft  mentioned at the begin
ning of the tale the very prototype o
himself it bad a most suspicious  l
it bad but one door but windowi
were placed so that he could see a
that was going on no every side
he bad only one domestic an ole
cripple without relations who was to
lame to go out and of course had n
visitors it was well known in thi
neighborhood that he had withdrawi
large sums from the different country
banks where it had been invested bj
his father and it was strongly believet
that he kept it in the bouao as be sue
pected that these speculative gentle
men might one fine morning turn out t
bo insolvent hia walks were confioet
to within sightwf hia solitary mansion
the precincts of which he was nevei
known to leave as age crept on him
but wandered about like an unquie
spirit around his selfimposed tomb
in the course of time bis old do
mestie was conveyed to the vulagi
church yard much less solitary that
the abode which she had left
fora moment the old man atoot
and gazed after the bearers his whin
hair blown about by the cold wintry
wind and his shrivelled hand shad
ing his eyes he turned slowly away
from the sight and closed the door
 many were the kind offers from the
simple people of the village but all
offers he resolutely declined as he sue
pected that his age and wealth were
calculated upon to a nicety and a
thumping legacy looked forward to as
the reward of some trifling attention
distant relations began to hover
around him and make tender inquiries
these he always met on the doorstep
which was his only audience chamber
for such callers
that solitary old man sat as long
as day lasted at a window everlooking
the high road here he passed his
life in reading and watching the
same wiudow showed a light burning
throughout the hours ofdaikness for he
always appeared upon his guard as
upon any person approaching nearer
thau usual to the premises his ears
were saluted by the deep growl of his
dog who never led the house any more
than his master
about two years after the decease
of his housekeeper the nightly light
was missed from the window for it had
become quite a guide to many coming
to the village this of course caused
some oi the more curious to approach
the house by daylight and reconnoitre
but there sat the solitary old man ap
parently deeply occupied with his book
and also his god peering through the
glass this satisfied them and they
departed
a week had elapsed and the vil
lage was alarmed by the appearance ol
mawbys dog careering in a wild man
uer through the villageupon being
noticed he sped hack to the croft
many followed him and upon approach
ing the house and luok ng up at the
window they perceived the old mat
still sitting unmoved though the
frame had been smashed by the dng
exit after repeated calls which inei
with no attention they forced theii
way into the house
everything in the chamber was
neat and comfortable there sat tht
poor old man in bis arm chair deac
and alone of what value now wert
those riches which had closed his hean
against ail the pleasures of this beauti
ful world against the possessions of t
wife children kindred and friends
there was no will for he suspected llu

that would be his last moment of securi
