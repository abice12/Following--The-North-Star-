speech of ansom burlingame
mr chairman and gentlemen of the
convention l respond to your call
with alacrity and i promise you all in
the outset tha i shall not detain you
long a friend sitting at my side just
now said that this assembly did not
look as if the free soil party werej
dead it is the resurrection and the
life ot all that is noble in the old deadj
parties applause
i discovered a lone in this conven
tion that tells me tuat the hour of the
time server and the trimmer has struck
henceforth men must be what they
seem it will not do to say you are it
favirr of freedom when the only fruit
of your action is a president who in
vests the earning of a warrior life in
the bodies and ouls of men no the
stream must run as high as the fount
the resolve must precedemust
forerun the voteand that vote must
be given with a will that shall send it
like a bullet through the very vitals of
slavery cheers
our difficulty has been not so much
to find men holding our doc trines as to
find those who could stick to them in
all weather several rounds of ap
plause the taylor men and the
cass men both hold to our doctrines
but both pause and tremble before a
pledge of their fulfilment cheers
vou yourselves in worcester have
furnished the most striking instance of
devotion to freedom and defection from
it in a man who sullied the glories ot a
life in an hour and took upon himself
the voke he taught you to spurn
cheers thank heaven the spirit
that buoyed him up when his eye was
sunward still lives and treads unawed
the path he trod b fore he lost his prin
ciples and changed his constituency
great enthusiasm his punishment
was severe but it w as just applause
and i tell those men who betrayed us
at baltimore and philadelphia
their doom too is sealed hear hear
it is true their surpassing eloquence
planted in our youthful breasts the
principles we hold so dearthat they
nourished those principles there until
thev became the intensest convictions
of our youthful livesit is true they
hive trampled them in the dust but
shall we follow their leading and do
the same no we shall hold onto
themwe young men through good
report and through evil reportteeling
a we go on sustained by their own
burning words in their better days and
sustained moreover by what is better
a conscience here placing his hand
upon his heart and  tell those men
that we shall move straight on turning
neither to ths right hand nor to the
left though our path of duty shall lead
directly over the grae of their political
aspirations i irrepressible applause
why all unprepared a s we were
for their treachery we went out on to
the brown hills of the old bay state
god bless her and we heat both of
their miserable nominee before the
people cheers j e sent one
down lower thsn plummet ever sound
ed unbounded and prolonged en
thusiasm w have tied up the other
hand and foot at washington
cheers we have seized the halanct
of power in nearly all the northerr
slates and we hold it in congress to
day and we mean to use it like mer
holding in our hands the sacred inter
ests of humanity acting sometimes wit
this party and sometimes with that
but always with those persona who arc
most in favor of freedom
why  think i behold before roe
the north star
already in session the next congress
sensation the representative from
worcester who stands at the head of
the alphabet in more sensei than one
cheers enthusiasm waving of hats
and repeated rounds of applause con
tinued for several minutes sitting
side by side with the accomplished
representative from boston who
stands at the foot of the alphabet io
more mates than one laughter and
cheers  think  behold the judge
firing his resolutions into that quailing
congress like a revolver  think 
see the accomplished gentleman the
representative from boston vainly en
deavoring to sustain in that congress
his janus faced polcjr i see him
tiring out and finally behold him wip
ing the perspiration from those fine
features which i will aay are all that
is left to remind ua of a once noble
ancestry continuous applaum and
laughter
a friend met me yesterday in the
street said he suppose california
comes in as a state with an antislave
ry constitution i replied we will
thank god and take courage we will
sing songs of jubilee in all the valleys
of massachumtts and then collect the
forces of liberty and heave them like
an ocean wave upon the next salient
point of slaverycheerswe will
strike the fetters off the district of
columbia cheers we will repeal
the jaw of we will destroy the
interstate slave trade and stretch our
arms of power and protection ova ther
sea from pole to pole cheers in
short we will put the government ac
tively and perpetually on the side of
freedom cheers
and what do we mean by this
why we mean that if a citizen of the
united states with a skin as dark as
the purposes of slaveryapplause
if he shall apply to the secretary of
state for the protection to which a citi
zen of the united states is entitled hi
shall have it great sensation if
there is a usage against it that usage
shall be changed enthusiasm if it
is a controverted question one of doubt
as they ay it is then we will give that
doubt to liberty cheers according
to common law and common sense
v repeated cheers
we mean by putting the government
perpetnally on the side of freedom
that if a boy educated in the free
schools of worcester shall apply and i
be sustained in that application fer an j
appointment in the navy manned
principally from new england that
his claims shall not be set aside in favor
of ir son of one of the first families in
virginia we mean that if a rascal
hall rob our letters of their contents
either of money or affection in south
carolina he shall suffer the same pen
ally he would have to suffer in massa
chusetts for the same offence
cheers and if a citizen of massa
cliusetts shall be imprisoned in the jail j
at charleston arid we send our most j
venerable man as attorney there to try i
his rights there shall stand between his
gray hairs and death something more 
than a beautiful rnd heroic daughter i
redoubled applause we mean to
make slaveholding primu facie evidence
against a mans capacity to hold office j
we will see whether there is not a
man among the eight hundred thou
sand nonslaveholding voters of the
south fit to hold office as well as among
the  slaveholders if we can
get a nonslaveholder in the union we
will not take a slaveholder
how shall we achieve these things
we shall do it by calling together such
large hearted conventions as thiswe
will do it by going out on the hills of
massachusetts and speaking gods
truth to honest menspeaking tht
truth manfully with a proper regard to
the feelings of our candid opponents
but coming down like the hammer of
thor upon those free soil men who
will agree with us by our firesides
that slavery is a curse but who will go
among the slaveholders and attempt to
show by their bibles that the institu
tion is of divine origin thus attempting
to involve the author of all good in
their own criminal inconsistency aye
the great god who thundered from
sinai opposition to all oppressionwho
suspended the laws of nature for the
sake of delivering an oppressed people
who smote with death in one night
two and a half millions of the first born
of fifteen millions of egyptianswho
dealt out thunder and hail and dark
ness against the oppressor who made
the nile run blood all day long pur
pling the great mediterranean for thirty
mileswho sent plagues to persecute
a whole nation and all to show his
abhorrence of a servitude which
compared with american slavery is as
light compared to darkness tre
mendous burst of enthusiastic ap

how shall we achieve these things
why we are three hundred thousand
strong and glowing with the faith with
in us as enthusiastic as the crusa

were the followers of cromwellthink
you we shall not make ourselves heard
and feltr
we will study our principles by the
light of day we will write them down
by the midnight lamp we will give
them the wings of the morningwa

if a slaveholder shall come herehis

slaveholders have falsely styled them
let him tell it openly it he dare to them
and we can safely leave his punishment

i will not introduce yeu among my
little ones lest you may instil into thair
youthful minds sentiments born of the
bottomless pit good i
we will do here as the celebrated
irish oconnell did in the streets of
londonrefuss to shake their slave
stained hands a slaveholder can
hardly be shaken by the hand among
the better classes in england we
will make the same sentiments prevail
here
a word more and lam done go
on go on why we let loose the
vials of our wrath upon a person for
selling rum but his business is saiutly
compared with slaveholding a rum
seller makes a man a slave of his own
free will but the slaveholder does it by
force shuts him out forever from the
sweet cheering voice of father mathew
who may wish to raise him from his de
based condition true you that
can beard the rumseller who is weak
go brave the slaveholder who stands
behind and looms above him
i invoke the assistance of my youth
ful brothers in this holy crusade the
victory must come if it come at all
from your fiery hearts for men in
middle life are engrossed in the pursuits
of business and tremblingly hug the

the future defiant of its dangers ap

thanking you gentlemen and mr
president with all my heart for the kind
manner in which you have listened to
the few desultory remarks i have
made i will give way and allow you
to call to the stand some person more
capable of doing justice to the great
cause we have in hand cheers and
applause
proslav fry theology
slaveholders and their defenders
having been supplied at the hand of
northern clergymen with biblical pro
tections for their system and sanctions
for their crime are daily growing more
devout and constant in their appeal to
the bible more sanctimonious in their
pious twang about the dealings of pro
vidence and the authority of moses
and the apostles and more bold and
shameless in charging upon god the
authorship and patronage of slavery
the extract below from an influential
southern journal will give an idea of
this growth in grace and at the same
time a portrait of the popular religion
of the south which we foster and
cherish by church fellowship and min
isterial intercourse
the following is an extract from an
essay on the evils of abolitionism and
the glories of slavery by a correspon
dent of the augusta ga rtpttblu
the writer should be hunted up and
the title of d d conferred on him by
some one of our northern theological
schools he is ahead of dr rice
and dr junkin when we last heard
from them with regard to the patri
archal institution but there a no tel
ling how far they may have progressed
in proslavery theology since isis
we invite any who are not blind to
madness to look into the holy wise
and merciful work of the beneficent
i creator and in defending the char
acter of the christians god as the
auihor of southern slavery we only
ask thst its history may be traced go
back then into the wilds of africa
and see two of her savage tribes en
gaged in the din of deadly battle the
one and perhaps not the aggressor
proves victorious in the conflict and
now the broodiog spirit of the god ol
mercy says to the conquering party do
not butcher your captives though they
may have unjustly assailed you and
if conquriog might jhnve put you te
i death and paved their yards with yout
skulls as many savage tribes of youi
country do with their captured enemies
but do you act upon the principle ol
mercy and benevolence make ilei
your servantstun them nte your
moneymad then they will be arete
ful to von and you will love and pro
ject them the divine influence pre
vailed over their savage minds um
 poor captives destined to destruction
were spared by their conquer nd
became their hied aod submissive
slaves but to go badk to the caae ro
corded in the ninth of genesis when
übmxi hit ca
rochester n y friday october  
i whom hams descendants ate sub
jected to the prophet arose had
committed a most atrocious offence el
some kind was it not wondrous mercy
in god instead of the decapitation ol
ham to simply punish him in cantui
the first son perhaps born to him aftai
l the offence by flattening his band
kinking his hair and blackening bis
akin and turning him loose with ku
mind in chains to be a servant of mp
vants to his brethren thus giving him
time and opportunity for repentance
upon the same principle that the nan
englanders confine their free negroes
in their penitentiary instead of haqf
 them for corns nsv is the wtsdetfl
mercy of god less marked with in
finite benevolence in allowing thesa
captive sons of canaan to be trana
ported from bondage in their own land
of degradation and darkness to our
country while their enlightenment and
religious opportunitias would not only
 elevate thir civil character but se
cure to them gospel privileges through
which thousands of them have rejoiced
in past ages and thousands will rejoien
in redeeming mercy in every genera
tion down to the judgment trump at
the sound of which we are told thsf
every bondman and every freeman
together with men of every rank and
society found in impenitency will say
to the mountains and rocks fall on us
and hide us from him that sitteth on
the throne and from the wrath of the
lamb for the great day of his wrath is
come and who shall he able to stand
i
but putting the institution upon the
footing that many of the forefathers of
our slaves were kidnapped though the
avaricious dark hearted thieves meant
it for evil god meant it for good
and while he holds those avaricious
manstealers responsible to the deci
sions of the eternal judgment he has
greatly improved the condition of
joseph by providentially causing him
to be thrown into our honest possession
and as the steward of such a trust we
feel bound to take good care of our
charge and god forbid that the van
dalism of yankee and british fanati
cism should bring against us any iniqui
tious pharoah to wield the sceptre of
oppression over them and in after
generations your correspondent would
insinuate that the fact of our southern
men voting in congress to prohibit the
importation of slaves from africa and
also to prevent the extension of slave j
ry to some of the territories denoted
their disapproval of the institution of
slavery they voted against the
slavetrade not because the condition
of the outdoor slaves would not be
vastly bettered but mainly because
it wasbecoming a rather strong tempta
tion to the iniquitous sin of yankee and
british kidnapping
and we think your correspondents
attempt to use as precedents to entire
ly justify the unrestrained overleaping
of the constitution those compromises
voted for by southern men and sanc
tioned by southern presidents for the
sake of the union and for the peace
of the north but one out of many
instances of proof that the spirit of ab
olitionism is marked by the character
istic trait of basest ingratitude we
hesitate not to assert that all those
compromises admitted by the south to
conciliate the north were founded in
injustice for though we hold that
every state who might feel it to be her
interest to put out of her limits negro
slavery should be allowed to do it if
compatible with the rights of her citi
zens and neighbors yet all territory
becoming the property of the united
states should be held in common by all
her citizens and that ail should be en
titled without restraiut to participate
in its occupancy and why should not
the people of the south with their por
perty and with the god of justice and
mercy overshadowing them with the
protecting banner af his truth go into
new mexico carrying the flag of the
gospel to unfurl to her inhabitants
debased far below our negroes in civil
condition and religious opportunities
ah we ask in truth and justice why
not and the sound of this question
having reverberated upon the zephyrs i
of the far west the echo as the voice
of god back from the mountains ofj
california thunder forth in truth and
justice why not
i have no pretension to prophetic
vision but upon the showing of your
correspondent our slaves are greatly
prospering and the god of heaven has
placed net only new but old mexico
in such geographical and clirnaticai
 juxtaposition to our sunny south that
i know net but wheu enlargement for
our slaves may reuire k who has
 ever favored those walking under the
banner of truth and rigbteousneas may
open the way in peace and goodwill
too for his peculiar institution of slave
ry to carry its blessings still farther

an american sla ye in england i
london england june l  j
dear sir l witnessed an incident
a few days ago which  have no doubt
will be interesting to you being at 
newbroad i was introduced to a
fugitive from american slavery he
was a man about my color and sire
he could not tell his age but i should
think he was  he had been the
shive of william hunter of new or
leans he attempted to fly from slave
ry about two years since and was
overtaken received one hundred and
sixty lashes and wore an iron collar six
months his next opportunity occur
red to get on board of an english ves
sel after they had been out three
weeks he was discovered in the hatch
way where he was concealedthe
captain appeared to be enraged he
ordered a sandbag to be tied to his
feet and said he would throw him
overboard that freak over he ordered
him to be tied up saying be would flog
himwhen all was ready he went to
him looked at his back and said
well i dont see any place left to
flog when he arrived at liverpool
he ordered him to be kept concealed
until night and then he gave him a
suit of clothes four shillings in money
and started him for london he came
to london and presented himself before
the lord mayor who was then sitting
in court he gave him some tammy out
of the poorhwrfifld ordered lodgings to
be provided for him the next day he
was brought to the antislavery office
and will go from here to one of the
british islands one fact in this case
has struck me with great forcel may
say alarming forcethat an english
captain should hide a fugitive from
american slavery after he gets into
liverpool here you see american
slavery reaching forth it bloodstained
hand all over the world feeling after
its victim and seizing by the throat all
who dare aid him brother i tell you
we need not fly from american slave
ry to any part of the world we must
meet it on the continent and conquer it
there or we are done men go where j
we may yours truly

the accountability of
slavery
the responsibility which they as
sume who undertake to control the con
duct of others is a fearful one this
kind of responsibility slavery always
imposes on masters thsy who vol
untarily assume such a relation to oth
ers shauld have brave hearts as it is
not unlikely that occasions may arise
in which great sternness and rigor
and perhaps cruelty will be exacted
of them for the effect of which they
must be held accountable to a power
higher than of man
whoever undertakes to control oth
ers necessarily makes himself acconn
tabsfor the conduct of those under him
this cannot be set aside it ad
heres of necessity to the position of a
master the servant cannot exert his
own independent volition and where
there is no freedom of volutions reason
teaches that accountability cannot ex
ist if the accountability of a human
being is affected or lessened he who
lessees it must to the extent which it is
lessened assume accountability it is
impossible to avoid this conclusion a
man is accountable for his own con
duct only because he himself deter
mines what that conduct shall be if he
voluntarily step in and assumes the con
trol of another he necessarily by that
act assumes to himself the accounta
bility of all such conduct as he requires
what a fearful thing it is thus voluni
tarily to assume accountability in the 
sight of heaven for the conduct and
character of others allminded true
baarted men feel that to be accounts
ble for themselves is s perilous thing
and he who adds accountability for oth
ers to his accountability for himself
places himself in a position of greatdis
advantage and great danger
a kentucky master owns a negro
child ha brings that child up in a
state of moral and mental blindness
in consequence of that blindness the
child commits many blunders and is
guilty of many crimes can the child
b hamseevmiwme for the cfttnes
which resulted from the control which
his master exerted over him if a man
oould render his neighbor insane and
could induce him while in a state of in
sanity to cut the throat of a third per
son no one would hesitate to excuse
the madman and to hold the man who
caused the insanity and induced the
murder responsible now although
the master who holds a slave may not
be to that fatal extent accountable for
the slaves transgressions those vices
and crimes perpetrated by the slave
that are directly clearly and only
traceable to the power exerted over
him by the master must be charged
on the master we cannot see how
masters can escape accountability for
the conduct of slaves to the extent
that the will of the slave is directly un
der their control if thorp was no oth
er objection to slavery tfaftn that it im
poses additional accountability on the
master that consideration of itself
ought to deter all reflecting men iroro
involving themselves in its perils
all parents fool that they are accoun
table to some extent for the conduct
and character of their children this
conviction cooperating with paternal
affection induces them to studiously
endeavor to enlighten the hearts and
instruct the minds of their offspring in
relation to subjects of the most solemn
importance all agree that if a father
eta an example of drunkenness to hie
son end the son adopts u and lives a
nuisance and dies in a gutter in conse
quence the father csnnotjbe guiltless
or if a child is debarred by the perent
from acquiring a knowledge of sound
moral principles and in consequence
of hie ignorance of those principles
leads an ungodly lift the parent cannot
bo excused he is nearly as gailty
for the childs ungodliness as if
he had committed it himself those
parents who strive to discharge their
doties to their offspring are net ac

quence of their vile examples incite
their children to the commission of sin
or by keeping their children in a state
ot mental and moral ignorance footer

generally and vary justly looked upon
as involved in the guilt of their off

we recently copied from a v trguiia
paper certain humane threat against
the editors and publisher of sort ama
magazine and all in any wise connect
ed with it one person especially the
writer ot a tale published in the maga
zine in which a negro is allowed to
justify himself dor escaping from the
peculiar institution was earnestly in
vited to make his appearance south of
the potomac and was assured if he did
so he would be murdered by a web
tbe instant he became known a lady
of this city of distinguished literary
reputation stated to be connected with
the magazine was at the same time
warned under the penalty of outrage
not to present herself in those lati
tudes it has since beau discovered
that the author of tliis obnoxious tala
is a southern incendiary by the name
of wiley a native and citizen of north
carolina a graduate of her state uni
versity and a practising lawyer in hat
courts
the south carolinian a print as
sharp as any even in the state where
it is published on the scent of an in
cendiary has an article upon the case
of mr wiley from which we learn
that he is to be required to give rea
sons and explnatjona for permitting
wild bill who personates the charac
ter of the fugitive slave to talk in tbe
heretical manner which has excited ae
much alarm and indignation but tbs
south carolinian is fearful that the un
fortunate tala writer will be unable te
satisfy his fellowcitizens whom he
has ao grievously outraged the
worst part of the w hole story is that ta
the dialogue in which wild bill ax
dresses his sentiments to walter an
other character in the slory on tbs
subject of escaping from bondage he
does not make walters refutatioa at
all satisfactory
this is very unfortunate ami wt
fear beyond remedy for every body
will admit that if wild bill ie a person
of any acuteness and viger of intellect
he will so apply those faculties in the
argument upon the propriety of rnnmng
away from slavery as to render any at
tempt to reply quite futile and that
he has employed a very forcible style
of reasoning on the subject it is evi
dent from the sensation of his conver
sation with walter has occasioned a
north carolinia editor who aeema to
be a neighbor and acquaintance of mr
wiley and who is altogether lass san
guinary and obdurate than his brothel
of the south carolinian proposes te
postpone the hanging of his friend un
til he has had the opportunity of finish
ing his story for he suggests that ni
ter all the tale may have a vary fit
ting catastrophe w r iid bill may be
floored in the argument by walterand
then tbe fugitive colored logician may
be caught and strung up and so all
end happily
what is to be done with wiley
becomes a vary important question
hie treatment will form a precedent in
the code lynch which may exercise a
great iufluence in the future adminis
tration of it hie crime ih certainly
far more flagrant than that with which
barrett stands charged for the docu
ment signed brutus which this un
lucky person is said to have put into the
mails makes no reference whatever to
slavery but is simply a ealm address
to the whits citizens ef south carolina
showing them that they live underran
aristocratical despotism and are de
nied a portion of their political right
this is denounced as a celebrated
incendiary document and a respecta
ble citizen of a free state is threatened
with death for attempting to circulate it
through the governments mails of
course if they ceuld catch the author
of that address he would be account
dated with a short shift and a long rope
mr wilev therefore stands in a ve
critical position and it would net sur
prise us to hear by the next naml
that tbe services of the hon mr ketch
now in the united stales senate had
been brought into requisition and the
first indiscreet storyteller had been
hung up on the first limb and if tbe
bones of thomas jefferson should be
exhumed and suspended by that body
tbe memory ef that prince of incendia
ries would at length have received tbe
crowning honor to which the fanaticism
of the hour in carolina and virginia
no doubt considers it fully entitled
it strikes many as a singular circum
stance that all three of the person who
are at this time exciting the leers
and tbe violent passions of the more
bigoted partisans of slavery in tbo
south are themselves natives of that
region ihe most dreaded and detest
ed of them tbe author of tbe polit
ical tract signed brutus v
man bom in south carolina and
until within a few yuan a resident
preacher in that stats mr barrett
si as we are led to believe in a recent tot
i ter is a native of virginia and ban

dear friendsince the receipt oi
the vigilance committees circular two
weeks ago i have been diligently engaged in
endeavoring to respond to the call and have
found a greater degree of sympathy with
suffering humanity than my appeals met with
last spring and in order to excite
an interest for the oppressed in the breasts ol
the dear chiidien  solicited them to add
their shillings and pence the result is the
enclosed draft for fifty dollars which
 thought preferable to bills both as regards
safety of conveyance and because of the dis
count on some of them my wholehearted
friend e d t assisted me as my age

surely the example of this mother ic is

the news from the mines is of a quite glow
i ing character the yield of gold was steady
and though there was as a uoattar of course
 much disappointment among individuals tin
general result was highly satisfactory it i
estimated that the average product of all tin
mines together thus far since the beginning
of that season has been  pe
month and there was thought to be no doub
of its continuance at the same rate of abun
dance no change is quoted in the pricei
either of gold or meichandise
the health of the population both at th
mines and elsew here is generally good anc
neither cholera nor any other serious maladj
is reported as having made its appearance
the jealous unfriendly feeling which has
so long been in existence between the amer
iicans and south americans ofspanish origin
i has at last approached a crisis and by the
 next a rival we may expect to hear of a grave
i collision at least if the party warned offdis
play anthmg like a manly spirit the amer
leans have determined that the mexicans and
i chilians who are at the mines shall no longei
enjoy the privilege of digging out the richei
of the earth and have taken deliberate meas
ures accordingly all companies of these na
turns who have come organized tft work foi
the season with the inteniiou of returning tc
spend the winter and wet season at home
have been informed that their presence will
no longer be tolerated and have received pos
itive orders to leave tbe gold diggings and
not return the more active and energetic
part of the american mining population are
understood to be engaged in tins new move
ment of nativeisra but we are not informed
what number of persons are actually engaged
in this expulsive movement nor how the
parti sjwould be matched incase of an attempt
forcibly to compel the mexicans and chilians
to evacuate but there appears to be no doubi
that the latter would have no resource but tc
submit at last
the order to evacuate allows a fixed time
sufficient for the retiring partiee to make fcl
necessary preparations tbe americans seen
from our iulurmation to have proceeded very
calmly about it and up to tbe th no distur
bances whatever had taken place they were
waiting lor the expiration of the allotted peri
od after which should the rejected adventu
t rersn fuse to leave they would set about
making them when that moment arrives

wild savages of central america aad set him
up as a king claiming for him the territory in
the vicinity of the san juan river the outlet
of lake nicaragua including the exclusive
right of navigating that river the real
cause of this interest suddenly taken by the
british government m the affairs of an igno
rant savage is perfectly transparent the
most feasible route fur a ship canal across the
isthmus exists at this point to the sueeess of
this project the navigation of ibe st john
rivet is essential the british government
is the guardian of the moequito king and
denies the citizens of any other nation the
previlege of navigating the san juan
the republic of new grenada to whom
this territory rightfully belongs has recently
i signed a contract with a company from the
united states granting them the exclusive
navigation of the san juan river for the term
of fifteen years on the condition that that
i company commence cutting a canal from the
lake nicaragua to the pacific ocean within
i a year from the date of the contract the
affair which lias been pending for nearly two

american government has probably refused to
acknowledge the puppet set up by the british

that a reforming church coming out from his
own may tend to diminish the latter or spoil
 some of the craft
if abolitionism does not abolish slavery
it is not because abolitionists have not the
truth with them but because such men as dr

every just effort of the abolitionists to effect
the freedom of the slave
that abolitionism drives some into schism

lockport oct bth 
we have just completed the last fair in
the series it was held on friday and satur
day oct sth and th and may be set down
as the most successful of the numberthe
gross receipts amounting to one hundred and
forty dollars
considering that there were one or two
drawbacks this sum is large there had
just been held quite a popular fair in the
lutheran church in ets own behalf and the
public of course felt less interest in ours than
would have been the case under other circum
stances the weather too was unpropitious
cold and rainy so much so as to make it
difficult for ladies to attend
we however are highly gratified by the re
sult besides the pecuniary advantage ari
sing from the fair we think that much good
was done by bringing the subject of slavery
prominently before the community and active
ly enlisting the energies of a number of per
sons in practical efforts for advancing the an
tislavery cause there are in every town
a number of persons who feel more or less
deeply the necessity of doing something to
wards abolishing slavery but whose energies
lie dormant solely for the want of some per
son to lead and mark out the way
they need something iu the way of fairs and
sewing circles upon which to bestow their
attention activity and skill
we would respectfully suggest to the la
dies of lockport the desirableness of forming
among themselves an antislavery sewing
circle such an organization while it would
do much towards furnishing the sinews of
our antislavery warfare would also keep
alive the interest in the subject already exci
ted will some lady in lockport lead
the way in this benevolent work
previous to the fair we had the pleasure
of addressing a large and respectable audience
in the congiegational church a most com
modious building which was very kindly and
readily granted for our use it always gives
us pleasure to record a fact of this kind
i the proslavery press and public frequent
ly charge us with a studied inattention to the
good deeds of the chnrch and the constant
e af fetation of its ahortcomings the charge
unfounded we hail with delight the slight
est indication of liberality from that quarter
our controversy with the american chuich
and  clergy ends just w here their antisla
very action begins let them make slavery a
disciplinary offence let them exclude slave
holders from their communionkt them de

fraught with the most horrible consequences
o both slaves and slaveholdersand let
them in the spirit of ihe prophets and apo

the mountain ddhcalty in tbe way of the
antislaverv movement which ia known as
color madness met us oo the threshold and
for a time rendered it doubtful whether or not
we should find shelter on our arrival we
called at the americas hotel ia the hope
of obtaining accommodation there but were
infsrmed that the court of supervisors was in
session and that its members occupied tbe
whole house we hare every reason now to
believe this was true though our frequent ex
perience of being excluded from hotels indu
ced at first the suspicion that this was but a
mere subterfuge we next called at the
lockport house but could not induce the
keeper to take any notice of us thence we
went to the eagle hotel from which we
were spurned iu a most vulgar and insulting
manner bythe contemptible creature who pre
sumed to be the master we next tried our
fortunes at a small hotel near the eagle
the unpretending proprietor of which wel
comed us kindly and would undoubtedly
have paid us every attention in his power had
we remained under his roof but as soon as
our kind friend mr spalding ascertained our
whereabouts he extended to us to mr
post and to tbe misses griffiths a warm
and hearty invitation to make his house our
home so long as we remained in lockport
and on our accepting his generous offer he
promptly sent his servant and carriage to
convey us to his hospitablegmansionwhere we
noware oh how delightful it is to meet
ever and anon in this howling proslavery
wilderness a resting place where we are
neither shocked by vulgarity nor chilled by
patronizing condescension our antislavery
life would be hard indeed but that our lot is
sometimes cast in pleasant places in this re
spect nothing can be more distasteful to us
than to receive the hospitality of one who
makes a merit of granting it and who takes
pains to assure us that he is sacrificing public
esteem by giving us entertainment we are
aware however that this is in many cases a
sin of ignorance and we can therefore excuse
it but such persons tuust  not be surprised it
they find us maintaining a respectful distance
and avoiding rather than seeking a second
visit it is heedless to say that the hause oi

our readers must not be dissatisfied with

it absolutely necessary to travel and lecture in

a convention of the colored men of con
eecticut was held t new haven on the th

much harmony and to have been conducted
with becoming dignity jrhiil c bsmam

seretaiies a committee was appointed to
prepare an address to the voters ef the state
 in behalf of the colored people whieh ad
dress is published in pamphlet with the pro
ceedings it will probably appear in an early
number of the north star after mature
discussion on each the following resolution
were adopted
i resolved that we regard the right of
the electivefranchise as one of the most
valuable and sacred rights of man and at
once the glory and the shield of civil gov
ernment
 resolved that to deprive any class of
men of this invaluable and inalienable right
and for a pretext release their property from
a state tax when at the earae time they
must beai their part of the expenses of the
general government is not to be considered
as a favor but is rather s measure calculated
to fix upon them more deeply the mark of
political degradation
 resolved that the constitutional dis
ability under which colored men labor in the
state of connecticut being founded upon
that color with which the almighty creator
has clothed them is impious before heaven
unjust and cruel to those effected by itab
bot rent to the religion of jesus christiu
suiting to humanityx dishonor to the state
and an obstacle in the way nf that spirit oi
freedom which is abroad in the earth strug
gling to redeem man the world over and
should therefore be speedily removed
 resolved that we believe that the day
has now come when the people of our be
loved stale of connecticut should remove ibis
blot from her constitution sod proudly and
uobiy take her place with that of every other
state in new england in giving to all tbeir
eitixens the right of suffrage
 resolved that we pledge ourselves to
each other u use all honorable means to in
duce the good people of ibis stste to arise
in their moral strength sad in the majesty of
their political dignity and remove from the
stales escutcheon that blot which now identi
fies her with the spirit of political tytanny
 resolved that we rejoice in the efforts
sod progress which our brethren have made
and are to procure property especial
ly land in this sad various other states and
qua we regard this as one of the signs of the
com i of of tiatdey when as e people we
shall hold in emioeoi and dignified position
in society
t resolved that we are eoeoeraged by
the partial success whieh has crowned the
eflbna ef ear bcethrsa sad the friends of free

congratulate her eitocos sed the world on the
repeal of her black law and hope the
day will speedily come when the statute
books of every state in the colon shall be
purified fiom all eejeet aed oppressive lews

deeper aflmhoes we will to show that we

every three months upon the important sub
ject of total abstinence i root the uae of all
intoxicating liquors and thus exert a living
influence agatnat the direful evils of intern

 resolved that we recommend to all
an earnest and zealous interest in the educa
tion of theii children and that they use their
beet endeavors t givr them a thorough men
tal and moral training and then introduce
them into the mechanic arts and ibus prepare
them  develop and sustain a virtuous and
honorable station in society
 resolved as there appears to be s
crisis m our condition as a people it u our
duty to regard carefully the position of those
who in this cause identify themselves wnh
un and those among us who deny ihtir
identity with us should be looked upon in
the light of tones and enemies to the social
and universal freedom of man
 resolved that notwithstanding we
are deprived of the right of the elective
franchise and deprived of the privileges ot
citizenship we will use our utmost omleavora
to cultivate the principles ol a pure morality
and high intellectual attainments aud by in

 resolved that this convention deem
it advisable and expedient to present the
claims of the colored citizens of connecticut
to equal rights to the body of the people by
the means of lecturers discussed hy

 resolved that those lecturers should
be colored men of intelligence and ability

doings in south carolina
the hairbrained fools of south calhounia
are at their work again the post office
seems destined to keep up an everlasting fe
ver in that region of slaves and patriotism
in the charleston mercuty appears an ac
count of one of the most arbitrary and illegal
proceedings which the history of modern
times can furnish the tyrannical acts of
russia have given occasion for much railing
so have those of austria algiers turkov
japan isc but the tyranny of these coun
tries must henceforth cease to be regarded
as at all to be compared with the unmitigated
despotism of south carolina the mercury

more abolitioism by the following
letter from an esteemed correspondent ii
will be perceived that the abolitionists are
still active in their incendiary efforts
pendleton sept  
gentlemen by the mail of friday there
were received at this place a number of cop
ies of an abolition circular directed to the
members of the committee of vigilance
the executive committee of that body on
the following day demanded the letters ol
the postmaster on his refusal to deliver
them they entered his office and took them
by force this oase presents a new feature
of an important matter which is deeply agi
tating the public mind among the reforms
which our enemies propose to accomplish in
this state it will not escape your notice that
the election of president of the united states
occupies a prominent position
it need scarcely be remarked that the war
which the fanatics of the noith are so perso
veringly waging against the peace and secu
rity of the south cannot be much longer
carried on only by one party an offensive
attitude by the other it will be impossible to
restrain the people very shortly from as
suming
respectfully yours s
we should like to know how long the gen
eral government means to submit to such
indignity what is particularly remarkable
about this case is that the incendiary docu
ment which has caused the disturbance says
not a word about slavery but is simply an
exposure of the working of the constitution
of south carolina and the unequal represen
tation among the white population
by all means let that little nest of hornets
lake themselves off and fiud a post office
that will answer the purpose of keeping them
in that deep and everlasting darkness which
they seem so much to covet decent men
who have no evil deeds to hide or to be a
shained of would then give them a wide
berth and allow them to stumble along by
themselves the short but rough road to per
dition which they seem to have chosen
the case of dr brisbane a baptist minis
ter of south carolina who among other
things was accused of praying that univer
sal liberty may prevail and for that and hia
opinions against slavery was harried out of
the state under threats of tar and feathers
is another striking illustration of the barbar
ous state of feeling in south carolina
these violent measures resorted to by the j
slaveraongersmay be regarded as evidence that
they see their weakness and the untenabieness
of their position the mao who has truth on
his side never attempts to smother discussion
tne more his views are talked about  and ar
gued upon the more apparent does their
truthfulness become not so with tyrants
and evildoers they hate the light they
dare not eome to the light they know they
are in the wrong and they will try every
means in their power to keep their dark deeds 
aud darker doctrines huddled away and bid
deu but it will not do even into the
murky regions of south carolina the light oii
troth will ere long penetrate slaveiyisei
ten now acknowledged on all hands to be an
unnatural condition and productive of evil
not leas to the master than to the slave
when printed even slaveholders are foiced
to make this confession though they are
slow to act upon it so slow indeed that it
may well be doubted whether they are real
ly convinced of its truth there must be
few however who bold the doctrme of per
petualism it is so clearly abeurd and its
absurdity is every day becoming so much
more apparent even to the prejudiced under
fundings of tbe haughty and self sufficient t
chivalry that there is reason to hope the
highpriest of slavery will ere long be left
alone to worship in the temple of baal amid
neglected faaea and despised ceremonials
bet in the meantime slavery m rampant

ie driven te fanous measures of selmefencs

if is well known in this community thst
i bate good reason for desiring to see south

i now grinding her to powder i have my
self suffered enough to know that the white
citizens of that state are subjects of opprea

endure it is but eighteen months sgo that
i went there to vmt my numerous relative
and friends who lote and respect me and
whilst tnv wife infant and self were en
joying then company nd receiving iheir bos
pita lilies and afffctionste attentions a conspi
racy was seertely forming among e eie
entes ot liberty and the riotously disposed to
make an assault upon roe and on a cold win
ters night with my wife and child both sick
we had to leave the warm fireside of our
friends and for their as well as our own
safety hasten forty or fifty miles bv private
conveyance through forests anttswamps to
tho railroad depot and leave the state not
knowing we had left a packed meeting of
citizens was held for the purpose of taking
proceedings against me fortunaiejv two
or three of the friends of order heard of ih
meeting in time to uke part in the discu
sioris and by opposing their violent demon
strations to nndify somewhat their course of
aetion but they appointed a committee to
wait upon me and warn me to leave the state
and for what was this done they knew
well knew that  was not a man to engage is
schemes of servile insurrection they knew
that i had always borne the character when
i lived among them of being an honest and
an honorable menthey knew me aa oris
who hid tried to be a faithful minister of ths
gospel among them they knew too thst
the chinch in their neighborhood of which
was foimeriy the pastor had still such confi
dence in tmuitegrity and christian character
notwithstanding my well known opinions on
the subject of shivery as to have had me bv
invitation to preach in their pulpit but a few
days before they knew that thus who
were paying me friendly attention were them
selves slaveholders and as deeply interested
as any others in the consequence of mv ptes
ence in the state and therlore if they could
have confidence in me others might all
these things they knew why then did
they et upon me it was for nu other rea
son than that i had opinions adverse to sla

liberty in europeorm of our very
clear sighted cotemporaries has an article
under this head in the course of which the
writer waxes warm and comes to the conclu
sion that something ought to be done for
europe what that something is he does
not condescend to say perhaps he does not
e actly know the idea is contained in the
following sentence
a movement should he started at once tti
this country for the disenthralmem of the
enslaved millions of europe where is the
man who may trace relationship to bunker
hill or lexington that doesnt burn with a
desire to aid the noble men who are strug
gling for their tights in the old world
very ood and very rational no doubt
after the scheme lias been fully explained to
the relations of bunker hill and lexington
it might puzzle a philosopher to find out what
is ment by tracing relationship to bunker
hill we suppose however that in the ex
pression there is a poetical ellipsis pnd the
writer means to he understood to refer to the
men who ought at bunker hill and lexing
i ton now may we not be allowed to hint
that it is a very spurious kind of sympathy
with the enslaved that travels off some four
i thousand miles for an object when there ire
enslaved milliona at home on whom it migh
be expended with great advantage charity
begins at home more especially is this the
case when the charity is more than ueually
required to whom are out three millions
of slaves to look for deliverance if we neglect
them let us boast about our republicanism
as we may it is quite beyond dispute that
there is no slavery in eurape scarcely any
where elseto be compared in diabolical atro

should cheer and incite us to vigorous effort
for the present year
so fully have the various circles through
out our hounds identified themselves with u
in this work and so much of experience have
the past years given us and them that all
which we consider now necessary to be done
is to revert to the necessity of continued ef

must not come the folding of the hands nor
the rejxise of him whose labor is accomplish

overtook him and endeavored to get him to
the bridge fortunately two colored men
observing the chase joined the parlies and
effected the release of the fugitive hia pui
suers making good their escape across the
liver
the seizure of a man in open day in one
of the most public thoroughfaiea of the cap
ital for the purpose of reducing him to bon
dage did as might be expected meate a
considerable excitement among tbe citizens
the friends of humanity understanding
that the slave catchers on the other side
of the river had a considerable force thoeght
it best to remove the fugitives to a place
where they would be secute until evening
when they would be put onj their northern
journey presuming from what bad trans
pired that an effort would be made to recap
ture the fugitives in the evening same twen
tyfive or thirty perons assembled in tha
neighborhood where the fugitives were se
creted for the purpose of affording them
protection
the constable af the borough who
it was thought was acting in concert with tbe
slave catchers came up to the peraoua who
had thus assembled and ordered them to dis
perse as as considered the ass emblsge un

whet was the reuse of the sasentbiafe afto
being informed that it was peaceable orderly
aad quiet cotnmeoeed together with hia
posse without orderiag them to disperse
to beat them with their dabs and sticks
the colored men retaliated and the resell
was that urn sheriff and his posse were en
tirely vanquished and not to flight not
being satisfied with their first adventure and
feeding as they said that the hooor of the
community was at make they put a wil
ful falsehood in circulation that the colored
people were assembling h short street foe
the purpose of mobbing urn whites mes
sengers were dispatched with this falsehood
to the different grogshops is town for the
purpose of raising recruits failing how
ever to procure a sufficient number by that
course of piocedure and after holding a
counsel at the corner of short street they
thought it would be necessary to call out the
military accordingly a requisition was
made on captain w foster for the use oi
his company to quell a riotous disposition
that existed among the colored people in
short street the company with great
alacrity obeyed the call and about  oclock
other good citizens of the borough were ar
oused from their slumber by the sound oi
the fife and dram of captain ws company
on their way to the scene of the riot to
shoot downas they said the d d niggers
they joined the sheriff and his party at the
corner of third and market and this molt
headed by the constable of the borough with
two large horse pistols moved boldly forward
to the ssene of action
finding on their arrival that the neighbor
hood was peaceable and that there was noth
ing for them to quell ihey commenced treat
ing and knocking the colored men who were
standing before their own doors one man
was knocked down at his own door and
dragged to jail and on the next morningwas
admitted to bail in the sum of one humred
dollars to answer the charge of riot at the
next criminal court another who was
standing as a spectator was knocked down
ttid kicked and thumped till they got him to
prison with the cry of kill the d d nigger
a third was chased a considerable distance
and finding they could not oveitake him they
fired after him but fortunately he escaped
unhurt on morxfty morning three airests
were made but the stool pigeons not be
ing able to prove that they had broken the
peace that they had participated in the
riot they were promptly dismissed
the proceedings of the sheriff shell
and his mob are loudly condemned by the res
pectable portion of the citizens and they
think he has transcended his duty in theis
case
it is generally thought that the sheriff and
constable were under instructions from the
slavecatchers and that their effort to dis
perse the colored people was uothing more
than to give the kidnappers a chance to con
lummate theii object be this as it may they
and the kidnappers were entirely frustrated

harmless if they left any room to suppose
there might be a woman inside or it they
would gire us the shape of a garment hong

give us fashions that look as if they could be

an appeal in behalf of the western
new york antislavery fair
earnestly desiring the abolition of slavery
in this land and being deeply convinced that
this result can only be accomplished by renew
ed efforts to change our present corrupt moral
sentiment the undersigned members and
friends of the western new york antislavery
society again make their appeal to the
friends of the slave in behalf of their annual
bazaar which will be held in rochester in
december next
while we have been cheered and gladdened
bv the progress already made and the good
lleadv done and while we rejoice to observe
that friends have been raised up to plead the
cause of the bondman among persons and in
quarters where we had least expected them
we still see the harvest to be great and the
laborers to be few and instead of relaxing
our efforts we are impressed nth a sense of
the duty of doubling our diligence and ap
plying more closely our energy to the means
if advancing this holy appeal the
more boldly to our ftiantto because those for
whom we plead cannot plead lor themselves
while we are surrounded by our domestic
circle with none to molest or make us afraid
there are three millions of men and women in
our own land doomed to abject shivery and
chains tobbed of every rightcivilsocial
personaland political remembering those
uf bonds as bound with them we desire to
plead their cause as though they were on our
swn limbs and the knotted lash were applied
to our own backs
while to obtain means for enlightening the
public mind is the strong motive for holding
our annual fair it is not the only ooe a
great amount of good may be traced direvtlv
to such occasions many who are now ac
tive workers in behalf of ibis holy movement
became first interested in it through the in
strumentality of those annual exhibitions of
antislavery industry tact and skill
the present object of the rochester anti
slaverv bazaar is for the general enlighten
ment of the public mind ou the subject of sla
very recognizing the north star published
in ous city as an efficient antislavery in
strumentality we propose that the
by the sale of articles at the
behalf of which we here appeal ahall be
mainly appropriated to tht support ot that
isss acknowledge the prompt as
aistance rendered to out last fair by our
friends and coadjutors in
owu state wisconsin and michigan and we
earnestly solicit ber continued cooperation

if it should so happen that as regards
me any one should wish to cast t kind
glance behind the curtain which con
ceals a somewhat uneventful hie he
may discover that i was born on the
banks of the aura a river which flows
through ajq and that several of the
venerable and learned men of the uni
versity were in godfathers at the
age of three i was removed with eiy
family from my native country of fin
land of this part of my life i have
only retained one single memory
this memory is a word a mighty name
which in the depths of paganism was
pronounced by the finnish people with
fear and love and is still so pronoun
ced in these days although perfected
by christianity i still fancy that i often
hear this word spoken aloud over the
trembling earth by the thunder of thor

both in pagan and christian times
if any one kindly follows roe from
finland into sweden where my father
purchased an estate after he had sold
his property in finland i would not
trouble him to accompany me from
childhood to youth with the inward
elementary chaos ajid the outward
uninteresting and commonplace pic
ture of a family which every autumr
removed in their covered carraige
irom their estate in the country tc
their house in the capital and ever
spring trundled back again from theii
i house in the capital to their country
seat nor how there were young daugh
ters in the family who played on the
piano sang ballads read novels drew
in black chalk and looked forward with
longing glances to the future when
they hoped to see and do most wonder
ful things with humility i must
confess i always regarded myself as
a heroine
casting a glance into the family cir
cle it would be seen that they collect
ed in the evening in the great draw
 ing room of their country house anc
read aloud that the works of the ger
man poets were read especially schil
ler whose don carlos made a profounc
impression upon the youthful mind o
one of the daughters particular

show tiiat a heavy reality of sorrow wa
spreading by degrees a dark clouc
over the splendor of her youthu
dreams like early evening it earn
over the path of the young pilgrim o
life and earnestly but in vain she en
deavored to escape it the air wai
dimmed as by a heavy fall of snow
darkness increased and it became night
and in the depth of that endless win
ter night she heard lamenting voice
from the east and from the ivest from
plant and from animal from dyiug nu
 ture and despairing humanity and she
saw life with all its beauty its love iti
i throbbing heart buried alive beneath
chill covering of ice heaven seemec
dark and void there seemed to hei
no eyes even as there was no heart
all was dead or rather all was dyinj
excepting pain
there is a significant picture at tin
commencement in every mythology
in the beginning there is a bright an
warm and divine principle which allie
itself to darkness and from this unior
of light and darknessof fire and tear
proceeds a god i believe tha
something similar to this takes place ii
every human being who is born to i
deeper life and something similar tool

looking at her a few years later i
will be seen that a great change ha
taken place in her her eyes hav

that light she has exclaimed with tear
of joy death where is thy sting

if it be desired to hear anything o
my writings it may he said that the
began in the eighth year of my age
when i apostrophised the moon ir
french verses and that during tha
part of my youth i continued to writ
in tie same sublime strain i wrote
under the impulse of restless youlhfu
feelingsl wrote in order to write
afterwards i seized the pen under the
influence of another motive and wrou
that which i had read
horrible adventure
the writer of the following letter
having been out shooting at kirdee
near poonah lay down to rest under a
tree when suddenly he was aroused by
he furious baying of his dogs on
turning round  beheld a anake of the
cobra da capella species directing ite
course to a point that would approxi
mate very closely on my position is
an instant i was on my feet the mo
ment the reptile became aware of my
presence in nautical phraseology il
boldly brought to with expanded hood
eyes sparkling and neck beautifully
arched and the head raised about two
feet from tha ground and oscillating
from side to side in a manner plainly
indicative of a relentless foe i seized
he nearest weapon a short bamboo
left by the baaters and hurled it at my
opponent a head i was fortunate en
ough to hit beneath the eye the rep
tile immediatelyll and lay apparently
lifeless without a moments reflection
 seized it a lulls below tba head haul
ad it beneath the shelter of a tree and
very coolly began to examine be mouth
for the poisoned fangs of which natu
ralists apeak so modi
while in the act of forcing open the
month with a stalk i felt the head sfi
i ding through my hand and to mr as
tonishment became aware that i had
i now to dontead with the moat deadly of
reptiles in its foh strength and vigor
 indeed i was in a moment convinced of
this for as  tightened my hold of the
throat its body became wreathed
around my neck and arms if the
reader is aware of the universal dread
in which the cobra de oapeua is held
throught india and the almost instant
i death which invariably follows its bite
he will in some degree be able to ira
agine what my feelings were at that
moment a faint kiud of disgusting
sickness pervaded my whole frame as
i felt the clammy fold of the reptile
lightning round my neck i still held
the throat but to hold it much longer
would be impossible
immediately under my grasp there
i was an inward working and creeping
i of the skin which seemed to be assist
ed by the tightness with which  held
itmy hand was gloved finding in
defiance of my efforts that my hand
each moment was forced closer to my
ace an idea struck me that were it
fn my power to transfix the mouth with
some sharp instrument it would pre
sent the reptile from using its tangs
hould it escape my hold my gun lay
at my feet the ram rod appeared to be
the very thing required which with
some difficulty i succeeded in drawing
out having only one hand disengaged
my right hand was trembliog with over
exertion and my hold became less firm
when  happily succeeded in passing
the rod through its upper jaw to its cen
tre it was not without considerable
hesitation that i let go my held of the
throat and seizing the rod with both
hands at the same time brought them
over my head with a sudden jerk and
disengaged the fold from iny neck
which had been almost tight enough to
produce strangulation lhere was
then but little difficulty in freeing my
right arm and ultimately throwing the
reptile from me to the earth where it
continued to twist itselt into a thousand
contortions of rage and agony to
run to a neighboring stream to bathe
my neck hands and lace in its cooling
h waters was my first act after dispatch
ing my formidable enemy this con
cludes a true though plainly told tale
 as a moral it may prove that when
 a man is possessed of determination
l coolness and energy combined with
reason he will generally come off tri

the ferocity of the tiger
health of cities
as a general rule when a body it
examined after death whether of a
child or adult one or more organa are
found in a diseased state a fact which
i induced a physician to state that he
looked upon every adult he met in the
 streets of london as a walking mu
iseumof morbid anatomy
 one grand means to prevent such
diseases is to have well ventilated
houses and to keep the air in motion
for in warm weather the air always
contains a large quantity of animal anc
vegetable matter in the form of ova o
infusoria and the seeds of vegetable or
 ganisms the act of breathing too
is a great cause of rendering the ail
 j impure
i the air in the lungs is exposed tc
l  of cells having a surface
 equal to thirty times that of the body
 so that during respiration the air it
deprived of oxygen amd becomes load
ed with deadly carbonic acid gasanc
is rendered totally unfit for a seconc
respiration being no longer atmospher
i ic air but a poisonous gas a seconc
cause of the deterioration of air is the
 combustion of lamps gas lights can
 dies tc a single candle is nearly ai
injurious to the air as a human being
two fourteen hole argand burners con
suine as much ait as eleven men
a third source of atmospheric impu
rity is the vapor loaded with anitna
 matter given off from the lungs anc
the skin each of these parts pour oui
r an ounce of fluid every hour so that
in a church containing  people 
gallons of noxious fluid are given of
 in two hours
j a fourth source of bad air in towni
is the large quantity of decomposing
animal and vegetable matter left tc
give off efhuvia and the difficulty there
is in the renew al of the air in towns b
means of the w inds on account of the
 vicious mode of their construction anc
their very large size
certain diseases are traceable to the
 want of fresh air such as fever con
 sumption scrofula deafness and thai
most fertile ongin ot numerous disea
es the commoni cold
in england and wales  peo
pie die annually of consumption anc
i the geater number of cases is amonjj
indoor laborers and m the city of new
york about  die of consumption
per annum most of these being confin
ed within doors
one grand means ot promoting health
would be the construction of better ven
ulated houses no living sleeping
ior working room should contain lest
i than  superficial feet nor be lest
than a feet high and it should have
one window at least opening at the top
also an open fireplace to the chim
i ney
every building in which uaed
should have plans to carry off the pro
ducts of combustion and not allow them
to escape into the room and also to
supply fresh air
diseases that arise from a want of
ventilation are a scourge to society
those who are merciful to animals
should not forget that they need plenty
f fresh air likewise this we are
sorry to say is but little thought of by
the majority horses are housed most
miserably in our cities and this is one
great cause of a disease called the
heaves
the high rents for both dwelling
bouses among the poor and for stabler
of our carmen are no doubt the cause
of potting op with mall apartments
what the remedy for this evil is we
sre not able to divine and a great and
growing evil it is

present sorrow will be weary and will
