the americannew slave law
mr editor the fugitive slave
bill which when the last packet left
had just passed the senate of the united
states and is probably by this time be 
come the law of the land throughout
the vast transatlantic federation is a
measure of such enormity so atrocious
a violation of the plainest dictates of
right and justice that in no country
where a free and honest press exists
ought its adoption to be unmarked by
the strongest reprobation this bill
will make slave states ol all the states j
it recognizes and extends all the claims
over fugitives hitherto set up by the
southern states disposes of all doubt j
ful points in favor of the pursuer and
against the fugitive and supplies every
lack of legal power by which in many
cases the effect of wicked laws may
have been practically neutralized i
how such a triumph to a demonical
principle has been obtained is not yet i
apparent on what grounds the sanc
tion of the house of representatives
is so confidently anticipated is still to
be explained but if the vote of hu j
inanity and truth can resound across j
the atlantic in time to make congress j
pause in its downward and damning
course if it can be heard in time to
encourage the constitutional interposi j
tion of the new president by his veto j
on this nefarious projectsomething
will have been done for the redemption
of our common nature from a foul dis
grace and the striped and starry ban
ner may wave the more proudly for
escaping a darker stain than any in
flicted by defeat on land or sea
the bill proposes to enact that
wherever a fugitive his or her color
need not be blackthousands of slaves
are fair as europeans is claimed in a
district court the affidavit of tiie purj
suer shall be taken as conclusive proof
that the runaway is his property the 
testimony of the alleged slave is not to
be taken as evidence at all and the j
deposition of the pursuer is not to be
taken according to the legal forms of
the free state in which the man
hunter finds his victim but according
to those of the slave state from which
the allegedrunaway is said to have es
caped this is an allowance for sla
very to lord it over the union the in
stitutions of the free states succumb
before those of the slave states the i
local laws and forms of the south are
made paramount truely the spirit of
the pilgrim fathers is tamed down in
their posterity let this doctrine
spread in europe let it be conceded
that a free soil does not make a free i
man and there is no longer any refuge
from oppression independent states
indeed why you new englanders
will be nothing but the slave and the
slavecatchers of the south you will
be their mantraps their
republicans faugh you wilt make
the word stink in european nostrils
thedespotism of a claimant conclu
sive evidence the contrary deposi
tion not admissible in any trial or
hearing under this act what should
we say of such a law if the disputed
properly were a silver spoon and not
a living human being what should
we say were the property a dog the
probable abuse is obvious thousands
of free men and women may and will
be kidnapped the marvel seems how
anybody should be secure under the
present law we read in the same
journal that details the progress of the
bill how the old oachtnan at wash
ington of threesuccessive presidents
has hud his wife  yearn old his three
daughters and three grandchildren all
seized and carried off by a slavetrader
from baltimore to be sold to the
highest bidder the old tnan had pur
chased his own freedom some years
ago but that might not have availed
him under the new law there is work
enough in him to he worth a custom
house oath and judges in the district
courts of the states will be found to
carry this law into effect what an
infernal mockery of the forms of justice
such judges they gay wear no
horsehair wigs upon their heads they
ought to wear hempen halters around
their necks
any person according to this bill
aiding or abetting the escape or inter
posing to prevent the arrest and recon
veyance will be subject to a fine of 
 dollars to six months imprison
ment and to a forfeiture of  dol
lars by way of civil damagaa to the
pursuer really the contriver of then

are not matters of opinion we may
as well be asked our opinion of sordid

and for which reprobation is not a moral
necessity of human nature
a runaway slave is a man trying to
catch his manhood he aeeka to be

property in hts own thews and sinews
being a man he will not confess tc
being a beast the inalienable own

the rights which he aseeits are in theii
right is of no sex truth is of no color god is the father of us all and ale men are brethren
nature indefeasible his flight only
shows that he is not debased so low as
to repudiate the heavengiven charter

with difficulties and perils the most
humane amongst them may hesitate to
say that they clearly see their way out
of it let them confess as much and
the world will listen without inter
ruption let them devise plans though
of long gradation to emancipate their
brethren and the world will approve
let them cry for help out of their
depths and good men every where will
bestir themselves to aid but there
seems nothing in them of this earnest
nesss and becoming humanity they
boast and swagger and show them
selves encroaching this same fugi

antiblavery meeting in new
castle
on thursday evening a public meet
ing was held in salemchapel hood
street newcastleupontyne in pro
motion of the the consumption of free
labor in preference to slavelabor
products the attendance was numer
ous
on the motion of mathew foster
esq seconded by mr challoner the
rev j c brouce was called upon to
preside and on taking the chair brief
ly adressed the meeting congratulating
the friends of the slave ou the recent
intelligence from the united states
that the scale was turning and the
free states acquiring a preponderence
applause
the rev h h garnet who was
warmly received by the meeting spoke
at considerable length necessarily em
bracing much of the same matter
which entered into his gateshead ad
dress he referred however to an
interesting manner to the news just
received from the united states the
struggle he said which had long been
in progress beyond the atlantic had
terminated for a season since
march last a conflict had been waged
which for fiercenes and persever
ance was unprecedented in the histo
ry of the republic the combatants
on the one side demanded that the
bloodstained banner of slavery should
wave over every inch of soil in the
union from the banks of the potomac
to the fartherest verge of california
this pretension was resisted by the
other party and the result was the ad
mission of new mexico into the union
with the wilmot proviso leaving th
door open to slavery while california
came into the confederation on her
own terms utterly repudiating com
pulsory involuntary labor applause
the modern and as many learned
men contended the ancient land of
ophir people from all quarters of the
world had unfurled on the lofty peaks
which teemed to guard the pacific the
flag of freedom and its folds were
proudly reflected io the deep blue wave
of the free and chainless sea cheers
but if this glad intelligence filled his
mind with joy and exultution his hap
piness was chastened by the knowledge
that the farfamed fugitive slave bill
bad passed both houses of congress
and was now the law of the united
states it was often asserted by the
apologists of american slavery that
the negroes were kindly treated and
content with their condition but if so
why were there  fugitive slaves
in canada and  we understood
mr garnet to say in the free states
of the union now the slaveholders
had long been anxious to obtain a law
which should enable them more readily
to drag back the fugitive to slavery
the supreme court of the republic
against whose judgment there was no
appeal had decided that the slavehold
er wherever he found his slave might
seize and repossess him but this was
not sufficient mr henry clay the
roost popular and at the same time
the most wicked man in the u slates
a slaveholder and womanwhipper
one of the most cruel men that had
ever existed from the day of hrod
to those of haynau laughter and ap
plause mr clay maintained the
doctrine that wbat the law declared to
be property was property and the
whole course of legislation for 
rochester n t thursday october  

years had held the slave ha said try
be property the bill which founded
upon this assumption hehatf fff r
ried enacted that if any
made oath that go and so living at this
or that place wherever it migmfhe
was his slave the officers of tte yoited
states were hound to delivel v the
aiaawhaiki arefroitfer was
der no obligation to make the claim in
person he could send his oath and
his agentand that was enough the
persoa seized might demand a juryi
when he was carried backa jwfy o
slaveholders a jury of wotvev to try
the lamb now to understand the true
character of this law the meeting
should be aware that there were places
in the united states where the slave
was as safe as if he were in newcastle
to meet this fact there was a clause
providing that if any person interfered
between the agent of the slaveholder
and the negro whom he claimed and
the latter should in consequence es
cape the person so interfering must
pay the value of the fugitive or if the
escape should occur in a mob and no
individual could be made responsible
then then the cost must be made good
by the stale in which the rescue took
place was ever such an outrage
committed until now in the name o
law or justice since the days of the in
famous jefferies all over the union
there were negroes livingfugitive
slaves two thirds of his own congre
gation in geneva were escaped ne
groes his own wife and children
might be seized under this bill and
hurried into the south it was a mea
sure to scatter the seeds of civil war
throughout the union and it would not
surprise him were it to provoke a
dreadful conflict he was a man of
peacebut if the agent of the slave
holder were to enter his house and lay
hands upon his wife and child could
human naure tamely suffer them to be
torn away to slavery hear hear
mr garnet proceeded to state that it
slaves sold well in america you might
be sure that cotton was high in liver
pool and virce veca britain in fact
was the main prop and stay of slavery
and slavery could best be struck down
by the withrawal of british custom he
bsw no prospect of the abolition of
american si very save in tirrender
ing of it unprofitable or in arf uprising
of human naure against the outrage
hear hear
the rev dr pennington also a
fugitive slave referred to the slave
chase at washington narrated in an
other column and said that if such
beenes occurred even on the soil of
slavery what might be expected in the
free states under the new bill it
was a bill which he deliberately de
clared could not be enforced the
law would prove a nullity dr pen
nington exhorted the meeting to pur
chase wherever they had the choice
free in preference to slavelabor pro
duce he rejoiced to know that such
a feeling was spreading in great bri
tain and that in lancashire the manu
facturers were anxiously looking to
new fields for the supply of cotton
a collection having been made
thanks were voted by acclamation on
the motion of the rev t pottinger
to ir pennington and mr garnet
and with a vote of thinks to the chair
man the proceedings closed
it must have struck very reflecting
mind in the meeting that american
slavery is sufficiently condemned by
the fact that it insolently reduces to
the level of the brutes men like mr
garnet and dr pennington who may
take their stand by the side of the
proudest saxon on either side of the
atlantic gateshead observer
the slaveholderslast move
the senate of the united states has
just adopted a measure which gives a
new and deeper interest to the great
controversy respecting american sla
very if the measure in question shall
receive the sanction ofthe other branch
of the legislature a state of tnings
will speedily arise in which great num
bers of upright and faithful citizens
will find themselves called upon to
choose whether they will obey the law
of inan or the law of god it has been
long contended by some of the oppo
nents of slavery that the free states
are sharers in the guilt of those with
whom they are federally united inas
much as the constitution binds them to
aid in restoring fugitive slaves to their
masters the most common answer to
this we believe has been that the
constitutional provisions respecting the
surrender of fugitive slaves were in a
great measure neutralized and made a
deadletter by the habits and feelings
of northern citizens and that it would
be unwise and unpatriotic to jeopardise
the continuance of the union and to
disturb the very foundations of the
government in order to get rid of an
enactment which was so much worse
in appearance than in reality the
species of compromise however is
about to be blown to the winds by the
adoption of a new and stringent law
which will require from the authorities
ofthe northern states as much activity
and vigilaace in barring up all the cus
tomary avenues of escape from bond
age as if they were the paid police of
their southern neighbors nor is this
all the new law wjll not only de
mand that the energy of the north be
employed in seizing and sending back
fugitive to the prison and the lash
but will place the life and liberty of ev
ery fre ptrson of color at tbe mercy of
any scoundrel who upon oath may
claim him as his property the alfi
davit being duly made the authorities
ar to give effect to the law without
listening to a single syllable which the
fugitive or supposed fugitive can say
in bis own defence the evidence of
the unhappy person placed in this cruel
predicament is prohibitedas something
s unfit for the ear of justice
ihanuwani fimiher
carrytng off his victim he has
reason to dread of rescue the authori
ties are to take upoa themselves the
task of conveying the snpoosed slave
to his place of punishment and if a
rescue does take place the people of
the state in which it happens are to
compensate the slaveowner
when we are told that an act like
this has passed the senate of th united
states in this present year  we
scarcely know how to express our
amazement there is in it a shame
less defiance of the opinion of the civ
ilized world which an assembly inclu
ding the moat eminent statesmen of
america might have been expected to
avoid as impolitic even if they did no
think it immoral it is however only
a new proof that the statesmanship of
america is of a very unscrupulous
character its system of courting and
managing the popular passions is an
elaborate political jesuitism according
to which a great end felt to be desira
ble is held to justify any means by
which it can be attained there was
muh in the recent proceedings relative
to the new settlements calculatd to
alienate the slaveholding interests
now they are to be propitiated for
reasons in which it is to be feared tf
genuine concern for human rights had
little share the extension of slavery
was powerfully resisted but now the
friendship of the offended slaveholders
is to be purchased back by a legislative
guarantee that the slavery which al
ready exists shall be made as perma
nent as the constitution
it is also possiblefor of men who
do such things no suspicion can be too
unworthythat this new movement is
only a sham concession the law may
be brought forward in the belief that
the northern states will not execute it
and that those of the south may be ap
peased by finding the legislature ready
to do for them all that is in its power
but the intention of the authors of such
a law is a raster of very little conse
quence in any case of the attempt to
briog it into play will be made both by
real and pretended owners ot runaway
slaves and the applications of such
parties will infallibly give rise to a se
ries of contests between law and con
science by which for a time society
may be exposed to serious disorders
the ultimate result however can be
nothing else than a great triumph ot
freedom yve are indeed greatly
mistaken if this new and odious con
cession to the slave power does not
give a vast and decisive impulse to the
abolitionist agitation
the legislature of the united states
in adopting so monstrous a measure
will place law in direct antagonism
with some of the noblest and strongest
feelings of human nature the very
existence of a great social wrong like
slavery does indeed involve such an
tagonism but in the strife the human
heart is perpetually gaining upon and
subduing the evil with which it is at
war the props and defences of sla
very are continually giving way before
the moral pressure which hears against
them and every attempt to put new le
gal supports under the tottering fabric
only extends the surface against which
the tide of opinion beats with an ever
growing force this hew proslavery
law must stimulate into active hostility
many opponents of slavery who at
present content themselves with a
great protest against it the bulk of
mankind care little tor the refinements
of reasoning many of the best citi
zens of the northern states are in no
way troubled by clauses in the consti
tution whichhowever bad in themselves
are nullified by custom but let one
of these men who has never taken part
in antislavery dem nstration be call
ed upon to aid personally in forcing
back some trembling refugee to his
chains and stripes from which he has
escaped and what will be the conse
quence hundreds and hundreds we
can have no doubt whatever will be
ready to declare that no power on earth
shall force them to become sharers in
such iniquity the case is one iu
which law will compel men to ask bn
what right or authority it commands
obedience and when it can plead noth
ing but the will of congress against
the clear and imperative voice of con
science the most determined adherents
of order and peace may be driven into
resistance it is true that the majority
may still be disposed to take the easi
est path and may assume that which is
legal most necessarily be right but the
men whose moral force of character
give them influence over others will
be those to whom such acquiescence
must necessarily appear degradation
they will resist the new slavery
ordinance as a violation of the highest
law by which human beings are bound
and whatever discussion or agitation
follows from such resistance must
spread the opposition by awakening in
other minds those universal sentiments
of justice which no force of custom can
extinguish in the human breast lon

i dear sir an erroneous account
haring lately appeared in some of the
american papers of tbe assault on
mr douglass i hand you a true state
ment from bis own pen as published iu
jfc iuur ewr t wt nicn he is propri
etor and editor
my readers will hare observed in
the north star of last week an account
of a most cowardly assault made upon
me in the battery at new york like
most other statements which emanate
from the american press this one tho
partly true is false in several particu
lars it is not true that i walked down
broadway with two white females rest
ing on my arm in the case alluded to
although i insist upon the right to do
so it is not true that the ladies in
company with me placed themselves
under the care of the gentleman ruff
ian who assaulted me nor of any of
tee villanous party nor of anybody
else it is not true that i sneered at or
spoke to the loafing assailants the
facts briefly are these myself and
friends were going to philadelphia and
supposing that the john potter de
parted from new york at  oclock
we rode down a quarter before  but
found on our arrival that we had been
mistaken the time of starting being
half past one oclock the interval
therefore we passed in the battery
when about to leave for the steamer
five or six men surrounded us assail
ing us with all sorts of coarse and
filthy language and two of them finally
struck the ladies on the head while
another attacked me i warded off the
blows with my umbrella and the cow
ardly creatures left without doing any
personal harm thinking we should
not be disturbed by them again we
walked slowly toward the steamer one
of the mob observing that i was off my
guard ran up behind me and before i
could put myself in a position to ward
off the assassins blow i was struck in
the face these are the whole facta
of the case i never was more calm
or selfpossessed than when under this
beastly assault i felt no indignation
towards the poor miserable wretches
who committed the outrage they
were but executing upon me the behests
of the proslavery church and c ergy
of the land doing the dirty work of
the men that despise them and who
have no more respect for them in re
ality than they have for me i shall
have more to say on my visit to new
york and philadelphia next week

it is no wonder that the slaveholders
and their allies hate mr douglass for
having so powerfully exposed the ini
quity of a system under which he so
long suffered when my friend wi
in belfast i lent a copy of his narra
tive to a mutual friendot ours did
you read it all doctor said i he
replied i think i have it all by heart
and in my opinion be is the stone in the
sling destined by god to overthrow the
goliah of slavery
thu good cause is progressingthe
congress cant go on without debating
the question recollect how it retarded
for a long time the election of a speaker
in the house of representatives yet
a few years ago no antislavery petition
would be read in either house
in last month i had an interview
with david turnbull esq one of the
judges of the mixed courts in jamaica
he is on sick leave his health having
suffered much from residence in foreign
climates he is the editor of an inter
esting work entitled movement for
the enforcment of the slavetrade
treaties for gratuitous distribution
the last and most important of which
was negotiated by the lord lieutenant
of ireland earl clarendon when am
bassador at the court of spain and
which treaty was based on the sugges
tions conveyed to the foreign office by
mr turnbull when british consul at
cuba the duties of which office he dis
charged so faithfully to the poor ne
groes illegally held in bondage that his
life was endangered and he had to
sleep on board a british ship of war in
the harbor of cuba mr turnbull
informed me that he lately met mr
rives in london the american minis
ter at paris who has long represented
virginia in the senate of the united
states and tbe owner of extensive
tracts of land in virginia with a pro
portionate number of slaves he ex
pressed his readiness to promote man
umission and removal of large numbers
of them as well as those of some
twenty of his neighbors as soon as he
is made aware that the necessary ar
rangements were completed for their
transit to tbe west indies and for their
reception there and i am happy to
inform you that mr turnbull has un
dertaken i believe the pleasing duty
of having these poor slaves taken to
jamaica where laborers are required
and where they will be no looger sub
ject to the lash of the taskmaster but
be paid for their labor mr law
reuce the american ambassador to
st james told mr turnbull that the
system of slavery is now so unprofita
ble and burdensome in six of the fif
teen slave states of the union namely
maryland virginia kentucky north
carolina tennessee and missouri
that the may hope tbe time will soon
come when slavery will be abolished in
those states mr rives entirely con
firmed the statement of his colleague
mr lawrence is not this cheering
news mr editor weil may the
friend of human freedom praise god
and taka couraga let them persevere
in a righteous agitation until slavery is
abolished throughout the world

when the rev dr pennington and

m union chapel the addresses of
the gentlemen were eloquent persua
sive and thrilling and were received
with expressions of the highest appro
bation many of their statements filled
the audience with horror and drew
from them the deepest sympathy
they showed that the history of slavery
on the cotton fields of america is the
very epitome of human misery the
slaves are treated like beasts of bur
dentheir family ties are disregarded
they are constantly worked under the
whipeven the women being flogged
unmercifully when they fail in accom
plishing their appointed task should
they attempt to escape they are hunted
with bloodhounds and not unfrequentiy
shot down like wild beasts the aver
age life of a slave on a cotton planta
tion is estimated not to exceed seven
years they exhibited american sla
very as they had seen and felt it they
showed its debasing character injus
tice and impolicy even in a temporal
light the oppression cruelty and
wretchedness of the fugitive slave law
lately passed by both houses of con
gress and which is now the law in op
eration in that country they also
pointed out the means by which the
system may be entirely suppressed viz
by using free labor produce and re
fusing to touch or taste any article pro
duced or manufactured by slaves in
the united states brazil and spanish
colonies there are seven millions of
slaves who produce cotton sugar rice
tobacco and coffee which articles are
consumed in large quantities by the
british nation they give the slave
holder their money or manufactures in
exchange for the products of the blood
stained fields and thus furnish the
means for continuing the atrocious sys
tem the remedy is apparentabstain
from their produce and slavery must
cease a whiff of a slavedriver was
shown which has often been wet with
the blood of the oppressed slave the
whip was nine feet in length a fearful
weapon to be applied in the punish
ment of a human being manacles for
the legs and neck which had been
manufactured in birminghamwere also
shown and produced sensations of the
most intense nature and loud cries of
shame shame both meetings were
most enthusiastic the rev james
pringle from newcastle revds s

efforts to sustain the above named paper have
formed an association for the purpose of
bolding a fair during christmas week in aid
of the north star
to those acquainted with the character of
this jpaper it is needless to speak of its merits
or of the untiring zeal and sincere devotion
of its editor eminently qualified as frederick
douglass is to promote the elevation of his
oppressed and despised people at the north
he is also equally qualified to sympathize with
our brothers and sisters who are still in
chains and slavery at the south to tell of
their wrougs to vindicate their rights and by
the blessing of god to hasten the day of
freedom to the three millions of our enslaved
fellow countrymen
we therefore regard the north star
as one of the most effective antislavery in
strumentalities now in the field and in this
night of darkness and gloom we look to it
as the beacon to guide us until the day
dawn and unclouded sunshine bursts upon
us
we call upon all true friends of the alav

present occasion

distinguished advocotes of emancipation
from other states have been invited to be with

what now we ask is an earnest and
faithful response from the people of our own
state who profess abhorrence of the constant
ly increasing evils of american slaveryevils
that are every day developing themselves in
some new phase in the moral social and
political communities in which they move
and for whose existence no man nor woman
in our state may deny their proper share ol
responsibility it is not a time when we may
properly shrink from the duty our reason
point to and when our logcherished faith
makes binding upon us the hounds of the
slave gang are upon the track of the fugitive
armed with the weapons of law and eager
for those tiiumphs which only fiends can shout
overthe triumphs of slavery and its curses
and its chains over the liberty which makes
a boon worthy of thanksgiving and which
some few of the dark sons of africa have
been so fortunate as to purchase for them
selves and their wives and children if we
have hearts and remember the professions
we have made we shall not fail to come to
gether on this occasion and ulte in noble and
earnest language our detestation ot an un
righteous law and our determination to re

n y and frederick douglass in relation to
the case of w l chaplin a citizen of this
state incarcerated in montgomery jail mary
land and also to review the clauses of the fu
gitive slave bill mr hathaway had visited
mr chaplin in the prison house at washing
ton and had beheld the sufferings and heaid
related the circumstances attending the arrest
of that noble man from his own mouth
mr chaplin did not abduct the persons
said to be the slaves of messrs  oombs and
stevens he met them by accident and
merely extended to them an act of courtesy
such as he would have extended to any man
mr chaplin did not know however that those
men were armed or lielieving as he does in
the sinfulness of all war he would not have
allowed them to ride in his carriage until they
had thrown away their arms mr hatha
ways appeal for sympathy and assistance to
rescue mr chaplin from the prison house of
bondage was most eloquent and impassioned
frederick douglass succeeded mr hatha
way and expatiated upon mr chaplins char
acter as a man and a christian liis address
was characterized by his usual fervid earnest

letter the editor
the fugitive slavcbiu and the writ of
habeas corpus new york express
i have just read ike opinion of ibe attorney
general of the united states which denies
that the fugitive slave bill suspends the
privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and
that this abominable and hellblack
enactment is in perfect accordance with the
constitution of the united states this
opinion appears to havs been given at the
request of the president before he signed the
bill and its publication is the first intimation
which the public have had that mr fillmore
ever permitted himself to indulge a scruple
oo the subject of giving hie sanction to the
bill in question the avidity with which this
opinion of a slaveholding attorney genera
has been seized upon by a portion of the
northern press is significant it is demon
strative as proofs of holy writ that they begin
to feel the rebound of their own devildirected
blows that they have overshot themselves
that the thunder cloud which they raised over
the oppressed is about to discharge its bolts
upon the oppressor this learned opinion is
published to shield the recreant head of our
doughface president and to allay the storm
kft iiurmwm um stlip wf state it is
thought that arguments which could convince
the northern president ought to satisfy the
northern people a slight mistake  appre
hend the judgment of the president is not
the judgment of the people mr crittenden
had but one objection to remove from the
plastic mind of millard fillmore his diffi
culties are greater when he undeiiakes to
convince the public mind the former can
be iufluenced by mere legal technicalities and
musty judicial precedents but the latter
mounts above such contemptible barrien and
demands justice in the light of common
sense and the liberty of this the nineteenth
century the law is against justice agtinst
humanity it is cruel monstrous and iifet
nal and the northern mind revolts at it and
would do so though every line had btei
copied word for word from the constitutivn
it is of no avail for mr attorney general or
mr anybodyelse to tell the people that it ts
constitutional their own conscience airl
common sense tell them that the law it
wrong and that it ought not to be obeyed
and they will not obey it  arp no lawyer
and have not the ability if i had the disposi
tion to examine this letter of our kidnapping
attorney in the light of the law hut i know
enough to know that his conclusions are based
upon assumptions which are as absurd to the
eye of reason as they are dangerous to the
cause of liberty
r the whole letter is based on the assump
tion of the utter impossibility of a false claim
being made and upon the idea that the slave
r holder can and will with unerring certainty
i in every instance of pursuit place his fingers
upon the throat of the victim secured to him
by southern slave law now this assumption
of the impossibility of inutile and of the im
maculate purity of slavehcdd rs is simply
absurd wicked and impudent even if we
could acquit the slaveholder and slavecatcher
of the slightest desire to reduce freemen to
bondage free turn from ail suspicion that he
t feels the slighteat temptation to commit such
a crime and yet is it not plain to every mans
s common sense that the said worthy slave
f catcher is liable to commit a blunder a mis
take it seems to me that mistakes are inev
i itable in a matter like this a slaveholder
loses a slave in the yeai  he learns
that said slave lives in rochester n v he
i has not seen him for fifteen years and pei
haps scarcely thought of him for several
i years he avails himself of the new fugi
tive slave jhll to recapture his victim but
 in order to recapture him he must describe
i him bear in mind that this claimant is now
r to make a description of a person he saw fif
i teen years ago and that the said person must
answer to this description and that man is
not like an iron chest answering its descrip
 tion a bundled years after it is made but a
creature of constant change and you will
 fully appreciate the absurdity of the assump
tion of the impossibility of mistakes it is
obviously impossible that he should not make
 mistakesthe more especially as tho slave
holder will himself seldom cotne after the
slave but will merely send his agent who
 may or may not have personally known the
 alleged slave
but setting aside this consideration alto
r getlier and assuming the menial infallibility
 of slavecatchers can it be supposed that
j men who can bring themselves to the degra
i dation and viilany of hunting men for no
 crime tearing them away from their wives
 and helpless children and dooming them to a
jife of cruel torture and chains will have any
very suong moral sense left to discriminate
or to enforce discrimination in the selection of
their victims hoes not the very vocation of
the kidnapper deaden all the better qualities of
human nature and make the wretched man
engaged in it ft for the perpetration of any
crime which he may commit with less impun
ity t why is there not even now abundant
testimony on record of the selling of free citi
zens known to be such in the southern
states  and in view of such facts can any
northern man hesitate for one moment as to
the peril in which this fugitive slave bill
places every free colored man
mr crittenden holds the north to the
bond he says it is well known historically
and judicially that this clause of the consti
tution was made for the purpose of securing
to the citizens of alaveholding states the
complete ownership of slaves as property in
every slate or territory into which they
might escape let us grant the slaveholder
the full benefit of this wholesale statement
but does it follow that the north must obey
or submit to a law which strikes down jury
trial makes the privilege of the habeas corpus
a mockery and subjects every free colored
citizen of the north to the terrible liability of
being doomed to all the horrors of lifelong
slavery is congress more sacredly bound
under the constitution of the united states
to restore the slave to slavery than it is to
protect free meu in their liberty
the new york express a paper which
a few years sgo denounced me as a glib
tongued scoundrel because i told the eng
lish public that i was not safe from the kid
napper in any part of the united stales has
juined in the bloodhound bray in defence of
this fugitive slave bill and endorses also the
opinion of mr crittenden after commend
tog the written opinion to the piofound con
section u an 
felts at km of eery union nun mr brooks
of the express discourse aa follows
the pilb of mr crittendens opinion is
that the black fugitive from slavery has all
the rights that a white fugitive from justice
ms under the constitution and laws viz
the habeas corpusnot the uial by jury in
the state where taken but the trial by jury in
the state whence taken
mr crittendens opinion reduces the agi
tation to this issue has a black negro slave
more rights than a free white man under the
constitution v all who are agitators will
aay aye
the escaped slave has now the habeas
corpus in new york say and the trial by
jury in maryland if taken theie no white
freeman haa any more rights all who are
in favor of giving the negro more rights than
the white man will say aye
any day any white man demanded as a
fugitive from justice may be taken and car
ried off to georgia or louisiana without a
trial bt jury here and this has been the
law since  but no matter that is only a
white man
mr crittendens opinion takes fromsound
rational conserrative constitutional men ev
ery cse or desire for prolonged agitation
but will the abolition agitation atop no
sever
tts is not only flagrantly unjust but vio
i astir and bitteily malignant upon the face of
ifj  tire ompmwm tu frnm the
whips and chains of slavery with s felon
escaping from justice stamps the man who
could make it as a villain of the deepest dye
the colored people of new york ought to
keep an eye to men who can in the midst of
tnem hold such language certainly no col
ored man should be found willing to take and
pay for such a paper as the express
there is no similarity in the case of a fugitive
slave and a fugitive white man the white
man is presumed to be innocent until he is
proved to be guilty his rights are the same
in the state to which lie may be taken as
they are in the one from which he may be
taken he can have aye must have a jury
trial in open court and compulsory process
for obtaining witnesses in his favor when
once in he hands of the law he has the law
to defend and protect him whether he will
or not there is no danger of hie being re
moved or of his whereabouts being unknown
to his friends he can always be surrounded
with their sympathy and protected by their
vigilance not so with the recaptured fugi
tive he is taken from a state which is pre
sumed to be free to a state which is pre
sumed to be a slave statefrom a state
where he is shielded by the law to a state
where he is virtually condemned by the law
from a state where his friends may counsel
and advise him to a state where they are
forbidden under pains and penalties to come
he may be in the next hour after arriving in
a lave state and before any friend of his can
reach him sold away or whipped to death
or at any rate lost forever to his friends
the pretence that he may have a jury trial in
a slave state is a cruel and bitter mockery
ef the man in fetters foi it i may except
the single state of louisiana there is not one
in which a colored man car prosecute a white
man upon the testimony of colored men and
ibis the editor of the express ought to
know and doubtless does know false how
mr brooks has been in his slate
monks lame as he has been in his logic and
monstious as he is in his morality he has
made one truthful prediction in the article above

boston oct th
this city is now the scene of the most in
tense alarm it is positively asserted that
there are warrants now in the hands of the
united states marshal for the arrest and re
capture of three fugitive slaves and that wm
and bllen ciafts are two of the party to he
arrested mr crafts is aware of the fact
and refuses to leave boston he is armed
and resolved to stand his ground and in less
than an hour blood may flow in the streets of

resolutions adopted at the great meeting
i fanieul hall boston oct th
whereas the recent act of congicss
known as the fugitive slave law has caus
ed great anxiety among our fellow citizens of
color driving some of them from their homes
 and leaving others in a state of doubt and ter
ror incompatible with the power of enjoying
in safety and ranquilily their natural rights
and the blessings of life which are guaranteed
to every individual by the constitution of
r massachusetts and whereas we have assem
t bled in fanieul hall at their request to con
sider the condition of the fugitive slaves and
other colored petsons of this city under the
said law and have deliberated and counselled
 together therefore
i resolved that our moral sense revolts
against the fugitive slave law believing it
to involve the height of injustice and inhu
manity since it violates the golden rule of
christianity of doing unto others as we would
have them do to us and the command of god
himself uttered from mount sinai thou
shalt not deliver unto his master the servant
that hath eacaped from his master unto thee
resolved that as citizeus we denounce
this law as contradictory to the declaration of
independence as inconsistent with the pur
poses of the constitution of the united states
which was ordained to establishjustice and
secure the blessings of liberty and as in vi
violuiion of its provisions because it takes
away the benefit of the habeas corpus
the right of the people to be secure in their
persons against unreasonable seizures and de
prives men of their liberty without due pro
cess of law
resolved that we cannot believe that any
citizen can be found in this city or vicinity so
destitute of love for his country and his race
and ao devoid of all sense of justice as to take
part in teturning a fugitive under this law
resolved that we individually pledge to
our colored fellowcitizens who may be en
dangered by this law all the aid cooperation
and relief which the obligation of each of us
to the supreme law of god and right impose
upon ua and we accordingly advise fugitive
slaves and other colored inhabitants of this
city and viftinify to remain with us we
have no fear that any one will be taken back
to the land of bondage and we trust that such
as have already fled in fear will return to
their business and their homes s
resolved that as we believe this law to
be repugnant to the will of a vast majority of
the people of the united states their seiia
i tors and representatives ought to demand its
instant repeal at the next session of
congress
resolved that constitution or no consti
tution law or no law we will not allow a
fugitive slave tq be taken from massachu

amount ot food he had received in infancy
and childhood for his parents by their daily
labor had much more than paid for that not
for his clothing for he had none until he was
old enough to earn it and one months labor

tice that the master owed him for years of
service and as payment was not given he
at times stole his masters hogs and chickens
until finally the master hiving been battled
i for years became exasperated and offered a
large reward for his apprehension dead or

failures finally succeeded in capturing the
poor slave he killed one dog before he took
to a tree for which act his pursuers after
getting him down suffered the remaining

letter from josiah quincy sen
j ingersoll bowditch esqmy dear
sirhaving been requested to state my
viewß on the subject of the fugitive slaves
many of whom have been long domesticated
among us and who alarmed at the supposed
stringency of the new law relative to them
are preparing some to quit our country for
europe and others for canada and con
cerning whom there is to be a meeting of
citizens this evening i take the liberty to ad
dress this lettei to you which will embrace
some of my views on that topicand submit
them to your disctelion to be used or sup
pressed
in the first place then it ought in mv
opinion to give reasonable satisfaction to
that class of our inhabitants that in the
state of massachusetts no person has ever
been delivered to his master under the law of

i believe this to be literally the case it
is however possible in the lapse of nearly
sixty years cases may haveoccuredof which
theie is now neither memory nor record if
there have been any such they have been so
few as to form only exceptions that prove the
truth of the rule rather than evidence of
its falsity
persons therefore under these circum
stances ought to rest at ease with the as
surance ard in the confidence iesulting from
the above fact that in the state of massa
chusetts the law of  will be just as in
operative for sixty years to come as hr law
of  has been for nearly sixty years past
theie is indeed in the new law an ener
gy and a vigor of proceeding somewhat be
yond that obtained by the law of  and
this will undoubtedly operate in terrorem
on the slaves in the southern states and
thus diminish their attempts at freedom and
give more quiet of mind to their masters
the greater stringenev of the new law will
also operate in favor of their masters in re
spect to slaves who have taken up their resi
dence in stales adjoining slaveholding states
among the inhabitants of which there is no
i such genera repugnance to the slaveholding
system as exists among llie inhabitants of
massachusetts and where individuals may
easily be found who moved by cupidity
would readily stem the low tide of obloquy
and reprooch which exists in those states to
giving aid to masters in the recovery of their
slaves but no such fear or apprehension
concerning the power of the new law can
in my judgment reasonably exist within the
state of massachusetts past events are suf
ficient guarantees for the future the great
mass of the intelligent southern slaveholders
understand the universality of the feeling in
massachusetts on the subject of this law and
respect it and have neither expectation nor
desire that it shall be made to have a retro
spective or retroactive effect it is possible
that some one or two interested individuals
running for luck or desirous of creating ex
citement may attempt to put the law in force
in massachusetts but the great body of
southern slaveholders understand their inter
ests too well to desire to see crested in mas
sachusetts buch an excitement as would result
from an attempt like that affecting the slave
hamlet in new york whereby a peison long
residing as a freeman in the state should be
secretly seized handcuffed and hurried out
of it without aliowing him an opportunity to
apply to counsel for protection or to the law
of the state or the sympathies of the vicini
ty any man officer or lawman engaged
in such an attempt in the state of massa
chusetts if successful would i apprehend
find it difficult afterwards long to remain
resident in a land the feelings of whose in
habitants he had so universally outraged
the law of  was not deficient in strenth
it was ample for its objects and would have
been as effectual in massachusetts as it was
elsewhere its utter inefficiency here resulted
solely from the unanimous spirt pervading
the whole people of the state on the subject
of that law and from the inwrought tover
eignty in the minds of the people of this
state of the principle of the constitution of
the slate which secures to every human be
ing within it the light of trial by jury in
every caae affecting his life liberty or pro
late universality of this feeling within this
stale on this law is attributed moat falsely
to the labors of a class of men at this day
known by the name of abolitionists that
feeling existed long before any such class had
existence or even a name it was grown in
the grata it was infused by nature as a com
poncut clement into the blood of the people of
this state i have been intimately acquaint
ed with and a close observer of the character
of that people for sixty years and i do not
believe there has been a moment in which in
any populous district of this stale the law
of  could have been openly enforced and
without any pretenaion to the spirit of pro
phecy i foretell that the same will be the fact
of this law of 
 can apeak of ihia subject with a aotne
i peraona certainty ao far aa respeeu the
existence of the feeling prevalent on thin sub
ject fiftysix years age sometime about the
year  soon after the first law oa this
abject was passed  was sent for aa a couiv
aelloritlaw to appear before one of oar act
ing justices of the peacegrcenlealjto
defend a person then on trial under the charge
of being a slave on the claim of hia master
for delivery to him on appearing before
the justice  found the room filled with a
crowd of persons not one of whom i knew
but who were attending the court appearent
iy from interest or curifility among them
were the constables and the agent of the
master but who the other persona were or
what was the object of their assembling i
was ignorant  entered of course on my
duties an advocate called for the evidence
of the agents authority and denied the au
thority of the law of congress and of the
magistrate under it to deliver an inhabitant of
massachusetts into the custody of another
unless aftei trial by jury according to the
constitution of this stale while occupied
with my argument i was suddenly interrupt
ed by loud noise behind me and on turning
round i found to my astonishment both the
constables and the agent on the floor and the
alleged slave passing out of the room between
the files of bystanders which were opened to
the right and left for his escape
about a fortnight elapsed when  was cal
led upon by rufua creene amory a lawyer
of eminence at the boston bar in that day
who showed me a tenet rrom a sonmern
slaveholder directing him to prosecute joaiah
quincy for the penalty under the law of 
lor obstructing the agent of the claimant in
obtaining hi slave under the process estab
lished by that law
mr amory felt not leas than myself the
folly of auch a pretence and  never heard
from him or from any one anything more
upon the subject of prosecution this fact
and the universal gratification which the re
sult appeared to give to the public satisfied
my mind that unless by accident or stealth
or iu some very thin settled parts of the coun
try the law of  would forever be inopera
tive as the event has proved in massachu
setts and the same will in rny opinion be
the case as  have already said with the
law of 
the feeling and the origin of this univer
sality on tins subject in massachusetts is
i apprehend not well understood it had
its origin in no general disposition to inter
fere with the rights of southern slaveholders
but from the surprise and utter disgust of the
law of  which from the first pervaded
every class of citizens in massachusetts they
regard that law as violations the principle ol
the compact as they understood it when
they acceded to the constitution of the united
states in accepting that clause of that
constitution which provides that person
held to service or labor in any other state
and escaping into massachusetts should not
be discharged from such service or labor in
consequence of any law passed by her and
that she would deliver up on claim such per
sons to the party to whom the sir ice may be
due the people of massachusetts understood
that such claim should be enforced in confor
mity to and in coincidence with the known
and established principles of the constitution
of massachusetts that pledge the people
of massachusetts by accepting the clause in
the constitution of the united stales sol
emnly gave and that pledge the people ol
massachusetts have never violated and 
will add they will never violate it the
law of  undertook to modify the terms ol
that pledge availing itself of certain general
constructive powers of the constitution of the
united states and by wresting them to pur
poses to which they were never supposed ti
be applicable had it been anticipated by
the convention of massachusetts which
adopted the constitution of the united states
that the general powers it couveyed would be
so construed as to authorize the passing of a
law of congress riding over and trampling
down the great principles of the constitulior
of massachusetts which secures to everj
human being within the state the right o
trial by jury i cannot question for a moinem
that the objections which such an anticipation
would have raised would have been insur
ns mutable and the constitution of the unitec
states would never have received the sanction
of that convention could it have been an
ticipated by that people that a law would be
passed superseding that great principle ol
human fteedom and that in this state in
which the claimant of ownership fur a cow
an ox a horse or an acre of land could no
be divestej of his right without a trial by
jury yet that by the operation of such a law 
a citizen might be seized perhaps secretly
carried before a single magisliale witlioni
the right of proving before a jury his title ol
himself he sent out of the slate on the cer
tificate of such single magistrate into hope
less and perpetual bondage it is impossible
in my judgment that the constitution of the
u s could have received the sanction o
onetenth part ofthe people of massachusetts
the law of  unquestionably excited in
the people of the united slates universal sur
prise and disgust and a willingness to coun
teract the provisions of that law became a
settled feeling and policy of the people of the
state and this feeling became so general
that the attempt to enforce the law within the
state became hopeless from the first and
this  have already staled arose from no
general disposition in that people to interfere
with the rights of southern slaveholders
but from the general opinion prevalent in the
state that southern rights when prosecuted
in massachusetts should be pursued under
he principles of the laws and constitution of
this state this was the natuie of the pledge
given by this people in accepting the clause
hi the constitution of the united states re
lative to persons bound to service in other
states and escaping into this this pledge
the people of massachusetts even have vio
lated and as i believe never will violate
let the laws upon this subject be so modi
fied as to give to every person whose service
is thus claimed the right of trial by jury be
fore being sent out of the land and the uni
versal dissatisfaction would be almost wholly
allayed and the southern owner under the
law so modified will have no more obstacles
to his success than what is inherent in the
nature of such trial
let it not be said that this wauld be keep
ing the promise to the sense and breaking
it to the hope because not twelve men could
be found in the state who would do justice to
the slave owner on such trial without ad
mitting for a moment that there is any truth
in such a suggestion  will only sayif it be
true and no twelve men in the state could
be found who would not violate their oath
rather than be concerned in returning a slave
to his master cau any fact be imagined more
conclusive the folly of attempting to
enforce such a law within the limits of a state
in which such principles and feelings so uni
versally predominate
but  have extendedmy remarks beyond
my original intention my great object has
been to give such opinions and views as
ought in my judgment to give peace of
mind to the class of persons agitated by their
apprehensions from the recent congresiottal
lawand tended to assure them they may
abide safely as the have already done under
the protection of the laws of massachusetts
and the sympathies of her citizens and in
addition  would express s hope that nothing
should be done in this meeting giving the
subject a party or political aspect which i am
assured was not the intention of those who
originated the call of it

the following resolutions were adopted at
the recent large meeting of the colored citi
aena of philadelphia hold in the brick w so
le church of that city
whereas the declaration of american in
dependence declares it to be a aelf evident
truth that all men are created equal and
odowed by their creator with certain in
alienable tights among which are life liberty
and the pursuit of happineas and whereas
the constitution of the united states ait 
sec  declares that ihe privilege of the
writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended
and art  of the amendments that no
perami shall be deprived of life liberty or
property without due process of law and
whereas tho fugitive slave bill recently
enacted by the congress of the united states
ia in clear palpable violation of thane several
provisions therefore
 resolved that while we have hereto
fore yielded obedience to the laws of our coup
try however hard some of them have botae
upon us we deem this law so wicked so
atrocious so utterly at variance with the
principles of the constitution so subversive of
the object of sll law the protection of the
live liberty and property of the governed
so repugnsnt to the highest attributes of god
justice and mercy and so horribly cruel in its
clearly expressed mode of operation that wo
deem it our aacred duty a duly that we owe
to ourselves our wives our children anj to
our common nature as well as to the panting
fugitive from oppression to resist this law at
any tost ana shm trazsnts w  ftreby
pledge our lives our fortunes and out sacred
honor so to do
 resolved that we deem the laws of
uod at all times paramount to any human
laws and that in obedience l the command
to hide the outcast and bewray not him that
wandereth we shall never refuse aid and
shelter and succor to any brother or sister
who has escaped from the prisonhouse of
southern bondage but shall do all we can
to prevent their being dragged back to a sla
very inconceivably worse than death
 resolved that whenever a government
fraraeth mischief by law or decrees un
righteous decrees or concentrates all its
power to strengthen the arm of the oppressor
to crush the weak that government puts it
self in an attitude hosflle to every principle of
justicehostile to the liberal spirit of the age
and hostile to that god who executed right
eousness and judgment for all ihat are op
pressed r
 resolved that in our resistance fo this
most cruel law we appeal to our own boast
ed declaration of independence to the inhe
tent iighteousnes of our cause to the moral
sense of enlightened nations all over the world
and to the character of that god who by a
series of the most astounding miracles on
record declared hi sympathy lor the oppres
sed and bis hatred of the oppressor
 resolved that feeling the need in this
tryiug hour of the wisdom that erreth not
and the aim that is invincible to defend and
guide us we therefore call upon all ihe col
ored pastors of oui churches in the free
states so called to set apart the first mon
day night in each mouth for public prayer
and supplication that the hearts of all this
people may be so turned to the weak and the
oppressed that the operation of this cruel
law may be powerless and that the time may
soon come when liberty shall be proclaimed
throughout all this land unto all the in
habitants thereof
 resolved that we will hold up to the
scorn of the civilized world that hypocrisy
which welcomes to our shores the refugees
trom austrian tyranny and at the same time
would send the refugees from american sla
very back to a doom compared with which
austrian tyranny is mercy
 resolved that we endorse to the full
the sentiment of the revolutionary patriot of
v irginia and should the awful alternative be
presented to us w ill act fully up o it give
ite liberty or give me death
 resolved that a committee be ap
pointed to draft an appeal to the citizens of
the commonwealth of pennsylvania setting
torlh the antirepublican antichristian
antihuman nature of the fugitive slave
bill and asking of them their sympathy and
succor
resolved that having already witness
ed to some extent the cruel operations of this
law having felt such anguish as no language
can describe in seeing the wife flying from
her home and the embraces of her husband
and ihe husband compelled to fly from his
wife and helpless children to gain that secu
rity in the land ot a monarchy which they
could not enjoy in this republic we ask
the american people what have we done to
suffer such treatment at your hand and
may we not in the sight of that god with
whom there is no respect of persons appeal
to your sense of justice and mercy to have
this moat cruel law repealed as soon as con
gress shall reassemble and in the meantime
may we not ask you to create by ail lawful
means such a public sentiment as shall ren
der its operation upon us powerless
 resolved l hat in the spirit of bravado
neither affecting unconsciousness to the ctuel
ties of public sentiment and law in regard to
our unfortunate and abused race but seeing
dearly and knowing fully the unjust preju
dice existing against us using only those
moral means of truth sufficient as we deem
them by a certain process to the pulling
down the strong holds of the injustice and
wrong that now afflict us yet in view of the
unheard of atrociousness of the provisions of
this infernal fugitive si ave bill we sol
emnly declare before the most high god and
the world to resent to the death any attempt
to enforce it upon our persons adopting fully

of cecil county maiylandthe name of
the prisoner was henry garnet and he ap
peared to be about twentyseven years of age
it appears that he has been absent from his
master for eight years and during that time
haa been residing in different parts of this
city and county

friend when mr pierce appearedin that ca
pacity mr pierce made a motion to post

was carried for the purpose no doubt of
affording chas gibbons opportunity to at
tend
the right of property was traced through
several wills to the present owner but when
the identity was about being established the
motion to postpone was made and further
proceedings were stopped
jjidge grier in commenting upon the case
said that this the motion to postpone was
a precipituous proceeding yet he desired to
give the prisoner a fair opportunity to procure
proper defence and if he had proceeded in a
summary manner it would be owing to the

the force of the law and many paragraphs
appeared in the newspapers inciting the color

determined to maintain the full power and

tempted he would invoke the aid of the mili
tary and jn order to pieserve the sanctity of
the court the most stringent measures would

the laws of pennsylvania make it illegal
to place the prisoner in any of the jails of the
country the marshal is responsible for his
security and therefore marshal roberts took
the fugitive into custody the deportment
of mr jones throughout the proceedings
was calm and courteous
although his prsition was exceedingly em
barrassing he evinced no trepidation but ap
peared like one deteimined to maintain his
rights administered by the law the law
must be maintained at every hazard
this affaii of course ha  caused an im

in the case of henry garnet colored who
was arrested on t hursday as a fugitive from
labor from cecil county maryland was re
sumed yesterday morning before judges grier
and kane in the u s circuit court the
prisoner during thursday night was kept
in the custody of the  s marshal and as
no provision has been made in this state for
such prisoners he was not removed from the
court house
mr hugh w tener appeared on the part
of the claimant and messrs robert p
kane david paul brown charles gibbons
and william s pierce in behalfof garnei
judge grier explained to the respondents
counsel that ihe prisoner was charged with
being a fugitive from labor for a term of
years which was to cease upon his attaining
the age of thirty years under a will of mar
garet sanders the alleged former owner of
the respondent
mr tener opened the case he said that
he was desirous to submit the facts to the
court without comment and that if they
were not satisfactory to the court he would
not object to the discharge of the prisoner
he then offeied in evidence the will of mar
garet sanders bearing dale december lh
 and the will of benedict jones to
thomas price jones the legatee and execu
tor of the same and who now makes the
claim before the court
mr gibbons objected to this evidence on
the ground that the papers were not so certi
fied under the acts of congress as to admit of
their admission ard cited the authorities
which sustained his objection
the judge decided against admitting the
papers and clearly pointed out the course
which the claimant ought to have pursued in
prosecuting his claim under the late act of
congress he said the party should have
gone befote a judge or magistrate and had
his papers properly certified the case ought
to be made out at home and then nothing
would be necessary but to prove the identity
of the prisoner as the individual so show n to
have been a fugitive from labor
mr tener then proceeded to show that
henry garnei is a slave and the circum

mr tener asked the court to allow the
claimant until this morning for the purpose of
having his documents properly attested and
the case brought before the court in accord
ance with the rules laid down in the law
mr brown suongly opposed this motion
contending that as the law was a stringent
one the giving of every advantage to the
claimant would be a monstrous perversion of
justice the party had had ample time to
prepare his case and having began erroneous
ly the prisoner ought not to be kept in cus
tody until mr jcnes can make up the deficien

bad one and followed by all in subordinate
positions who act for the courts besides one

th september  j
sir  have had the honor to receive your
note of this date informing me that the bill
commonly called the fugitive slave bill
having passed both houses of congress had
been submitted to you for your consideration
approval and signature and requesting my
opinion whether the sixth section of that act
and especially the last clause of that section
conflicts with the provision of the constitu
tion which declares that the privilege of the
writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended
unless when in cases of rebellion orinvasin
the public safety may require it
it is my clear conviction that there is noth
ing in the last clause nor in any pait ot the
sixth section nor indeed in any part of the
provisions of the act which suspends or was
intended to suspend the privilege of the writ
of habeas corpus or is in any manner in con
flict with the constitution
the act of the th february  be
fore alluded to so far as it respects any con
stitutional question that can arise out of this
bill is identical with it it authorizes the
like arrest of ihe fugitive blave the like trial
he like judgement the like certificate with
the like authority to the owner by virtue ot
that certificate as his warrant to remove him
to the state of territory from which he es
caped and the constitutionality of that act
in all those particulars has been affirmed by
the adjudications of state tribunals and by
the courts of the u states without a single
dissent so far as i know baldwins c c
r  
 conclude therefore that so far as the act
of the th february  has been held to
be constitutional this bill must also be so re
garded and that the custody restraint and
removal to which the fugitive slave may be
subjected under the provisions of this bill
are all lawful and that the certificate to be
granted to the owner is to be regarded as the
act and judgment of all judicial tribunal hav
ing competent jurisdiction
with these remarks as to the constitution
ality of the genera provisions of the bill and
the consequent legality of the custody and
confinement to which the fugitive slave may
be subjected under it i proceed to a brief con
sideration of the more particular question you
have propounded in reference to the writ of
habeas corpus and of the last clause of the
sixth section above quoted which gives rise
to that question
myopiuionas before expressed is that
there is nothing in that clause or section
whih conflicts with or suspends or wa in
tended to suspend the privilege of the writ of
habeas corpus i think so becaue the bill
says not a word about that writ because by
the constitution congress is expressly for
bidden to suspend the privilege of this writ
unless w hen in cases of rebellion oi invasion
ihe public safety may requite it and there
fore the suspension by this act there being
neither rebellion nor invasion would be a
plain and palpable violation of the constitu
tion and no intention to commit such a vio
lation of the constitution of their duty and
their oaths ought to be imputed to them
upon mere constructions and implications and
thirdly because there is no incompatibility
between these provisions of the bill and the
privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in its
utmost constitutional latitude
congress iri the case of fugitive slaves as
in all other cases within the cope of its con
stitutional authority has the unquestionable
right to ordain and prescribe for what causes
to what extent and in what manner persons
may be taken into custody detained or im
prisoned without this power they could not
fulfil their constitutional trust nor peiform the
ordinary and necessary duties of government
it was never heard that the exercise of that
legislative power was any encroachment upon
or suspension of the privilege of the habeas
corpus it is only by some confusion of ideas
that such a conflict can be supposed tc exist
it is not within the province or privilege of
this great writ to loose those whom the law
has bound that would be to put a writ
granted by the law in opposition to the law
to make one part ot the law destructive of
the other this writ follows the law and
obevs the law it is issued upon proper com
plaint to make inquiry into the cause of com
mitment or imprisonment and its sole remedi
al power and purpose is to deliver the party
from all manner of illegal confiement
 black com  if upon application
to the couit or judge for this writ or if upon
its return it shall appear that the coafinement
complained of was just and lawful ihe writ
in the first instance would be refused and in
the last the parly would be remanded to his
former lawful custody
the condition of one in custody as a fugi
tive slave under this law so far as respects
the wiitof habeas corpus is precisely the
same as that of all other prisoners under the
laws of the  states the privilege of that
writ remains alike to all of them but to be
judged ofgranted or refuseddischarged or
enforced by the poper tribunal according
to the circumstances of each case and as the
commitment and detention may appear to be
legal or illegal
the whole effect of the law may be thus
briefly stated congress has constituted a
tribunal with exclusive jurisdiction to deter
mine summarily and without appeal who are
fugitives from service or labor under the d
section of the fourth article of the constiiu
tion and to whom such service or labor in
due the judgment of every tribunal or ex
clusive jurisdiction where no appeal lies is
of necessity conclusive upon evety other tri
bunal and therefore the judgment of the
tribunal created by this act is conclusive upon
all tribunals whether this judgement is
made to apar it is conclusive of the right
of the owner to letain in his custody the
fugitive from his service and to remove him
back to the place or stale from which he es
caped if it is shown upon the application of
the fugitive for a writ of habeas corpus it
prevents the issuing of the writif upon the
return it discharges the writ and restores or
maintains the custody
thia view of the law of this ease is fully i
sustained by the decision of the supreme
csurt of the united states in the ease of to
bias watkins where the court refused to
discharge upon tne ground that he was w
custody under the sentence of a court of
competent jurisdiction and that judgment was
conclusive upon them  pet 
the expression used in the last clause of
the sixth section that the certificate therein
alluded to shall prevent all molestation of
the persona to whom granted by any pro
cess issued die probably mean only what
the act of  meant by declaring a certi
ficate under that act a sufficient warrant for
the removal of a fugitive and certainly do not
mean a suspension of the habeas corpus
i conclude by tepeating my conviction that
there is nothing in the bill in question which
conflicts with the constitntion or suspends or
was intended to suspend the privilege of the
writ of habeas corpus

i t l t
it haft become fashionable of late in the
w northern states to brand every man who
f ventures to express an opinion hostile to the
institution of slavery as an abolitionist no
matter how devoted to the union the individ
g ual may be no matter how unimpeachable
may be his integrity if he dates to exercise
it a aceuioii in giving utterance to
his honest convictions respecting tbe odious
institutions of slavery if he presumes to call
ih justice and humanity of the
fugitive slave law he is denounced as an
abolitionist an incendiary an enemy of
the constitution
this cry of mad dog is raised by par
ties who place a higher value upon southern
votes than upon the principles of morality or
religion according to their code of morality
the slavecatcher or kidnapper is a respect
able character compared to the unhappy in
dividual whom they think proper to character
ize as an abolitionist
it is time that all the free men should pro
test against this intolerance and the most ef
fective protestation which can be made
against it is an explicit declaration of princi
ples on the part of all those who hold slavery
to be a curse who regard the institution with
abhoirence and who earnestly desire to see
it forever abolished from the land
according to the practical defination of ab
olitionist i given by the parties above tefeued
to every honest man in the northern states
deserves he title of abolitionists who is
therein tus country that does not hold sla
vety to be a curse  what man is there in
the north that would not if he could tomor
i row banit h it for ever from the country
we do not know of any such the cry
therefore of abolitionist is as senseless as
it is wicked and the duty of every honest
man is to troat it with contempt
for our part if an intense hatred of slavery
a fixed determination to oppose its farther ex
tension and an anxious desire to see it who
ly abolished if this constitute an abolitionist
then do we cheerfully accept the title more
over if hostility to the fugitive slave law
and a steady resolve to labor for its repeal 
modification if this be abolitionism than are
we willing to be called an abolitionist
we are devotedly attached to the union
but attachment to the union does not wiih us
involve attachment to slavery attachment to
crime we are the friends of the constitu
tion but friendship to tbe constitution does
not in our philosophy mean enmity to free

morality and religion n y sun
fugitive slave billthe conduct of a
portion of the northern people in preventing
the citizens of the slaveholding states from
recapturing fugitives slaves has generated
more illfeeling between the opposite extremes
of the union than any other cause put to
gether it was indeed a crying evil and
demanded the immediate legislation of con
gress we are glad to discover that the
members from every section have taken a pro
per view of its importance and that the sen
ate has passed the bill which was befure that
body with such provisions and amendments
as will likely be satisfactory to the south we
have not seen the bill but understand that
southern senators were requested and allowed
to make it asstringent as possible and so to
to frame it as jn future to the rights
and property of their constituents it is
stated in the telegraph notices of the bill that
all marshals of the united states are bound
to execute all warrants for the appiehension
of fugitive slaves and safely keep such as
they may arrest under a penalty of looo
any person obstructing or hindering the
claimant from arresting his slave is subject to
alike fine of looo ills thus to be hoped
that if the house does its duty the causes of
complaint and dissatisfaction may one by
one be removed during the present session
and the country lesioted to peace this is
the ardent wish of every friend of the con
stitution every patriot of the union the
enemies of either will be silenced in the gen
eral rejoicing columbus ga enquirer
incediarism the panic among our south
ern brethren seems growing to a fearful hight
it is not only abolition tracts they fear but
abolition candles are dreaded as incendiary
hear the richmond inquirer
a few days since we were surprised to
hear that out merchants still continue to pur
chase and sell the candles manufactured by
jackson the noted abolitionist who shows
his gratitude for the tteasure drawn from
southern pattonage by urging on the anti
slavery fanatics to the most deadly aggres
sions on southern rights and properly we
trust to see this informed altogethernonin
tercourse in such a case is a vital matter of
selfdefence
to this the southern press adds
henceforth therefore the candles if not
the politics ot the abolitionists are to be
resisted they may take our territory but
we are determined not to take their candles
never never never at all hazards and to the
last extremity
 he fears of the southerners are not we
confess altogether unreasonable in this mat

the people leaving what mischief they bad

the next session which will assemble in two
months that they have served their mas
ter the slave power to the full extent of
their ability is too evident for doubt and
that they have not done all that southern ar
rogance and avarice demanded ia owing to
the force of a public opinion which they could
not resist that the most greedy of slave

judge jay on the blood

the following letter from judge jay
appeared in the evening poet of this
city a lew days since we copy it at
the request of one of the gentlemen to
whom it was addressed though without
that request we should not have per
mitted a paper so characteristic of its
author and so worthy of the widest
circulation to escape our notice no
clearer exposition of the infamous law
which may at any time make any
of us a slavehunter or a slave hasyei
been offered
bedford d october 
gentlemen in pursuance of instruc
tions given you by a meeting of color
ed citizens you ask me in your letter
of the th ult my opinion first of
the constitutionality and binding force
of the late act of congress for the sei
zure of fugitive slaves and secondly
of the course most proper to be pursu
ed by our colored citizens in reference
to the personal jeopardy in which they
are now placed
many years since i endeavored to
prove in an argument published at the
lime that congress has no constitution
al power to pass any law whatever re
specting fugitive slaves i find from
mr websters speech of th of last
march that such is also his opinion
but the supremo court has otherwise
determined and hence mr webster
advised the senate to exercise power
which the constitution in his judgment
had conierred exclusively on the states
the law in question appears to ine as
palpable a violation of the constitution
as it certainly is of the principles of
justice the rights of humanity and the
obligations of the religion of jesus
christ
of the binding force of this law
in its practical operation i entertain no
doubt it is said i know that it is too
atrocious to be executed that public
opinion will not endure its enormities
be not deceived there was indeed a
time when such a law would not have
been thought of much less enforced at
the north some years since as i
was directing a fugitive os to the route
lo canada he told me to my surprise
that he wished to go to massachusetts j
on asking himsvhy be said he had
heard mr adams say at washington
that it a slave once got into massachu
setts there were not tjwelve men in the
state who would give him up littlej
did mr adams anticipate to the recent
developements of boston gentility and
andover divinity
the slavecatching law is a boon
granted by the north not a measure
fastened upon us by the slaveholders
it is a law passed through massachu
setts influence voted for by the rep
resentatives of boston and appro
ved and applauded by a very large
number of politicians a presidential
election is approaching and the result
will be decided by southern votes
hence our politicians will seek to pro
pitiate the slaveholders by zeal and
diligence in slavehunting the law
wil be executed in al the pfentitude of
its diabolism or to use the words of
mr webster when pledging his sup
port to the bill then before the senate
to the fullest extent to the fullest
extent
if you ask my opinion of the bind
ing force of this law in a moral sense
i answer that its binding force is pre
cisely the same as was that of the iaiv
of nebuchadnezzar commanding the
multitudes on the plain of dura to fall
down and worship his golden image
of the decree of darius forbidding
prayer to god forthirty daysof the
order of the jewish magistrates to peter
tand paul not to speak at all nor to
each in the name of jesusof the
commands of the roman emperors
that christians should cast incense on
the altars of idols of the edicts of
louis xiv requiring hugenots to
embrace the faith and practice the
rites of the church of rome this ac
cursed statute requires us to become
notice instruments of treachery cruelty
and oppression to the persecuted bui
innocent fugitive to set at naught the
law of jehovub to do justice and love
mercy to trample under foot the greai
commandment of our blessed redeem
er to love cur neighbor and regard
less of his authority to do to others
what would fill our souls with anguish
if done to ourselves let us with out
families enter the dungeons which
northern politicians have prepared
rather than hazard our souls by render
ing obedience to the requirements ot
this wicked law
most deeply do i sympathise ou
in your unhappy state with your
wives and children you are now placed
at the disposal of any villian who ia
ready to perjure himself for the price
you will bring in the human shambles
of the south with less ceremony and
trouble than a man ran impound bis
neighbors ox you may be meta
morphosed from a citizen of the state
of new york to a beast of burden on
a southern plantation on leaving
your house in the morning you may
be enticed into another where one oi
then newly appointed commissionerstf
ter reading one affidavit made a thou
sand miles off and another that you
are the person named in the first or on
the bare oath of the kidnapper himself
may infoim you to your amazement and
horror that you are a slav the fet

your limbs and in a few minutes you
are travelling with railroad velocity tc
a southern market never again will
you ever behold your wife and children
nor will any tidings from them evei
reach your ear the remainder o
your life is to be one of toil and stripes
in this war against human rights the
laws delay is utterly unknown
the commissioner is commanded tc
jpatcb he mttnir mr a summaiii
manner the oath of the wretcl
who has seized you and who expect
to clear eight hundred or a thousanc
dollars by your sale is of itself all suf
ficient and abundant proof that you art
his property while your own oath it
the contrary is excluded by law th
act gives you no right to demand i
postponement of the hearing allowi
you no process to command the attend
ance of witnesses no time to send foi
counsel however essential these
privileges may be to your restoratior
to freedom to family to happiness
you must beg them as favors to be gran
ted or denied at pleasure from a crea
ture who has accepted the office of t
slavecatching judge and who is t
be paid ten dollars if he dooms you t
slavery but onl y five if he sets you at
liberty and who is this commission
er heretofoie he was a person ap
pointed by the united states courts tc
perform certain acts as taking affida
vits c jyow he is elevated to the of
fice and dignity of a judge and ht
courts are expressly commander
to enlarge the number of commit
sioners irith a view to afford reasonable
facilities in relation to fugitives from la
bor hence these judges are to be
appointed for the express and only pur
pose of catching negroes and the
amount and condition of their rewardin
dicate the character of the men whe
it is expected will accept the infamout
office
from the decision of one of these
men given under the circumstances 
have described there is no appeal tc
any court in the united states yel
this man whose judgment is too sacred
to be reviewed and in whose awfu
presence the trial by jury the habem
corpus and all the forms of the commor
law devised lor the protection of liberty
are but as things of naughtthis higl
and mighty judge who sits in judgmeni
upon the right to the souls and bodies
of immortal beings made in the image
of god is deemed unworthy to decide
on the title to a horse such a ques
tion is referred to a higher court and
how are these omnipotent slavecatch
j ing commissionerjudges appionted
no popular vote invests them with their
j tremendous powersno president and
senate are responsible for their lenrn
j ng wisdom and integrity notwith
standing the constitution entrusts to
them tho appointment of the federal
judges among the wonders of the
times is this discovery of judicial gen
eration by virtue of this new law
judges procreate judges at pleasurefor
the convenience of the slaveholders
our commissionerjudges are to
have a tbree at their command to main
tain their dignity and execute their be
hests they are authorized to appoint
an unlimited number of slavecatchers
and each of these miscreants is empow
ered by law to roam through the
whole extent of the state executing
warrants seizing alleged slaves white
or black ordering out the postt comita
tus calling the citizens from their em
ployments and commanding them to
join in slave hunts should any dare
to refuse obedience to the satanic man
date a fine of looo and imprison
ment for six months will vindicate the
insulted authority of the slavecatcher
when the chase is ended and the man
is taken he may be guarded and trans
ported to the slave region at the ex
pense of the national treasury
thus have our doughfaceswhigs and
democratsin taxing their constituents
to give jobs to slavecatchers and to
rivet the fetters of the bondsmenfallen
down in the dust and licked the very
feet of the slaveholders
you ask me how you shall secure
yourselves from the kidnapper god
only lnowi may ho have mercy on
you for our low makers have had none
rumors have reached me of an inten
tion on the part of our colored citizens
to curry arms in selfdetence if i
have earned any title to your confidence
may i not ask you to ponder my ad
vice to abandon such intention most
freely do i confess my utter ignorance
of any system of morals founded by di
vine authority on the color of a mans
skin whenever and tor whatever
cause god permits a white man to take
life i believe he equally permits a
black man in similar circumstances to
do the same some i know maintain
hat life may never be taken in self
defence but it is not on this ground
that i urge you to abstain from the ust
of deadly weapons i implore i be
seech you not to attempt the life of the
kidnapper first because his death
will not secure your safety and being
therefore unnecessary it would be
morally wrong and secondly because
such an act of violence would prove
the scource of great evil lo yourselves
and to your brethren
the facilities afforded by this law to
the kidnapper are so great the means
of converting you in a slave are io
plainly prescribed the physical force
furnished him for perpetrating the out
rage is so abundant that tho whole vil
lany will be done according to law
and under circumstances rendering re
sistance vain the fraudulent affidavit
will be regularly verified warrant duly
issued the seizure strictly legal hence
should death occur by your resistance
you would m law bo deemed guilty oi
murder for having slain an officer in
the legal discharge of his duty think
you that at a time when parties are
sacrificing truth aad honor for south
ern votes and thoir leaders openly
scoffing at the highor law that you
would be permitted to eccape with im
punity there would be a mighty
struggle among our politicians who
should make the most southern capital
out of the slaughter of a slavecatcher
the proslavery papers of new york
and boston would be seized with a fit
of horror and indignation against the
bloodthirsty negroes and of admira
tion for the patriotism of the departed
martyr and for that lolly devotion to
the compromises of the constitution
which had cost him his life
the occasion would moreover be
embraced for rendering new homage
to the slaveholders by urging the for
cible expulsion to africa of all such ne
groes as unhappily have no masters to
ake care of them and control their
savage tempers and not unlikely hints
would be thrown out that before long
selfpreservation requires the reestab
lishment of slaveryat the north such
an act would furnish gn excuse for
armed hand roaming
through the country insulting and ter
rifying our citizens and picking up ne
groes at pleasure for you will recol
lect they may be seized either with or
without warrantleave i beseech
you the pistol and the bowie knife to
southern ruffians and their northern
mercenaries that this law will lead
to bloodshed i take it for granted bui
let it be the blood of the innocent not
of the guilty if anything can arouse
the torpid conscience of the north it
will be our streets stained with human
blood shed by the slavecatchers
most deeply do i feel and deplore
the wrongs inflicted upon your race
bond and free by a people professing
to be christians and republicans and
greatly do i fear that a righteous prov
idence will make those very wrongs the
instruments of his vengeance by means
of the moral leprosy they are spreading
through our country this very slave
catching law has a direct and powerful
tendency to beget in our people a
reckless contempt for the rights of in
dividuals a disregard for the usual
conservatory forms of legal and judicial
proceedings and a selfish indifference
for the claims of humanity
for years most strenuous efforts
prompted by commercial and political
views were made to deprive the oppo
nents of slavery of their constitutional
privileges by lawless violence the
right of petition was suspendedthe
freedom of debate interruptedthe
sanctity of the post office violated
public meetings dispersedprinting
presses destroyedfurious mobs exci
tedchurches sackedprivate houses
gutted and even murder peapetrated
all this violation of rights was regard
ed with complacency by many who had
much at stake so long as abolitionists
alone were its victims but the spirit
of aggression thus raised and fostered
is seeking new subjects on which to
exercise its power gentlemen of
property and standing are rarnr begin
ning to feel alarmed about socialism
antirentism agrarianism c hence
of late we hear much of the impor
tance of conservatism as it is called
the political movements of the last few
months seem to indicate that our land
lords and our cottonlords and mer
chant princes regard an alliance with
the aristocracy of the south as at least
in some degree a security against the
violation of vested rights sequestration
of rents oppressive taxation unequal
laws c c to the influence of gen
tlemen ol this class the late slave law
owes its passage
and is it believed that the rights of
the ricn will he protected by familiari
zing the populace with the practice of
injustice and cruelty towards the poor
will the sight of innocent men seized
tu our streets and sent in fetters to till j
the broad fields of great landowners
increase the reverence felt for land ti
tles is it wise to give the people
practicaj lessons in the demolition ofall
the barriers raised by the common law
tor the protection of the weak against
the strong it is true conservatism to
obliterate in the masses the sense of
justice the feelings of humanity the
distinction between right and wrong
no man looks with more loathing than
i do on the destructive and disorgani
zing theories of the day but i have no
idea of counteracting them by the ex
tension of human bondage and the ex
ample of ferocious injustice iu hunting
innocent men and robbing them of all
the rights of humanity the only con
servatism to which i look for the pro
tection of my rights and my property
is that higher law which with the
authority oi deity and the sanctions of
the invisible world says to each indi
vidual high or low rich or poor do
justice love mercydo to others
runt should do to you
but alas this law is sneered at by
men whose all depends upon its obser
vance the vindications of property
in man which are poured forth from
the pulpit the forum and the press
the maintenance of caste in the church
the apathy with which the oppression
of three millions of countrymen is
viewedthe permission given to intro
duce slavery into our new territories
with a pledge to receive them as slave
statesthe broken faith of many of
those by whom the permission and
pledge were giventhe contempt ex
pressed for the scruples of conscience
and the horrible iniquity of the fugitive
laware all combining to break down
those barriers of justice humanity and
the fear of god which under our pop
ular form of government can alone
may the flood of spoliation and anarchy
well may we tremble lest god should
apply to our nation the maxim of his
moral government towards individuals

belle
jl jay on the flfiltlve
law
hon william jay at the application
of a committee of colored men has
written an opinion respecting tbe new
law which as might he expected
strongly condemw it he unhesitating
ly pronounces it unconstitutional as op
posed to tbe principles of justice and
humanity and an likely to result in
great wrong and hardship to the color
ed population yet he earnestly dis
suades from any forcible resistance to
its operation as nothing can be gained
by such resistapce and as it would
tend to increase the hardships of the
class upon which it presses at best
too heavily resistance would give
color to the proslavery clamor at the
north and furnish an excpse for vio
lence on the part of stavecatching
leave says his address to this class
leave i beseech you the pistol
and the bowieknife to southern ruf
fiians and their northern mercenaries
that this law will lead to bloodshed
i take it for granted but let it be the
blood of the innocent not of the guil
ty if anything can rouse tbe torpid
conscience of the north it will he our
streets stainedkum blood shed
by he slavecatehers
the advice here tendered however
wise it is hardly possibly that it will
be always heeded it is a style ol
neroism not olten attained in this
world quietly to submit to an act of
aggression and otrage like that which
tbe slavecatcher attempts in making
his assault upon the fugitive society
and laws have made war upon the
colored man they disown him they
outlaw him and afford him no protec
tion and in this war he throws him
self upon he rights of his manhood and
defends himself when no one else will
defend who can blam him and if the
pursuer falls in the conflict we cannot
see whom he has to blame but himself
as an illustration of this doctrine
we may state a fact which has not yet
found its way into tne papers a week
or two ago an athletic stalwart ne
gro arrived at this port in a vessel
from the south apparently unknown to
anybody on board as the boat reached
the wharf and the fugitivefor such
he is supposed to have beenattempt
ed to again the shore tbe first object
he met was the keen glance of hi
master who missing his slave and
suspecting the route he had taken hur
ried on by the more rapid conveyance
of the railroad and arrived in new
york long enough before the vessel
containing his runaway slave to obtain
bis u s marshal and to present him
self at the boat ready to recapture his
victim as he landed the parties met
and understood their relations at a
glance the master hirnseif nn ath
letic man pointed to the officer by his
side informed the slave that this was
united states officer who must not be
resisted the logic was not conclusive
to the poor fugitive he ruised a
brawny powerful arm which appeared
to have the force of a dozen sledge
hammers and before a word could he
uttered or a motion made laid the
officer senseless upon the ground the
crowd around caught the meaning of
the scene with electric sympaty and
raising a shout urged the fugitive to
flee and covered his flight from the
enraged master till trace of him was
utterly lost
now these consenting citizens
were lawabiding men yet they saw
not and we defy any man to perceive
any wrong in tho resistance of this
heroic fugitive he felt himself at
war with the government and with op
pressors and he only availed himself of
the natural rig tof war and the blame
must rest uponlßioae who commenced
strife by assaulting the rights which
were thus summarily redressed what
ever we may think of the policy of
such acts they are too obviously ac
cordant with every instinct of justice
to be honestly condemnedv y

the freewill baptists ov the
fugitive bile at the triennial ses
sion of the cenference of the free
will baptists held at providence a
short time since the following resolu
tions were adopted in reference to the
fugitive slave law
r solved that we do deliberately
and calmly yet earnestly and decided
ly deny any all obligation on our part
to submit to the unrighteous enact
ments of the aforesaid fugitive slave
bill also that regardless of unjust
human enactment fines and imprison
ment we will do ail we can consistent
ly with the claims ofthe bible to pre
vent the recapture of the fugitive and
to aid him in his efforts to escape
from his rapacious claimants
resolved that as we ought to obey
god rather than man acts   in
disobeying a ciuel and wicked human
law and patiently submitting to its un
rightouto fiialtie nr suok
cnee we are subject unto the higher
powers that be rom   in the
highest and holiest sense of that divine
command that is in the same sense in
which the apostles primitive christians
and the subsequent christian martyrs
obeyed it when they disobeyed the
jewish heathen aad popish laws
resolved that we de most deeply
sympathize with those who after hav
ing escaped from human bondage are
now in great fear anxiety and distress
on account of the passage of the fugi
tive slave bill we also recommend
them to use all the means to preserve
the liberty that religion conscience
and reason will justify under their har
rassing and distressing circumstances
resolved that the conduct ofslave
holders and their abettors iu procuring
the annexation of texas in order to
afford security to slavery their efforts
to establish the unmerciful institution
in the free territory acquired by the
war caused by that annexation aho
their violent opposition to the admission
of california into the union as a free
state and their threats to dissolve the
union it they cannot be permitted to
carry slavery where they please arc
developments that affords increasing
proof ot the deep inherent depravity
if american slavery and likewise call
loudly for continued and increasing
christian and constitutional efforts for
its abolition democrat
