meetings of colored citi
zens of new york
below we give reports of two meet
ings held by the colored people of this
city within the past few days the re
port of each was made in part for the
standard and in part corrected from
that of the herald as we do not pro
fess to give much more than a sketch
of the meetings of course the drift
merely of the speeches can be given
they are full enough however to in
dicate the spirit which animates the
new york colored people it would
be exceedingly difficult to take a fu
gitive publicly from this city but unfor
tunately the work is done secretly and
in the dark
the reception meeting given to
hamlet who had been purchased by
contributions made through the jour
nal of commerce office and who was
brought back on saturday was the first
public meeting ever held by colored
people in the park it numbered sev
eral thousands and went off with the
greatest enthusiasm we are glad to
be able to state that the death of mrs
hamlet which was reported two or
three days before was incorrect and
that the joy of the reclaimed slave was
made complete by the welcome of his
wife and children the story of her
death we are told arose from the fact
that she was at one time thrown into
convulsions and was supposed by the
bystanders to have ceased to live

information from you which the nature
of the case demands

 pearl street
up to this hour seven and one half
o clock oct   that functionary
had not thought it worth whi to give
an answer
the several sections of the fugitive
slave bill were then read amid inter
ruptions execrations and cries of
shame at the conclusion a voice in
the gallery asked was there no more of
it an interrogatory which excited the
risbilities of some which were how
ever checked by the president who
told them it was too solemn a question
for merriment
the following letters were then read
to the meeting
letter from ai an son nah
new york october ist 
gentlemen
i received your communication of
the th of september last requesting
my opinion as to the constitutionality
of the recent law of congress relative
to fugitive slaves in reply i state
that the law g passed by congress
has many objectionable features in it
indeed it obviously infringes upon the
constitution of the united states in
several particulars
h irst it suspends the writ of habeas
corpus contrary to the second subdivis
ion of the ninth section of the national
constitution
second it is in violation of a por
tion of the fifth article of the amend
ments which declares that no person
shall be deprived ol life liberty or
property without due process of law
third it is m violation of the sev
enth article of the amendments which
declares that in suits at common
law where the value in controversy
shall exceed twenty dollars the right of
trial by jury shall be preserved
fourth it is in violation of the spirit
and force of the constitution of tile
united states which declares that the
judicia power of the united states
shall be vested in one supreme court
and in such inferior court as the con
gress may from time to time ordain
and establish according to art  ec
 of said constitution in as much m
yd bmumib yd im asaw fhb
right is of no sex truth is of no color god is thsvriir of us all and all men are brethren
the fugitive slave law confers judieia
powers of the very highest nature upoi
commissioners who are not judges o
any court nor can they have judicia
powers conferred upon them withou
constituting them in direct terms t
court
a u s commissioner is an inferioi
officer he is no judge he has no clerk
he holds no court and his proceedings
are not subject to review
ik owtjgurss or he united states
possesses no power to pass a law that a
citizen of the state of new york shall
be taken and carried to south caroli
na and in the latter state to be tried
whether he is a free man or a slave in
new york
the doctrine that a man may be sei
zed in england and carried to france
and there tried whether he is a free
man or a slave in england is contrary
to all known laws
and so far as the rights of citizens of
the state of new york are concerned
the arrest of such persons here and the
sending of them to other slates for tri
al of their rights under the laws of the
state of new york is as much a viola
tion of law as though the man had been
seized in england and carried to
france to try by the judicial tribunals of
ihe latter country the rights of the man
so seized in england
the whole spirit of this act called
die fugitive slave law takes away
the rights and personal liberties of the
citizens of each state
the ninth article of the amendments
to the constitution of the united states
are in these words
the enumeration in the constitu
tion of certain rights shall not be con
strued to deny or disparage others re
tained by the people
so article tenth of the amen dments
jays that
the powers not delegated to the
united states by the constitution nor
prohibited by it to the s ates are re
lerved to the states respectfully or to
he people
nor the powers reserved to the states
and the rights retained by the people
onsist among other things of those f
a trial by jury where life liberty orf
property are concerned
and also the right of each state ho
letermine whether its own citizens aie
ugitives from service or not
congress has not power to pass laws
hat shall deprive a citizen of this state
af his life liberty or property or of
areventing each citizen of calling to
iis aid a trial by jury wljen either his
life liherty or property is involved
the writ of habeas corpus and the
right of trial by jury for each citizen
are amply provided for by the consti
tution and the laws of the state of new
fork and whenever a person is arrest
ed under the provision of the fugitive
slave law such person has the right
o a writ of habeas corpus and trial by
ury under our own state laws
there is one feature in the late law
f congress relative to slaves which
seems to be a full recognition of the
principle that all slaves brought into
he state by their masters are thereby
made free
and also that all children born in a
ree state of a fugitive slave mother
tre also free
the fugitive slave law no where
orovides that a person making oath un
ler this law and swearing corruptly
ind falsely shall be guilty of perjury or
iable to any pains yid penalties for
ommitting perjury nor does the
aw make it obligatory on the claimant
f a fugitive slave to take him back
vhen reclaimed to the place whence he
iscaped but a man from charleston
south carolina may arrest a free man
n new york and carry him direct to
the slave pens at baltimore and sell
tim to a negro trader and then land
him directly into the awamps of louis
iana whenever he can obtain a certifi
cate from a commissioner rightfully or
wrongfully
the constitution of the united states
evidently contemplates that the people
of the several states shall be deprived
of no rights which are guaranteed to
themby the state laws and constitution
the constitution of new york de
clares that the trial by jury in all cases
in which it has been heretofore used
shall remain inviolate forever
and further that no member of this
state shall be disfranchised or depri
ved of any rights or privileges secured
to any citizen thereof unless by the
law of the land and judgment of his
peers
in this latter section tne word mem
ber is used in contradiction to the word
citizen
the people ol this state have intend
ed that every person in this state shall
have the benefit of our laws
the stranger who sojourns here be
his color black white or redis equally
entitled to the protection of our laws
the great bill of rights called the
magna chart a declares that no man
shall be seized or imprisoned or exiled
or in any manner destroyed or con
demned or passed upon unless by the
lawful judgment of his peers or by the
law of the land
it is the birth right of every manand
the people of the states and of the
united states have never given up this
right to congress to pass laws to take
it away suppose a man arrested is a
slave who knows most about it his
family and friends or his claimant
suppose he is a freeman who is to
determine this question is a com
missioner ex parte in a secret session
and without a hearing of the allega
tions from the accused or a jury who

mr george t downing then read
the following resolutions which were
received with cheers and expressions
ot approbation
i whereas the congress of the uni
ted stales has passed a law for the
avowed purpose of reclaiming persons
owing service in one state apd esca
ping into another and approved by
milliard fillmore the president of the
uuited states on the th day of sep
tember 
and whereas the operation of said
law allows any person in the southern
states to go into any court or before
any justice of the peace or any other
person authorized to take depositions
in any state or organized territory of
the united states and swear that any
colored person owes him or her ser
vice or labor and has escaped there
from and may take out a warrant for
the arrest of such person in any united
states court in any state or territory
and seize sueh person withor without
a warrant and command the assistance
of bystanders to make the arrest
and whereris any person so ar
rested may be taken before any united
states court io any state or territory
of the united states and deprived of
his or her liberty in as ummary man
ner by any judge justice or com
missioner of the united states
and whereas any person so arrest
ed and tried is stripped of the right of
trial by jury deprived of the writ of
habeas corpvs contrary to the provis
ions of the constitution of the united
states
and wheritas any white person
may seize and arrest any colored per
son and drag him or her by violence
before any unit ed states judge justice
or commissioner and swear away the
liberty of any person so arrested
and whereas any person assisting
another to escape either before or after
trial or is known to conceal a person
claimed as a slave is subject to a fine
of one thousand dollars and thus in
every way placing the liberty of color
ed persons in every slate or territory
of this union completely at the mercy
of slaveholders or their agents with
every safeguard of liberty stricken
downtherefore
 resolved that we utterly repudi
ate the law and its provisions that it is
so repugnant to every principle of jus
tice that it can have no binding force
whatever upon us and that we do here
in the sight of god and before all men
declare that should any one attempt to
execute its provisions on any one of us
either by invading our home or ar
resting us in the street we will treat
such an one as assaulting our persons
with intent to kill and god being our
helper will use such means as will re
pel the agg lessor and defend our lives
and liberty
 resolved that we are worthy
neither of our homes nor of the confi
dence of our wives and children unless
we are prepared to sacrifice ourselves
freely if necessary on the altar of
freedom and in their defence
k resolved that the teachings aad
examples of oar countrymen the
promptings of our nature as men as
well as our duty towards god leii us
that whenever tbs unjust provisions of
this law against god and huinmty
hall be attempted to be enforced
against either of us it were far better
that a thousand fives wrish in the re
i friday oct   mkrh
honor the mayor has me
f that in case of arrest of he
has forbidden the policetshpan
t other officer of the corpjffhfrnni
assisting the slaveholder ttvhping
slaves uuder the late act ofrflhks
but as to what course the iflhbrecj
people ought to pursue hvlfss wmt ol
seizure not bavin re fugitive
law he was unablato ssla
his honor that in the event of my friend
robert hamilton who was present
being arrested under the fugitive act
with intent to reduce him to slavery
that we would not allow him to be taken
out of the city to which the mayor
made no reply w p powell
once send a man into slaveryunder
a commissioners certificate and how
is he to obtain his freedom when wrong
fully wrested from him
a person once condemned by an
united states commissioner to slavery
is forever deprived of his freedom he
is a slave for life and all his fraternity
he might as well expect to get an
audience of the monarch of great brit
ain as to obtain relief through any ju
dicial tribunal in the slave states or
in those of the united states
the door is forever shut to him after
he has once passed into a slave state
i have no doubt that in all cases
where a person may be arrested in this
state under the late act of congress
that he is entitled to and he and his
agent or friends can sue out a writ oi
habeas corpus in our state courts
and there try the question whether he
he is fugitive slave or not here he
will at least have a fair trial

being permitted io be dragged from our
midst htto hopeless bondage and that
we desire no grave prouder than that
over which shall stand the monument
and no page of history prouder than
that which shall record the deed of such
rescue
 resolved that it has ever been
our aim and earn to be gotd
l ftbl citizens and that
strive such to be neverthelesswe can
not for one moment entertain the idea
of compliance with the terms of that
bim its force being lost in the fact that
it is at variance with the laws of our na
ture and of god and further because
we believe it to be at variance with the
spirit and letter of our declaration of
independence and of the constitution
established under that declaration
 resolved that the provisions of
the fugitive slave bill of leaving
us no other alternative we must adopt
he motto of our sister state virginia
resistance to tyrants is obedience
to god
 resolved that we declare to ma
son and the aiders and abettors of this
arbitrary and despotic law in the lan
guage of daniel webster that there
is something on earth greater than ar
bitrary and despotic power and the
lightning has its powor and the earth
quake has its powerbut there is
something among men more capable of
shaking despotic power than lightning
whirlwind or earthquakethat is the
threatened indignation of the civilized
world
 resolved that god willed us
freemenman willed us slaveswe
will as god wills gods will be done
 resolved that inasmuch as des
perate efforts are being made to re
claim fugitives who have fled for liberty
to reclaim them at all costs we sym
pathizing with such fugitives and be
lieving that they would be justified
therein by the promptings of natureby
the precepts of patrick henry and of
washington by the glorious example
of madison washington do council
them to do as we wouldto arm them
selves with the surest and most deadly
weapons to resist unto death for
which if they be not prepared we ad
vise them to repair with all possible
despatch to where the law as well as
nature proclaims them free
 resolved that in giving ten mil
ions of dollars to the south for land
which the south never owned in
promising to pay one thousand dollars
u the south for every bondsman
who mat escape therefromin con
verting hir once free soil into a hunting
ground for the panting fugitive and in
offering to own citizens a bribe on
the one hand lo join in the chase and
fine and imprisonment on the other
hand for refusing to do so the once
free north has sold herself body and
soul to the dark spirit of slavery and
has through her chosen president and
subservient members of congress de
clared in tones that will pierce the
ears of half the human race that the
last great experiment of representa
tive government has failed and has
caused millions of eyes of those who
fed their inherent love of liberty upon
the success and prosperity of the amer
ica example to turn away from our
deep disgrace with dissatisfaction and
disgust and has caused the doctrine of
the divine right of kings to feeleven in
its grave a returning sensation of vi
tality and resuscitation
 resolved that we call upon all
american citizens who have any regard
for constitutional law or any reverence
for the history of our glorious past or
any pride in our national reputation
abroad to join in the cry of repeal
repeal the infamous hill which barters
the life and liberty of a freeman for the
oath cf any wretch who may swear that
he is a slave
 resolved that ww will circulate
petitions to the legislature of this state
calling for a law to protect its free col
ored citizens from slavery and for res
olutions instructing the members of
conf ross to urge the repeal of the fu
gitive slave bill
 resolved that we will send pe
titions to congress praying for the re
peal of the fugitive slave bill of 
 resolved that abated by noth
ing other than pure humanity in at
tempting to curry out these resolutions
whenever necessity requires them we
will for further endeavor to infuse their
healthful spirit into the minds and hearts
of our fellowcitizens
 resolved that the president of
this meeting be appointed to receive the
names ot ail persons who may be wil
ling to act on the secret committee
and all persons who are fugitive to re
port themselves to the chairman of the
meetingwho must have their real name
and the name of their master in order
that the secret committee may know
what to do in the premises
mr ijowning then said that he had
nothing to remark but that these reso

uvents of his heart and he declared
that whenever he saw the panting

by reading a letter which tho com
mittee had sent to horace greeley
asking him to explain some matters
with respect to the course of presi
dent fillmore on the question but
which mr greeley for reasons best
known to himself had not answered
dr smith rose and said in the
year of grace  and ih of our
independence which we had reason to
be thankful to divene providence it
has pleased the american congress to
suspend the habeas corpus act the
papers today if queen victoria had a
blister on her toe or some freeman
were shot down in a petty german
principality would be out in full cry
about the melancholy etent and the
horrible butchers we would have
extra heralds and extra tribunes
houting it through the city but when
the charter of human liberty is sus
pended there is not a single whisper
about it but thank god we stand
here tonizht not as slaves cowering
under the lash of our tyrantsno we
i stand here as free american citizens
and with the blessing of god wewill
not desist until this odious bill is re
pealed i wish to know if in a few
months when daniel webster is sit
ting at his fireside in marshfield and
an officer comes with his papers des
cribes him as a large dark man with a
large head and big as that of henry
clay what would mr webster say il
he were carried before a magistrate
and after that hurried away as fast as
steam can oarry him to alabama or
somewhere else where he never would
afterwards be heard of he advised
that one of their first duties was to
have a committee of two appointed
who would be always on hand to give
evidence and aid in favor of the poor
fugitive he further advised that sub
scriptions should be immediately en
tered into by all the colored people to
assist their colored brethren who would
seek their liberty in the eastern states
and described the death of hamlets
wife and said that a corners inquest
should be held on her bodythat mil
lard fillmore daniel webster and
honacgreeley should be summoned
as witnesses and that on her tomb
should be written the first victim to
the act of cpngress of  dr
smith then sat down
il was then announced that a collec
tion would be taken up to defray the
expenses of a number of fugitive
slaves who are now in this city on their
way to canada
john s jacobs a fugitive then
came forward and spoke nearly as fol
lowshe said he came here tonight
to give some advice and to extend the
hand of fellowship to his colored
brethren he said my colored breth
ren if you have not swords i say te
you sell vour garments and buy one
he regretted that he was not here in
time to hear the resolutiens rcsd to
know if they were strong enough if
there be any man here tonight who
wants to know my name tell him it is
john s jacobs of south carolina
and that lam an american citizen
that  never denied that name neither
did  ever disgrace it they said that
they cannot take us back to the south
but i say under the present law they
can and now i say unto you let them
only take your dead bodies tremen
dous cheers this is no time my
friends to laugh let us go to the
bouse of mourning and see the dead
body of the wife of hamlet and her
surviving infants vell i would rather
see her body dragged to the stake than
see her dragged back again into sla
ver i would my friends advise
you to show a front to our tyrants and
arm yourselves aye and  would ad
vise the women to have their knives
too but i dont adviseyou to trample
on the laws of this state but advise
you to trample on the aws of this
state but  advise you to trample on
this bill and  further advise you to let
us go on immediately and act like
men he then advised the colored
race to lay aside their religious and
political feelings or anything that may
tend to separate them and suggested
that a registry should be commenced
with the name of every slave his own
er and all other particulars that they
might tend to give him every assis
tance and concluded by advising the
fugitives not to suffer themselves to
be taken
rev charles gardiner said he did
not rise to make a speech but he could
not help telling the meeting that god
was with them he saw the minister
ing angels hovering around them he
said that he had been travelling through
the east for the last ten weeks and
that there is but one sentiment in re
gard to this billthat it is a flat denial
of the republican principle he told
them in pittsfield and other places
that they the colored race should go
to war with the united states or ac
knowledge themselves slaves they
were sold he said by daniel webster
the veriest bloodhound to the united
states and by both houses of con
gresss to the south and i call this an
infamous union a union cemented in
blood and robbery yes i sty rob
bery because slavery was began by
the robbery of the sons and danghters
of africa ho said that eyerr editor
in the united state skulked this bill
by hiding it from the public and i tar
that thoy are all a ant of vllians it
was a secret combination at which
daniel webster and the editors were
at the bottom of to dries the colored
people to africa the appropriation of
three millions of dollars was proposed
for that pourpose he said ha was
almost disposed to cut loose altogether
from the presbyterian church he was
disgusted with the ministers of that and
the other churchesthey were all
combined sgsinst them he advised
his brethren and sisters to be on their
guard and take the life of every man
that attempted to deprive them of their
liberty he considered that liberty
was the greatest and only blessing they
enjoyed he said that evary colored
church should be opened on the first
monday every month and a concert of
prayer held for the panting slave he
could hear them pray for everything
but the poor slave and he assured them
that slavery progressed upon them in
proportion as they separated them
selves from the lord y
jacob it ghbbs colored then ad
dressed the meeting he said tfce
resolutions had met his approbation
entirely hissing order order if
be only got men to give him their
names and stand with him they would
wnihn infamomajlw in mary
land the law was equally splebe but
he risked bis life and put it down if
ye submit to this law ye are not the
men i take you to be let us tell
them at once we will not submit to it
let us tell them we will not submit to
the yoke and theu we shall have
peace had he been in time to rescue
hamlet he would make new york tell
a tale but the next time he would
take care to be up to time and if he
gets six men to go with him the offi
cers will have another story to tell
he will give assistance and shelter to
every fugitive that wants it and the
bloodhounds of the law are welcome
to take his life he was ready to lay
it down
a man in the gallery cried out that
they had wandered from the object of
the meeting they had heard some
fine speeches but while we are speak
ing hero the fugitive slaves are fleeing
from the city from their families and
their firesides and if liberty is worth
fighting for anywhere it is worth fight
ing for here he concluded by calliug
on them to appoint a committee to ad
vise the slaves to remain and the first
that is taken to rescue him and that
would have more effect than all the
resolutions you would pass tonight
junius c morrel next spoke to the
resolutionshe said that in commo
tions in a great community the first in
quiry always was what occasioned
such commotion just so it wa with
us i would ask you then what
i brought us here tonight it was their
famous fugitive slave bill i would
i not tell you what to do but i will tell
i you what i w ill do lam a freeman
and i care not for the constitution or
the laws made by man the is a law
above them and  tell you that before
they drag me into slavery they will
have to take my life the mau that
would cross the threshold of my door
to drag me into slavery although i am
not a fighting man but when i am put
to the wall i will use this right arm
and deal death and destruction around
me but my friends be not the ag
gressors keep the peace but always
be prepared i dont agree with my
fellowtownsman who spoke here to
night that we have no sympathy but i
say we have and if we deserve it we
will have more of it he then gave
an account of a fee colored man named
charles frisbee who was kidnapped
in philadelphia and sent into virginia
and a man named stansbury a mem
ber of the methodist church who was
also arrested and if it had not been
for the testimony of mr titus a
member of the society of friends who
was produced as a witness and swore
that he knew stansbury for several
years before the time it was said he
escaped and who also swore that stans
bury was at the battle of bladensburg
under commodore barney he would
heve been condemned and sent into
slavery he said they would have
plenty of such cases here a voice
in the gallery said he would have been
claimed in  as a fugitive slave
only that he was in the naval service
mr morrell said that in viewing the
church he other day he found the
church of rome had its headthe
greek church had its headthe eng
lish church had its head and so has
the american church but the head of
the american church was the demon
of slavery cheering the orator
then went on to tell a story that hap
pened in one of the down east church
es wttch nearly led him into infidelity
he said that after the performance of
some splendid ceremonies in which all
the white brethren and sisters joined
and old aged gentleman with hoary
locks and with one foot in the grave
and the other on the brink came for
ward and said now iny colored breth
ren and sisters it is your turn we are
all the same in jesus come and par
take of the communion this my
brethren is the sort of religion that
had nearly led me into infidelity but
if we act like men now we will soon
have no negro pews and no sending
us around about he concluded by
advising them to be prepared but not
to be the aggressors
jerimiah powers next addressed
the meetinghe said that the black
men fought side by side with their
american brethren and had a share
in tho most glorious battles that were
fought in this country from the first
revolution to the late war with mexico
the only argument he would use against
this hell hatched code the fugitive
slave billwas the bowieknife and
the revolver they want to drag the
black men and black women out of this
country but i tell you we have as
good a right here as any white man or
woman he then said the locofocos
went to syracuse to eat up john van
buren and all the free soil niggers it
was the negroes elected mr fillmore
and now he pays us off with big bills
and that i  the reason they kept dark
about it and only the election is near
at hand horace greeley would pub

mr st remmy from canada next
ddressed the meetiog he related
several old anecdotes in n ferencs to
rochester north star fair
the ladies of rochester desirous of emu
lating the noble example set them by their
sisters of new york snd philadelphia in then
efforts to sustain the shore named paper htre
formed an association for the purpose of
holding s fair daring christmas week in aid
ofmhe north star
to those acquainted with the character of
this paper it is needless to spepk of its merits
or of the untiring zeal and sincere devotion
of its editor eminently qualified as frederick
douglass is to promote the elevation of hi
oppressed and despised people at the north
he is also equally qualified to sympathize with
our brothers and sisters who are still in
chains and slavery at the southto tell of
their wrongs to vindicate their rights and by
the blessing of god to hasten the day of
freedom to the three millions of our enslaved
fellow countrymen
we therefore regard the north star
as one of the most effective antislavery in
etrumentalities now in the field and in this
night of darkness and gloom we look to it
as the beacon to guide us until the day
dawn and unclouded sunshine bursts upon
us
we call upon all true friends of the slave
to give us their zealous cooperation on the
present occasion
friends of humanity shall we call upon
you in vain a cruel and inhuman law is
banishing hundreds of our people into a dis
tant land and bringing ruin and desolation
upon many once happy families
christian friends of rochester we call up
on you in the name of all you hold dear and
sacred to extend your kind aid and sympathy
to the daughters of an outraged and suffering
people
we earnestly invite the cooperation of
benevolent friends throughout the country
we appeal with confidence to our english
friends for aid on the present occasion

brewers panorama of the mammoth
cavewe have no hesitation in saying
that this is one of the best if not the best
exhibition of this kind ever presented to the
people of bosron we would recommend
our readers to visit this splendid panorama
it opens with a fine view of boston common
the views of fairmount water works the
niagara river and falls especially the win
ter scene of the jailer and the prairies are
beautiful
that portion of the painting devoted to the
mammoth cave says the atlas closes the
exhibition a visitor to this painting has a
belter opportunity to behold its wonders than
can be obtained by an actual visit two or
three torches serves as the artist observes
but to make darkness visible but at the
time of mr brewers visit to the cave he
had by the permission of the proprietor
three or four hundred lights to illuminate the
chanbets when he made his sketches few
persons have any idea of the extent of the
mammoth cave it has  avenues vary
ing from half a mile to sixteen miles in length
and altogether forming an extent of over four
hundred miles explored there is probably
as much of the cave unexplored as there is
explored and daily discoveries verify the
truth of this assertion the most noted and
beautiful of the chambers and hls of the
cave are faithfully portrayed in the painting
bv mr brewer and the panorama closes with
a view of the beautiful fairy grotto not a
painted but an intimation grotto this exhi
bition affords an excellent and highly instruc
tive entertainment for a couple of hours
books descriptive of the panorama containing
a full acconnt of the cave may be obtained
at the door for a slight increase of charge
mr brewer himself explains the painting to
the spectators his voice is clear and dis
tinct and can be heard ia all parts of the
hall this is quite a consideration he is

id the new york evangelical congre
gational association passed the following
resolutions at a meeting at poughkeepsie
on the bth inst
resolved that we cannot recognize this
law as of any binding force upon the citizens
of our country ist because it is coxtrary
to the express command of god deut 
  thou shall not deliver unto his
master the servant which ia escaped from his
master unto thee he shall dwell with thee
even among you in that place which he shall
choose in one of thy gates where it liketh
him best thou shall not oppress him d
it is in opposition to the great law of chris
tian benevolence which requires us in all
things to do unto others as we would that
others should do unto us d it conflicts
with the provisions of our national constitu
tion th it prostrates those two great safe
guards of human liberty habeas corpus and
trial by jury sth it is revolting to the spon
taneous promptings of humanity th it
brings upon our nation the reproach of in
justice and inconsistency and impairs our
influence upon the world for good th in
short this law outrages every principle of hu
man feeling of humanity and religion and
thus so far as the principle is concerned it
endangers the iibeity of every maf w
resolved that while we recognize the ob
ligation to obey the laws of the land we make
ai exception in the case of all such provisions
as contravene the higher law of god
resolved that we advise all arsons to
render every needful aid and comfort to fugi
tive slaves just the same as if there were no
law in the land forbidding it

the satisfaction to release you from the duties
of a laborious session but she said it with
wonderful grace and dignity as well as

fugitive slave lawa large meeting
of the colored citizens of williamsport ly
coming co pa was held on the evening of
the bth of oct  after hearing the
different opinions it was unanimously
resolved that we denounce the late fu
gitive slave law as being unjust unconstitu
tional and at variance with the laws w god
and humanity
d j the friends of humanity in detroit ere
determined that the colored man recently ar
rested there as s fugitive from slavery shall
not be returned to bondage and have resolved
to buy his freedom if he fails to establish his
right to it otherwise the man says he has
purchased his freedom and was allowed one
weeks delay in order that he might send
to cincinnati for hit papers
the washington union has the following
from its baltimore correspondent
a great excitement has sprung ap among
the blacks st the north relative to the opera
tion of the fugitive slave bill especially aa it
is well known that hundreds of owners of fu
gitives are now scouring the north in search
of their property many owners know of
the whereabouts of their slaves having met
them in their travels and are now perfecting
their arrangements for securing them
id  referring to the indignant reeeption
meeted out to the infamous fugitive slave
law and to the determination of some of
our people not to join in the chase for fugi
tives the richmond whig says
we cannot believe but that any resistance
on the part of the madmen of the abolition
party to the legal authorities will be met
promptly and with the moat decisive measures
the bullet and bayonet if it must needs be
so will effectually suppress the mutinous
manifestations of these fools and should re
sistance indeed come we do not doubt that
such arguments in this case the ultima ra
tiswill be addressed to them
the recreancy ol the press
men who can twist therßible to suit their
own extreme opinions disregarding all pre
vious interpretations by the most learned and
pious commentators men who have the
hardihood to pretend that slaves are not once
spoken of in the new testament and that
philemon was not a slave men who are
governed by a higher law than the consti
tution viz their own private judgment of
what the law should have been are not to be
trusted in a case where their feelings sym
rathiea and prejudices are so deeplyenlisted
t was for precisely such men that the severi
ties of this law were introduced
the foregoing words are quoted from a
recent editorial article in the n y journal
of commerce and have reference to bat
portion of the fugitive slavs law which
strips its victims of the right of trial by jury
in the state where the arrests may be made
thereby annulling the most sacred feature of
english law
the spirit embodied in this editors produc
tion alluded to is in perfect keeping with
the eourse of that venal print during a long
period of years the journal of commerce
ever since we fust knew anything of it has
been the fast friend of its southern task
masters ever paying a willing service to the
demonise spirit of its proslavery age it has
not regenerated one whit since the rev
erend david hale passed from his post to
receive his deserts for deeds done in the
body he was a faithful servant of wrong
no ray of hope no word of kindneas for the
oppressed of hit country was ever observed
in the productions of his pen to lend them an
unwonted glow and give their readers an evi
dence that they were not ute outbirth of a
spirit of darkness
we dislike exceedingly to speak in terms
other than commendatory of such as have
passed from our immediate sphere but it is
a miserable charity which refrains from con
demning the perpetrator of wrong merely
because he has by one of natures sternest
laws been placed where he can no longer do
violence to those whose humanity made
christ their brother and him their enemy
we refer to this journal for the purpose of
instancing it as a fau specimen of the pro
slavery press of our country it is sui
generis evil and timeserving snd those
who rule its columns are ever ready to
bend the pliant hinges of the knee
that thrill may follow fawning
it is cheering to turn from such odious ex
amples to the fresh and generous pages of
those journals whose columns evince a better
purpose a loftier morality and a truer piety
than that which swells its cant in the
leaders of a hireling press
there are men in our country who had
rather suffer wrong than do wrong they
honor their profession let it be what it may
whether it leadathem to the editors table the
legal tribunal or the christian pulpit they
are those who will not bow themselves to
falsehood nor sell themselves to the bid of
mammon let sa instance the new york
evening post and its able poeteditor william
cullen bryant that paper is outspoken
and fearleea on all occasions when any great
principle demands its utteranoe aa far
aa we can remember it has stood firmly and
battled nobly against the tide of oppreeaioo
that would have swept it out of existence
had the wish been tfee parent of the means
its former editor willutm leggett a man
whom we love to remember as imbued with
an earnest devotion to liberty had more of
the better attribute of humenity in hie soul
than all the rest of the democratic party
whom he served so ably and toe well
let the beeches the leggetts end the
sumners of our day do their whole duty and
ere another session of our etatiooal legislature

boston oct th 
the meeting held last night in faoeuii
hall to oonatder the ooodition of the colored
citizens of boston end its vicinity consequent
upon tbs enactment of that hellblack scheme
by our free american congress for the re
capture of fugitive sieves was a powerful de
monstration the vast hall was crowded to
its utmost limits many were compelled to
leave unable to gain admission there could
not havo been fewer piesent then five thou
sand the spirit of the occasion equalled the
numbers i have never seen a meeting more
unanimous end strong it wss easy to see
that the vast multitude had assembled under
the influence of emotions of no ordinary char
acter there was a manifest eagerness eveil
before the appointed hour to have the speak
ing commence foot merely because they wanted
to bear but because they wanted their own
strong and impressible feelings expressed
they felt a daep sympathy for their alarmed
aod terrorstricken fellow cilixens upon
whom the late congressional cloud wasabout
to discharge its wrathful thunder and they
desired that speech earnest and strong
should erive thir quilrkiig hearts relief
hence when that noble man francis jack
son whose very countenance proclaimed him
fnid to the oppressed came forward to call
the meeting to order he was hailed with pro
longed and deafening cheers his presence was
regarded as an undication of what they might
expect to follow for he ia known of all met
in tbie region as the inflinehing friend of the
slave and of the oppressed black man you
will doubtless see the proceedings of this
meeting as reported for the daily papers but
i must be allowed to say a few words re
speeting them for good as those reports are
especially those of the chronolype and trav
eller they fall short of conveying to the read
er the real feeling which pervaded that as
semblage nor can i expect to do so it is be
yond the sphere of pen ink and paper to do
it to understand what that meeting was
seeing and hearing were indispensable the
congregated thousands must be visited the
universal buzz and confused clamor common
to auch masses and the sadden hush and fix
ed attention of such a multitude to one cen
tra point must be seen to be appreciated
the chairman of the meeting hon c
francis adams made the first speech it
was chaste lucid and earnest and was re
ceived with many tokens of applause the
speech though excellent was not the only
reason of the applause which followed it the
audience saw before them an adams a son
of john quincy adams and a grandson of
john adams illustrious names in the history
of the nation a bust of the grandfather
and a portrait of the father were both seen
just above the worthy chairman over the
rostrum ot faneuil hall the people saw
these and democratic as they doubtless are
they could not free themselves from the influ
ence of the aristocracy of noble deeds which
they saw there represented the grandfather
a leader in the american revolution a
statesman and an orator who had sounded all
the depths of honor and glorythe father
equally illustrious these things talk aa we
may about aristocracy do command respect
but let them pass
at the close of the chairmans address i
was called upon for a speech and especially
to state the condition of the colored people
under this new act for their oppiession 
had rode all day was tired excited and un
prepared to launch into suoh an undertaking
still i did not feel at liberty to decline and
therefore did the best  could at the close
of my speech came a letter from the hon
josiab quincy it was and able snd important
document mr dana who read the letter
made a few very appropriate introductory re
marks he called upon the audience to lis
ten to the letter ss coming from a venerable
souroe a man whose claims to be heard in
faneuil hall were not surpassed bythose of
any other man in the commonwealth my
readers shall have the letter in the north
star it is a valuable history of the legis
lation of our country in rsepect to fugitive
slaves from the very commencement of the
government until now when the reading
of this letter wss finished a thousand voices
shouted for phillips phillips wen
dell phillips he came upon the platform
his countenence glowed like sparkling iron
newly drawn from the flaming coals the
shouts which greatedhim bespoke the speak
er known without saying more it is enough
to say that his wss the great speech of the
evening it was brief concise and power
tul mr phillips was followed by mr james
a briggs of cleveland ohie atalentedtfree
toiler his remaiks were wel received
speeches wete also made by rev theodore
parker charles l remond w b spooner
snd rev nathaniel colver the latter closed
his speech by offering the following as the
last resolution in the seriesthat law or no law
constitution or no constitution union or no
union the slavemaster shall never drag
any man from our midst under the provisians
of the late fugitive stave bill this was
carried by aflslaimation six deafening cheers
were given and the meeting adjourned
it was said after the passing of the fugi
tive slave bill that the union is saved and
quite is restored the arch compromiser
henry clay exclaimed exultingly that peace
and harmony now reign throughout our bor
ders daniel webster in the very eestacy
of patriotic enthusiasm broke forth in the
language put in the mouth of the perfidious
sid murderous gloster by the immortal poet
now is tbe winter of our discontent made
glorious summer but is it so have tbe
landstorms and cold blasts of winter sub
sided snd have the bright sunshine and
flowers of summer come  no there is no
peace yet nor can there be thia aide of re
pentance never waa there a time when the
eternal father more signally vindicated his
authority in the affairs of men he bae con
founded the wisdom of tbe crafty and brought
tbe counsels of the ungodly to nought our
wise men have attempted to get respect for
their laws by trampling upon the law of god
and to heal the wounds of the confederacy
by infiicffng wounds on the negros back
their efforts are vain the whole north pre
sents a scene of agitation such as has never

agitation a just indignation pervades the
minds of all honesthearted people as yet
there are no signs of the glorious summer
anticipated by webster while the winter oj
our discontent becomes daily more apparent
i envy not the feelings of the inventors of
the diabolical scheme i believe it will recoil
destructively on their own heads the gal
lows so carefully and surreptitiously erected
fot the lowly and despised mordecai may yet
serve for the execution of the haughty and
tyrannical haman
it seems to me that these most worthy
grave diplomatic compiomising and treach
erous politicians have in some respects sig
nally failed in their object as the school
boy whistles to keep up his courage when in
nightly terror he runs through the church
yard so have they uttered a feeble cry of
peace peace but in response comes an
eaithquake and lo ihe land rocks from
centre to circumference the learned states
man henry clay with his keen sagacity and
wonderful presence failed to foresee the com
ing convulsion the modem mirabeau dan
iel webster with hts giant intellect and
colossal mind believed that all the clouds
were
id the deep bosom of the oceaa buried
and was fully prepared to bask in the sun
shine and take his siesta in a summer of his
own creation
and all went merry as a marriage bell
but hush hark a deepsound strikes liks a rising
knell
these humane and worthy coadjutors
though deaf to the voice of lamentation
weeping and great mourning which ia
ascending to heaven from hundreds of terror
stricken and outraged fugitiveswhose parted
bosom clings to wonted home as they pur
sue tbeir weary way into exile are never
theless constrained to listen to the unexpected
and simultaneous burst of indignation which
goes out from the people of these not them
cities as yet they know not of what it ia
the precursor but if it be true that con
science makes eowards of us all they may
well tremble one drop will sometimes make
the cup overflow how often when perusing
the history of bygone ages have we seen
that mighty revolutions appeared to hang
upon trivial incidents
there has been a rapid augmentation to
the ranks of the abolitionists let these
friends of the slave watchstand fast in
faith tpat them like menbe strong and
as in days past the counsel of ahitophel
was turned into foolishnessby him who
dooth according to his will in the army of
heaven and among the inhabitants of earth
so note may he cause the cruel machinations
of perfidious politicians to prepare the way
lot the opening of the southern prisonhouse
and the more speedy delivery of the captive
there needed something to awaken the dor
mant energies of many nominal friends of the
slave in our midst as some who say long
prayers never pray in heart so i be
lieve may we repeat an antislavery cteed
until it becomes a dead letter now however
the time for words has passed the time foi
action has come the curse of slavery with
all its accompanying horrors ia at our very
doors  incurred the penalty threatened to
him that hideth the outcast last week and
i will incut it again on the first occasion that
presents itself that noble man henry ward
beecher pronounces the new fugitive slave
bill the most powerful antislavery ieaaoner
that ever shook our northern forum
i trust that the fresh impetus given by it to
antislavery agitation will be ever renewed
until alavetys days are numbered and no
longer slave shall succeed to slave through

friderick douglass on arriving here
i find no little excitement about the fugi
tive slave bill since president fillmore
has unchained the tiger by the use of
t poo on the i sill or sept exerting his
power for the glory of god and the liberty of
man i have felt an irdent desire to have some
religiouspolitical watchman tell us what
the signs of promise arefor the world ia
expressing its opinion freely respecting that
enlightened and christian enactment called
the fugitive slave bill the sentiment of
which is doubtless the result of the inspiring
influence of his satanic majesty the climax
of his infernal wickedness
it seems to me that the world has misun
derstood till the sitting of the last united
states congress what the real and true mis
sion of that government is is it not a mission
of bonds and death our race have been
i taught to think that it was to be the example
of all coming human governments it being
itself the model of heaven as soon as it
should act upon the principle that there is
a higher power than the constitution but
all must confess that were all legislative
governments to follow the example it has set
of late that earth woud be anything else
than human
it may properly be asked would not the
devil do well to rent out hell and move to the
united slates and rival if possible president
fillmore and his political followers if he
can beat them at the game of sin the change
will be well would not fallen angels make
wise and humane senators compared with
cass clay and webster the fugitive slave
might have rejoiced had these men have had
the experience of a lost being or fillmore
the soul of satan the woiid must be con
vinced that damned spirits would do better
and honor more the representative hall than
such men as bissell brower buel ellott
fuller gilbert hibbard mann miller and
walden god grant that
tlwir names may rot
op the scroll of time
we are proud to say that even fugitive slaves
pity the nation that makes colored men slaves
and white men kidnappers but i pity the
man who willingly becomes such a slave and
beast of burden for
god has a bolt usburled
for such in store
i have often been struck with tbe great
contrast between king james of england and
president fillmore of america one with
stood the corrupting influences of irreligion
resisting demagogues priests and tbe pope
writing for god and in behalf of mangiving
the the poor and sustaining its hu
mane and godestablished institutions tbe
other floats on the popular current of infidel
ity and oppressionopposing the truth unless
humanity be a lie and seeking to sunder
every cord that rivets creature to cteature and
the finite to the infinite also the different
influence of these twe men upon their fellow
creatures james right position decision of
chsrscter and virtuous actions bound the
good will of his subjects to hitn with liga
ments of etetnal lovefixing the foundation
of his throne not in the pleasure of any des
pot but in the confidence and affection of his
loyal people but fillmores heartless posi
tion indecision of chsiseter and the want of
a virtuous soul have rendered him despicable
in the eyea of tbe good and contemptible in
the just opinion of the bad in seeking to
please tyrants he has lost the favor of all
and alas the true church of christ can no
longer pray for the success of his truckling
administration it has given their souls to
the oppressor and their bodies to the prison
if they dare do their duty in obedience to
christ in view of such fads it is my candid
eonvictiun that the tecoid of the infernal
regions can exhibit no blacker deeds than the
american archives and the accursed fugitive
slave bill upright humanity cannot uphold
the hand that signed that bill of abominations
unless it first does violence to its own nature
god is against the man who owns the hand
ha is weighed in the balance and found
wanting such men as do him honor
the devil fear
and slaves hate
this truth will be exemplified i believe in
certain parts of the country in the attempts
to take back to slavery and to deathyea in

slave bill in boston
the rev pharcellus church d d in a
sermon preached yesterday at the boston
square baptist church in a moat impressive
manner denounced thi bill anulling the trial
by jury and habeas corpus as follows
nothing can be moreinnocent than the in
terest we take in our political relations in a
government constituted like ours a solemn
duty is imposed upon us to interest ourselves
in elections and the course of legislation its
permanency and its success depend not upon
the power of the government but upon the
feelinga of the people it lives in the sun
shine of the popular favor we have tou
ranch at stake not to be interested our pro
tection in person and property the obligation
we are under to show mercy and justice to
ail require that we should do everything we
oan to insure the wisest and best laws im
perative however as may be our political
duties do they no expose us to the danger of
sinning elections involve party contests
which tareiy leave those enaged in them free
from guilt we seem to dismiss sll the ordi
nary considerations of obligation in our po
litical transactions and say of those who are
elevated to office what we should not date te
say of them as private individuals is theia
no danger also that we may be implicated in
tbe iniquitous measures of government
though i never wish to appear in active
political life  must be allowed to express nf
opinion because my deepest feelings prompt
me to it on a question which is justly agitat
ing the community  will not dwell upon
the constitutional aspects of the subject but
i cannot fail to pereeive that the elementary
principles of english law which we havu
adopted in our government have been aeii
ousfy violated ido not believe there ia a
highminded court in the universe that would
not so decree i allude to the fugitive slave
bill a moie cruel act of legislation can
hardiy be found enacted by any government
ip modern times a great outcry was raised
against austria tor her treatment of the
hungarians and yet has austria passed
laws coercing a portion of that illfated peo
ple in perpetual slavery has she sent her
officers over hungary to drag a portion of
the citizens into captivity in another part of
the country there to chain them and lash
them to service she has done no such
thing thank god
it was reserved for the home of the brave
and the land of the free to convert its
national police into mancatchers and slave
dealers it was left to us republicans to com
pel peaceful citizens and honest taxpayers
who helped to defray he expenses of the
government to compel them and their
children to be forced forever into a condition
of hopeless bondage one hour of which
as one of our former presidents said is
worse than centuries of that oppression our
fathers engaged in a seven years conflict to
overthrow how can such an act as this go
unavenged i tremble for my country
said jefferson in speaking of the cruelties of
davery when  remember that god is

fugitive slave meeting la faneuil hall
frederick dougaa addressed the meeting
he said that he appeared in behalf of a
suffering and horrorstricken people he
was not aware until a few moments previous
that he should be called upon to state the
condition and wants of his colored brethren
he came not here for the purpose of de
nouncing slavery generally nor to promulgate
to appeticulai theory for its suppression but
men ialtothe audience as men humane
peoplen behalf ot a buffering aud terrified
people
they were aware he said that by the
law lately enacted by congress and signed
by the president of the united states any
man in any part of our country who shall
make oath that he has lost a slave may pur
sue that slave any othei answering that
description and that slave or alleged slave
may be seized anywhere ironed and carried
back to bondage
back to bondage
this law he said has carried consterna
tion and despair to many families in the
north and in this city that there is this
alarm he had abundant evidence within
two days he said he had travelled five hun
dred miles and in this route he met with
many ut his brethren on the way from this
land of boasted freedom to canada
in many towns in the west nearly the
entire colored population freemen and fugi
tives are so alarmed that they are disposing
cf their property and making their way to
the british shores many even in this city
are anxiously inquiring what they
many who have lately arrived here are in the
utmost terror and alarm tney are airam
that the hunters of men will appear here in
the city of boston under the shade of bunker
hill and seize themthey dread a re
turn to slavery worse than death itself the
crime of escaping from slavery is considered
by the slaveholder as the highest crime il
he returns therefore he return to gratify a
deep seated revenge this is the active tto
live in pursuing a slave it is generally un
derstood by slaveholders that one who has
once tasted of the sweets of liberty can never
again make a profitable slave they there
fore pursue the slave in order to make evam
pies of them and the slave knows that if
returned he will have to submit to excru
tiaiing torture
hence these tears and this train going out
from the land as if fleeing from death many
of them are without the means to live and
are going to a severer climate and to face
colder winters than they ever dreamed of
those who remain he said ask you whal
you will do to protect them from this bond ol
bloodhounds many of them have escaped
from slavery with great sufferings and have
endhred tortures and if such acisof heroism
give any claims to freedom they can claim
il
the speaker then proceeded to desciibe
instances of suffering in escaping from sla
very in one instance mentioned the fugitive
tied himself to a tree during the day and
fled at night he asked if they would con
sent that these fugitives should be taken
back he was greeted with a universal no
he instanced also the case of a female fugi
tive now in new bedford who hid herself
in the hold of a vessel they smoked the
vessel as was the custom aud the woman
lay there in the hold almost suffocated hut
she resolved to die rather than to come ibrth
she had been be said a fugitive several
times before and had been recaptured at
one time to punish her her master took her
out tied her up and stripping her to the
waist laid on the lash until the warm blood
dropped at her feet he then washed het back
in brine and nailed her by the right ear to a
fence rail and in her agony she tore off the
outer rim of her ear he asked the audience
if they would let the slavehunters carry that
woman back a universal no was the re
ply
the speaker staled that his own family
had been thrown into the greatest alarm by a
telegraphic despatch that the alavehuniers
were after him and although he said lie
stood there a freeman in consequence of the
payment of ssoin british gold  a demo
cratic slaveholder in st michaels mary
land although this was known although he
had a bill of sale of himself he felt he con
fessed some fear that there might be a flaw
in the document and learning some of these
southern gentry were about to make him a
visit he resolved to meet them at home and
as his house was rather small and the party
probably rather large he went up to a trap
door in the attic in order to receive
one at a lime and tf they had made their ap
pearance he should he said have endeavored
to greet them with a hospitality befitting the
klace and occasion and many of his neigh
jrs had adopted the opinion that when men
act as bloodhounds they should be received
as such
in conclusion he said that if the people ot
the united states weie determined to carry
this law into execution the colored people
could not it they were at their
mercy how can half a million poor and
oppressed people a law backed up if
it be backed up by  of whites
we therefore he said proclaim no united
resistance to this law alter the fullest de
liberation we one and all without the
slightest hope ot making successful resist
anceresolved rather to die than to go
back if you are he said prepared to see
the streets of boston strewed with innocent
blood if you are prepared to see sufferings
such as no country ever witnessed just give
in your adhesion to the fugitive slave hill
you who live on the street where the blood
first spouted forth in defence of freedom and
the slaveholder will he here to bear the
chained slave back or he will he murdered in
our streets
wendell phillips was loudly called for and
appeared upon the platform he began by
stating that the action of our city representa
tive has thrown half a million of our people
two thousand of whom inhabit boston com
pletely atour mercy he wished lie said
he could trust them to the public opinion of
massachusetts letters had been received in
this city by fugitive slaves slating that men
are on liter way even to boston to pul thia
law into effect lie could not talk of vio
lence the colored men were at the mercy of
the whites he expressed wish that
public opinion was as powerful here to nullify j
a law opposed to the general sentiment of
the people as it was in south carolina
hoped that some future historian whould have
it to record that the panting fugitive when
he set his toot in massachusetts could feel
himself at rest we say he said that this
law is utterly unconstitutional we are not
hereor other issues we beg on our knees
for the poor boon of the constitution this
law allows a matt io arrest any one whom he
may claim as his slave without appeal but a
man thank god is primafacia a man north
of mason and dixons line until proved other
wise he spoke of the impossibility of his
proving his freedom before a southern jury
where according to their laws his fnrndr
and relatives cannot testify he spoke of a
scene in cincinnati where six men armed
with revolvers seized an alleged fugitive in
the open street and asked who knew that
he was a fugitive slave as was alleged in
this law he said the bulwarks of liberty arc
all broken and it is a base libel to call it a
comutuiionai law we have he remarked
one eliot in boston and he wished he could
doubt that we had eleven more to make up a
jury the path to the jury box lies through
defiance of a law if he concealetfa slave he
was liable to a fine of  but a jury
must try him the remedy therefore lies
in defiance end a jury met least reached in
a defiance of the law we must look to it
said he therefor to place sufficient living
men in the way of the slaveholder to make it
ro the language of daniel webster extreme
y inconvenient for him to reclaim his slave
we trust he said trample the law under
our feel there is no treason in that the
law expects die obedience provides for diso
bedience and god ferbid that it should b
disappointed he did not knew how it might
be in button bat in the country the jew
coaid be sustained by peaceful remittance
he said we must interrupt the slaveholder
and make it not worth bis while to attempt
reelsiraaiions we must say that the man
who has once touched the soil of massa
chusetts and breathed its air shall never go
back this at least we can say the con
stitulion we claim with its jury trials there
are many fugitives who have been here fiom
twelve to twenty years who have children
and we are not he said going to people
southern plantations with men born in massa
chusetts if we do bow down to the consti
tution he said dont let us bow a jot lowe
than otis and adams did of old he dared
not he said advise the coloied man but be
knew what he should do if the nation should
expel him from its laws and he advised them
to do the same he advised them to disobey
this law and if like the unjust judge they
rule it constitutional contiuue to disobey it
until you weary them out and they rule it
unconstitutional
mr jatms a briggs editor of a free
soil papenln cleveland ohio next addressee
the meeting he said that we owed obedi
ence to the law but not the law which assai is
right if the fugitive were not safe here he
said jet them dee to giddings district in
detroit they now had a fugitive slave safe in
jail and they may take him through michi
gan towards the south but they cant take
him through ohio it cantbe done
he gave an account of the escape of a fe
male slave with her babe in her arms from
the kentucky to the ohio shore across the
dotting cakes of ice a crowd had assembled
be said on liie cincinnati shorn hrouoht to 
gether by the sight and as the weman leaped
from cake to cake and death seemed to stare
hei in the face the shout went up  cour
age woman courage when she reached
the shore in safety she was grasped in the
arms of a kentucky slaveholder who had
witnessed the scene and who cried out in a
loud voice she has won her liberty and
she shall have it she was thea placed by
him in a carriage and conveyed to a place of
safety that slaveholder he said is now
editor of a free soil paper in ohio
theodore parker was the next speaker
he gave some facts relative to the arrival and
depaiture of fugitive slaves to and from bos
ton within the last ten days ten or twenty
liave gone from here to foreign lands and
ivithin a few days fifty or sixty fugitive
slaves have arrived here from other places
jn the th of this month a person from the
south writes that several police officers are
jetting affidavits intending to come here and
laim fugitives and the fugitive was advised
n the letter to buy in his liberty of his mas
er instead of that he went to dock square
md boughtsomething else this very
norning a wife whose husband has fled to
janada received a telegraphic despatch from
ter husband asking if it was safe to come
lack and the question he wanted to ask was
will you let him come back and how many
il defend him to the worst here a hand
ote was taken at first a few appeared but
rradually about two thirds of those in the
lall hed up their hands
mr parker gave his tribute ofpraise to
he course of mr winthrqp in the senate in
egard to this matter he also spoke in
ermb of condemnation of the course of mr
sliot he advised a recourse to peaceful
iolence to protect the fugitive let not
langerous weapons be resorted to but use
hose which nature has provided to impede
he progress of the slaveholder
mr charles l remond colored the next
peaker seemed to think that the resolutions 
lid net go far enough he would have resolu
ions go out so far as the colored people are
oncerned of a definite character to the 
laveholder the fact he said that their
tghts are taken away is sufficient to make
hem rebel and if to avow this was treason
le gloried in it they had resolved never
o go from this state by any process conjured
ip at the south but as a last resort would
ell their lives as dearlo as possible
mr wm b spooner a merchant of
road street said that he wished he could
inswer the question that had brought them
lere can the fugitive remain here in safe
y he would reply after mature delibera
ton that he thought as a a body they could
erhaps one or two might be carried off but
iven for them like the slave hamlet their
trice would be quickly raised and they
vould again return to feedom for such an
tbject he belive that even mr eliot would
reely contribute in conclusion he advised
hem to remain here quietly and they would
rot ec ted
mr douglass again addressed the meeting
md related an anecdote of the president of
he syracuse and utica railroad who upon
teing applied to said that no fugitive slave
hould be carried ironed over his road to the
south and gave orders that if any ironed
lave was put intp the cars to stop the train
ake off his non and set him at liberty
the rev mr colver was the last speaker
ie thought the resolutions hardly went far
mough he thought that an amendment
night be added of something like the follow
ng tenorresolved that constitution or
io constitution law or no law we will not
tllow a fugitive slave to betaken from massa
husettts mr colver interspersed his speech
tfith sundry humorous anecdotes he said
hat an athletic traveller heard on his journey
ries of distress proceeding from a cabin he
mtered and found a man beating his wife
irawing the man away from the woman lie
infolded him in his strong embrace until his
tones cracked crying out how i love you
rntil the poor husband was obliged to call
tut for mercy now said the speaker if
he slave hunter comes here and nobody else
will love him in this manner  will at the
lose of his speech the meeting which was
low reduced to about one half called out for
he putting of the resolution and it having
teen slated by word of mouth by mr colver

at a public meeting held on tuesday even
ing october h which filled minerva hall
almuat to overflowing and which waa as
spirited aa it waa large the following resolu
tiona were passed unanimously and wiih the
moat emphatic acclamation
resolved that the circumstances which
have made this convention necessary are such
aa require in ua the solemnity and earaeatness
becoming to a moat momentous occasion and
a spirit of wisdom and prudence which god
alone can give and that we apply ourselves
to the business before us with the feeling that
we have fallen on times in which principles
must show themselves in practice and philan
thropy in manful and perhaps selfdenying
action
resolved that we coasider the fugitive
slavq law  recently passed by congress
unconstitutional in that it abrogates the rights
of habeas corpus and trial by jury and pre
scribes a form of pincedure against the fugi
tive which overturns the moet essential princi
ples of common and constitutional law and
resolved that we consider this law im
moral in that it forbids the exercise of hospi
tality to the innocent way fater and requires
men to become hounds upon the track of the
wronged and hunted fugitives therefore
resolved that we regard this law as not
binding and void and hold ourselves bound
nor only not to obey but positively to disobey it
resolved thai we are bound to disobey
this iniquitous law lai by aiding the fugitive
slave whenever opportunity offers d bv
withholding the assistance which united
states officers will oliim in summooinu tim
posse cmnmuiuus tor me purpose or atrest
ing the fugitive and d by impending by any
means not inconsistent with morality the civ
il process by which the slavehunter will en
deavor to secure his prey
resolved that we warmly commiserate
the condition of the thousands of fugitive
slaves at the north and elsewhere to whose
homes and hearts the recent law has carried
terror and woe and that we promise that
they shall receive from us until fines con
sume our means and prisons confine our bod
ies such shelter and aid as we would ask for
ourselves were their circumstances ours
resolved that we deeply sympathize with
our truehearted friend and brother william
l chaplin and pledge ourselves  stand by
him to the last by a devotion of our time en
ergies and money to bail him from prison
ind defend him before the tribunals of the land
sixty dollars were raised for the benefit of
chaplin and at a late hour the meeting ad
ourned sine  henry wright
chairman
henry e peck secretary
we insert the above proceedings at the
tpecial request of the respectable clergyman
whose name is appended aa secretary but
nasmuch as it ia not out custom to lend our
tolumns for the purposes of those who eom
ine to violate the jaws and to urge upon
heir fellow citizens as a duty bloody resist
ance to the legal authority we deem it prop
r to accompany their publication with a few
emarks
no unpopularity which may attach to the
xpression of our honest convictions shall
under this journal fiom beating its emphatic
estimony against the doctrines put forth in
hese resolutions they are subversive of
aw and orderthey lead lo violencerapine i
jid murder if the principle upon which i
hey are baaed shall be generally received as
i rule of action we may bid farewell to gov
ernment and civil societywhat is that
rinciple simply this that any citizen
las a right to disobey and resist the execution
f any law which he may deem immoral or
ontrary to the law of god
now we run little risk in assuming that
he rev henry e peck considers the law
equiring the mails to be carried on sunday
f that character is he therefore to get a re j
olver and ahoot ail the post masters and mail i
igents if it s the duty of every fugitive
lave to shoot his pursuers and so we undei i
land the meeting of which mr p waa sec
etary voted then it certainly is no less the j
luty of every negto in bondage at the south
o spill his masters blood as ft means of i
anting bis liberty do we understand this
obe recommended it is a legitimate infer i
ince from the premises asumed at the mi
lerva hall meeting and if carried into prac
ice would cover the ground of thirty stales
with murdeied victims
ihe law which is so vehemently denoun i
ed may be uocorisututionalif so let that
e declared by the supreme coutt but till j
o pronounced it is binding and as much lo i
e obeyed as any other enactment of congress
he constitution says expressly that fugi
ivea from service shall be delivered up
i his is to us of the north a painful require j
nent but are we therefore freed from its
bligation shalt minister of god tell us j
what we are the truth is that a large por
ion of the citizenn of the norih intend to vi
date that requirement of the constitution
they do not mean to deliver up fugitive
laves this is the simple fact and it ia as j
ounding that good men preachers of the gos
el and influential presses should urge men
o resist unto blood the execution of the
undamental lawhow long can the gov
iinment be maintained if this doctrine con
inues to animate our peoplehow csll we
ail upon our brethren in other quarters of
he confederacy to observe the constitution
vhile we ourselves tread it under foot
it may be that we shall incur odium by the
itterance of such sentiments in the present
xcited and morbid slate of public opinion j
ive do not think it worth while to indulge in j
irofessions of regard for the colored people i
vhelher free or slaves it may be that in all
iractical legal efforts to aid in their elevation
ab shall do as much as those who incite
hem to bloody collision with the laws but
ve abide the dominion of legal authority
we respect the constitution and shall endea
ror to obey it we shall counsel none black
r white bond or free to resist its execution i
ind we cannot but regard those who do as
memies to peace good order and liberty
lfiey are doing all in their power to over i
urn the foundation of all prosperity safety
ind happiness as a nation american

harboring and feeding them and by furnish
ing means to elude tbe slavehunter he or
he should be regarded and treated as a kid
napper and as a traitor to god and hu
manity

commissioner marshal deputy marshal or
assistant or who in uny way officially or

charles f adams was called to the chair
five vicepresidents and two secretaries were
appointed and prayer waa offered by rev
dr lowell mr adams made the opening
speech in language peculiarly chaste and
calm but firm and clear in its condemnation
tworfdimaia uii ai   ihai
any edict of rome in her worst days n n i
mr adams was followed by frederick
douglass who spoke nearly an hour he
stated that his own family had been thrown
into great consternation by two telegraphic
dispatches received in one hour giving in
formation that slsvehunters were in pursuit
of him he was absent but hastened home
not feeling quite safe though his freedom
had been purchased with british gold and he
had in his pocket a bill of sale of himself
he related some cases of great suffering on
the part of slaves escaping from bondage
named their residence and condition and
asked whether tho people ef massachusetts
would suffer such persons to be taken from
them and returned into slavery to every
such question the immense congregation an
swered no no in almost deafening tones
a letter from hon josiah quincy who
was not able to be present was read by
richard h dana esq it was a calm and
thorough exposition of the new law and un
qualified condemnation of it as unconstitutional
md wicked and a decided expression of be
lief that it could not and would not be en
orced in massachusetts
after the reading of this letter resolutions
vere read by mrr dana and followed by ad
iresses from wendell phillips esq theo
lore parker mr harris of ohio remond
spooner c these speakers i wish dis
incily to say exhibited great moderation and
oolness considering the occasion none of
hem recommend violence or threats much
ess flight on the part of the colored people
they left the fugitive to his own choice as
o death or slavery in the last resort some of
he speakers simply offering what they would
 the effort of the meeting seemed to be
o create a public sentiment which should
nake the enforcement ol the law impossible

the fugitive slave law and the con j
regationalitsat a meeting of the new
fork evangelical association held at pough
keepsie october  the following resolutions
vere passed with reference to the recent fu
rtive slave law
resolved that we cannot recognize this i
aw as of any binding force upon the citizens
if our country ist because it is contrary to
he express command of god deut 
tthou shalt not deliver unto his master
he servant which is escaped from his master
into thee he shall dwell with thee even
imong you in that which he shall choose in
me of thy gates where it liketh him best
hou shalt not oppress him d it is in op
msition to the great law of christian benev
ilence which requires us in all things to do
into others as we would that others should
lo unto us d it conflicts with the provis
ons of our national constitution th it
irostrates those two great safeguards of hu
nan liberty habeas corpus and trial by jury
ith it is revolting to the spontaneous prompt
ngs of humanity th it brings upon our na
ion the reproach of injustice and inconsisten
cy and impairs our influence upon the world
or good th in short this law outrages
very principle of human feeling of humanity
ind religion and thus so far as the princi
leis concerned it endangers the liberty of
ivery man
resolved that w hile we recognize the ob
igation to obey the law of the hind we make
in exception in the case of all such provisions
is contravene the higher laws of god
resolved that we advise all persons to
ender every needful aid and comfort to fu
jittve slaves just the same as it there were
to law in the land forbidding it n y ivi
nine
fugitive slaves and hubeas corpus
we understand mr jy to say at the
neeting on friday that he had tried all the
fudges of this city and had been unable to ob
ain a writ of habeas corpus it is hoped that
ie and other legal gentlemen will examine
urther into the subjectthat no legal effort
nay remain untried and if they cannot suc
ieed that they will give the ground of objec
ion on the part of the judges det trib
we hope this matter will not be surred
iver but put to the extremes test it has
een alleged here by sound thinkers that the
habeas corpus cannot be suspended in any in
stance and that a judge who refuses to grant
t w rit of habeas corpus in such a case would
render himself liable to impeachment the
sooner this question is settled the better
agitation will not cease while it is admit
ted the recourse to this great popular right
cannot be had in the case of a fugitive arrest
ed under the late law
the detroit advertiser says that five hun
dred dollars have been raised and paid to the
claimant of rose if so the chance of test
ing an important question ia probably lost
a correspondent of the buffalo courier
slates that the negro belonged to a brother of
the hon r l rose of ootdlio county in
this stalethe owner pocketed the money
and departedwe have no doubt that slave
holders and their agents will be vere ready to
take advantage of this example and northern
people can have as many slaves as they ate

in canada many jears go slave
waa arrested under the pretence of
atealiac watch but in fact he waa a
fugitive slave and waa thrown into
prison for several weeks and was
finally conveyed off by bis master
therefore he said if the slave seeks
canada for refuge a better organiza
tion must be gone into good lawyers
must be engaged yes i mean good
ones lawyers who can command res
pect or the judges will be against
you one judge in particular i mean
judge sherwood you must gentle
men to the rwcue it mu at be done
i for myself will do my part lam
willing to take my revolver and take
my own part i say find rescue the
fugitive slave second send him to
canada and thirdly aelfdefenc
we will not fight willingly we do
not intend to proyoke a fight but let
us protect the slave here we ought
to aspire to something more than ser
vile labor let us dig the ground and
not black the shoes applause it
is a fact that all the colored people do
not know how to read but they know
how to fight after the noise had sub
sided a little the speaker continued
the white gentlemen uphold their
respect by fighting duels and my
friends if you want to carry your
points and command respect you must
fight overwhelming applause and
exclamations of we will that we
will
mr downing then announced that
he waa informed the wife of the fugi
tive slave had died that day of t
broken heart at williamsburgh and
proposed to raise a subscription for the
purpose paying the funeral expenses
he said it would be a shame to allow
any other persons to do that honor
than this meeting accordingly the
hats and plates were handed around
and  was soon collected after
the money was counted
a person rose and wished to know
if the sister of mrs hamlet was
present if so let her comejforward as
the fact was necessary to know if she
was dead he said that a number of
persons were present from williams
burgh up to a late hour from that place
and none had learned the fact of her
death after many calls for the sister
to come forward no one appeared and
it was finally concluded that the state
ment was falsethat she was not dead
but whether dead or alive said one
of the speakers the money collected
shall be appropriated for her benefit
but we do not wish to collect money to
bury a woman who is not dead laugh
ter
benjamin stanley a very dark com
plexiooed man from north carolina
said to be by several colored men
present a distant relation of mr stan
ley the menber of congress ad
dressed the meeting with a good deal
of spirit said he go to your homes
good wives and prepare them to receive
your husbands and friends wuh bruised
arms and broken heads tor his part
he recommended them to arm the slaves
with bowie knives and revolvers and
arm yourselves like men and rescue
yes that is the word you must do
the work the poor fugitive slave
you must recollect has not the courage
of you men north nor of the men who
have escaped from slavery for several
years no gentlemen they are fear
ful and know not what to dothey
are trembling in their boots in fear of
their master conveying them back to
bondage yet gentlemen shame to
relate you suffer a man to be taken
from your midstyes in a population
of  colored people to be seized
at nosnday the manacles put upon
him and he carried off by force back
to chains and slavery i say again
the fugitive slave is not safe here but
if they do remain here you must pro
tect them they have not the courage
necessary to protect themselves you
must do it and show that a population
of twentyfive thousand colored people
will not allow the fugitive to be con
veyed back to bondage great cheer
new york must be the battle ground
we cannot battle at the south and
therefore it must be done here ap
plause if it is not worth fighting for
here it is not worth fighting for at all
cheers and applause an albany
paper remarked the other day that it
was good to get rid of a worthless
population what would they say to
put a white loaferyes a dirty white
loafer who rolls about in the mud
gatter into chains aud will you
stand by and see one of your own color
thrown back into chains and slavery
immense excitement with cries of
no no no never and let me
tell the fugitive slave to supply himself
with a bowie knife and if he cannot
get arms to defend himself let him
hollow ont when seized and placed in
to acarriage kidnappers and will
you stand peaceably by and allow him
to be thus carried away loud cries
of no no therefore how much
better it is for the fugitive slave to stay
here and if he must die to die with
his triends for if he goes to canada
he may be taken at last cheers
edward v clark almost as black
as the former speaker he skid that
he did not agree exactly with the for
mer speaker said he i am well aware
that the fugitive slave law just passed
is now the law of the land and as to
the principle of dying before your time
it waa much better in theory than
practice for my part i was very sick
the othor day and thought i should
die but still i had no inclination to
leave this world laughter go on
i am opposed to conflicting with the
law  dont know what i might do
with a bowie knife or a revolver  am
greatly averse to taking lite sup
c in defending one we lose the
iol seven you see it would be a
loosing game you see dearly we lose
now i go for secreting the slaves
keep them private bhift them about
let each slave report himself to the
ecret committee the law has been
passed and it must be carried outand
sufficient force will no doubt be called
to carry it into effect however odious
this law may be still it is a law and all
the lives we lose in opposing it will be
a dead loss to us laughter i say
again keep thu fugitive secreted we
can do it if any of them have obtained
a little money or property about them
let them at once make it over to some
pther person and move off out of reach
we shall gain nothing by fighting
against the law
rev charles r ray roee and
announced that at  oclock that after
noon the balance of the money had
been paid in making up the boo for
the liberty of hamlet the fugitive slaw
taken the other day to baltimore
therefore he would come back to hit
wife mid family at this information
great xheering took place and soon af
ter the meeting adjourned it being
then near oclockx  standard

be acquainted with the kidnapping law

public action oa the fugitive
slave law
at meetings called for the purpose
oberlin oct ist d and th the fol
lowing resolutions were fully discussed
and earnestly adopted
resolved that we regard the late
fuffitive tv uatk age
and a tyrannical government and that
we acknowledge with mortification and
shame this evidence that barbarism
and oppression in our country have tri
umphed over the spirit of liberty and
of progress
that the provisions of this bill are in
plain and flagrant violation of the con
stitution of the united states in the
following particulars it suspends the
action of the writ of habeas corpus in
a case not warranted by the constitu
tion it deprives a citizen of the right
of trial by jury in a case transcending
in importance every pecuniary consid
eration and it deprives persons of lib
erty in entire disregard of the course
of proceedings which a due process
of law would demand
that a union which brings us under
the law of slavery and enjoins upon
us the loathsome work of slavecatch
ing shall not be numbered among our
precious things and that if our submis
sion to such disgrace is to be the con
dition of its existence we cannot pay
the price
that we contemplate with mingled
emotions of humiliation and disgust the
action of a congress that could pass
and of the president who could sign
a bill containing these iniquitous pro
visions and that we find in this dis
graceful event a melancholy proof of
the oftrepeated assertion that the
slave power not only rules in the south
but has poisoned our national legisla
tion and made the national executive
a catchpoll for the recovery of its
victims
that while we regard the command
to hide the outcast and not to bewray
the wanderer and not to deliver unto
his master the servant that is escaped
from his master as embodying princi
ples sanctioned by the highest law
giver and while we regard this law as
forbidding what god commands and
as commanding what god forbidswe
will study to obey the law which tran
scends all human enactments appeal
ing id the language of the apostle even
to those who have decreed this un
righteous decree whether it be right
in the sight of god to hearken to you
more than unto god judge ye
that we tender our thanks to the
congress and president of the united
states for having advertised the people
of file north of the meanness of the
work demanded of them and the miser
able venality of the men who are to
figure as the tools in this abhorrent
business by offering the pitiful bribe of
five dollars to the commissioner who
will decide to consign a fellowbeing to
slavery on the testimony of robbers and
menstealers
that the northern man who as
judge commissoner or marshal or
in any capacity shall consent to aid in
the execution of this law has too little
of the man about him to claim our pity
or move our contempt
that while by the provisions of this
law the area of slavery is virtually ex
tended over the whole country and the
entire power of the general govern
ment arrayed on the ride of the claim
ant of slaves yet we hereby solemnly
affirm that while our fugitive brother
remains in our midst we will stand by
him to the last to protect him by all
justifiable means in our power
that those northern men who voted
for the socalied fugitive bill knowing
as they must the feelings of their con
itituents deserve the condemnation
and execration of all good men and
we believe their names will go down to
posterity a hissing and a byword
that j m root our fearless rep
resentative in congress and those who
labored with him are worthy of our
hearty thanks for the noble stand they
have taken in the cause of liberty
that we recommend the holding of
mass xvleetings throughout the noith
to express and embody the feeling of
the people against this bill of abomi
nations and that various measures be
prosecuted immediately to secure its
repeal and that we call on the con
ductors of the press the members of
the bar and the ministers of the gos
pel to unite their efforts to annul this
statute so at war with liberty law
and religion
that we see in this act fresh and
convincing proof that the constitution
of the united states must either be
given up to the slaveholders or be in
terpreted as all laws should be inter
preted and thus be rescued from sla
very and made to subserve the great
ends for which it declares itself to be
framed

dr kelsey being loudly called upon
addressed the meeting in some elo
quent remarks which were louly
cheered
the comuuttae o
purred the following which were unani
mously adopted
resolved that we are whigs and
that politically we are nothing else
and that we ardently desire and will
earnestly labor for the success of the
whig nomination of our state and
country
resolved that we recognize in
millard fillmore a whig ol approved
fidelity that is truly national policy
and wise moderation in a period of
unexampled difficulty and perplexity
have produced the happiest results and
entitle him to the gr atitude of his
country and that his administration is
eminently deserving of support from
the entire whig party of the union
resolved that we deeply lament
the apparent and as we trust tempo
rary division of the whig party of this
state caused by the extraordinary ac
tion of the majority in the syracuse
convention in rejecting the excellenf
and conciliatory resolutions reported
by the regular committee on resolu
tions and the adoptions of others which
censure by necessary implication a
large number of whig representatives
who thought it their duty to vote for the
settlement of the bundary controversy
with texas as recommended by presi
dent fillmore in his message of the
th of august last
resolved that the inexorable re
quirement of the majority in the syra
cuse convention that the majority
should render especial thanks to
gov seward for acts in which he
separated himself from all his whig
associates in the senate which our
judgment cannot approve and form no
part of the whig creed or platform
was tyrannical and directly calculated
to destroy the harmony unity and
efficiency of the party
resolved that in our opinion it is
the chief duty of the utica convention
to counteract the mischievous conse
quences flowing from this conduct o
the majority at syracuse by declaring
to our brethren of this state and of
other states the true whig ground on
which we stand and have always stood
and by taking measures to secure the
election of the sate ticket without
making ourselves or our candidates
justly liable to the imputation of sec
tionalism abolitionism or any other
destructive heresy sought to be fast
ened upon the party
resolved that while we are dis
posed in good faith to carry out all the
requirements of the constitution ns
well when they do not accord with our
interests and sympathies as when they
do we nevertheless approve of the vote
given by our immediate representative
hon a m schermerhorn and the
other whig members from this state
in congress against the fugitive
slave bill in asmuch as we deem its
provisions harsh oppressive and at
variance with the usual course of legal
pioceedings in the free states
gems of truth duty is not only
pleasant but cheap every mans
actions from a centre of influence upon
others and every deed however
trivial has some weight in determining
the future destiny of the world the
good fruits of human life are the pro
duce of mingled smiles and tears as
th fruits of the field require sunshine
and rain as without clouds there can
be no rain and without rain no fertili
ty so without sorrow there can by no
tears and without tears the heart jvould
soon be barren a cloud upon the
soul shrouds and darkens the earth
more than a cloud in the armament
the spectacle is in the spectator
every deceased friend is a magnet that
draws us into another world they
who are independent in love are gen
rerally so in everything else if weak
in this respect they are generally weak
in other respects how rarely do we
accurately weigh what we have to
sacrifice against what we have to gain
one act of beneficence one act of real
usefulness is worth all the abstract
sentiment in the world it is happy
enough that the same vices wich impair
oness fortune frequently rum the con
stitution that the one may not survive
the other british banner
fugitives is canada the to
ronto globe of the isth says great
numbers of escaped slaves still coutinue
to pour into canada from all parts of
the united states most of these ref
ugees go towards the elgin colored
association in the western district
and are here we understand pur
chasing land from the rev mr king
the president of the association as
fast as he can sell it to them
families are separating leaving
their homes and dying in all directions
to seek in canada under the british
flag the protection denied them in tne
free republic
we would not feel called upon to
remark upon the bill were it not likely
to prove injurious to ourselves by driv
ing immense numbers of slaves to set
tle among us but in flying from dan
cer it is quite natural that they should
direct their course to the nearest place
of safety and that place is canada
