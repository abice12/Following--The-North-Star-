lf the friends of freedom would ab

grown cotton it would have a tendency
to diminish this horrible traffic en
courage the freelaboring farmers of

sweat and toil and it may exert a mor

it will gain the good will of the poor
white citizens of the south to the cause
of human freedom
whatever may be the difference of
opinion as to the moral right to pur
chase slave labor products all anti
slavery men ought to feel the obliga

rather than the master of slaves and
even should we pay a cent or two more

that the interests of humanity demand
it and therefore do it oheerfully

walked from the stand to the outskirts

a child of her own in her arms and
proceeded to draw a rope from his
pocket to tie her claiming at the same
time that she was a fugitive slave of
one ot his neighbors and saying that
he was sent after her and took this
plan to find her in order to secure the
reward of  dollars offered for her

in  we declared that all men
arc qpeated equal and endowed by
their creator with certain inalienable
rights among which are life liberty
and the pursuit of happiness
in  we formed the confed
eracy with no provision for the sur
render of fugitive slaves
in  we shut out slavery from
the northwest territory forever by
the celebrated proviso of mr jefferson j
in  the constitution was formed
with compromises and guarantees
in  ihe importation of slaves
was forbidden but

friendship is the cordial of life the

destitute of this blessing amidst the

rounded with flatterers and admirers

elevated station in life affords no ex
emption from those agitations and dis
quietudes which can only be laid to
rest on the bosom of a friend
the sympathies even of virtuous
minds when not warmed by the breath
of friendship are too faint and cold to
satisly the social cravings of our nature
their compassion is too much dissipa
ted by the multiplicity of its objects
and the varieties of dstress to suffer
it to flow long in one channel while
the sentiments of congratulation are
still more slight and superficial a
transient tear of pity or smile of com
placency equally transient is all we
can usually bestow on the scenes of
happiness or misery which we meet
with in the paths of life but man nat
urally seeks for a closer union a more
permanent conjunction of interests a
more intense reciprocation of feeling
he finds the w ant of one or more with
whom he can trust the secrets of his
heart and relieve himself by imparting
the interior joys and sorrows with
which every human breast is fraught
he seeks in short another self a kin
dred spirit whose interest in his wel
fare bears some proportion to his own
with whom he may lessen his cares by
sympathy and multiply his pleasures
by participation
the satisfaction derived from sur
veying the most beautiful scenes of
nature or the most exquisite produc

plete that it almost turns into uneasi
ness when there is none with whom
we can share it nor would the most

the way to be happy
a story is told of two travellers in
lapland which throws more light on
the art of being happy than a whole
volume of precepts and aphorisms
upon a very cold day in the winter
they were driving along in a slidge
wrapped up in furs from head to foot
even their faces were mostly cover
ed and you could see scarcely any
thing but their eyebrow aad there
were white and glistening with frost
at length they saw a poor man who had
sunk down benumbed and frozen in the
snow
we must stop and help him said
one of the travellers
stop and help him replied the
other you will never think ot stopping
on such a day as this we are hall
frozen ourselves and ought to be at
our journeys end as soon as possi
ble
but i cannot leave this man to
perish rejoined the more human trav
eller i must go to his relief and
he stopped his sledge come said
he come help me to rouse him
not  replied the other i have
too much regard for my own life to ex
pose myself to this freezing atmosphere
more than is necessary i will sit here
and ktep myself ns warm as i can till
you come back
so saying he resolutely kept his
seat while his cutnpanion hastened to
the relief of the perishing man whom
they had so providentially discovered
the ordinary means for restoring con
sciousness and activity were tried with
complete success but the kindheart
ed traveller was so intent upon saving
the life of a fellow creature that he
had forgotten his own exposure and
what was the consequence why the
very effort which he made to warm the
stranger wanned himself and thus he
had a twofold reward he had the
sweet consciousness of doing a be
nevolent act and he also found himself
glowing from head to foot by reason of
the exertions which he had made and
how has it with his companion who
had been so much afraid of exposing
himself he was almost ready to
freeze notwithstanding the efforts he
had been making to keep warm
the lesson drived from tins little inci
dent is very obvious we are all
travellers to a distant country at
every step of our journey we find ether
travellers who need our friendly aid
nay god has brought hem around
our path in great numbers and far as
the eye can reach we see their dense
and gloomy ranks now there are two
ways of meeting these objects of chris
tian sympathy and brotherly regard
we can go forward with the stern pur
pose of a selfish and unloving spirit
saying in reply to every appeal which
is viddressed to our better feeling
depart in peace be ye warmed and
filled or wo can say with the warm
hearted traveller i cannot see this
tuan perish must hasten to his relief
and the rule which we adopt for our
guidance in such cases will determine
the question whether we are to be
happy or unhappy the man who
lives only lor himself cannot be hap
py god does not smile upon him
and his conscience will give him no
peace but he who forgets himself in
his desire to do good not only becomes
a blessing to others but opens a per
petual fountain of joy in tm own bosom

the duty of prayer lf there is
a supreme being author of this world
which we inhabit who sustains it by
the power of his word and who would
be known and adored by bis creatures
it is the first duty of man to lift his
eyes to heavep to recognize the
to whom he owes allegiance to offer
him homage for all he has received at
his hands what then is the man
who acknowledging the supreme be
ing never prays to him he is a
wretched being who has no god who
is living alone in the world attached to
no being but himself who falleth back
upon his own heart finds nothing there
with which he may commune but his
pains his disgusts his troubles and
fears he is that unhappy man who
expects nothing beyond the tombwhose
hopes and desires are all confined here
below who regards himself a vapor
formed by chauce ready to dissolve
and vanish forever in the immensity of
nonexistence who believes himsell
created only for the fleet days that he
is to appear on the earth who looks
abroad in the world as a man whom
chance has cast alone upon some iuac
cessabie island where he may live
without a master without a sovereign
without care or discipline expecting no
assistance anticipating no better des
tiny importuning heaven with no future
desires sending no wish or hope across
the abyss that surrounds him and
seeking no alleviation of his wretched
condition but in a listless indolence

fast eating
the practice of eating our weals in
a hurry so common among us ameri
cans has long been a fruitful theme of
ridicule with foreigners it is a trite
observation that we do not eat our
food in this country we bolt it the
celerity with which our business men
especially stow away huge quantities
of fish flesh and fowl into their stom
achs is perfectly astonishing were
it not so general a practice one would
conclude that they were engaged in
some disagreeable mechanical process
which it was desirable to get through
with as expeditiously as possibleor
else that they were cramming upon a
wager certain it is that you rarely
see a live yankee sit down coolly and
deliberately to a meal as if he appre
ciated the appetizing qualities of the
delicacies and luxuries before him
he regards all the different dishes in
the same light viz as so much gross
material to fill a void and not as sub
stances gifted with rich essenceshid
den flavors that require to be brought
out and analyzed not so with john
boll however large the quantity of
food he gorges at his meals he never
dispatches it in a hurry he sits
down to his roast beef as to a days
work and proceeds calmly and care
fully to discuss each slice as if he were
fully sensible of its delicious qualities
and profoundly thankful to the gra
cious providence that thus ministered
to his most earnest cravings
speaking of fast eaters a modern
writer has the following remarks upon
the intellectual characteristics of this
class of men which are quite novel and
original
a fast eater may be a man of infor
mation but he will never be a man of
taste for whyhe lacks the gift of ap
preciation he may swallow the con
tents of many books and gorge any
given quantity of facts in the same
manner as he gorges his food but he
will never be a man that loves the
beautiful either in art or nature he
will not care a whit about sunsets or
ihe choicest groupings of wood and wa
ter and a panoramic exhibition or
ihe scenery of a playhouse will suit
hirn better than the delicate graces and
minute finish of a leslie or a newton
he may enjy the rich humor of a
smollett because it is at the same time
broad and obvious but he will never
detect the subdued quiet manifestation
of the same quality iri a goldsmith or
relish the the exquisite pleasantries or
yet finer pathos of charles lamb and
as for nothing the lights and shadows
or feeling themore subtle beauties of
poetry how can it be expectetf of a
person that eats shad just as fast as he
eats halibut yankee blade
the poetry of steam this lron
age we are told is unfavorable to the
cultivation of poetry its machinery is
incompatible with imagination its rail
ways are the antipodes of nature it is
ridiculous to think of putting parnassus
under the plough and starting a steam
boat on helicon all this mav be very
wise and very witty but to say that
industry and poetry are antagonisms
for this is the sum of the whole is to
confound poetry with verse making
if the ancient greek were evoked
from his toomb of ages and set to wan
der through the wonderful country we
term unpoetical he would be thrilled
with mingled delight and awe and his
impressions would gush forth in a tor
rent of song the manufactory would
be to him a world of poetry the thun
der of its machinery would be more
truly than that of the tempest the
voice of viewless but intelligent spirits
and its productions changing from
rude shapeless masses till they come
forth perfect in form and beauty would
appear the woik of enchantment the
fiery locomotive skimming like the
wind along the surface of the earth
gliding by the side of precipices span
ning gorges and valleys and plunging

black as erebus would take away hfa
breath while the steamship with her
banner of smoke attempting impossi
bilities yea getting the better of them
sailing defyingly up into the very eye

are reading conversation and thought
if our existence after middle life is not
enriched by these it becomes meagae
and dull indeed and these will prove
sources of pleasure just in proportion

pleasurable thought during its solitary
hours which has no knowledge of the
treasures of literature and science
which has made no extensive acquaint

those who know nothing but on the
other hand what delight is that mind
able to receive and impart which is
able to discuss any topic that comes up

good listeners in the world who make
all the use they might make of the un
derstanding of others in the conduct of

instrument of conversation is the dis
play of superiority not the gaining of
those materials on which superiority
may rightly and justly be founded
every man takes a different view of the
question as he is influenced by consti

motion by many causes and affected
by an endless variety of accidents
nothing in my humble opinion would
bring an understanding so forward as
this habit of ascertaining and weighing
the opinions of others a point in which
almost all men of abilities are deficient
whoso first impulse if they are young
is too often to contradict or if the
manners of the world have cured them
of that to listen only with attentive

done for his own improvement and as

william l chaplin a native of massa
chusetts long a resident of the state of new
yorkthe accomplished gentleman the ripe
scholar the upright statesman the whole
souled philanthropist the sincere practical
christian william l chaplin is imprisoned
at the city of washington the capital of
our republic charged
first with having assisted certain en
slaved fellowmen in their attempt to escape
from bondage and
secondly with an assault upon those who
arrested him with an intent to kill them
for these alleged offences he is now held
in duress vile by the police of the district
of columbia and also under a requisition of
the governor of maryland
now be it known to all men that be did
not commit the second offence named above
at the time of his seizure he he had no
weapon of violence about his person nor does
he ever wer any neither did he know that
his companions were armed much less did
he counsel them to make resistance all this
we know and do affirm he was ignorant too
of the character of the persons wbo seized
him no warrant for his arrest was an
nounced a band of men like ruffians in
the darkness of night came upon him on the
highway and the first salutation he received
was a savage yell and a blow that felled him
senseless to the earth when he recovered
from the shock he was in the hands of four
stout men and therefore powerless
the persons who were with mr chaplin
made an effort unhappily without success
to ave themselves frqm the monsters who
would return them into slavery but no one
of either party was seriously injured unless
it were the self sacrificing chaplin lie was
severely braised by the ruffians who captured
him
the other charge that he helped men in
their attempt to escape from slavery if true
should fix upon his good name the stigma of
no crime unless it be a crime to act in obedi
ence to the commaud of christ to follow the
example of the good samaritan
chaplin has the heart of a man quickened
by the spirit of the son of man lie was
in that bad region of our country which is
infested by the worst of robbers where men
and women are often found stripped not so
much of their raiment as of all the rights of
human beings wounded many of them in
their persons but all of them in their feelings
in the tendeiust relations of life and left with
not indeed an much as half of what constitutes
the true life of men surely if the poor
travellei between jerusalem and jericho was
to be pitied and his relief attempted dot
withstanding the dangers of the place much
more every christian must allow ahould w
attempt at any hazards to ourselves the
rescue of a fellowman who is subjected t
the terrible wiong of ameitcan slavery
w l chaplin if he has done all that the
charge alleges has done no mure than the
good samaritan would do and for this we
honor we love him to deliver him flora
confinement ihetefore as soon as possible
that be may renew and redouble hin gener
ous exertions in the cause of suffering hu
manity we feel ourselves impelled by the
highest selse of duty and the deepest feel
ings ot sympathy with him and brotherly
kindness to all men we call upon all wbo
have any love of christian heroism to help
us the last mau who should be kept in
confinement or subjected to any disabilities
in our country or in our world is the man
wbo is ever ready to spend his time bis
strength his all to break the yoke of the
oppressor and set the captive free sucb is
the man who is imprisoned in the jail of the
foiled slates
we plead we insist we demand that his
prison door be thiown open not no much for
hit sake fur we know he counts it joy to suf
fer in the cause of humanity as far our owo
sakea that we may quicken our own and each
oihere love of liberty by doing honor to ha
exalted spirit of selfsacrificing philanthropy
we came to this cazenovia convention
that we tnigb congratulate some r the many
in this region who have escaped from a worse
than egyptian bondage and advise with diem
sod their friends as to the obligations that
reat upon us in regard to the nullioßs of our
countrymen wbo are longing to be likewise
free there have been with us about fifty
fugitives but the fugitives bravest friend has
not been here and we have almoet forgotten
the fifty wbo ate safe to our concern for the j
one who is left behind in the clutches of those
who bne no respect for the nghu of colored
men or of the colored mens friend
hie story of chaplins captuie has been
told us by a devoted fellowlaborer and roost
of the time of the convention his been given
to the consideration of his case we were
shown that the expenses already incurred
in his behalf the legal processes to which we
may be obliged to resort and the services of
the ablest counsel will demand of his friends
sn amount not less than twenty thousand
dollars but what is that for ua to pay if
those in out country who profess to love the
practical application of the principles of chris
tianity will give their due proportion no
one would be impoverished nay all would
be enriched for whatever ii given in such a
cause as this iiso invested at to yield an in
comparably better interest than any soulless
corporations psy le then the rich men
give their hundreds and the poor widows
their nuites that all rosy share in the joy of
chaplins deliverance and that the people of
our land and other lands may know that
there are many thousands in ibis republio
who will not bow the knee to baal but respect
and love the überaior although he be chain
ed in a dungeon for more than the oppressor
of our fellowmen though he walk at large
in the palace of our nation
what is to be done fot chaplin must be
done quickly a generous contribution and
a more generous subscription were made by
the members of the convention just closed
and a large committee were appointed to
hasten with this appeal to alf tint good and
true and urge yon to respond at nee to this
demand upon your purses give freely
give without delay measure your contribu
tions by your abilities and both the amount
and the readiness of your gifts by the goljen
rulethat there may be nothing wanting to
show the respect that is due to our brother
and to defend him triumphantly against all

there were occasions whenoconnell preferred
that what he said should not be printed there
of this an amusing anecdote has been given
oconnell was on a visit to ireland and in
dulging in long speeches of a most combus
tible character when the government
thought fit to send over some short hand wri
ters to take down the harangues the first
appeatance of the government reporters was
at a meeting at kanturk the gentlemen
were englishmen says he story and be
longing to mr gurneys reporting siaff
they came on the platform and introduced
themselves to mr oconnell he shook them
by the hands and said to those around thein f
nothing can be done here until these gen
tlemen are afforded every requisite accomjda
tion this was at once provided and hav
ing assured mr oconnell that they were
perfectly ready and well provided for he
came forward to address the people and com
menced his speech to the great dismay of the
englishmen in the irish language having
explained to the assembly who they were and
how he humbugged them he continued in the
same language to address to the meeting
everything he wished to convey to them the
people laughing all the while at the english
reporters whilh they joined very good hu

cazenovia convention again
the arrival of the hour tor the departgefi
of the mail ft ora peterboro to rochester
found us only at the beginning of our tajj
giving an account of the caaenovia conven
tion we shall now continue that letter
though you have the official proceedings f
that convention spread before you in tfcflj
dumber of the north star if we can am
nothing in detail i may perhaps give ii
illustration of its doings and rhus help
swell the influence of one of the most in
portant and remarkable demonstrations ever
made in this country
it will be seen by the resolutions and ad
dresses that the convention assumed the
highest ground known as the basis of its
action the rights of the slave the wicked
ness of the slaveholder and the duty of tbs
abolitionist were viewed from a standard
point above all the complicated arrangements
of men calling themselves nations the
slave was here regarded as a man he
i was looked upon bv all who spokeas a man
and nothing less than a man his humanity
and not he inhuman laws that brand him a
a slave was regarded as the criterion of om
relations and duties towards him in this
point the convention was unanimous the
laws of slavery were esteemed bat the in
fernal edicts of piratesthe religion of slave
holders was held to be a horrid and revolting
blasphemy against the majesty of heaven
and a moral war was declared against the
law and the religion thus specified
these views were brought out especially
in reference to the case of wm l chaplin
now in prison in the capital of this false and
shameleas republic on a charge  having
attempted to assist two men m their perilous
flight from slavery to freedom in respect to
the rig hi fulness of rendering such assistance
as that ohatged against mr chi pi in there
was we think but one opinion he was not
hound to respect the villanous enactments of
pirates and sconudrels the passengers in
mr chaplins wagon were men and having
committed o crime were free men and as
fully entitled to their freedom as either the
honorable mr toombs or the honorable mr
stephens he who denies this is either in
head a fool or in heart a knave and he who
tlfiirus it affirms at the same time not only
me innocence but the heroism and christian
spirit of mr chaplin
the gtound was distinctly taken in the
convention that slave laws should be held
in perfect contempt that it is the doty of the
slave to escape when he can and that it is
equally the duty of every freeman to help the
slave in his flight to freedom when he can
for our part we rejoice in every successful
escape from slavery not more because it
leaves one less to be redeemed from bondage
and is one more added to the ranks of free
dom but because it serves to weaken the
whole system of slavety by rendering slave
property insecute then  we rejoice
equally when the inhuman laws of slavety
are boldly violated since one such example is
worth many precepts in bringing such laws
into the contempt in which they ought to be
held this nation must be taught that theif
unnatural and jrgodly enactments will be
regarded by the true and the good as of no
binding force and as only worth to be tram
pled in tha dust when congress shall enact
the heavendaring and humanityinsulting bill
now pending making it criminal to obey god
in the matter of taking in the stranger and
in deliveriog the spoiled out of the hand of
the spoiler may there arise in the land ten
thousand chaplins who shall prefer dsath to
such a law
but there is nothing we apprehend in the
whole ptoceediogs of the caxenovia conven
tion which wit attract more universal atten
tion or which will be more universally con
demned by a corrupt and slaverybound press
than the able address emanating from the
fugitive slaves in attendance and addressed
to tbeir enslaved brothers and sisters at the
south that addiesa will cause a howl to
go up from all the bloodhounds of our land
it will be denounced as immoisl cruel and
monstrous and yet what does the address
inculcate that would not be done with all
freedom by any enslaved white man and
which would not be looked upon as creditable
os his part to do by every white man in this
country nothing absolutely nothin the
escaping slave h told to escape from his bond
age and take possession of sny and every
thing belonging to bis master which he may
need for his journey this we deem to be
highly proper and just what any american
citizen would be fully justified m doing wore
be reduced to slavery under sny form of gov
ernment the slaveholders of this country
have no lights they have forfeited their
rights by trampling upon the rights of oth
ers rubbers ami murderets have no right
to that which they plunder and possessing
nothing which they have not sides all that
they have rightfully belongs to the whole
number of slaves
the address however speaks for itself
let that portion of the press which condemns
it publish it if they dare thsy will find
that its senuroenu will have a lodgment in
the hearts of their reader and that ail the
sophistry whjnlpaorg may abed from their
perverted be unable to break
through the if tanked logic of that address

the last ifleitti of the convention and wa
very ably dsmed by gerrlt smith mr

you will easily picture what a good time
to use a yankeeism we are having am
with what animation conversation issustained
yesterday an antislavery convenlior
was held at peterboro the mornings meet
ing was convened in the baptist church i
was numerously attended after the prelim
inary exercise of prayer praise and reading
the scriptures f douglass addressed the
assembly for an hour and a half in his own
peculiarly earnest eloquent and felicitoui
manner the afternoons gathering tool
place in a fine grove adjacent to ac oli
home of gerrit smith in peterboro thi
timethe placethe circumstances combiner
to render the occasion one of deep interest
the speaker was himself powerfully im
pressed and his words came home witf
double power to the hearts of his hearers
verily l was good to be there
before this reaches you you will have seer
the full account of the proceedings of the
cazenovia convention ao there is the lest
occasion for my adding much to the slight anc
imperfect sketch  lately sent you
i will however just aav that the meeting
held there on the second day were convenec
in a beautiful orchard and were numerous
attended the speaking was for the mosi
part good considerable reference was madr
to the case of mr chaplin a committee
was formed whose duty it should be to take
measures for using every available instru
mentality to promote his liberation thh
committee haa decided to test the feeling
of the northern states by going out and
striving to raise twenty thousand dollars fot
defending mr chaplin some among them
hopesome fear but all are stimulated tt
active exertion
iu my former letter i made reference to tht
edmonson giila they are warmly attached
to mr chaplin and coute qui coule one ol
them was resolved to say a few words at the
convention on the subject of his arrest and
imprisonment your eyes and heart deal
mrs howilt would have overflowed could
you have heard and seen that young and noble
hearted girl appeal in words of simple tnd
touching eloquence m behalf of her dear
friend now lying in prison for performing ao
act of humanity to bis brother man
the excitement however did not reach its
height until f douglass arose and appeal
ing as it were over the heads of thefdnton
son girls he called upon the men and
women ol cazenovia to awake arise
and do their duty to thems ivesto their
brother man sad to their g d it was s
moment of thrilling interest and will long be
remembered by many who witnessed the
scene
 must say adieu we are oo the eve of
leaving peterboro for syracuse tomorrow
there is to be a  chaplia meeting there
 treat that the liberal portion of our british
press will do as they are wont to docome
out boldly and fearlessly ie defence of the
right end consequently in defence of mr
chaplin y
nothing ean evidence to tlie world more
clearly the hollow hypocrisy and mockery of
this false republic than the mearoermtioo oi
he noble man abort mentioned
dwylon sayre and hams aie still kept
in jail on ike chaige of aiding slaves to es
cape they ate retained by the very men
who rail against the tynmoy of austria and
who stretch out their arms to receive the
hungarian fugitives therefrom yeti believe
it would be quite as easy to escape from the

to the friends of freedom doubtless
yourhearts are as is my heart stricken
with great sorrow at the arrest and imprison
ment of william l chaplin the truehearted
friend of the enslaved the ripe scholar the
christian gentleman the noble highly accom
plished man that he should this day be in
a southern prison is quite as much our fault
as bis for bad our duty been done had none
of us even wavered or faltered had our vir
tue been proof against all temptation and
our faith in god been unshaken and out work
correspondent to faith nu slave would
this day have worth his cfcjas not chaplin
drayton and sayres been lying in jail at wash
ington city the rtition would have been
wellnigh free from this cuise of curses by
this time o the fault is at our door and not
at hia what has he done that he should lie
in jail has he stolen the property of anoth
er has he assaulted the person of any oi
the citizens of the district does his life
mark him as a man who lives by rapine and
bloodshed no  what then is the matter 
he has lived out the principles of the declar
ation of independence he has honored jesu
christ by honoring his poor oppressed brother
he has violated ihe law of slavery which u
glorifying the law of freedom he has done
what cotoards call a rash thing what prudent
men call a foolish thing what proslavery
men and slaveholders call a wicked thing
but what god and honest men approve aoj
love and cherish him all the more for hav
ing done let no man who wishes bis chib
dren never to wear chains who desires thi
government to be saved from destruction and
general execration who loves law and ordei
instead of anarchy and weltering chaos uuei
a word of reproach against w l chaplin
what in gods name should he have done
turn traitor make of himself an apostate
let hia own soul die within him for want ol
the sustaining power which deeds of mercy
always give never if he comes foitli
from that prison only to be buried let none
of his friends or the friends of the slave think
such thoughts is it needful to tell you that
a roan who lives at washington necessarily
aids slaves to escape if he remains true to him
self dues he develope in his daily life the
truths of the gospel and of liberty wbat
does be but quicken m the slave a desire foi
freedom does he make manifest bis regard
for liberty and his detestation of slavery in
his conversation with whites what does this
all amount to but to impress on them the
image of himself which is reflected on the
slave what is the true man to do with the
spiritual influences which emanate from him
and which bolt and bar cannot confine
these settle on the slaves biow like a halo
of inspiration and silently stimulate him to
efforts for his freedom let the preacher of
cautiousness go to washington and do belter
than has mr chaplin if be can it is so easy
for the heartless to and fault faullffatftftg
from time immemorial has been a capital
easily acquired and a like easily invested one
thing is true if to give innocent men their
freedom which is unjustly withheld from them
is a ctime then w l chaplin is criminal
in his late attempt if not he is not criminal
the law of slavery makes it an offence but
can slavery make a law which all should not
disobey slavery is violence slavery is lust
made practical slavery is theft slavery is
murder slaveiy is lying of the most atrocious
character slavery is defiance of all law such
as heaven provides for the government of
men there is nothing mean nothing
lothsome nothing detestable that is not legii
timate to slavery it whips women murders
men kills children it breeds ignorance
begets idle men creates poverty establishes
caste it makes distinctions where i rod has
forbiddon them destroys distinctions where
nature has set them up it rears its super
structure inversely to all the fundamental
principles on which divine wisdom builds
and is not nor can it be other than the most
stupendous fraud the sum of all villanies
would you have a man deliberately seat
himself and see this python wrap hia enor

he struck his horse and turned his head t
the wheel and was struck with bludgeon
and knocked off from his seat the blov
made the wound on his head and he is nov
recovering from his injuries the first notin
of the assault upon him was the blocking o
the wheels and an unearthly noise near him
which he supposed was done by highway
men he did not suppose he was arrestei
for aiding slave until he heard the voice o
mr goddard tne policeman which he knew
he said the blow on his head must hav
killed him but for his hat on his recover
from it he found himself on his back upon
the giound with two or three ruffians upoi
him some with their knees upon his breast
and some upon his side brandisbiog bowii
knives and hatchets and swearing they wool
lake his life hearing the voice of goddard
he asked him to save his life which he did
he had no doubt he would have been mur
dered by them had not mr goddaid inter
posed to save him
mr chaplin was suipriaedat seeing mr
hathaway but he presented himself to him
the same serene dignified cheerful loving
btave and gentlemanly man that he ever was
in his intercourse with the world
mr hathaway called on gov sewan
upon his arrival but gov seward had re
turned to new york he then called or
hon s p chase of ohio mr chase gav

the hall in which they were lays in front o
the cells in which the prisoners sre confined

julian hale durkee it c and every mani
festation was evinced to make his stay ageee
able and his object prosperous

an exciting slave case on thursday
afternoon the monongahela house was
thrown into a most terrible confusion by mr
john drennan of van fiuren arkansas who
announced the startling fact that a female
slave about fourteen years of age had dis
appeared while he and bis lady were at din
ner as was very natural in such a case he
became vexed and angry and had some sharp
words with the proptietor it is scarcely ne
cessary to add that he neither gained not lost
by this as mr crosaraan does not suffer
himself to be guided by any other feeling
than his sense of duty a servant who wa
strongly suspected of being in the affitir was
promptly discharged
the girl is fairer than a mulatto and is
said to have indian blood in her veins the
time chosen for her escape was ss stated
above the dinner hour she sent her friends
whoevrr they were np stairs for her bsggsge
but a trunk inlonging to the master was ta
ken by mistake mr drennan went to of
ficer hague and offered him a reward for the
recovery of the fugitive and the trunk mr
hague said he thought he could get the
trunk but he feared the girl was beyond his
reach he was right in both points of his
answer he did recover his trunk but the

a letter to the american slaves front
those who have fled from american
slavery
afflicted and beloved brothcrsthe
meeting which sends you this letter is a
meeting of runaway slaves we thought it
well that they who had once suffered as
you still suffer lhat they who had once
drank of that bitterest of all hitter cops
which you are at ii compelled to drink of
should come together for the purpose of
making a communication to you
the chief object of this meeting is to tell
you what circumstances we find ourselves in
that so you may be able to judge for your
selves whether the prize we have obtained is
worth the peril of the attempt to obtain it
the heartless pirates who compelled us to
call ihem master sought to pereuadfe us
as such pirates seek to persuade yoo that the
condition of those who escape from their
clutches is thereby made worse instead ot
better we confess that we had our fears
that this might be so indeed so great was
our jgnorance that we could not be sore that
the abolitionists were not the friends which
our masters represented them to be when
they told us that the abolitionists could they
lay hands upon us would buy and sell us
we could not certainly know that they spoke
falsely and when they told ua that abolition
ists are in the habit ot skinning the black
man for leather and of regalling their can
nibalism on bis flesh even such enormities
seemed to os to be possible but owing to
the happy change in our circumstances we
are not as ignorant and ctedulous now as we
once were and if we did not know it before
we know it now that slaveholders are aa
great liars aa they are great tyrants
the abolitionists act the part of friends
and brothers to ns and our only complaint
against them is that there rae so few of them
the abolitionists on whom it is safe to rely
are almost all of them members of the
american antislavery society or of the
liberty party there are other abolitionists
but most of them are grossly inconsistent
and hence not entirely trustworthy abolition
ists so inconsistent are they as ttf vote for
antiabolitionista for civil rulers and to ac
knowledge the obligation of laws which
they themselves interpret to be proslavery
we get wages for our labor we have
schools for our children we hsveopponuni
ties to hear and to learn to read the bible
that blessed book which all fot freedom
notwithstandieg the lying slaveholders says
it all for slavery some of ua take pert in
the election of civil rulers ludeed bet for
the priests sod politicians ibe influence ot
most of whom is against ns our condition
would be every way eligible the priests
and churches of the north are with com
paratively few exceptions in league with the
priests and churches of the south end this
of itself ia sufficient to account for the fact
that a castereligion and a negropew are
found at the north as well aa at the south
the politicians and political parties of the
north are connected with the politicians and
political partiea ot the south and hence
the political arrangements and interests of the
north as well as its ecclesiastical arrange
ments and interests are adverse to the color
ed population but we rejoice to know tbs
all this political and accluf jitmfep fi  ou
ike wan tka irfr american
democracy has be
fome glaring and every year multitudes
roce eluded b them come to repudiate
them the credit of this repudiation is dee
in a great measure to the american anti
ilayery society to the liberty party and to
antisectarian meetings and conventions the purest sect on earth is the rival of instead of 
one with christianity it daaervjm not to b
trussed with a deep and honest and earnest re
form the temptations which beset th
pathway of each a reform are too might 
for it to resist instead of going forward foi
god it will slant off fiir itself heaven grant
that soon not a shred of sectarianism nor 
shred of the current religion nor a ahied o
the current politics of this land may remain
then will follow ay that will itself be the
triumph of ebriatiaaity and then white men
will love black men and gladly acknowledge
that all men have equal righta come blessed
daycome quickly
including our children we number in
canada at least twenty thousand the total
of our population in the free states far ex
ceeds this nevertheless srs we are poor
we can do little more to promote your de
liverance than pray for it to the god of the
oppressed we will do whit we can to sup
ply you with pocket compasses in dark
nights when his good guiding star i hidden
from the flying slave a pocket compass great
ly facilitates his exodus besides that we
we are too poor to furnish you with deadly
weaons candor inquires the admission that
some of us would not furnish them if we
could for some of us have become nonresist
ants and have discarded the use of these
weapons and would say to you love your
enemies do good to them which hate you
bless them that curse you aod pray for them
which despitefully use you such of us
would be glad to be able to say that all the
colored men of the north are nonresistants
but in point of fact it is only a handful of
them who are when the insurrection of
the southern slaves shall take place as take
place it will unless speedily prevented by
voluntary emancipation the great mass of
the colored men of the north however much
to the grief of any of us will be found by
your side with deepstored and longaccumu
ated revenge in their hearts and with death
dealing weapons in their hands it is not to
be disguised that a colored man is as much
disposed as a white man to lesist even unto
death those who oppress him the colored
american for the sake of relieving his color
ed brethren would ao mote hesitate to shoot
an american slaveholder than would a white
american for the sake of delivering his
white brother hesitate to shoot an algerine
slaveholder the state motto of virginia
dealh to tyrants is as well the black
mans as the white mans motto we tell
you these things not to encourage or justify
your resoit to physical force but simply
that you may know be it to yout joy or
sorrow to know it what yournoithren color
ed brethren axe in these important respects
this truth you are entitled to know however
the knowledge of it may affect you and how
ever you may act in view of it
we have said that some of us are nonre
sistants but while such would dissuade
you from all violoace toward the slave
holder let it not be supposed that they re
gard it as guiltier ban those strifes which
even good men are wont to justify if the
american revolutionists had excuse for shed
ding but one dropnof blood tneu have the
american slaves excuse for making blood to
flow even unto the horsebridles
numerous as are the escapes from slavery
they would be far more so were you not em
barrassed by your misinterpretations of the
rights of property you hesitate to take even
the dullest of your masters horseswhereas
it is your duty to take the fleetest your
consciences suggest doubis whether in quit
ting your bondage you are at liberty to put
in your packs what you need of ford and
clothing but were you better informed you
would not scruple to break your masters
locks and take all their money you are
taught to respect the rights of property but
no such rights belong to the slaveholder
his right to property is but the robberright
in every slaveholding community the rights
of properly all center in them whose coerced
and unrequited toil has created the wealth
in which their oppressors riot moreover if
your oppressors have rights of properly you
at least are exempt from all obligation to re
spect them for you are prisoners of war
in an enemys countryof a war too that is
unrivalled for its injustice cruelly meanness
and therefore by all the rules of war you
have the fullest liberty to plunder burn and
kill as you may have occasion to do to pro
mo e yuui escape
we iegret to be obliged to say to you that
it is not every one of the free states which
offers you ao asylum even within the
last year fugitive slaves have been arrested in
some of the free states and replunged into
slavery but make your way to new york
or new england and you will be safe it is
true thatenven in new york and new
england there are individuals who would
rejoice to see the poor flying slave cast back
into the horrors of slavery but even these
ate restrained by public sentiment ii is
questionable whether even daniel webster
or moses stuart would give chase to a fugi
tive slave and if they would not who would
for the one is chiefpolitician and the oilier j
chiefpriest
we do not forget the industrious efforts 
which are now making to get new facilities atj
the hands of cougress for reenalaving those
who have escaped from slavery but we can
assure you that as to the state of new i
york and the new england states such
efforts must prove fruitless against all such j
develismagainst ail kidnappersthe color
ed people of these states wili stand for their
life and what is more the white people of
these ststes will not stand against them a
regenerated public sentiment has forever re
moved these states beyond the limits of the
slaveholders hunting ground defeatdis
graceand it may be deathwill be their
only reward for pursuing their prey into this
abohuonizcd portion of out country
a special reason why you should not stop
in that part of the nation which comes within
the bounds ot john mcleans judicial district
is that he is s great man in one of the religi
ous sects and an aspirant for the presidency
fugitive slaves and their friend fare hard in
the hands of this judge he not only puts a
proslavery construction on the federal con
stitution and holds that law can make pro
perty of mana marketable commodity of
the image of god but in various other ways
be shows that his sympathies are with the
oppressor shun judge mclean then even
as you would the reverend muses stuart
the law of the one is as deadly an enemy to
you as is the religion of the other
there are thtee points in your conduct
when you shall have become inhabitants of
the north on which we cannot refrain from
admonishing you
ist if you wil join a seciaiian church let
it not be one which approves of the nfgro
pe w and which refuses to treat alaveholdtng
as a crime against god and man h
were beter that you sacrifice your lives than
that by going into the negro pew you invade
your selfrespectdebsse your soulsplay
the traitor to your raceand crucify afresh
him who died for the one brotherhood of
man
 d join no political party which refuses
to commit itself fully openly and heartfully
in ita newspapers meetings and nommauous
to the doclriue that slavery is the grossest of
all absurdities as well as the guiltiest cf all
abominations and that there can no more be
a law for the enslavement of man made in the
image of god ban for the enslavement of
god himself vote for no man for civil office
who makes your complexion a bar to political
cclawmaiaau  social equality better die
than insult osu every person

tier influence against slavery than could all
theii learning however great if purchaser
by concessions of their manhood and sur
renders of their rights and coupled as it thet
would be by chaiacteistic meanness and ser
vility
and now brethren we close this lettei
with assuring you that we do not cannot
forget you you are ever in our minds om
hearts our prayers perhaps your ar feat
ing that the free colored prople of the uoitec
siste will suffer themselves to be carried
away from vou by the american colonisation
society fear it not in vain is it thai
this greatest and most malignant enemy of the
african race ia now busy in devising new
plans and in seeking the aid of government
to peipetuate your enslavement it wants u
away from your side that you may be kept in
ignorance but we will remain by your side
to enlighten you it wants us away from
your side that you may be contented but
we will remain by your aide to keep yon
and make you more discontented it wants
us way flout your side to the end that your
unsuccored end conscious helplessness may
make you the easier and suter prey of your
oppressors but we will remain by your side
to sympathize with you and cheer you and
give you the help of our rapidly swelling
members the land of our enslaved brethren
is our land and death alone shal pan us
we cannot forget you brethren for we
know your sufferings and we know your suf
ferings because we know from experience
what it is to be an american slave so gall
ing was our bondage that to esc pe from it
we suffered the loss of all things and braved
every peril and endured every hardship
some of us left parents some wives some
children some of us were wounded with
guns and dogs as we fled some of us to
make good our escape suffered ourselves to
he nailed up in boxes and to pass for mer
chandize some of us secreted ouselves in
the suffocating holds of ships nothing was
so dreadful to us as slavery and hence it is
almost literally true that we dreaded noth
ing which could befal ur in our attempt to
get clear of it oui condition could be made
no woise for we were already in the lowest
depths of earthly woe even should we be
overtaken and resubjected to slavery this
would be but to return to our old sufferings
and sorrows and should death itself prove to
be the price of our endeavor after freedom
what would that be but a welcome release to
men who had all their lifetime been killed
every day and killed all the day long
we have referred to our perils and hard
ships in escaping from slavery we are
happy to be able to say that every year is
multiplying the facilities for leaving the
southern prison house the liberty party
the vigilance committee of new york in
dividuals and companies of individuals in
various parts of the country are doing all
they can and it is much to afford you a safe
ind a cheap passage from slavery to liberty
they do this however not only at great ex
pense of propeity but at great peril of liberty
and life thousands of you have heard ere
this that within the last fortnight the pre
cious name of william l chaplin has been
added to the list of those who in helping
you gain your liberty have lost their own
here is a man whose wisdom cultivation
moral worth bring him into the highest and
best class of menand yet he becomes a
willing maityr for the poor despised forgot
ten slaves sake your remembrance of one
such fact is enough  shed light and hope
upon your darkest and most disponding mo
ments
brethren our last word to you is to bid
you be of good cheer and not to despair of
your deliverance do not abandon your
selves as have many thousands of american
slaves to the crime of suicide live live to
escape from slavery live to serve god live
till he shall himself call you into eternity
be prayerfulbe bravebe hopeful lift
up your heads for your redemption diaweth

lo the liberty party the fugitive
slaves whu are this day assembled in caz
smovia n y come to youwith a very ear
nest petition
the national convention which you are
 hold in the city af oswego the second day
of next october is to nominate a candidate
for piesident ol the united slates your
petitioners are aware that f julius le
moyne william gooodeli and gerrit smith
are each spoken of as such candidate
as to mr smith we know that he al
ways refuses nominations to office and that
he now goes so far as to refuse to admit
that he would accept of the office however
elevated or important to which he might he
elected as to mr le moyne and mr good
ell we cannot deny their competency to fill
the highest offices in the gift of the people
they are wise and truehearted men an honor
to their age their nation their race but
notwithstanding all this richly deserved praise
of these men we are bold to say that there
is another man in this nation who is not their
inferior in the qualifications for president of
ihe united statesnay where in the whole
length and breadth of this nation can a man
be found mote competent than william l
chaplin to administer itc government he
is emphatically a scholar a statesman a
philanthropist a gentleman and a christian
job who was the supreme magistrate in the
community in which he dwelt numbers
among his own qualifications for office 
was a father to the poorbeautiful
precious indispensable qualification ia this
and who has it more abundantly than william
l chaplin
but we confess it is not because of mr
chaplins ability to fill arid admn the office
of president of the united slates that we
ask you to nominate him to the office it is
because he is a prisonerand a prisoner for
such a cause it is true that we would
not for this reason ask for his nomination
wese it not also that he is fit foi it but
being fit fot it we find in the fact of his im
prisonment good cause why he auong all
who have such fitness should be singled out
for the nomination
in our esteem however it may be in the
esteem of others who hsve not like our
selves had personal experience of the woee
of slavery the greatest of mil the questions ol
human rights which agitate this age is sla
very now to the just and merciful solu
lion of this question mr chaplia has devotee
himself with an ability a zeal and a self
denial which none of bis fellow laborers an
fellow sufferers hsve surpassed and whilst
in return for all this heaven will reward ant
dues now reward him with its love met
have deprived lum of his personal liberty o
all the men in this land who are fit for presi
dent he is the only oue who lor devotion
sake to the cause of the slave is suffertnj
this severe deprivation and is not his im
prison ment taking all the circumstances iit
account a very clear and certain providentia
indication that he is the naan for your caodi
date and would not your nominal ton u
him besides being a merited tribute lo hi
excellent worth and a soothing and beautifu
expression of your sympathy with his suffer
mgs and of your affliotion in hit afflictions
and besides being in your thus openly an
without shame idertilying yourselves wit

constitution of the united states hitherto
the great mass of professing christians in thi
land have voted for slaveholderseven foi
this meanest and cruellest class of piratesant
h ive yet been called christians but wil
they be called christiansnay will they
much as make themselves believe that the
are christians if when the question before
them is whether on the one hand to vote foi
the follower of christ who for christs sake
and tho sake ol his poor lies in prison or
on the other to vote for ihe heartless candi
date who will keep that follower of christ in
prison they shall decide to vote for that heart

er or against the prisoner and re
member too that in the dying of this great
questionihe question of slavery of humanity
of religion will be triedand tried too more
effectually tlan they have ever yet been tried
in this guilty land
our petition and our reasons for it are now
before you in disposing of them may you
have the divine guidance
resolutions
ist resolved that slavery is the curse of
burses the robbery of robberies and the
crime of crimes
j resolved that inasmuch as it is the
duty of evety man to serve god with all his
powers it follows that no man has the right
to curtail his powers by going into slavery
but that every man who is in that condition is
bound to get out of it if he can and fur her
more that on the principle o the brother
hood and identity  rnci he is no more
bound to get out of it it he can than others
are to help him out of it if they can
d resolved that our hearts are in the
cell of willian l chaplin and that whilst
his enemies deride his condition and his false
friends aie ashamed of his chains he will
ever be in our eyes and that too whether he
die in the dungeon or on the scatfold a scho
lar a sta teamana philanthropist a gentleman
and a christian
th resolved that in that day when the
slaveholder shall find in each slave he has re
tained in slavery a millstone around the
neck of his sou charles t torrey and
william l chaplin will find in each slave
whom they may have delivered a welcome
remembrancer of their laith in god and jove
to man
sin resolved that odious in the sight of
the american people as is the slave steal
ing which is charged upon william l
chaplin that is neveitheless a sham repub
licanism and a sham christianity which does
not indorse it
th whereas whatever may be said of
slavery in the states it is admitted by all the
intelligent and candid that the federal con
stitution can authorize can suffer no slavery
in the district of cob inbia and that the ha
very which exists there exists simply out of
comity  the slaveliolding portion of the
country
resolved therefore that william l chap
lin and they who occupied the carriage with
him the evening of the bth instant were a
company of innocent freemen and that they
who stopped it were guiliy of the insolence
and violence of highwaymen and should be
and if this were a land of law and justice
uwuldbe promptly punished as highwaymen
th resolved that there is not in the
congress of the united states one liberty
loving and lawloving raaif who can consent
that its present session shall cloae until
drayton sayre harris and chaplin have
been released from prison and slavery ex
pelled from the district of columbia
bth resolved that slavery in the dis
trict of columbia is a fearful precedent which
caunot be too speedily overthrownfor if
congress can make slaves of some persons
there it can make slaves of all persons there
and the like power can it exercise whatever
in any slate there are national foils mag
azines arsenals dockyards and other need
ful buildings and upon whatever persons
may visit them or enter a post office or a
custom house or a federal court house
th resolved that whethet there is or
is not constitutional slavery in the states
the federal government should see lo it that
all the slaves and the posterity of all the fe
male slaves who have ever been though but
for a moment and though with or without
the consent of their masters within the lim
its of the district of columbia be immedi
ately restored to libertyfor it is too plain
to require argument that whoever whethet
slaves or freemen be the fugitives from ser
vice and labor referrflstd in the constitution
they ate fugitives from one state into another
state
th resolved that much as the fret
soil party has said of its purpose to divorct
the federal government from the support o
slavery it is now and has long beea abun
dantly demonstrated that this purpose cannot
be accomplished without either disbanding
that government or wielding it for the over
throw of slavery in every part of the na
tion
th resolved that he dishonors boil
republicanism and christianity who ac
knowledges any law of slavery or who ac
knowledges that such an abomination at
slavery is capable of legalizaton
th resolved that slaveholders ate tb
cruellest and meanest of ail piraies and that
instead of being fit to be civil rulers no gov
eminent is just which does not make then
ibe subjects of its severest punishment
th resolved that in the arrest and im
prison men t of william l chaplin for no ol
fence but ihat of loving his neighbor ss him
self and of practically maintaining the eon
fesaedly selfevident and inalienable right o
man to life liberty and the pursuit of hap
pincss we aee not only that the fedra
idiatrict which was placed by the conatitu
control of con
power but we sea v
ruhthat the struggle in this
s avery and freedom involve lhe
fee hte entea as well as of ue color
d slavethat it is in short a jf e and deal
which must icsult in liberty to a ij
t in the liability of slavery to all
goic
down into a free soil party or any th
r ahatn abolition party or of identifying them
selves whk any scheme whatever of anti
slavery mide easv abolitionists are sum
mooed by me thickening of the antislavery
battle and the multiply ihng trials of their ao
lislavery integrityby the voice of torrey
t from his grave and of chaplin from his
prison to put forth more and more emphatic
and selfdenying evidences of tbesinceiitv
and depth of their sense of the immeasurable
and horrid wickedness of slavery
th resolved that among the eviden
ces of our devotion to the cause of tbe slave
should be
ist no connection with and no worship
ping with a church which has i oegiopew
or which it associated directly or indirectly
closely or remotely with chuiches north or
south that have it
d no voting fm any man for any civil office
who makes complexion a bar to eithei m il
or political equality or w ho will admit mat
there is the least obligation to obey or honor
any form or pretence oflaw nr any judicial
decision which ta on the side of slavery
d no consuming unless in cases of abso
lute necessity any of the produce of slave
labor any of the cotton rice sugar which
are wet with the tears and sweat and red
with the blood and heavy with tho groans of
the poor weary and desolaie victims of the
slavepower
 h resolved that in the names of god
and humanity religion and the constitution
we demand the liberation not only of dray
ton and sayre and harris and chaplin but of
the slaves of the district of columbia and
that in these names do we also demand
that the american people shall regard the re
fusal to liberate these victims of the slave
power asjust cause for revolution
tb resolved that we call on every
man in the free states who shall go to the
polls at the approaching electionsto go with
this motto burning in his heart and bursting
from hia lips chaplins release or civil

lord brougham coming to
america
the roost eccentric member of the
most eccentric peerage extant is about
i coming among us to examine this de
mocracy a little more closely than he
has yet had an opportunity of doing
brougham is an old fellownear sev
enty but he is in astonishing preser
vation and seems determined to live
another score of years at least not
that
he husbands out lifes taper to ihe close
and saves the flame from wasting by repose
for he is one of the most restless and
vivacious men in the world the ener
gy of his younger years still accom
panies him in the domains of litera
ture and science be has been a sort
of admirable crichton he has
tried his pen at everything his ene
mies used to say of the exchancellor
that if he only knew a little law he
would have a smattering of all the
knowledge that was ever known but
harry broom knows the law too and
can talk as well upon it as upon the
differential calculus or the palarity o
light in his youth he helped to found
with sydney smith and francis jeffrey
the edinburgh review this was
when he and they cultivated litera
ture on a little oatmeal brougham
wbs the writer of that famous critique
upon young lord byrons hours ol
idlenessthough the public and we
believe the poet himself attributed it
to jeffrey the prases byron how
ever ranked brougham among his foes
as will be seen in the english bards
and scotch reviewers and may te
gathered from the line in don juan
a legal brooms a moral cbimueyaweeper
one of the most notable of brough
ams stepping stones to renown was
his eloquent and angry defence ol
queen caroline when brought to trial
before the house of lords mr brough
am behaved on that momentous oc
casion with the greatest interepidity
not sparing in his advocacy the char
acter of the king himself under the
reform administration of lord mel
bourne henry brougham was made
lord high chancellor of england
the keeper of the conscience of wil
liam the fourth during the time he
held the seals of that high office the
peculiarities of his lordship instead of
being represented by the grave duties
and circumstances of his situation were
exhibited as remarkably as ever he
astonished the officials and lawyers of
the court of chancery by the energy
and rapidity of most of his decisions
people who were accustomed to the
doubts delays and general prolixity of
lord eldonthe preceding chancel
lor were astonished at the innovating
spirit of brougham he was at that
time in his element and went through
his various duties with an intellectual
agility perfectly unparalleled he was
president of the society for the diffu
sion of useful knowledge and was
ceaseless in his labors to support it
aaer having passed hours in literary
correspondence concerning the works
it was publishing or making alteration
or suggestions in them he would gc
down to the house of lords where he
would electrify that grave senate with
some eloquent exposition of politics
f principle or some withering tirade
aunched against some rash opposition
ist who had ventured a fling at the
wool sack leaving the house some
times at three or four oclock in the
morning he would be found in his seal
nt court by nine oclock looking a
fresh as a daisy and go to work at his
adjudications and decisions as if he had
just then only begun to exercise his
faculties in that particular line of busi
ness in everything he treated his
lofty station as if it was entirely sub
servient to the wilful personality ol
henry brougham for this he was
caricatured at a great rate and filled
the prints and paragraphs of the nation
with pleasantry he is still the object
of incessant sarcasm and satire he is
part of punchs stock in trade that
venerable joker could better spare his
indispensable judy his writers make
it their pastime to gird at the some
time lord of the woolsack on every
occasion like falstaff his is not
only wity himself but the cause of wit
in others
a thousand scapes of wit
make him the father of their idle dream
and rack him in their fancies
his nose is known to all the world
it is as famous as the nose of slaw
kenbergins recorded in the veritable
history of tristram shandy a million
of conceits have hung by that nose as
from a peg reports have been spread
in england that weary of the british
aristocracy like lord edward fitz
gerald he intends to renounced his
title and claim a naturalization here
as a citizen of the republic it will be
remembered that in the heyday of the
french revolution of  he wrote
to the provincial government for let
ters of french citizenship lamartine
was then at the head of affairs and
refused the request apprehensive it
is said that if brougham came into the
revolution at all ho would work the
poet out of his prominent position and
occupy it himsfelf but we are not
quite sure that brougham really intends
to throw off the bindings of the peerage
and become as one of us there is a
matter of  dollars a year life
pension of an exchancellor which
he should sacrifice as a preliminary
and this we think is a grave obstacle
in the way of such a consummation
in apite of his eccentricities
brougham is a man of splendid and
general genius and will be recognized
and remembered as aich by posterity
when these are forgotten we have
no doubt he will will receive from the
american people a favorable reception
such at they are never backward in
giving to men of genuine intellectual
power yankee blade
quick wit a gentleman travel
ling on horseback down east came
upon an irishman who was was fencing
in a most barren and desolate piece ol
land
what are you fencing in that lot
for pat said he a nerd of cows
would starve to death on that lend
an sure yer honor sir wasnt i
fencing it to kape the peer bastes out
of it
all enemy ilf chasea provi
dential succour
many an uneasy look was thrown
orer our shoulders as we struggled
down that slope our strength was
urged to its utmost and this was not
much for we bad all lost blood in the
encounter with the sleuthhounds and
lelt week and faint we were baffled
too by a storm a fierce tropical
storm the rain thick and heavy
plashed in our faces and made the
ground slippery under our feet the
lightning flashed in our eyes and the
electric sulpher shortened our breath
ing still we coughed and panted
and staggered onward nerved by the
knowledge that death was behind us
i shall never forget that fearful race
i thought it would never end i can
only liken it to one of those dreams in
which we are always making endea
vours to escape from some horrible
monster and are as often hindered b
a strange and mysterious helplesness
i remember it now as then i have of
ten repeated that flight in my sleep
and always awoke with a feeling ol
shuddering horror we had got with
in five hundred yards of the timber
fivo hundred yards is not much to a
fresh runner but to us toiling along
at a trot that much more resembled a
walk it seemed an infinity a small
prairie w th a stream beyond separa
ted us from the edge of the woods a
smooth sward without a single tree
we had entered upon it raoul who
was light on foot being in the advance
while lincoln from choice hung in
the rear an exclamation from the
hunter caused us to look back we
were too much fatigued and wornout
to be frightened at the sight along
the crest of the hill a hundred hors
men were dashing after us in full gal
lop and the next moment their venge
ful screams were ringing in our ears
now do yer best boys cried lin
coln an ill stop the cavortin of that
ere foremost feller afore he gits much
furrer we trailed our bodies ou
but we could hear the guerilleros fast
closing upon us the bullets from
their escopettes whistled in our ears
and cut the grass among our feet i
saw raoul who had reached the tim
ber turn suddenly round and valk
back he had resolved to share our
fate save yourself raoul i call
ed with my weak voice but he could
not have heard me above the din i
saw him still walking towards us i
heard the screams behind i heard
the shots and the whizzing of bullets
and the fierce shouts i heard the
clatter of hoofs and the rasping of
sabres as they leaped out of tho iron
sheaths and among these i heard the
crack of lincolns rifle and the wild yell
of the hunter then a peal of thunder
drowned all other sounds the heavens
one moment seemed on fire then black
black i felt the stifling smell of sul
phur a hot flash a quick stroke from
j some invisible hand and  sank sense
i less to the earth something cool in
jmy throat and over my face brought
back the conciousness that i lived it
was water i opened my eyes but it
was some moments before i could see
that raoul was bending over nrc and
laving my temples with water from his
boot i muttered some halfcoherent
inquiries it was a coup declair cap
tain said raoul good heavens
we bad been struct by lightening
raoul being in the advance had es
caped the frenchman left me and
went to clayley who with chunc and
he hunter lay close by all three
as i thought dead they were pale as
corpses with here and there a spot of
purple or a livid line traced over their
skins white their lips presented the
whitish bloodless hue of death are
hey dead i asked feebly i
think not we shall see and tho
frenchman poured some water in clay
leys mouth the latter tighed heavily
and appeared to revive raoul passed
on to the hunter who as soon as he
felt the water started to his feet and
clutching his comrade fiercely by the
throat exclaimed yer cussed cata
mount yer wud hang me wud ye
seeing who it w as he stopped sudden
ly and looked round with an air of ex
treain bewilderment his eye now fell
upon the rifle and all at once veetn
ing to recollect himself he staggered
towards it and picked it upthen as
if by instinct hi passed his hand into
his pouch and coolly commenced load
ing while raoul was busy with
clay ley and the irishman i had risen
tp my feet and looked hack over the
prairie the ran was falling in tor
rents and the lightning still flashed at
intervals at the distance of fifty
paces a black mass was lying upon the
ground motionless a mass of men and
horses mingled together as they had
fallen in their track here and there
a single horse and his rider lay pos
trate together beyond these twenty
or thirty horsemen were gallopping in
circles over the plain and vainly en
deavouring to head their frightened
steeds towards the point we were
these like raoul had escaped the
stroke come cried the french
man who had now resuscitated clay
ley and chane we have not a mo
ment to lose the mustangs will get
over their fright and these fellows will
be down upon us his advice was
instantly followed and before the guer
illeros could manage their scared
horses we had entered the thicket and
were crawling along under the wet
leaves the rifle ranger s
jcj a china man in san francis
co by the name of assing keeper
of a restaurant left open a cesspool on
his premises into which one of the
citizens chanced to fall and the result
was an action for damages to the
note addressed by the sufferers law
yer to john chinaman the following
reply in good chinese was returned
immediately by the laws of the
celestial empire which have been in
force since the reign of confucius to
the reign of the present illustrious
taukwang it is provided that where a
man trespasses upon anothers property
and thereby faileth into a sink he shall
get nothing but dirty clothes unless he
shall happen to be an outside barbari

the duke of wellihgtonr
the london papers contain the fol
lowing ludicrous account of a game of
crosspurposes played by the great
duke of wellington the great bishop
of london and the not quite so groat
but somewhat greatsh mrs london
the authoress
a remarkable story has besn in
circulation in private circles for some
days past which we think is too good
to be lst to the general public par
ticularly as it numbers among its dra
matis persotye no less personages than
field marshal his grace the comman
derinchicf the metropolitan bishop
and an accomplished authoress it is
only necessary to mention the name of
mrs london to recall to tho readers
memory the clever writings of that
lady on horticulture she was lately
in the neighborhood of strathfieldsaye
and beinganxtous to visit spots remark
able for fine specimens of the vegeta
ble world she wrote to the duke con
veying her desire to see some beech
es for which the gardens of bis grace
were celebrated tho letter was duly
delivered and the duke raising his
glasses and glancing at the contents
his eye caught hastily the signature of
the note c j london and he at
once came to tho conclusion that it
i came from charles james bishop of
of london more particularly as the
i hand writing bore a close resemblance
to that of the right rev prelate but
whilst there was nothing remarkable in
the fact of a note from the bishop the
object of it did raise his graces most
especial wonder for that same rapid
glance which had converted an amiable
i lady into a bishop metamorphosed the
majectic beeches of strathfieldsaye in
to the nether garments of their illustri
ous owner in fact the note ran thus
that c j london the ordinary
laconic mode in which charles james
bishop of london sums up his hon
t ors and dignities was desirous of
i viewing the duke of wellingtons
breeches how the duke looked
t as he eyed the note is notour province
i to picture but with his usual despatch
and thinking that the request applied
i to the waterloo inexpressibles and
that they might be wanted for artistic
i purposes he directed his valet to look
r out the article and forward it in a
polite form to his lordship
ii the packet arrived at the bishops
i and the amazement with which the pre
late received with f m the duke of
 wellingtons compliments his wa
terloo breeches may possibly be con
st ceived but the ludicrous was soon
f changed into the painful as the idea
i flashed through the mind of the bishop
s that all was not quite right with the
i great veteran and to solve the painful
r doubt his lordship started off to the
i premier to make lord john a party to
the extraordinary present he had re
ceived now it happened that after
i the parcel had been despatched the
duke was struck by a similar thought
i as to the mental state of the right rev
t erend prelate and he too thought it
t his duty to report to the premier the
t probable state of one of the heads of
the church militant his grace arrived
f most apropos the bishop was with
tlie premier lord john was pondering
tover the mystery of the breeches
when up rode the noble owner of them
how he ard the bishop looked at each
other is again one of those matters in
which the imagination of the pencil
 must come to the duty of the pen but
i the climax of the scene was that the
letter the source from whence all the
a mischief had arose was produced
f conned over and at length rightly in
r terpreted c j london was substitut
i ed for the bishop of london the beech
es of strathfieldsaye for the duks
breeches and to suin up mrs london
i received by return of post a polite com
pliance with her request we have

and influence he was very handsome
when young with a profile of grecian
regularity and was famous among us
for a certain dispassionate humor for
his admiration of the works of field

in pushing a narrative to its utmost
and drawing upon his stores of

i for which he possessed an understood

j to see his good looks swallowed up in
