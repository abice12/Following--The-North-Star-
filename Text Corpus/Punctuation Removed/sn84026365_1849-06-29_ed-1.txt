we copy the following from the

paper publishedat greenfield mass i
we agree with the editor that there is
great daugei that slavery will steal a
march upon california hut we are
rather more hopeful oithe result thanj
it hoerns to he to great vigilance
however cannot he exercised by the
free democracy we have a wily foe
to contend nitii and every friend of
freedom should he on the alert to re
sist its subtlety and power it is vain
to hope fur any aid from those wedded
to taylorism but we do expect that
uiiyiy whigs when their eyes are fair
ly opened to the proslavery tendeni
cies of the present administration will
show that their patriotism is superior to
any mere paitizan feelings and unhes
itatingly identity themselves with the

slavery in californiathe
washington correspondent of the n
y evening post of the th of april
says
 have information from gentlemen
from the south now here that satisfies
me that a struggle is to be made in
california as well as here to introduce
slavery into t fiat territorynumbers
f slaves have already gone there and
masters are making preparations much
more effectual than those you hear in
the newspapers to send more the
contest will arise between the slave
owners and drivers and the mass of the
inhabitants upon the question shall
these slaves he retained in bondage
which is identical with the question
miall slavery he legally estabiiseed in
aiiforn a
the daily w isconsin milwaukee
says
it lias been slated from tpne to time
that slaves were being carried to cali
fornia hut generally discredited vet
the evidence is increasing to confirm
this report ihe southern correspon
dent ol the new orleans picayune
writes from panama
not less than hkf to  are now
on the isthmus awaiting transportation
twothirds of whom are southern and
western men somo of them with
slaves
facts like these show how aburd it
is to argue tfiat slaves will nt be car
ried to californiaeven if there is no
legislative restriction the readop
tion of the ordinance of would set
tle this exciting question al once and
forever close the strife of sectional hif
ternes and it is therefore that file ar
dent lover of his country desires that
this question should he settled by the
extension of the ordinance of w over
the new territories
the host on traveller says
fihn ts increasing evidence that
slaveholders with thcr slaves are emi
gllting to ihfornia it jv doubtless
the act that a large number of the per
sons now waning at panama for trans
portation to san francisco me south
ern men with slaves i htat d on
credible authority that families with
all their slaves are moving towards the
gold region from arkansa tennessee
and missourislave drivers are mak
ing up gangs of them to carry out
the southerners believe that they
can rely on the senate to keep off the
yviimot proviso and that should they
be disappointed in this the president
will prevent its adoption true legal
ly without the proviso they have no
right to hold slaves in california but j
slavery has always been established
the north star
without right and in defiance of com
mon law no that the matters feel suit
enough against that it it only a pos
itive statute which they fear and thai
wc ought to have but shall not we fear
great confidence has been expressec
hat the calfornians will prohibit sla
very we doubt it there are man
southern men there and more will b
there w ith slaves before the people can
adopt any provisional government
they may be at first only body
servants and there is a strong odium
attached to an interference with a gen
tlemans personal comforts which will
unite with the strong temptation of the
gold seekers to get the gold without the
labor to wink at the employment ol
slaves it ahowm be too
that the g eecutafcbtwwtbe territory
fseifc smitti is a slaveholder as might
be expected and has slaves with him
so that slavery actually now exists in
california considering these things
and the probability in the present state
and temper of the two most numerous
parties in the union and the prosla
very character of the administration
we have strong fears we confess that
slavery will prevail there in spite of the
efforts to resist it we know it is more
common to assert that slavery can never
get another inch of territorythe last
slave state is admitted to the union
and so on we wish the indications
were sure that such would be the case
but we have never seen them to be
between the lukewarmness and hesi
tancy of the whig party and the more
decided aversion of the democratic par
ty to a prohibiting act there is great
danger that slavery will clandestinely
slip in and get quietly established be
fore congress will prove itself the
champion of freedom we hope other
wise and that is all but the dangers
are very great

southern movements slave
ry in californa
the following extract from a com
munication dated the th instant ad
dressed to us from virginia corres
ponds with our information from other
quarters and with authentic facts which
have already been laid before the pub
lic we have been assured by a
gentleman who has passed through
several of the sojthern states within
the last fortnight that the determina
fon is universal among the slave emi
grants to the pacific from those states
to take the slaves with them
the remarks of our correspondent
o which we w ish to invite attention are
preceded by some complimentary com
ments upon the course of this journal
of more interest to its proprietors than
its readers he then continues
the movement making at this time
ut the south is what  am most particu
larly anxious to call your attention to
ido not wish to excite sectional ani
mosities and criminations but i w ish to
see a scheme now in progress arres
ted it is no other than a plan to intro
duce slavery into california and new
mexico ever since the hope of pre
venting the passage of the wilmot
proviso was abandoned southern
ultraists have been preparing a very
successful scheme to promulgate slave
ry into these territories if they do
not succeed it w ill not be for the want
ofzeal or devotion according to mr
holmes of south carolina this scheme
is well laid and comprehensive enough
to ensure success
the memphis eagle tells us that
a large majority of the companies
formed and forming for el dorado
carry with them slaves a mr how t ard
of columbus ga proposes to form
one of five hundred to carry out from
one to two thousand slaves person
ally  know  that several of the com
panies which have lett this state i
carried out slaves with them a mem
ber of congress from tennessee said
to me that within his own knowledge
there would be carried to california
lrotn ten to twelve thousand slaves this
summer from reliable evidence i
know that whole families are moving
with all their slaves from the states of
tennessee arkansas and missouri it
is said that even slave drivers are
making up gangs to carry out it is
well known from a fair test in thej
states of virginia north carolina and j
georgia that the slaves make the best i
gold miners
the valley of the sacramento in the
summer is as unhealthy to the white
man as the low cotton and rice lands
of north and south carolina and
georgia and the belief is that the
miners will be compelled to resort to
slave labor those who carry out
staves undertake to say that the thirst
for gold will soon quiet all scruples of
conscience about the sin of slavery
besides the governor of california is
a slaveholder and the principal con j
ductors of the press and officers are
either slaveholders or from the slave
states all this looks as though the
introduction of slavery into that terri j
tory might succeed if timely action is
not taken to prevent it i tm no alar
mist and despise sectional animosities
but i cannot feel willing to see an in
stitution so much to he deprecated
planted there
what will be the result ol these
movements of the southern slavehold i
ers upon the main question we do not
now propose to consider the incident
al consequences however must prove
disastrous in many respects it the
property in slaves shall not receive a
legal recognition from the government
hereafter to be organized for califor
nia the loss to thoae who are sending
slaves to that region will of course be
ruinous ihe territory will be deluged
with an ignorant and thieving popula
tion whose presence will be an utunii
right ib of no sextruth is f f roliggod w thk father of us au avp all wl are brfthrfn
tgated curse to it and its inhabitants
and a strife between the slave proprie
tors and the free laborers will grow up
fruitful of discord arid crime
j if on the other hand the slaves who
may be dragged to that distant region
shall be compelled to wear away their
lives in bondage the consequences to
the dawning civilization aad promise ot
our pacific possessions will be yet
fmore disastrous
these and the thousand other evils
which may be easily imagined might
all have been prevented but fof the in
fatuated resistance of the soptbem
statesmen to a distinct expression of
opinion by congress upon the subject
and the weak admission of northern
trimmers that slavery could not exist in
those regions
multitudes were led to put faith in
the reiterated assertions of the north
ern journals and politicians and to re 
lax their effort to effect the passage ofj
a territorial bill last winter with a
proviso against slavery under the im
pression that such an enactment would
not be necessary for any practical
purpose
we hope their eyes may now be
opened to their error and to the fraud
which has been practised upon them
and that with all convenient speed they
will lake proper steps to repair the
consequences
people of folor
we should have announced last
week the action of the ohio legisla
ture respecting the people ot color in
the united states a few days before
the adjournment of that body the fol
lowing preamble and resolutions were
passed by the house of representa
tives without a dissenting voice
whereas the people of color of
the united states have been oppressed
and enslaved by the several states
thereof and thereby degraded and be
lieving it to be the duty of the general
government to do something for their
elevation to that position natures
god designed for all mei therefore bej
resolved by the general assembly
of the state of ohio that our sena
tors be instructed and our represen
tativesjn congress be requested to
procure the passage of a law author
izing the survey and apportionment of
a portion of the territory acquired
from mexico for the benefit of ail free
persons of color who inay become ac
tual settlers of the same and a title toj
eighty acres of land delivered to each j
of said persons free of oharge and
also to establish schools and provide
for them a government for protection i
resolved that the governor of this
state be requested to forward a copy of
the above preamble and resolution to
each of our senatois and representa
tives in congress
this is what the antislavery bugle
calls colorphobia wearing the garb
of philanthropy whether this plan
has been recommended out of pure
love to the colored man is a matter of
doubt had the former acts of our
legislature been different we would
have less hesitancy in awarding to its
members the purest of motives no
doubt many members have not been
under the influence of colorphobia
but actuated by the best of motives
but they have yielded to the plans of
those who will never rest satisfied un
til the poor hated colored man is
driven entirely from the bounds of
ohio like henry clay they join in
the cry away with them it is
anything but love to the colored man
that would colonize him in the territo
ry of newmexico if ohio is the
good buckeye state to the white why
ought it not he to the black especi
ally if it is the state of bis nativity j
we know that circumstances are so
prejudicial to the happiness of the
colored population in ohio and other
states that many of them would prei
fer seeking a home in an unknown j
land hut it should not be so let the
legislature strike the axe at the root
of the evil and we will award the noj
blest meed of praise let the neces
sary steps be taken for remodeling the
constitution of ohio so as to secure
to the people of color u voice in the
making of those laws by which they
are governed and in the choice of their
rulerslet all laws making distinctions i
on account of color he stricken out
let an oppressive system of land mon
opoly be checked or destroyedand
let legislation be for the poor and des
pised especially for those who are so
io conseqence of the injustice of the
rich and tyrannical and the work of
amelioration may be effected what
has been done is well whilst it should
not have been left undone the other
should have been done first but the
same body which has passed the above
resolutions had a hard struggle to
effect even a partial repeal of the
black laws some of the members
were in favor of enacting law to expel
the colored man from the state and a
bill was introduced into the senate to
prevent any one from entering with
such elements in that body we are
free to say those who would do good
to the oppressed in ohio have yielded
to the behests of an illiberal spirit in
others with the facts befoie us we
can look upon the preamble as little
else than a rhetorical flourish how
ever if we mistake not a better day
is coming who will help to hasten
it concord free press

trom the national a s standard
the standard
with this number begins the tenth
year of the standard for thrice three
years has it been the symbol to hie na
tion of the existence of an organized
and embattled opposition to slavery it
has been literally and not reetapbori
cplly merely the stanffarcto fcietcause
it has been the sign to foes and friends
that the ship was not yet given up
that the crew was resolutedesperate
if you please and that the battle would
be maintained as long as men and amu
nition were left on the one side and the
enemy on the other it was first un
furled to the winds in a dark and evil
hour the officers to whose charge
the direction of the attack upon slavery
had been committed had mutiniei and
deserted they had piratically run off
with the good flag entrusted to them
and used the influence of its name and
the stores it covered to shelter their
ignominious flight and to protect the
allies whom they had in common with
the enemy whose comfort and preser
vation they esteemed of more conse
quence than the discomfiture and defeat
of the foe itself in that evil hour as
it then seemed in the midst of the con
fusion and doubt which filled mens
minds the new standard was run to the
masthead the good ship righted as
soon as honest handswere felt upon the
helm her head turned instinctively in 
the right direction her batteries thun
dered away at open enemies and trea t

while the pilfered and prostitute flag
after many a scurvy adventure ragged
and dirty draggles at the tail of an her
maphrodite political craft ominous of
disaster and defeat
to drop the allegory the establish
ment and support of the standard have
been among the most pregnant proofs
of vitality and tenacity of life that the
abolitionists have ever shown begun
without a single subscriber at a time
w hen the movement proper was betray
ed and deserted by almost all who had
seemed to be its incarnate embodiments
its property made away with its char
acter maligned its supporters slandered
their lifes life lied awayit has
been maintained without interruption for
nine years and we hope it will contin
ue to wrestle with the storm as long as
the existence of slavery compels into
being the antagonist entity ot aboli
tionism the importance ot the organ
of a combination against any public in
iquity is to be very imperlectly meas
ured by its subscription list and indeed
is in some measure independent of it
the utterer of unpalatable doctrine of
hated truth was never yet popular if
he escapes such martyrdom as his age
deals in at least be cannot expect it to
afford him a comfortable support if it j
will lend him its ears and that grudg
ingly it is all that he can hope for j
but there must be a voice to cry in
wilderness repent and flee from the
wrath to come although locusta and
wild honey must be its meat the
scattered laborajof our ihtle remnant of
warworn veterans invaluable and all
essential as they are are almost lost
sight of in tba immensity of their field
they need a central organ to magnify
their office and to proclaim and record
their successes man require to me
single point to which to look to know
whether the antislavery movement
has still an existence and what are the
proofs of vitality that it ts affordiug
the flag at the mast head of a manof
war may be but an inconsiderable piece
of banting jut it is the emblem of na
tionality and gives friends and foes to
know whether it bolds its own or wheth
er it has yielded to the enemy
the soundnes of this philosophy has
been proved by the history of all as
saults upon the strongholds of national
and social crime the british and for
eign antislavery society during its
days of life previous to the abolition
of british slavery since which time it
has had a name to live bnt has been
worse than dead dependent on the con
tributions of abolitionists for the sup
port of its organ and publications so
with the efforts for the suppression of
intemperance war capital punish
ment and other public evils on both
sides of the water probably in no in
stance has the organ of any society
gathered for the removal of these or
analoguous evils sustained itself by
sales and subscriptions and this for
the obvious reason that men will not
pay for the rebukes of their darling
sins but which ot those movemcuts
could have had any abiding effect or
continuing influence had it not been for
the medium through which each spoke
to the world we believe the stan
dard has done as well in this respect
taking into cons deration the vastly
greater obstacles it has had to encoun
ter as any of its cotemporaries of a re
forming character nay better fo
the odiousness of the truths it enunci
ates has been in an unusual degree
compensated for by the ability which
has marked its editorial conduct and
the sterling excellence of the mat
ter it has contained thousands and
tens of thousands read it who do not
pay for it and the press far and wide
south as well as north it is the chief
channel through which antislavery
light and influence flows the aboli
tionists are obliged to furnish their food
to the hungry not merely in many
cases without money and without price
but even to send out and compel them
to come in on those terms
to make an attack upon the most
cherished institution of a great nation
on which it has encompassed in the
arms of its ecclesiastical and its secu
lar love can never be a popular or a
profitable occupation those who are
desirous of making money or of gain
ing office or of living comfortably with
their neighbors and she wprld had bet
ter direct their attentionelsewhere
tur clients are the dpwiiit addett and
spoiled of the race and silver and
gold have they none to reward our
services withal nay their advocate
must make up his mind before he en
gages in their cause to take his place
by their side and be little more es
teemed ot men than they social
consideration is no part of the induce
ment to enlist in the antislavery war
fare it is part ot the contribution each
is called upon to make iu its support j
the rewards and satisfactions which
wait upon antislavery fidelity are ofj
another nature these are to be
found in the clearness of vision which
discerns a great national crime in its 
true nature and in the strength which
enables them to cry aloud and spare
not against it in the consciousness
that they have attained to the know
ledge of the true way of deliverance
for their people from the wrath which
it has been treasuring up against the
day of wrath the consciousness that
they have not withheld this knowledge
from the ears of the people but that
they have been instant in season and i
out of season in relating it in their
ears whether they would bear or whe
ther they would torbear the consci
ousness ot the perception and the per
formance of a difficult duty and the
sense that the portion of contemporary
history which they are busy uu de j
veloping is the only oue iu this country
of a permanent and abiding interest
whose issues are issues of fife or
death and which will extend to the
remotest ages of the world
we see in every direction thf k
nowledged indications that we t e
understood our business and do i
well the continual dropping
made some impression even on the
stone of the american heart the
ears of the people have been at least
partially unstopped that they should
hear the cry of the captive and their
eves forced open that they should dis
cern some portion of their own guilty
complicity with the oppressor eccle

down and they must either take it up
or cry craven the inaolent common
places of proslavery with which the
northern ear was insulted a few years
ago are now almost unheard the
people bare been made comparatively
intelligent of tbe nature and effects of
slavery in tbeir own despite indi
rectly we have been the means of
changing tbe dynasty that reigns over
tbe land tbe result to be sure
which substituted n tyrant for a sy

agitation by the voice of hie living

have lost none of their efficiency the
field of their operations is widened by
the partial removing of landmarks and
throwing down of partitions ears
that were formerly sealed are now wil

to see will now look and rend it is
the business of the abolitionists to see
to it that judicial blindness and deafness
do not again supervene through their
negligence as a most important part
of this business we commend to them
all everywhere the extension of the
circulation of the standard in the
remoter parts of the country the in
terests of the paper must be mainly
left in the hands of its local friends
the small body of agents which the
executive committee will be able to
direct to this work must devote them
selves to the attempt to obtain a local
support for the paper in eastern new
york let the abolitionists and all
subscribers who value an exclusively
antislavery paper see to it that the
standard suffers no detriment through
their neglect let them continue their
own subscriptions collect those in their
neighborhood and procure additional
subscribers much we know from
personal experience can be done in
this woy enough to keep the present
list whole and to make the subscrip

character and numbers such as the
greatness of the occasion will demand
and of which in inviting the men we
have mentioned to associate for the
purpose we have inspired an expecta
tion for england we can answer
with confidence many hundreds of
her wisest and best headed by such
mcivas richard cobdcn william ew
arf charles hindley joseph sturge
are prepared to testify to theiflgfrenbti
njighborathi depth and pimpriy of
their convictious on the question of
peace by gathering around tne most
eminent of their fellow citizens on that
memorable occasion and will ameri
ca prove unequal to the demand made
on herenterprize and humanity we
believe not no fact in connection
with the coming congress excited so
deep and general an interest in franee
as the assurance we ventured to give
that many of the friends of peace
from the united states might be ex
pected to visit the french capital and
bear part in the deliberations of our
congress now just in proportion to
the feelings of kindly interest and
pleasure which this announcement has
inspired in france will be the severi
ty of their disappointment and our
mortification should our promise on
your behalf fail
have we presumed too much dear
friends on the energy of american
character on the spirit and fervor of
american philanthropy on the zeal
and devotion of american christianity
in giving such mi assurance wy
earnestly hope not standing foremost
as you do among the nations of the
world tor hardy activity for bold and
adventurous enterprize shall it he said
that the cause of universal peace and
humanity is too feeble to inspire the
national genius but wc will appeal
to higher motives than national pride
we call up before your mind the image
of bleeding humanity of fettered civi
lization of outraged and insulted chris
tianity standing on the shores of
europe in supplicating attitude and
with appealing voice entreating you to
come over we beseech you dear
friends to hear and obey this appeal
by sending forth a goodly company of
your most eminent citizens who bv
their wisdom and eloquence shall wor
thily sustain the reputation of your
country in this great assembly which
promises to be more than any other
of modern times a full representation

that slavery is a sin lie condemns many who

that was uot in evidence mr mc came
to order and argued the evidence some is or
 minutes give evident signs that be felt
cramped by the meagre ness of tbe teaumooy

pnt moved round and put about the book 
what could have been ins intent thu we

that the book must come in communication
with persons of color before it can affect

but believe and was sorry to sav there were
white person in grayson who would tell pet
sons of color all about such matters
abruptly leaving the case the speakerj
poured out a torrent of denunciation against
the abolitionists he hat to them because
they were enthusiasts liars scoundrels and
hypocrites god is the author of slavery
what was once right is now and always will
lie heaven and earth shall pass hut myi
word shall not pass till all e fulfilled the
abolitionists have hut one text to prove thalj
slavery is a sin viz he that steafeth a man
ac this they misquote misconstrue and
misapplv lifting the narrative he read the
sung commencing
conn saint ami mr hear me tell

the entire concourse is thrown into a parox
ysm of laughter he then read from the close
of me preface come what will cost what
it rnay e on which he commented with
great warmth spoke of blood stained knives
and hearths burning houses broken altars and i
much more such like at the close of which
the court decided that the case should go up
to the superior court brother smiths
pamphlet was delivered to the c onrt with
the request bv mcommet that it would read
thp passages that were marked mi  ullon
w ished their worship to read the whole ar
gument
the counsels on both sides agreeing that
theit pleas in the case ot the narrative should
apply to the pamphlet
the court read about fifteen and consult
ed for about ten minute and announced the
reference of the pamphlet also to the superior
court
mr fulton m behalf of brother bacon
risked lor leave ot toil mccommet objected
read the law on that point which amounted
to this if there was but slight suspicion
of guilt they had the power to grant bail
but if there was good proof they had not
the court allowed bail and ihereby said
there was but slight suspicion of guilt bro
bacon then gave security in a bond of a thou
sand dollars in each case i give it as worthy
of note that john cornout a slaveholder
gave his name as bail at which mccommet
expressed great surprise brother bacon is

we call attention to the appeal ot the
radies of the western new york antisu

that it will he generously responded to by our

of former eitorts have not been large nor flat
terimr is no reasen tor withholding the aid 
iltis  ar the antislavery cause in this region
is vet in its infancy its friends are few and
generallv pour the most they can boast is a
sincere and earnest desire to promote the
cause of emancipation and their willingness
to labor zealously and industriously to that
end it will he seen that the committee pur
pose devoting the main portion ot the pro
ceeds to sustain the north star this
is gratifying and encouraging to us and
we hope with their assistance and that of
our friends in philadelphia and in other parts
of the country to be able to establish our
humble sheet permanently it is impossible
that a paper like the north star devoted
to an unpopular cause attacking the long
cherislied opinions and prejudices of the
communitywithout agencies or capital
can sustain itself it it succeed it must do
so by donations f rom the persons who appre
ciate its importance
we rejoice to know that our colored as

the paper and although we stagger uudei
many difficulties we arc leaolved to persevere
and to leave no honorable means untried to
make the paper successful as well as useful

to celebrate not satisfied with having struck
the fetters from tbe lit of their own

fact alone should lead our people to patronize

cincinnati
pnrate letters from cincinnati inform us
that the colored citizens f that city are mak
ing extensive arrangements for celebrating
the birthday of treed ogjo  people in
the west indies no doubt that
the occasion wilttiejinde highly serviceable
to the cause of the oppressed and enslaved in
this land and that this may be done more
efficiently we would suggest to the ladies
the propriety of holding an antislavery fair
in a large hall amply provided with suitable
refreshments where the evening may be
passed in pleasant and instructive social in
tercourse we should regret if the occasion
should close by holding a ball as i usual in
this region pleasure should be combined
with instruction and moral improvement this
could be done much belter by holding a fair
than by squandering means and time tn the
revelry of a ballroom we are not aware
that a ball has been contemplated at cinci
nnati but we have spoken in view fi its pro
bability and we hope our friends will receive
the suggestion in the spirit in which it is
made our friends at cincinnati may rest
assured of our presence at the celebration
and that we are anxious for the moment to
arrive when we shall have the pleasure of
taking them heartily by the hand r d
colored newspapers
newspapers co ducted by colored per
sons have lately become very numerous
they are starting up in all directions we
hardly know whether to commend the spirit
that produces them or not in some instances
we can speak in safety both as to the motive
of publishing and the manner of conducting
them the one is as obviously wrong and in
jurious as the other is shabbily and discredita
ble within the last few weeks no fewer
than three newsspapers have been started in
this state by colored persons and were you
to put the whole three into one they would
not make a sheet twothirds as large as the
north star most of them seem to have no
higher motive than to rival eacli othtr and to
murder the queens english take the fol
lowing specimen from the delevan union
published and edited by the rev jamea glou
cester at new york
general assemblies of the presbyterian
church
these ecclesiastical bodies have closed
their sessions doubtless have done good but
greatly neutralized by trying to escape a sub
ject which should above all others engaged
their first and earnest attention iv otto do
so by no notice of it but by passing tame un
meaning resolutions refusing to lay a sin
where it is most prominent endeavoring to
put a tpnetes where almost all the world cries
shame and guilt thus they have done in the
full face of condemning heaven condemning
this as a sin which they have tried to escape
but have they done it  have they stopped in
quiry hushed the voice to silence that was
heard in deep under tones by a few noble
spirits then assembled against this sin and
then no measures though they stopped it here
they did not do it in more potent places it
will survive their action
the volcano is not capped yet it will still
pour its burring lava far and wide and
unhappy is he who comes within its reach
the foregoing is but a fair specimen of the
literary ability of the delevan union we need
not say that it is neither creditable to nor a
just representation of the mental powers of tbe
colored people we think that papers of this
description how well soever intentioned may
be their conductors seive to degrade us in the
eves of the public
the delevan union has discovered that the
north star is in trouble and flippantly
speaks of the eccentricities of its editor
what these eccentricities are he does not in
form his readers but we suppose he aliudes
to our low estimate of the chara ter of our
proslavery church and clergy since its fditor
vet remains in loving fellowsh lt with the very
church whose members traffic in the souls and
bodies of their fellow men we may be ec
centric in holding the idea that such a person is
not only mentally disqualified for editing an
aatislavety paper but as equally destitute of
the moral qualifications for such a position
we really feel mortified by the abortions in
the shape of newspapers that are springing
up around iis all ciaimingas they do to rep
resent the mental abtlhy and the moral excel
lences of the free colored people ol the united
states would the colored people unite in
sustaining two or thiee respectable papers
conducted by persons of their own complex
ion instead of dividing their energies and
squandering their means upon doubtful enter
prises and poorly conducted papers publish
eh stmixcasionally and at moat extending
their existence to a few brief months their
conduct would be fsr more judicious and
praiseworthy
we observe that the indefatigable stephen
myers has commenced the publication of an
other paper in a letter to mr bibb which
we find in the delevan union published at
an extract from a jnend tn the country he
says but i will if  am spared give
frederick douglass and the old rams
horn all they want before six months is
over the foregoing shows the spirit in
which the delevan union and the paper of
mr myers are to be conducted it t easy
to see that such papers will sene to promote
strife and to divide tbe colored people instead
of uniting them m efforts for advancing their
own elevation and improvement r i

causes of their degradation it has rather a
severe cut at the multitude o newspapers
w hich have recently sprung up in new y ork
it terms them tracts and presumes that
the object of the one started by mr glouces

gantts original ethiopian serenader
pai tly from a love of music and partly
from curiosity to see persons of color exag j
gerating the peculiarities of their race we
were induced last evening to hear these ser i
enaders the company is said to be com
posed entirely of colored people and it may j
be so we observed however that they
too had recourse to the burnt ctrk and lamp
black the belter to express their characters
and to produce uniformity of complexion
their lips too were evidently painted and j
otherwise exaggerated their singing gen
erallv was but an imitation of white perform
ers and not even a tolerable representation
of the character of colored people their
attempts at wit showed them to possess a
plentilul lack of it and gave their audience
a very low idea of the sharpness and shrewd
ness of the race to which they belong with
two or three exceptions they were a poor
set and will make themselves ridiculous
wherever they may go we heard hut one
really fine voice among the whole and that
was coopers who is truly an excellent sing
er and a company possessing equal ability
w ith himself would no doubt be very succss
ful in commanding the respectand patronage
of the public generally davis the bones
too is certainly a master player but the
tambourine is an utter failure b richardson
is an extraordinary character his virginia
breakdown excelled anything which we
have ever seen of that desciiption of dancing
he is certainly far before the dancer in the
company of the campbells we are not
sure that our leaders will approve of our
mention of those persons so strong must be
their dislike to everything that seems to feed
the dame of american prejudice against
colored people and in this they may be right
but vve think otherwise it is something
gained when the colored man in any form can
appear before a white audience and we
think that even this company with industry
application and a proper cultivation of their
taste may yet be instrumental in removing the
prejudice againßt our race but they must
cease to exaggerate the exaggerations of our
enemies and represent the colored man
rather as he is than as ethiopian minstrels
usually represent him to be they will then
command the respect of both races w hereas
 they only shock the taste of the one and
provoke the disgust of the other i ooper
davis and richardson bring around them
selves persons of equal skill and seek to im
prove relying more upon the refinement of
the public than its vulgarity let them sttive
to conform to it rather than to cater to the
lower elements of the baser sort and they
may do much to elevate themselves and their
race in popular estimationr d
an appeal in behalf of the western new
york antislavery fail
earnestly desiring the abolition of slavery
in this land and being deeply convinced that
this result can only be accomplished by re
newed efforts to change our present corrupt
moral sentiment the undersigned members
and friends ot the western new york anti
slavery society again make their appeal toi
the friends of the slave in behalf of their
annual bazaar which will he held in roches
ter in december next
while we have been cheered and gladden
ed by the progress already made and ihe
good already done and while we rejoice to
observe that friends have been raised up to
plead the cause of the bondman among perj
sons and in quarters where we had least ex
pected them we still see the harvest to lie
great and thejlaborers to be few and instead of
relaxing our effort we are impressed with a i
sense of the duty of doubling our diligence
and applying more closely our energies to
the means of advancing this holy cm use
we appeal the more boldly to ou friends
becausethose for w hom we plead cannot plead
for themselves while we are surrounded
by our domestic circle with none to molest or
make us affraid there are three mi ions of
men and women in our own land doomed to
abject slavery and chains robbed of every
rightcivilsocialpersonaland political
remembering those in bonds as bound with
 them we desire to plead their cause as though
the galling chain were on our own limb and
the knotted laah were applied to our own
backs
while to obtain means for enlightening the
public mind ia the strong motive for holding
i our annual fair it is not the only one a
great amount of good may be traced directly
i to such occasions many who are now acme
workers in behalf of ibis holy movement be
came first interested in it through the instru
i mentality of those annual exhibitions of
antislavery industry tact and skill
the present object of the rochester anti
alavery bazaar is for the general enlighten
ment of the public mind on the subject ot
slavery recognizing the north star pub
j lished in this city as an efficient anuslave
rv instrumentality we propose that the funds
j raised by the sale of articles at the bazaar
on behalf of which we here appeal shall
j be mainly appropriated to the support of that
important papei
we gratefully acknowledge the prompt
assistance rendered to our last fan by our
friends and coadjutors in various parts of our
own stale wisconsin and michigan and we
earnestly solicit tbir continued cooperauon
wuh ua in the good work that no time
i may be lost we especially recommend to
them the immediate formation of ae wring ca
eteio their various towns with a view to
malting article for the rochester bazaar
we would also in this connection render out
heartfelt thanks to our british friends for the
valuable aid encoded by them to oor hsi

ohio and it rnav be objected to that the
colored citizens of ohio like the faithful baud
of philadelphia pa in  with james for

at their head faithfully stood their ground
declaring that they would never abandon
their position while there was a bondman on
american soil but sacrificing their property
fled before their more cunning enemies leav
ing the field to them without even the roll ot
the drum much more the fire of a gun
the ohio colored freemen as faithfully and
manfully stood their ground as those noble
spirits of pennsylvania only choosing a dif
ferent policy to outmanoeuvre the enemy
while those of our brethren in philadelphia
at once took their position casting their mani
festo to the widespread breeze of heaven
bolstering their declaration with the boldest
determination never to leave the country of
their birth those of cincinnati chillicoth
and other parts of ohio were no less resolute
bold and determinedat once taking their
stand declaring before the dread powers of
heaven and the authorities of earth that
gather than remain and suffer the persecu
tions then being waged against mein
they would leave ohm should it even be at
the gieatest sacrifice of property as well as
personal rights and go to canada and there

of their brethren held in servitude in ths coun
try this was their bold manly and noble
determination whilst yet m ohio upon

and this manly and almost unique temeri
ty on the part of jhio colored freeman had
the most signal effect upon their enemies
we have only here to regret that it proved to
have the counteracting effect that it had we
would that it had been otherwise they had
not more than commenced practically carry
ing out their open declaration of voluntary
emigration until the papers and public jour
nals in all parts of the nonslaveholdmg states
were teeming with objections and censures
against the legislature and state of ohio for
the impolicy of their black law declaring
that they had overshot the mark that in
their hurried effort to get rid of the colored
people they reckoned without calculation
calculated without counting the costthat
in driving the colored people from this
country they were supplying the dominions of
a powerful enemy with robust ablebodied
men who settling in the neighborhood of
their kindred in chains would one day re
taliate upon this country with terrible conse
quences and how exceedingly considerate
did the various papere of ihe land all at once
become there was not an issue butmore
or less contained some advice to the color
ed people either original or copied concerning
their locality and livelihood they were
american citizens by birthfor the most pail
born south in a warm climate they were ac
customed to american habits american
society and american law labor was more
easily obtained in this country consequently
money more plentiful as to the canadas
the climate was ccid and uncongenialthe
people selfish and inheritable their customs
distant and unsociabltthe laws illiberal and
severework scarce and wages law these
and many more were the argument used and
urged to prevent the colored people from
emigrating to the canadas by the very per
son who in many instances were foremost
and those who were aider and abettor and
instrumental in getting up the persecution and
the passage of the infamous hdlongmated
black laws of ohio and leader of the
nefarious scheme of arueiican colonization
a scheme concocted and devised under the
supervision of the archdemon in the deep
est darkest and lowest cell of pandemonium
though ail that was done was intended fin
the better yet we cannot suppress the
thought that had the colored freeman of ohio
continued to emigrate as they commenced as
as those of pennsylvania who assembled
in solemn convention in  with a deternu
naoß follow their example and gone into
t e ni h amercan provinces of the british
dominions settled down substantially upon
lands where they would have been joined
by h colored people of the free states gene

will require ages almost to produce m o jt
present dtytndmt servile nonenlical position
that had there been the uroe sane mature
reflection and deliberation among colored men
then as there are nowthe same capacity m
judge and decide for themselves they would
have persisted in their own convictions and
not have yielded to the opinions and dictate
of others however friendly the deign xs

pursuant to public notice a large and en
thusiastic meeting of the colored citzens ut
columbus convened at the d baptist
church to take into consideration a memorial
from one david cpist agent of the
american colonization sciety to the legis
lattire of th i state requesting that body to
make a suitable appropriation to aid the
american colonization society fur a few
years to come in carrying out its designs in
relation to the colored people of ohio and m
promoting the spirit of emigration to liberia
and also to adopt measures to guard against
the difficulties and collisions to be apprehend
ed from a greatei increase of colored men
amongst us
the meeting was organized by calling
jas poindexter to the chair and ap
pointing j vs cadoso secretary ihe chan
man stated the object tor which they had
assembled and called the attention ol the
meeting to extracts of said memorial
mr c h langston then jresented for the
consideration of the meeting the following
j resolutions which were very forcibly and
eloquently suppported by messrs langston
and poindexter and rev j m brown wm
guy arid others and unanimously adopted
resolved that the original object of tlu
aiuerican colonization society as set toith
by the immortal sage of ashland the
great exponent of its principles is to remove
the free colored people from fnited
states and thereby make the slave prtqem
i more secure and valuable
resolved that we have no evidence ihai
this malevolent and ignommoua object has
been changed as many of ib leaders in that
diabolical scheme arc contributing means to
i send free colored people to liberia while
thev are holding hundred of their fellow
men inservile bondage
resolved that wc recognize dsvnjcnsty
the agent of the american colonization
society for the state of ohio as aiding in
the accomplishment of the same nefarious
end when he memorializes the legislature
of the state to adopt measures to prevent
greater increase of colored men in the ohio
valley
resolved that believing as we do that
the primary object of tl memorial above re
ferred to is to prevent the repeal of the accursed
black laws of ohio and if possible to
induce the the lawmaking power of th
state to inflict new and more odious disibii
i ties upon the colored freemen of ohio and
thereby to cause them to leave the country
we therefore view the petitioner david cris
iv as our inveterate enemy a poor con
temptible servile of the slave powera lick
spittle for slaveholders and their abettors
i doing their dirty work to procure their smiles
snd money dripping with human blood md
i consequently unworthy the slightest notice
from the legislature of an intelligent and free
people
resolved that we feel confident that the
intelligence wisdom and love of liberty man
ifested in the honorable legislature of this
state will not allow its members to give the
j least countenance to a scheme so miimou
i emanating from a being so conteiuptib e
resolved that we will never leave tins
country while one ot our brethren gtoan m
slavish fellers in the i tilled sine but w
remain on this soil and contend for our rights
and those of out enslaved raceupon
toe tramin ihe pulpit in the social circle

in earnest devotion to one philanthropic enter
prise consistent with a hearty interest m every
work of reform but that out usefulnes and
 efficiency in our several spheres will be pro
portioned to our just appreciation of the labors
of others and to our diligence m cultivating
the spirit ol universal unity the narrow j
bigotry which leads us to form an exagger
ated estimate of our own immediate labors
and to undervalue the toils and sacrifices of
others not less devoted than themselves to the i
welfare of mankind is at war with the whole
genius of reform and a mighty hinderance to
our moral and spiritual growth the friends
of humanitv of every class should se
dulously cultivate the spirit of harmony and
mutual cooperation so beautifully described

we admonish you beloved fellowlaborers
to be steadfast and immoveable in your ad
herence to fundamental principles to right
and truth in opposition to the maxims of a
worldly expediency but true under all
circumstances to your highest conviction to
the voice of duty in your own souls let no
temporary good no impatience for immediate i
results tempt you to swerve from the line of
strictest rectitude remember that duty is
yours while consequences are gods enter
 into no compromise with the evils which you 
j seek to exterminate while you deal kindly
and patiently with those who set themselves
i in opposition to the cause of reform seeking
towin them to the right way in the spirit of
love we exhort you also to he bold and fear
less in proclaiming the truths you ate set to j
defend let your rebukes of sin he tempered
with kindness but give no place to that false
j charity w hich shrinks from the utterance of
an important truth from the fear of giving
i offence
we entreat you also to be faithful t the i
truth in dealing with the corrupt parties and i
sects w hich lend their influence to sustain in
justice oppression and crime the church
which sanctions or apologizes for slavery
and war or which neglects or refuses to take
i the side of oppressed and downtrodden
controlled by the spirit of practical infideli
ty aid atheism the ministry which is
zealous for creeds and faiths hut uttets no
efficient testimony against the popular sins of
the age is not auhristian but an infidel min
istry and we counsel you by vour reverence
for god and your love lor man to lend it no i
support be not deceived by the potent
wiles nor awed into submission by the anath
emas of such a thurch and such a ministry
though the hosts of sect and parly are 
encamped on every side be not dismayed nor i
disheartened for ui the conflict with unright

with each other man has an undispulble
right to liveto acquire and possess prop

the various and wonderful powers of his being
thus to recognize the authority of god and

the bondage enslavement or chatteihood
imposed by man upon his fe lowman is a
war upon the natural and motal economy es

this committee can do no less than oppose
by all rational and effective means within it
reach the assumptions of slavery and its de
fender on all occasions and on overy assail
able point thus this committee will at all
rimes repudiate and resist ihe pretensions of
slavery to protection from the legislation of
congress or the states or to sanction from
the judicial tribunals of the country theidea
that slavery by any possibility can derive
righllul sanction support or approval from

with these views it is the firm purpose of
this committee to receive with open arms

the following memorial which we have
just received from a friend in england will
show that an important movement is now go
ing forward in lhat country for ihe suppres
sion of the african slavetrade it is highly
gratifying to observe that antislavery feeling
oj england does not slumber andthai it ha
again opposed itself in a tangible forrr to the
horrid traffic in human flesh which finds nc
greater protection anywhere than under the
meriean flag
foments of the memorial to the
queen
the memorialists respectfully call hei
majestys attention to the enormities of thr
african slavetrade which they describe as
in a state of great activity notwithstanding
he efforts of this country for its suppres
sion
they submit lhat this arises
ist from the absence of good faith on the
jart of the spanish and brazilian govern
nents which are under solemn engagements
o relinquish the traffic
nd from the increased consumption ol
slaveproduce in this country
with a view to remedy this evil the me
moralists pray
that her majestys government shall use
rvery legitimate and peaceful means for en
forcing on biazil and spain the fulfilment ol
heir treaties with this country
ist by the immediate abolition of the slave
trade and
nd by the emancipation of all negroes
mlawfully introduced
the memoralisls propose an individual and
videspread abstinence from the productions of
lirazil and uba and pray her majesty
to exclude the same from theroval house

they further entreat her majesty
to encourage the growth aud manufacture

speedily supplant the slavegrown cotten of

moral honestythe tribune in speakj
ing of the recent failure of bishop done of i
new jersey holds the following truthful lan 
guage respecting the morality of men who
never pay their honest debts but who live at
an extravagant rate
it is a lamentable truth thai the popular
morality with regard to debt and nonpayment j
is disgracefully lax in this christian land
we have become so habituated to look to the
law for the collection of debts that most men
have no idea of the pressing obligation to pay
a debt other than the legal obligation we
understand that a man who cant pay is not i
culpable in neglecting to pay but our cant
has a very slippery significance many a
man cant pay the mechanics and merchants
w hom he owes simply because he lives ex
travagantly hiring servants to do the work
w hich belongs to his sons and daughtersbe
cause he lives in h more expensive house and j
spends more money for food clothing e
than lie has any moral right thus to dispose
of many a man cant pay because he
docs not half work nor exert himself near
so much to get out of debt as he did to get in j
the man who cant pay an honest debt has i
ro right to indulge in luxuries keep their
sons at college nor their daughters at the pi i
ano ifhe thus lives at the rate of three or
four thousand dollars a year while the frugal
and industrious importune him for what is
their honest due he is an outright swindler
no matter how high the circle he move in nor
how many churches he belongs to
slavery and antislavery in missouri

i terest in keeping up or extending the institu
tion of slavery the same print complains
bitterly of the stigma which the existence j
of slavery fixes upon manual industry and
affirms that it has the effect of excluding from
the state a most valuable and numerous class
of emigrants from the atlantic region whose j
enterprise industry and skill are needed u j

hi mental sufferings were sufficiently
acute yet he did not sit down in des

i out america presented itself as a scene
where industry might find a reward
and by the kindness of some friends he
was enabled to make preparations to
emigrate with his wife and children
tow ards the end of february he qut ed
london for one of the great seaports
where he was to embark for boston
on arriving there w ith his family mr
harvey look up his abode at a princi
pal hotel this in a man of straight
ened means was doubtless imprudent
but he afterwards attempted to explain
the circumstances by saying that a
the ship in which he had engaged his
passage was to sail on the day after his
irrival he had preferred incurring a
slight additional expense rather than
tnat his wifewho was now with fail
ing spirits nursing an infantshould
oe exposed to coarse associations and
personal discomfort in the expecta

in the hotel harvey was unfortunately
disappointed shipmasters especially
those commanding emigrant vessels
were then as now habitual promise
breakers and although each succeed
ing sun was to light them on their way
it was fully a fortnight before the ship
stood out to sea by that time a second
and more dire reverse had occurred in
the fortunes of the luckless harvey
cartwright whose appetite for ven
geance was but whetted by his first
success had never lost sight o the
movements of his victim and now be
had followed him to the place ot his
embarkation with an eager but unde
fined purpose of working him some fur
ther and more deadly mischief steal
thilv he hovered about the house which
sheltered the unconscious object ot his
malicious hate plotting as he after
wards confessed the wildest schemes
for satiating his revenge several times
be made excuses for calling at the ho
tel in the hope of observing the nature
of the premises taking care how ever
to avoid being seen by mr harvey or
his family a fortnight passed away
and the day of departure for the emi
grants arrived without the slightest oj
portunity occurring for the giatification
o ins purposes the ship was leaving
her in rth must ofihe passengers were
f baid mrs harvey and the child
ren with neaily the whole ot the lug
gage were already safely in the ves
mr harvey only remained on
shore to purchase s me trifling articles
and to settle ins bill at the hotel on re
moving ins hist hunk cartwright had
tracked him all day he could not at
tack him hi the street and he finally
followed him to the hotel in order to
wreak his vengeance on him in his
private appartment ot the situation ot
which lie had informed himself
harvey entered the hotel first and
before cartwright came up he had gone
down a passage into the bar to settle
the bili he had incurred tor the last two
days not aware ot this circumstance
cartwright in the bustle which prevail
ed went up stairs to mr harveys bed
room and pai lor in neither ot which
to his surprise did he he rind the occu
pant and he turned away discomfited
passing along towards too cuiet stair
case lie perceived a ro in ot which the
door was open and that on ttie tauu
there lay a gold watch and appendag s
nobody was in the apaitmeut the
igentleman who occupied it had only a
i tew moments before gone to his bed
chamber for n brief space quick as
lightning a diabolical thought hashed
through thebrain of the villain who
had been baffled in his original inten
tions he recollected that he had seen
a tiunk in harveys room and that
the keys hung in tlie lock an iiicon
iceivahly short space of time served lu
him to seize the watch to deposit it at
the bottom of harveys trunk and to
quit the hotel by a back stair which led
by a short cut to the harbourthe
vvhoie transaction was done unperceiv
ed and the wretch at last departed uu
noticed
having finished his business at the
bar mr harvey repaired to his room
locked his trunk which being of a
handy size lie mounted on his should
er and proceeded to leave the house by
the back stairs in order to get as
quickly as possible to the vessel lit
tte recked he of the interruption which
was to he presented to his departure
he had got as far as the foot of the
stair with his burden when he was
overtaken by a waiter who declared
that he was going to leave the house
clandestinely without settling accounts
it is proper to mention that mr har
vey had incurred the enmity of this
particular waiter in consequence ot
having out of his slender resources
given him too small a gratuity on the
occaiauof paying a former bill and
not aw are of the second bill being set
tled the waiter was rather glad to have
an opportunity of charging him with a
fraudulent design in vain mr har
vey remonstrated saying he had paid
for everything the waiter would not
believe his statement ana detained him
itill he should hear better about it
let me go leiiow l insist upon it
said mr haivey burning with indigna
tion i am already to late
not a step till i ask master if ac
counts are squared
at this moment while the altercation
was at the hottest a terrible ringing ol
bells w as heard and above stairs was a
loud noise of voices and of feet running
to and fro a chambermaid came hur
riedly down the stair exclaiming that
some one had stolen a gold watch from
no  and that nobody ought to leave
tlie house till it was found the land
lord also moved by the huiricane
w hich hud been raised made his appear
ance at the spot where harvey was in
terrupted in his exit
what on earth is ail this noic ü
bout john inquired the landluid ot
the waiter
why sir  thought it rat hi r
strange for any gentleman to leave the
house ivy the back way carrying ln 
own portmanteau and so  was making
a little breeze about it fearing he had
not paid his bill when all of a sudden
sally rushes down the stairs and sav
as how no  lias missed his glu
watch add that no one should quit tin
hotel
no  an old drylooking military
gentleman in a particularly high passion
i now showed himself on the scene utter
ing terrible threats of legal proceedings
against the house for the loss he had
sustained
harvey was stupified and indignant
yet he could hardly help smiling at the
bother what said he have  t
do with all this  have paid for every
thing  am surely entitled to go away
if i like remember that if i lose iny
passage to boston you shall answer for
it
 very much regret detaining you
sir replied the keeper of the hotel
but you hear there has been a rob
bery committed witibin the last few
minutes and as it will be proper t
search every one in the house surely
you who are on the point of departure
will have no objections to be searched
first and then be at liberty to go
there was something so perfectly
reasonable in ail this that harvey step
ped into an adjoining parlour and
threw ojen his trunk for inspection
never doubting that his innocence
i would be immediately manifest
the waiter whose mean rapacity
been the cause of the detention
cud a examiner he pulled one
article after another out ot ihe trunk
an dtt lengthhorror of horrors held
up th missing watch with ft look ol
triumph and acorn
who put that there cxea har
vey in an agony o mind which can
be better imagined than described
who has done me this grievous
wrong i know nothing as to how the
watch came into my trunk
no one answered this appeal all
present stood lor a moment in gloomy
silence
sir said the landlord to harvey
on recovering from his surprise i am
sorry for you for the sake of a mis
erable tnile you have brought ruin and
disgrace on yourself this is a matter
w hich concerns the honor ot my house
and cannot stop here however much
it is against my feelings you must go
before a magistrate j
by all means added no it with
the importance of an injured man a
pretty thing that one s watch is not sale
in a house like this
john send boots for a constable
said the landlord
harvey sat with his head leaning on
his handa deadly cold perspiration
trickled down his brow his heart
swelled and beat as if it would buist
what should he do his whole pros
pects were in an instant blighted qli
god do not desert a frail and unhappy
being give me strength to face this
new and terrible misiortune was a
prayer he internally uttered a little
revived he started to his feet and ad
dressing himself to the landlord he
said l ake me to a magistrate instant
ly and let us have this diabolical plot
unravelled i court inquiry into my
character and conduct
it is no use saying any more about
it answered the landlord here is
boots with a constable and let us all
go away together to the nearest magis
trate boots carry that trunk john
and sally you can follow us
and so the party trunk and nil un
der the constable as conducter ad
j urnfd to the house of a magistrate in
a i adjacent street there the matter
eeiued so clear a case of felonyrob
bery in a dwellinghousethat harvey
aii protestations to the contrary was
tully committed for trial at the ensuing
march assizes then but a few days dis
tant
at the period at which these inci
dents occurred i was a young man go
ing on my first circuits  had not as
yet been honored with perhaps more
than thiee or four briefs and these on
ly in cases so slightly productive of fees
teat l was compelled to study economy
in my excursions instead of taking
w my residence at the inn when visit
ing a considerable seaport where
ti court held its silting  dwelt iu
 dgmg kept by a widow lady where
ii i small expense  could enjoy per
fect quieten ss free from interruption
on the evening after my arrival on
the march cir cuit of the year  
was silting in my lodging perusing a
new work on criminal jurisprudence
when the lanjlady after tapping at the
door entered my room
i am orry to trouble you sir
said she but a lady has called to see
you about a very distressing law case
very distressing indeed and a very
strange case it is too only if you
could be so good as to see her
vho is she
all i know about it i  this she is
a mrs harvey she and her husband
and children were to sail yesterday for
boston all were aboard except the hus
band and he on leaving the large ho
tel over the way was taken up for a rob
ber word was in the evening sent by
the prisoner to his wife to come on
shore with all her children and the lug
gage and so she came back in the pi
lot boat and was in such a state ol
distress that my brother who is on the
preventive and saw her land took pity
on her and had her and her children
and things taken to a lodging on the
quay as my brother knows we have
a loudon lawyer staying here he has
advised ihe poor woman to come and
consult you about the case
well ill see what can be done
please desire the lady to step in
a lady was shortly shown in she
had been pretty and was so still but
anxiety wa pictured in her pale
countenance her dress was plain
but not inelegant and altogether she
had a neat and engaging appear
ance
be so good as to sit down said 
bowing and tell me all you would like
to stay
the poor woman burst into tears
but afterwards recovering herself she
told me pretty nearly the whole of her
history and that of her husband
lawyers have occasion to see so
much duplicity that i did not ajj at
once give my asseut to the idea of har
ey being innocent of the crime of which
he stood charged
tnere is something perfectly inex
plicable in the case i observed and
it would require sifting your husband
i hope has always borne a good char
acter
perfectly so he was no doubt un
fortunate in business but he got his
certificate on the first examination and
there are many who would testify to his
upnghines and here again my
client broke into tears as if over
whelmed with her recollections and
profleets
i k  recollect mr harvey v
shcj s di soothingly it seem
a very respectable concern and w
mu we what can be done keep uj
v at spirits ihe only fear i have aunt
tri m the fait of judge a being or
the n ich he is usually considered
tv re and if exculpatory evidence
fail your husband will run the risk ot
