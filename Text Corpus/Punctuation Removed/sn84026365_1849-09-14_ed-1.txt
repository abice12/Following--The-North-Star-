having as  liclievo fully proved in j
ik first place that god never cither
a the old or now teatanent tolcra
ted slavery as l have defined it and
secondly that he positively condemned
it shall now proceed to show that
those who are held in bondage in the
southern states of america arc the j
subjects of a cruel and oppressive
system
let me repeat my definition ot slave
rv
slavery is the condition m winch one
is  the power of another whom hr is
compelled to serve without the means oj j
redress ichcn i pronged
southern writers say that those cirj
cuinstances that are adduced as oppios
dons and cruelties in slavery aie the j
abuses of slavery but  contend
that these things are essential elements
of slavery it  have a proper underj
standing of the use of language i
should say that to abuse any thing is to j
detract from its use i e to weaken
it if i abuse my liberty and become
licentious  am losing my liberty and
becoming a slave to tny lusts if lj
abuse mv purity i am becoming im
pure to abuse my honesty is to bej
come dishonest so to abuse slavery
is to destroy slavery but is tl not so
that the more you oppress a man the
greater slave he this oppression i
therefore is not the abuse of slavery
u is the of liberty it detracts
more and more liom the mans liberty
and involves him deeper and deeper in
slavery now how comes it to pass
that the more a man is oppressed the
greater slave he is if oppression be
not an essential element ol slavery f i
take away all oppression and what
then the man may not he out ofj
bondage but lie is no longer a slave
freed from oppression be is freed from 
slavery if he remain in bondage it 
is for ids own benefit he has his
means of redress should lie suftvr
wrong and his master is hound as well
as himself he hus all tlie liberty he
wants and he remains in bondage be
cause it is for his own happiness it
would be foilv to call such a condition
slavery
the slaveholder holds ids slave by a
legal tenure he could not retain the
man in servitude if the civil law and
its administrators did not guard and
defend his claim the laws ol the
country determine the extent ol the
masters claims and limit the extent ol
the servants powers accordingly to
ihe laws therefore must we resort to
ascertain the real condition of the
servant it they give tlie servant pow
er ol prosecution and means of redress
when imposed upon by the master and
others there is no slavery in the case
k u i they do not and the master
luv ihe power to compel service in
his own way just as he might an ox or
a mule hc man is oppressed b the
very law that places him in that condi
tion
what then is the law of american
slavery the law of south carolina
tetines slavery thus
slaves phall be deemed mold
ukcn and reputed to be chattel per
sonal in the hands ol their owners
and possessors their executors ad
ministrators or assigns to all intents
oti at ructions and purposes whatso
tvfcr
goes not any one see at a glance
hat a man or woman subjected to the
o ptratious of such a law must be in
n oppressed condition the msn who
too blind to ec this is not fit to be
the north star
reasoned with here is the essential
element of slavery a cedition in
which one is in the complete and entire
possession and power of a maater jusl
like a horse or a cow vet this is the
law under which professed believers o
the bible are holding their fellow men
in bondagebut why wa this and
similar laws in other states enacted
evidently because it was found essen
tial to slavery let the law now be
repealed and another passed in these
words
slaves bhall not hereafter he
deemed sold taken and reputed to he
chattels and what then becomes of the
slaveholdersclaims hehasnone his
servant is no longer a slave nc
longer a chattel he is no longer a slave
he can not be sold what then is he
worth nothing in the market he
cannot be transmitted to heirs he is
not a chattelhe is now a inan with a
will and a purpose of his own
thus the very basis upon which
slavery is erected is a law that places
men in the condition of cattle to all
intents constructions and purposes
whatsoever can any one in the
taco of this law say slavery is not op
pressive firacious god have mercy
upon the man whose heart is so hard
that he cannot feel for a servant in
such a condition
but to make the bondman as power
less as possible he is not permitted to
give testimony or to enter a suit in
law or equity either for himself or his
wife or children why such laws if
they he not essential to slavery
these two things defining the slave
to be a chattel and debarring him
from entering a suit in law or equity
to recover damages from his master
or to secure his wife and children from
wrong and injury are allsufficient to
prove the oppressive character of slave
ry and as such laws are absolutely
indispensable to the system it follows
that oppression is its essential element
but let us draw up a catalogue ot
some of those things that some might
be pleased to call the abuses of slave
ry
 punishments of kind and degree
at the option of the master
 delegated powers to agents and
overseers who may be cruel and
hearties men
 no legal rights of property
 liability to be sold at the option
of the master
 liability to be sold for the mas
ters debts
no right of redemption
 no choice of masters
 no reedvery of damages if inj
jured cither by others or by their
masters
no power of making contracts
 subject to descend by inheritance
to persons of the most cruel and des
potic dispositions
i
from the new yorx evangeul
education of free colored
people
by w l chaplin
i cannot but hope that the period
has at length arrived m the progress
of the antislavery cause when no in 
considerable group of persons notj
heretofore very definitely identified
with the objects of the enterprise are
prepared to listen with candor to the
claims of the colored population onj
this continent and to lend heartily a
helping hand in the work of their en
lightenment and elevation
among the results from antislavery
agitation collateral to the main issue
with slaveholders one of the most pre
cious and gratifying has been its effect
upon the free colored people what
waking up what advancement among
them have we not witnessed in the last i
fifteenlast ten years to under
stand this matter fully one must have
had his eves upon the colored people
all alongj from some point of observa
tion near at hand the antislavery
movement if it has not at all times been
perfectly calm circumspect and forgiv
ing in its tone and spirit has been as
life from the dead to the young men
and women among our colored people
it has touched dormant sympathies ar
oused benumbed faculties and kindled j
up new nobler and juster aspirations j
they have demonstrated a capacity for
developement and progress which the
most skeptical cannot gainsaywhich
has often won homage from the lips i
and hearts of the least genial and hope
ful persons in the community it is in
no way an extravagant assertion to
say that he colored people of this
country are at least as susceptible of
improvement and are as likely with
fair opportunities for culture to reach
a high state of civilization as any oth 
er division of our people why not
then open the way lor m at once
speak to them words ofctioo and let
them feel the cordial grasp of a broth
ershandr
in this case ns in all others the real
improvement of the colored population
must be the result of rallying their own
energies and putting in ceaseless re
quisition their own faculties not all
the lawmaking by all the parliaments
and conquerers in the world can make
a people genuinely free unless the peo
ple themselves have within them the
seeds ot true freedom and they are
cherished among them in their habits
i of thinking and their social activities
i whatever else may be designed or
attempted for the overthrow of slavery
and the restoration of their rights to the
j entire colored population in the united
states i submit that universal free
education ought at once to be exten
ded to them by their friends so far and
fast as they can be brought within
reach of its appropriate means this
measure as it seems to mt is no less
the dictate of a wise policy than of a
wise comprehensive philanthropy the
right is of no sextrfth is of no cojjrgod is the father of fs all and all we ark brethren
whole matter shapes itself in my own
mind on this wise in the  nited
states there are in round numbers
three milions ot slaves with half a mil
lion more or less of free colored pco
pie upon the islands in the gull ol
mexico and the contiguous seas the
colored population slave and free
amount to not less than two and a hall
millionswith say seven millions in
mexico somewhat variously composed
j as to origin complexion and progress
in the arts and refinements of life yet
agreeing very nearly in outlines of
j character and in general condition and
prospects without raising any ques
lion ofeurious speculation it seems on
j ly rational to conclude that these thir
teen millions are linked to a common
destiny are to commingle and live in
contiguity on this continent at some
point most agreeable to their tastes
temperament and the natural arrange
ments of an illwise providence most
obviously those fragments of the color
jed people scattered at intervals over
the cold north have been forced by
the pressure of slavery upon them from
their natural positionthe locality con
genial with their constitution habits
and strong predilections ho that ns it
may however these thirteen millions
of people are to form communities and
i states whether temporarilly or perina
i nently distinct from their paler faced
 brethren is entirely immaterial so far
forth ns the question of duty urges it
self upon our attention they arc to
constitute a leading and controlling el
ement in these communities and states
i in spite of anything that the w ildest
projects of foreign colonization can
achieve or the wickedest theories yet
devised by the imagination of the
most frantic pcrpetualists have hated
to assume
these thirteen milions ques
tion urges itself home to the bosom of
every considerate christian man what
can he done to diffuse among them
such a fullness of intelligenceeduca
tion in so comprehensive and enlarged
a form that tyranny cannot by any
possibility sway its scepti c over them
how shall they be put upon the career
of christian civilization in its highest
idea how shall they be aroused to
a keen perception of their rights and
dignity as men and induced to seize
upon the means indispensable to their
complete vindication it may be ho
ped that our free colored people and
their brethren as fast as their fetters
are broken will be borne along by the
general current of events and imbibe
the spirit of improvement and selfculi
ture peculiar to our times i wish it
might be so if such should be the
case that fact would prove them to be
the most remarkable people the world
has ever seenmassachusetts is now
twohundred and twentynine years
old her people came to this coun
try to educate themselves and for no
other purpose they have been at that
task more or less earnestly from the
beginning and yet her wisest citizens
have but lately conceived the idea of a
true education as applied to the massj
es ofthe community
let the drop generalities and descend
to a particular or two and that shall
end what i have to say at present in
some ofthe slave states the free col
ored people are accessible to school
arrangements they can be legally
taught the alphabet and multiplica
tion tables are not objects of such pe
culiar jealousy and alarm to society j
as to demand the restraint and terror of
legislative penalties with this small
measure of indulgence in this respect i
the colored people are yet under great
disabilities and embarrassments as
sistance and cocperation in the estab
lishment of schools among them entire
ly free for the poorest would become
a source of encouragement hope and
progress such as words cannot easily
describe for instance in washing
ton are say five thousand free colored
people they have acquired a con
siderable amount of property in the
gross and are taxed for every dollar of
it for the support of white schools
while not a single dime is in any way
contributed by the white pupils tow ards
the education and training of the col
ored children there is among the
colored people here a commendable
desire to reap the advantages of educa
tion a number bf subscriptionschools
are sustained by them a few of the
teachers are worthy of all praise for
their exertions in the cause to which
they are ie voted yet the number of
scholars actually in the schools is ex
ceedingly small in proportion to the en
tire colored population it will be
long  fear before education in the
most humble and meagre form w ill be
come general among tnc people with
out impulse and aid from abroad
three to four hundred children upon
an average are all that are found in
attendance upon the eight or ten
schools
can seven to ten thousand dollars
be appropriated in any way more likely
to bu effective for good in the cause ol
freedom than by placing in this city a
free school on the best model as yet
known to be open to all the colored
families and other families that choose
to avail themselves of its bene tits
well then why should not the friends
ofthe antislavery cause undertake it
to what object can our sympathies
and money be morb fitly appropriated
than in wisely directing attempts to ed
ucate the entire colored population in
the united states and on this conti
nent so far and fast as it is accessible i
i give this people who are already free
educationteach them to know them
selves physically intellectually in
their moral relations and the balance
ol their brethren would not long remain
slaves chattledom would soon be
stripped of its victims the tyranti
rochester n y friday september  
occupation would be gone the death
and burial of the slave system would
not be postponed for the enactment ol
wilmotprovisus or the rattime of
ballotboxes we should goon rejoice
over a vast people all equal in the eye
of the law all protected in their rights
by the noiseless action af a beneficent
government
as to possible anti probable objec
tions that may he raisedin any number
as to plans of action i have nothing to
say in this connection let the enter

dress you on an important subject one
of momentous interest to all of us
mirpnlitirians areabout topiecipitate
us into evils from which nge will not
recover the country
every effort is being made by them
to perpetuate a system which has al
ready nearly ruined us and in which
if they succeed they will forever blast
the hope of elevation and prosperity to
the mass of our population fnder
the name of southern kights they are
demanding the extension and perpetua
tion of a system of policy runious to
our own state and disastrous to our
personal interests a lew among us
having wealth having political power
having the monopoly of the govern
ment of the state are determined to
secure their own interests and per
petuate their own power and therefore
they arc resolved to rend the union of
these states rather than not preserve
their own supremacy knowing they
caunot succeed by a true representa
tion ofdheir own position they are
crafty enough to present themselves as
the standardbearers of southern inter
ests whilst in truth they only represent
a small fraction of the south they
cunningly declaim in favor of state
rights whilst they know they arc them
selves despisers of the people and are
trampling under foot the true sovereign
ty of the state
fellow citizens before wc suffer
ourselves to he hurried into the
schemes of mad politicians it be
hoves us to enquire what true
condition of our state and whether or
not it will be to the interest of the
mass of the people to follow these men
in their wild purposes to dissolve this
union rather than not perpetuate their
own power
this state is said to have a repub
lican form of government it may be
the form but the substance is wanting
by a republic we understand a state
where the interests of all the citizens
are cared for and their rights protec
ted is this the condition of the citi
zens of south carolina i speak now
of those who are recognized as citi
zens not the whole but only the white
populationare these in the full en
joyment of the rights of citizens do
all stand on one political platform is
the government alike regardful of the
interest of all or is it not rather the
case that the great mass of the peo
ple are virtually disfranchised their
interest utterly disregarded and their
voice not heard in the councils of the
state let facts determine this in

it will be seen that the constitution

thus
hites sen rep
eleven districts   
eighteen districts   
here we see that less than one
 third of the free population have th
j supreme control ot the state and tho
j occupy that portion of the state for th
most part where the rice and loogsta
pie cotton interests chiefly prevail bui
it is worse than this as the columo o
senators will show the six distncti
of georgetown beaufort harlestown
colleton sumter and oraogeburg girt
a majority in the senate nothing there
fore can become law if these six dis
tricts embracing a population of onlj
 whitej combine it
tunt is those districts embracing about
onefifth of the whole population of the
state can veto any demand which the
great majority of the people may deem
it their interest to make
the thirteen districts last in order in
the abova table comprehend the majori
ty of the white population of the whole
state but wl a is their strength in
the legislature they have only twelve
senators the tw o districts of charles
ton and colleton with less than
white population can outvote them in
the senate
and why does this inequality exist
for no other purpose than to guard and
secure the interests of the large rice
and cotton planters the interests of
men who have to work w ith their own
hands are entirely unprotected the
upper districts may go to ruin the
rice and cotton plantations of the lower
country are amply protected
but to guard these interest mark how
everything in the political machinery
is adapted exactly to suit the purpose
a proper qualification is required for
a scat in the legislature keal estate
of the value of about seven hundred
dollars clear of debt or live hundred
acres of land and ten negroes must be
actually possessed in a candidate for
the house of representatives or he is
ineligible to a seat to be a senator
requires double the amount of real es
tate he may he a thrifty farmer an
excellent mechanic an enterprising
merchant a skillful physician or an
aide lawyers and withal a suitable
man to represent the true interests of
the people but it is all in vain if he
have not in real estate the amount re
quired
will any thing ever be done by such
a legislature for the interest of the
peoplenever unless it be to the
special interest of the favored few to
allow it blit over no department of
the government can the majority have
control the governor must heve 
 at least in settled estate and to
make it certain that he shall be from
the planting rather than the farming
interest the people are nut allowed a
vote in the case he is appointed by the
legislature
the appointment of the judiciary
from the judge on the supreme bench
to the common justice of the peace is
entirely by the legislature
senators in congress arc appointed
by the legislature the legislature
lays off the state into congressional
districts from which the people as
guarantied to them by the united
states constitution may elect the rep
resentatives in congress and mark
how they arrange it to suit the strong
planting interest to the low district
with a white population of  ft
they allow four congressional represen
tatives and to the upper district with a
white population of lifttill only
three
nor are the people permitted to vote
for the electors of the president and
vice president of the united states
evidently from an apprehension that
they might cast the vote f the state
for a president who will promote the
welfare oi the people instead of the
interests of the wealthy planters
thus is the interest of the large rice
and cotton planters fully guarded in
every department of the government
and to have it doubly secure the con
stitution cannot he amended unless
this monopolized and monopolizing leg
islature lirst recommend it by a vote of
two thirds of both branches of the
whole representation and not even
then unless the succeeding legislature
also concured by a vote of two thirds of
both houses
and what is the consequence of all 
this despotism as a matter of course
the white population are emigrating j
although there are fourteen millions
of acres ot land in the state yet un
cultivated what can the poor man
do here he can make nothing to lay
up for his family he cannot get his
children educated he and his family
are doomed to poverty and ignorance
and to the contempt of the favored aris
tocrat here or there one of pecu
culiar tact or extraordinary talent may
obtain an independent property but for
the most part there is no hope here for
the citizen in moderate circumstances
and yet our socalled statesmen and
their partizans are moving heavpn and
earth to prevent the poor man offaro
lina crushed down a he is by this ter
rible slave power from finding a spot
in all the vast territory lately acquired
by the u states where lie can have
the full reward of his free labor nay
new mexico california and any other
genial clime must be under the domin
ion of this mancrushing powfy or the
disunion of these states must be threat
ened and the great body native
carolinians themselves can have no
voice in their own legislature to rebuke
this arrogant demand
and what is the remedy for those who
cannot leave the state or who wish to
remain by the graves of their fathers
they have no power to amend the con
stitution for this guaranties every
thing to the privileged class and they
alone have the power to alter it shall
the sword be resorted to and thereby
effect a revolution united states
soldiers will crush the first attempt at
violence and is there no remedy
no means of redress i think there
may be if we can only arouse the peo
ple to demand their rights shall up
wards of two hundred thousand white
citizens of carolina be virtualty dis
franchised whilst mocked with the idea
of free suffrage and lie still under the
iron despotism that crushes them

i a most interesting group presented
itself betbre us two young female
slavesboth with most pleasing counten
ances stood togather closely embra

the neck of the other their attitude as
well as the strong likeness between
them pointed them out as sisters by
their side was an african slave dealer
in whose furious countenance it cem
cd impossible to discern a trace of hu
man feeling he was armed with a
large heavy stick vvitl which he
drove them to and fro literally like a
herd of animals three or four turks
were discussing with tolerable animui
tion the price of one of the women
but the bargain had been struck justj
before vve came hi arid one of the par
ty a stout good looking man paying
down the money when this was
completed with an impel ions move
ment of his hand lie motioned to his
newly purchased slave to follow him
it was the youngest and most timid ofj
the two sisters whom lie had selected
nothing could lie more painful than to
watch the intense the terrified anxiety
with which both had followed the pro
gress of the sale and now it was con
cliyled and they knew that the moment j
of separation was arrived she whosei
late had been sealed disengaged her
self and turning round placed a tirm
grasp and gazed into her eyes not
words nor tears could have expressed j
onehalf of the mute unutterable des
pair that dwelt in that long heartren
ding gaze it was hard to say which
was the most eloquent of misery hut
the turk was impatient he clapped
his hands together this was the well
known signal a igbt tremor shook
the frame of the young slave her
arms fell powerless at her side and
she turned to follow her master the
voiceless but agonizing farewell was
over in another moment we could
distinguish her slender figure thread
ing its way through ibc crowd in corn
panv with other slaves belonging to the
turk ller sister bad bid hersclt be

the ground her head sunk upon her
folded arms

john c calhoun henry clay the amen
can colonization society and the entire pro

the chairman called attention to the report
remarking that the present crisis was as im
portant to them as any this ride of eternity it
being none other than the cause of truth and
right against prejudice and expediency
wm c nell r in behalf of the committee
submitted the following resolutions
whereas in all great and important under
taking it has ever been necessary to adopt
systematic efforts for their promotion as seen
in our saviors example in the appointment
of twelve efficent men to root up old evil cus
toms and establish upon their ruins a better
and more healthy state of things there
fore
resolved that we do hereby apppoint
twelve men m whom can be placed implicit
confidence to superintend our school right
matters and to pursue the same to the extent
of their abilitieapledging ourselves to meet
the contingent expenses thereof
resolved that the recent attempt to de
fame iljc fan reputauon of mr ambrose
wellington by a certain clique in raising the
cry ot infidelity against him is alike inhu
man unchristian and dastardly in design and
that while under unjust persecution we ten
der him the hand of sympathy
resolved that we again renew our pledge
to each other never to countenance fur one
moment an exclusive school and that although
we have often so decided we are not wearv
in our efforts in so just a cause
resolved that in our present etrupglefor
equal school privileges we shall not be frown
ed down by the active opposition of the ene
mies of human piogress nor shall our zeal
be in any degree abated by the insidious e
forta of those identified w ith us in complexion
but who alas to their shame be it recorded
are reverting by their animus the hand upon
the dialplate ol our imerties
resolved that sustained as we are by the
opinions of those eminent in legal authority
viz hon justices richard fletcher and
charles h warrenencoutageed by the
precedent in oilier citizens of ihe old bay
iate where proscription tor complexions
sake is now unknownjustified in out course
by an enlightened public opinion we will not
be satisfied wiili any equivalent for our rights
but slia  god helping us contend for victory
like men who know their rights and know
ing dare maintain
resolved that believing as we do that
special legislation regulated uy complexion
or any physical ditlerences is antirepubli
ean and antichristian we shall ever be found
using our best exertions for the supremacy of
equal rights
resolved  hat duly appreciating uie mer
its and dements of the arguments pro and con
relative to our rights as published in the
newspapers of ihe day and knowing as wc
do the sources whence they mainly emanate
we feel called upon here to assert that if
there was ever a cause in which a majority of
the people were united and prepared tor an
advanced position that cause is an equality ot
school previliges in boston and we colored
citizens arc that people
resolved that all articles that have
appealed in the public journals in opposition
to our cause arc the sure and ceitain agents
of the prejudice against the welfare of the ri
sing generation
kematks were made in support of the above
resolutions by several gentlemen and heartily
concurred in by the meeting the whole se

slavery ac in california
the alto california of july id publishes
ionie inteifsting paiticulars respecting the
now inhabitants of california and discusses
several points which it is will be
acted upon by the convention which was ex
pected to assemble in that country the alto
california gives its views ol what ought to be
held essential in ihe structure of a eonstitie
tion as under
the prohibition of slavery
the refunding by the united states of the
duties collected in california since the peace
to be made a general fund for the support oi
a state government
the limitation of the amount ol expendi
ture to be made in any one year for internal
and other improvements
the basis for the establishment of banking
or other incorporations
the prohibition of imprisonment lor debt
the rights of married women to iheir indi
vidual property acquired before or after mar
riage
the right of universal suffrage
the estab ishment of a branch united
states mint in california the net proceeds of
which should ho devoted to the suppmt of a
state gorernment
the writer goes on further to give his
views on the all absotbmg question of slavery
every person appears to be convinced that
the slavery question under the complexion
that it now wears in the atlantic states de
feated she numerous attempts made in the
last congress to give to california a territo
rial organization and all men ought to be as
firmly assured that unless the citizens of
california settle that question lor themselves
and do so at once it will prevent defeat or
at lean protract for years to come the estab
lishment of any government in the country
independent of ilie moral considerations w hich
weigh so heavily in the balance against slave
ry and which we have neither time nor
room to repeat as a matter of expediencyas
a means of giving to this country a govern
inentit ia necessary that the people should
insert in their constitution a clause forbid
ding the introduction ot negro or other slave
ry the highest noblest dictates of humanity
demand it the progressive doctrines of re
publicanism cannot be maintained without it
and the interests of the mass the people
those who dig and delve and earn their bread
and learn sellrespect and enterprise from the
necessities of labor render it imperative
there must be no slurring over or avoiding
the question the south have contended
that it is a question which should be left to
the citizens of each suite to decide and they
cannot complain if wc decide against it
whilst the north have asaeited that it was a
principle with them which they arc bound in
maintain it any and all hazards and that
therefore they can never consent to the exten
sion of tltvery into california true the
men who are the most vociferous are probably
the least sincere but the political character
of the question has become such that the
great controlling mass of the north would
undoubtedly agree with and sustain their rep
resentatives
we do not fear to assert ihen that a state
constitution for california which does not
contain a provision against slavery will never
he allowed to go into effect by the congress
of tbe l aited sttr nd ill m

froos the same journal will id in forming

fence
from the beat id formation in our powwioo
we are of opinion that up to this time th
lune there hare probably armed in this
ountry since the lat of january last about
 of tbeae about  are americana
 mexicans  chilians and tbe re
maining  from nearly eery country it
will thus be men that a preponderance of the
emigration thus far is foreign
the number of inhabitants in tbe country
on the first of january last waa probably not
far from  excluaire of indiana of
this number  were californians 
americansand  foreigner of many na
tions this would give then the character
of the present population as follows
americans  
californians 
mexicans 
chilians 
all other nations

by the last account from the atlantic
states there were about  emigrants
for this country by sea some  of this
number hare already reached here and the
others will probably arrive by the end of oc
tober in addition to this there will pro
bably be an emigration of  by land
which will reach here about the same time
and it we set down the number which will
come vis panama and mexico at the moderate
computation of  we shall have a total
of americans in california at that time of
thirtyfire thousand
if we add to the above figures the probable
number of emigrants which will reach this
country from europe and all other countries
by the last of october we shall then find the
total statement something like this
americans 
californians 
all other nations 
total 
of the thirty thousand already in the coun
try it is supposed that onehalf including wo
men and children are engaged in the various
business pursuits and the other half are en
gaged in digging we apprehend this will
not be found far from carrect

rochester september  
antislavery meetings at west wal
worth marion palmyra victor and
east bloomfield
it seetm necessary that  should report the
character of my antislavery meeting al
though very little can be said of them thi is
either new or peculiar the one held at
west walworth on tuesday evening last
was well attended by an audience that mani
fested a lively interest in the subject of sla
very as presented in the lecture at the
close of the meeting  disposed of a number
of copies of the narrative of my experi
ence in bondage and obtained one subscriber
to the north star i may state here
that there are already ten copies of the star
in circulation in this place
 found as usual the slaves inends wil
liam g barker and hicks halstead and
families ready to receive and cheer ine on
ward in the good work
on wednesday i held two meetings in
the presbyterian churchone in the after
noon the other in the evening the former
was well attended and the latter was throng
eda great many being compelled to stand
during the meeting my frienjß samuel
smith though quite feeble in health had
exerted himself to circulate the notice and 
am indebted to him for rquch of the interest
created on this occasion he is what  would
call a working abolitionistmaking the ad
vancement of the cause one of the constant
duties of his life it is always heartcheering
to meet a man who labors disinterestedly and
earnestly in a cause so unpopular as that of
abolition
i had the pleasure of meeting in marion
that longtried and faithful ftiend of the slave
griffith m cooper he came over to
attend the meeting and in the spirit of true
abolitionism brought not only his family but
 some ot his neighbors to help to swell the
numbers and to enliven the zeal of his fellow
i workers friend cooper exercised on this
occasion his right of free speech and his re
marks were listened to with attention and
respect by the audience besides my own
address in the evening mr wade a baptist
i minister from williamson entertained the
audience with a highly interesting narrative
lof his own expetience while traveling in
kentucky in which he illustrated the fiendish
spirit and murderous cruelty that slaveholders
usually manifest towards a man suspected of
sympathy for the poor slave in one or two
instances his own life was put in jeopardy on
account of the mere suspicion that e was an
abolitionist while in frankfort he had the
temerity to visit that martyr for freedom
calvin fairbanks this simple fact was
sufficient to shr up against him the fury of a
uiob consisting of many hundreds fiom which
he barely escaped with his life i hope that
friend wade will often be induced to attend
antislavery meetings and thus relate his ex
perience others may tell the honors ol
slavery as experienced by the black man but
it is advantageous to know its cruelties as
they aie sometimes felt by the white man
mr wade has it in his power to render the
cause of freedom in this legion essential ser
vice by giving lectures on the subject of
slavery and  earnestly hope he may find it
convenient to do so
on thursday evening  delivered a lecture
hi the baptist church in palmyra on ac
count of another very popular meeting being
held at the same time and tbe unpopularity
of the anuslavery cause in that place the
meeting was but thinly attended however
such as were present seemed to be quite at
tentive to and interested in what was presented
to them
on friday evening agreeably to public
notice a large meeting was convened in tbe
fniversalist church of victor it was one
of the most satisfactory antislavery demon
strauons which i ever atteoded in that pises
i thera appeared to be s greater willingness to
listen to tadteal antiala very sentiment than i
usually find in the country towns of this
region
on saturday the ladies of the western
new york antislavery society held fait
in the hall of mr picks hotel in victor the
gross receipts of which amounted to more
than fifty dollars
i mart end this bn f report with ikoit
account of ray meeting in east bloomneu on
sunday in consequence of a mistake is the
advertisement tn the north star there had
been no general notice of the meeting given
by the friend in the village before my arrival
and then there was but time for a very limited
one the meeting was large the spacious
vestry of the presbyterian church m which it
was held was crowded to overflowing and
my address was listened to with the beet at
tention
the new york observer containing
an artide in reference to the approaching
meeting of the american board of commis
sioners for foreign missions furnished me
with a text for my discourse on this occasion
this artide is in keeping with the spirit of all
that emanates from the brains of the rev
sidney e morse on the subject of slavery
cold obdurate jesuitical and aboundiog in
hypocrisy he writes as he says under an
apprehension that an attempt mil be made at
this meeting to obtain some action of the board
fat or able to the views of the religions antisla
very party and he adds as tf in solemn
warning if the board yielding to the
storm of nltraism which ts now raging with
such violence in some of the religious bodies in
england and america shall leave the firm
upright consistent and tndy christian posi
tion it has hitherto maintained it mil be
regarded by many of our best men as the pre
cursor of the direst cals to our country and to
the cause of evangelical religion here then
is the influence brought to bear upon the ap
proaching meeting of the board look at it
 w ould call the particular attention of british
christians to the statement first an attempt
is apprehended that  some action of the board
will be had favorable to the views of the reli
gious antislavery party what is the char
acter of these views that their adoption by
this board should lead to such disastrous and
dire consequences  they are if i understand
them simply these that the board shall
no longer send out men stealers as missiona
ries of the pure gospel of christ that slave
holders and polygamists shall no longer be
fellowshipped and esteemed as christians in
the mission churches established by the board
and that the board shall no longer lend the
sanction of its great name to the countenance
and support of the deadly sin of american
i slavery but that it shall exerfciae its mighty
influence on the side of the righteous cause ofi
immediate emancipation
herein consists the utraism which the
rpv sidney e morse professes to dread so
deeply he appears to have no wish to have
either the church or the world purified from
the foul stain and curse which now rest so
heavily upon both and which especially inflict
so deep a wound upon the cause of christi
anity in our own country making it a bye
i word in the mouth of infidelity jt is to sid
ney e morse and to such men as him that

the infidel is indebted for the most powerful
weapons he wields against the cause of reli
gion while it can be said with truth that
under the cloak of religion may be found the
most cruel systems of wickedness and that
the professed ministers of the gospel are
exerting their ingenuity to defend and protect
from exposure and rebuke the guilty perpetra
tors of crime it is impossible that any high
respect can be cherished by the thinking por
tion of the community for such a religion and
such a ministry the rev sidney e morse
affirms that neither christ nor his apostles
require the slaveholder to emancipate his
slaves and he denies that the church or the
ministry have any direct duty to petform to
j wards the abolition of slavery according to
him the moment a sin obtains ihe sanction of
human law it is at once beyond the legitimate
action ofthe church and ministry of christ
now it cannot be necessary for me to expose
the sophistry by which this damning heresy is
sustained upon the very face of it when
nakedly stated it carries its own confutation
to every honest mind this it is that makes
christianity appear to pander to all the popu
ur forms of human villany instead of puri
j fying the states it leaves the latter to decide
sj what sins shall be denounced and what ones
l shall be defended from the christian pulpit
how unutterably low and degrading to the
character of the church is this position in
i stead of being the hope of the world she thus
becomes the receptacle and cage of every
i abomination which the state may commit to
i her rare but  have no time to dwell further
l on this subject the article in question is but
i another proof of the truth of the oftrepeated
charge that the american church and clergy
i ate the deadliest enemies to the cause of
i emancipation and that they form the most
i powerful bulwark around the foul system of
f american slaveryr d
a few weeks since we published an ac
couut which we met going the round of the
press of a disgraceful election row in
which the publisher of the louisville exam
iner was said to be engaged the following
explanation from that paper places the mat
ter in rather a different light eveu this
which may be understood to be the truth
does not entirely excuse as nothing can ex
cuse a resort to the cowardly practice of the
chivalry whocary firearms and other murder
ous weapons of otfence and defence but it
in some sort explains llie circumstances so as
to make it evident that this was not the usual
course of the person referred to mr sey
mour in our humble judgment had no right
to be in such bad company if respectable
men will use and strive to make otbers use
the ballutbox and the majoritypower either
with or in opposition to such scoundrels as
means and the fighting men and the
slavebofdmg slavebreeding slavewhipping
sons of infamy in kentucky and the other
slave states of this union they must even
endure the consequences but it will be no
matter of surprise to learn that they have got
either shot or kicked to death by a vulgar
and ignorant mob whose highest knowledge is
the use of the bowie knifewhose onlv con
clusive argument is brute force s d
affray ia the tim ward
most of oar readers know that an affray oc
curred in the first wardduring the late elec
tron in our city in which mr seymour the
publisher of the examiner was attacked
anda mr means was shot by mr s we
expected the matter to undergo a jodieai
investigation and determined to aay nothing
on lb subject until after the investigation
should have been placed in proper light fiat
as erroneous accounts of the affair have got
abroad we will aay a w ord or two on the sub
ject
the editors of this paper ate utterly op
pofd to the earn ing of anna hjr private ciu
m and they would hate attempted to dis
suade mr sfrooi doing i if thev
y knowledge of the matter but we coaid
have employed nothing hut advice he is a
free agent and would hare taken his own
course we have made this statement that
oar own position msv be known now s
word or two in regard t the affray
it has been stated that mr seymour went
to the polls cursing and swearing that
he called some one d d son of a b b
die now there is not one man in a thou
sand ui the citv of ixmiisville who believes
such a statement certainly no one believes it
who has any acquaintance with mr s oe
have never heard bun use anything approach
ing to profane language during onr acquain
tance with him and the most delicate lady in
louisville is not more fastidioas in avoiding
vulgar language than be ts on the first day
of the election be saw several persons beaten
for voting according to their sentiments af
ter s particular instance of the kind he re
marked that it was a shame that in a republtj
can government men should be so abused for
exercising their rights his language it
seems was reported to some of the fighting
menln the evening a triend of mr s
who we believe is a proslavery roan told
him that he was in danger of getting a beat
ing mr s mentioned the matter at his
boardinghouse and a friend told him as be
was going out after dark he had better take
a pistol which the gentleman offered to lend
him this explains the fact that mr s had
a pistol he is not in the habit of carrying
weapons
the next morning he again went to the
first ward the weather was very warm
and mr s to relieve himself raised his hat
which was full of tickets some of the tick
ets fell to the ground and while mr s was
stooping to pick them up he wss struck by
mr means an athletic man mr s at
tempted totnake his escape from the crowd
means and several others pursued him and
while runningmr s turned partly round and
fired at means who was nearest to him both
fell a j ballard esq ihen fired at a
man who was beating mr s as he was ly
ing on the ground this probably saved mr
seymours life the man who was shot at
turned from mr s to fire at mr b anoth
er gentlemen also fired a pistol during the
affiay a littlle boy was shot all the parties
are now recovering mr s was badly
bruised having been severely kicked in the
face and head gentlemen of unimpeachable
veracity who witnessed the whole affairhave
told us that mr seymour had not said a wotd
to mr means when he was knocked down
they expect to make the statement in the
court
colonization sailing of the liberia
packet
the twinsister of slavery is still at her
post fostering prejudice against the colored
roan and scattering abroad her hateful un
pluloaophical and unchristian dogmas about
th inferiority of the negro and the necessity
of his expatriation both for his own well
being and that of his white fellow countiymen
it is gratifying to find that this movement in
stead of growing moie popular is every day
sinking lower and lower in public estimation
the white american has to learn and will
learn this lessonthat the color of a mans
skin is no sign of either mental or moral deg
radation facts beyond dispute are constantly
occuiring which prove the negro when cir
cumstances and education favor him to be as
capable of brave and manly deeds as his white
despisers they may affect to doubt to dis
believe this let them they may continue
to despise and insult the colored man let
them they may hope by stopping their
ears against all testimony to keep up in their
own minds the longcherished delusion let
them hut only the more sudden and complete
will be their surprise and discomfiture when
they awake to right reason and find them
selves lagging far in the rear of society in
company with the low and the vicious they
may as well learn this now as hereafter it
would be better that they should learn it now
better for themselvesbetter for those whom
they injure and insult it is a settled fact
that colored men will form a large proportion
of the inhabitants of this country for good
or for evil or as a matter of indifference just
as men choose to consider it this must be if
white americans cannot bring themselves to
the rational and chi tain conclusion that the
color of a mins si au or the shape of his
nose or the form of his eyes does not afford
a quite infallible rule as to the morality of his
character or the force of his intellect then
doubtless it will be for evil to them inasmuch
as they will constantly make themselves and
those around them miserable by their absutd
prejudices but if they learn to consider all
men alike all created equalall the
children of one common parent all human
beingsall immortal beingsthe life and
 happiness of every oneblack white brown
or any other shade of colorequally impor
tant and worthy of consideration so far aahe
is himself concerned with the hope and hap
piness of every other onehow little difficulty
will there be in the way of removing all doubts
and clearing up all differences
we want colored men when colonization
ists press upon them the propriety of emigra
ting to liberia or any where else to give
them this simple and decided answer we
will not go americans under the guidance
of irrehgion and selfishness have well nigh
exterminated the indian aborigines of this
continent they would long ere this have
done the same if they could with the negro
had they not found that he could be converted
into a beast of burden to do their bidding
and perform tleir labor he will not do this
long he is learning to respect himself and
l to know that he is entitled to a higher position
 than that of dogs and cattle it has been and
is exceedingly difficult for him to attain to
even this limited measure ot intelligence the
i tree of the knowledge of good at least if
not of evil has been guarded against his ap
proach by more vigilant and jealous watchers
than even the cherubim with flaming sword
who kept off intruders from the gates of
paradise all the possible sources from
which he might gather information are poi
soned or closed against him in ordar that be
either should not know at all or that hia
knowledge should be very imperfect but
this state of things cannot must not continue
humanity protests against it christianity is
loud in her denunciations of those who rob
the laborer of his hire god himself who
impartially justwho is oo respecter of
persons cannot behold without abhorrence
oeh s flagrant violation of that law of right by
which be wills the world to be governed we
rejoice in the anticipation that slavery will be
rooted oat of this continent we are as cer
tain of it as we art that the son will continue
to shine every paper that is printedevery
medium of conveyiog intelligence that is put
in operation is helping on this result
and the negro when liberated will not go
to liberia this is his native lend he if
any on bu a right to the soil of this couti
nea t far many long aad tedious years baa
be cultivated it with the labor of his hands
aad watered it with his tears he will re
main on this continent there is abundance
of space for him her there are still in
this wide domain thousands of acres on which
the foot of man has never trod why then
should he seek a new home in a fardistant
continent t this matter may be looked upon
as decided and it would be well for the
ruling and power possessing majority of this
country to begin at once to shape their
course accordingly delay only increases the
difficulty it is well for every country tka t
its citizens should be intelligent then let
the colored man receive such an education as
will tend to make him intelligent and by be
coming intelligent he will become useful
it is well for every countiy that its citizens
should be virtuous then let the colored man 
receive an education calculated to draw out
his moral nature and what has been consid
ered a curse will be converted intc a blessing
this opinion is rapidly gaining ground we
have much pleasure in copying on the outside
of this weeks paper an article by w l
chaplin which affords satisfactory evidence
of this no colonization humbug can ever
drive back the flowing tide of liberal popular
sentiment to where it waa only a few years
ago or to where it was last year even col
ored men themselves have also learned some
thing in the course of that time and they will
continne to learn last year the colonization
society boasted as if they had done a migh
ty deed because they had managed to ez
patnate four hundred and some odd peisons
under the name of emigrants to the liberian
colony this year we doubt whether they
w ill be able to effect even that small amount
of mischief we do not wish to be under
stood to say that colored men may not go to
liberia we aay they may go if ihey are
s minded just as white men go so we say
they may go to california or to nova zembla
hot they ought also to be allowed as white
men are to consult their own interest and stay
at home if they happen to have formed an
opinion that neither liberia california nor
the north pole is precisely the place best
suited to their tastes and constitutions it is
right that every one should go where he
thinks lit but it is wrong that he should be
subjected to any undue influence in the forma
tion of his opinion the weight of prejudice
presses heavily upon the colored man let
him battle withnot yield to it jle may
have and doubtless oftentimes has doubts
whether it would not be better for him could
he find his way to a country where he would
be recognized as an equal man in such a
mood of mind he is the ready prey of the col
i onizationisis let him banish forever all such
i thoughts and resolve to struggle on manfully
in this land for the full possession of his
 rights it is a republican theory that all
i men are created equal republicans in
this country must therefore either prove that
colored men in many cases their own offspring
 are not men or they must violate and deny
the first principles of their boasted republican
ism eiiher dilemma would not be very flat
tering to their selflove it is probable that
when they are forced into this corner they
will rather try to avoid the inference that they
beget monkeys then the conclusion is in
evitable that these men are entitled with
themselves to the tights and privileges of all
other men
but we have wandered somewhat from the
object which we had in view we have be
i fore us a number of the colonization journal
j from which we learn that the liberia packet
which sailed on the ist of august took out
six cabin and twentyone steerage passengers
we trust that the next effort at expatriation
will not be any more successful the entire
scheme has been frequently shown to be a gross
deception it has lost nothingof its fraudu
lent character liberia is probably a very
respectable place we have no desire to
stigmatise the colony it is mayhap as good
or a little better location for those who have
become in some measure accustomed to civil
ized life than the banks of the gaboon river
or the kingdom of dahomey all that we
affirm is that it is not expedient for ameri
cans to emigrate thither there are many
circumstances in liberia which cannot fail to
exert a very injurious influence at least for a
time upon the settlers in that country they
are surrounded on all hands by hordes of the
most ignorant and degraded savages are the
majority of the slaves sufficiently intelligent
and have they received a moral education
that will enable them to resist and to over
come that tide of barbarism  who can help
having some misgivings on this point  we
are more anxious for the welfare of the color
ed american than we are for the success of
the colony at liberia and with alt the disad
vantages under which he at present suffers in
this land we fee persuaded that he is better
here therefore we say again that it is not
for his advantage to go to liberia and those
who advise him to go thither under the pre
tence of friendship are his worst and most
deadly enemies giving themselves up to the
guidance of low and vulgar prejudice they
entirely forget to recognise the demands of
justice mistaking their own inferior na
tures for the common standard of humanity
they judge that all the inhabitants of this
country except a score or two of fanatics are
influenced by the same motives and actuated
by the same unchristian principles as them
selves may they and that speedily discover
their mistake and learn that there is a higher
morality than any they have yet dreamed of
which is summed up by an old writer thns
do justly lovt mercy and walk humbly with
thy god j o

letter aad fewpeper postage
we have received a circular from joshua
leavitt secretary of the boston cheap
postage association it is addressed particu
larly to the publishers of newspapers but the
object which it has in view is equally interest 
ing to all classes of a reading community
every one is interested in ihe subject of
cheap postage the idea of raising a reve
nue out of the transmission of intelligence
must be entirely abandoned all that the
administration should ever dream of from
this source is the mere return ol the required
outlay that this object can be gained at a
much lower rate of postage than that now
charged in the free states has been demon
atra ed time and again beyond a shadow of
doubt of the slave states the same cannot
be asserted without hesitation we rather
apprehend that even at the present rates
they do not meet their own expenses but
they never will so long as they are slave
states there cannot be much ot cither
reading or writing where for a large propor
tion of the population the possession of
knowledge is a crime this is one of the
items of subsidy which freedom by the
union of the northern with the southern
states is compelled to pay to slavery
the immediate cause says the circular
of the failure to pass a bill for chep pos
tage was a division among the friends of
postage reform to send newspapers postage
free it will be recollected that in the
house last year mr ashrnun offered an
amendment to a bill abolishing the franking
privilege the provisions of which amendment
were intended to bring the rates of postage n
i this country very nearly to a level with those
of britain namely a uniform rate of two cents
on all letters weighing not more than half an
ounce more than half an ounce and not
more than one ounce four cents c this
measure of reform its projectors w ere encour
aged to hope by the successful example of
britain would be earned out to the great
advantage of the public and without any loss
to the revenue but it failed by two votes
solely as the circular states because it did
not embrace the newspaper provision it
seems that under the present regulations as
appears from majoi ilobbies letter of last
december onethird of the expense of news
paper postage is a charge to the department
now r it is very evident that the expense ol
transmission of newspapers must be paid by
the public in some way we are no friends
to indirect taxation and we imagine that tin 
majority of our readers are equally with our
selves convinced that the postage and every
other department should meet its own ex
penses if we cannot at present have news
papers carried free of expense and at the
same time have a cheap letter postage
though we are fully persuaded that a little
experience of the cheap letter system will
show the practicability of this also then let
us have what is next best namely an imme
diate trial of a low postage on both letters and
newspapers the proposed plan by the
cheap postage association is given below
the reasonableness of this proposal will be
allowed on all hands
 that the uniform rate of postage on
newspapers should be one cent paid in ad
vance i e we suppose at the office
where they are taken and not at the otlice
from where they are sent
 all regular subscribers tube allowed to
pay their postage quarterly in advance
otherwise the postage to he doubled or the
publisher notified to stop the paper
 ah papers not sent to regular subscri
bers to be paid in advance at tbe office where
they are mailedexcept the usual free ex
change papers which will be continued of
course
 publishers prohibited from including oc
casional papers in the bundles sent to subscri
beis
 to facilitate the prepayment ot postage
on occasional papers let the postoffice fur
nish stamped strips or wrappers for one cent
each to be used in all cases except of papers
sent to subscribers these to be kept for
sale at every postoffice
 it would probably be for the interest of
the department to sell these newspaper stamps
in quantities of  or more at a liberal re
duction of onefourth or even onehalfthe
increase of business more than compensating
for the discount
but at all hazards we are in favor of
cheap postage and hope that this year this
much needed reform will be carried to a suc
cessful issue for our own part we have no
vote nor anything to say in the matter but
if we had and fell disposed to use it we
should be very much aided in deciding that a
candidate was deserving of our suffrages il
we found him willing to aid in every measure
which had for its object the promotion of tbe
education and brotherly feeling of the people
cheap postage is one such measure if the
sums that are expended yeaily in war or pre
paration for war against a foreign enemy
were expended in waring against that interna
foe of this as of all other nationslgnoiance
whether by transmitting intelligence free o
charge or in some other way how much
more rational would it be and how infinitely

mercially the present is a season of prospe
rity in england the price of wheat and
other first necessaries of life has for some
months been moderate and a plentiful harvest
it now being gathered in which promise the
continuance of ihe same satisfactoiy state ot
the market fur the laboring classes in england
at the same time the manufacturing districts
send reports of unusual activity this in some
measure accounts for the absence of poluical
intelligence agitation of any kind laroly
prospers m england while there is abundance
of employment for the workman and he can
live tolerably well ou the produce of his labor
hungry and idle men are dangerous elements
in any community more especially are they
dangerous in such a country as england
where so much of their small earnings is so
palpably squandered away uselessly by an ex
travagant and insatiable aristocracy but in
the midst of the present prosperity it is grati
fying to see that agitation is not wholly
asleep a very large meeting of the metro
politan parliamentary and financial reform
association has been held in the drury lane
theatre which was crowded to the ceiling
the theatre is a very large building capable
of accommodating at least  persons
amongst the speakers were lord nugent
lord dudleystuart george thompson esq
and a boat of others whose names are well
known in the ranks of reform
the report of the council was read by
georoe thompson esq in this report the
reforms advocated by the association are
given they are
 such an extension of the franchise as
will give to every male occupier of a tenement
or any poition of a tenement for which he
shall be rated or sha i have claimed to be
rated to the relief of the poor the right to
be registered as an elector  the adoption
of the system of voting by ballot  the
limitation ol the duration of parliaments to
three years  such a change in the arrange
ment of the electoral districts as shall pro
duce a more equal apportionment of represen
tatres to constiteenis  the abolition ol
the properly qualification for members of
parliament
this movement it is easy to predictis des
tined to be one of importance and will ere
many years passover after the example of the
corn law league sweep dow n all the bar
i ers to its progress the chief question
aised is of course the extension of the suf
rage this will be the entering wedge for
ii other needful reforms the piesent law
as most of our readers are aware requires that
one should vote for members of parliament
but those who occupy dwellings rented at lo
a year or upwards the proposal of the
refoim association when carried into effect
will greatly change iliis it is liable to one
very serious objection however that is that
while it would admit the most ignorant of
those who are now nonelectors and who are
moreover most liable to be influenced by
intimidation and sellinterest namely the
agricultural laboieia it would exclude the
majority of the young and intelligent olerks
and mechanics in ihe latge cities very tew of
whom are ho use holders this portion of the
proposed reform will probably be modified
into the simple principle of complete suffrage

ing their very inferior numbers and resources
the justice of their cauae or some unexpected
turn m the politics of europe might at least
save them from complete and final defeat but
that they were gradually losing ground and
beooming less and less effective in their ef
forts has been for some past abundantly
apparent the result is lamentable we can
only sympathise with the vanquished and
express a belief that liberty is not even yet
dead in europe and that although the czar
and his cossacks may for a time retard they
cannot prevent the final triumph of free opin
ions not only in hungary but in russia and
siberia

brrralo aug th 
frederick douglasas one of the
committee of arrangements of the first of
august celebration at buffalo you wilt con
fer a favor by allowing me through your
columns to call attention to the following ex
tract from an editorial in the impartial git
sen of the bth inst after speaking of the
peaceable mad orderly manner in which the
bmu at auburn patted off the magnanimous
editor adds as follows
it u due to our friend j w quincy
and others of the committee of arrangements
j that they exhibited a morea much more lib
eral disposition than did tbe buffalo conven
tionthe latter refused to pay h h
garnet a single red cent over and above his
travelling expenses for his services as orator
they however went to great expense for
printing paying largely to printers but ask
ing tpeakere to woik for nothing the au
burn committee were as willing to pay speak
ers as printerswe preferred not to say
j anything about this before the celebration
lest we should be regarded as desiring to
disparage the buffalo meeting or to show
partiality betwixt them we had no personal
reason to do so as a printer both committees
treated us alike bnt as a speaker the one
wanted ua for nothing and the other offered
compensation our object in mentioning this
difference between the two committees is to
call attention to the fact that just here lies
the secret of the poverty and embarrassment
of our public men in the unwillingness ol 
some to compensate them for their labors
we penned a line to mr g weir on this
subject but to no avail we doubt however l
whether they asked mr beman to come
from new haven simply for his travelling
expenses if they did they are more un
reasonable than they suppose they are
when will black men learn to pay their
own laborers as liberally as they pay white
men may the buffalo folks improve in this
matter
now we certainly have no objection to the
rev editors exposing himself to the world
through bis misnamed paper providing he
would make an impartial statement of the
facts in the case and not endeavour through
cunning and craft to present the buffalo com
mittee in an unfavorable light before the pub
lie for the most casual reader will readily j
observe that the gratuitous article while it
claims sympathy for us on the one hand is in
tended upon the other hand to reflect discredit
and disparagement upon our efforts
away with such disguised sympathy
some time in the month of january last the
committee at buffalo addressed a letter to
the rev s r ward inviting him to buf
falo as one of the orators for the first of
august and requesting him to state upon
what terms he would come c to which
letter he replied by referring us to the can
andaigua celebration held some two years
previous leaving us to judge from that what j
his terms would be c to which letier the
committee responded by telling him that j
they could not take the canandaigua celebra
for their criterion but that they would
pay his traveling expenses to buffalo and
back again and pay all expenses that might
be incurred by him during his stay in our
city to this letter mr ward replied as folj
lows
syracuse march  
gveir jr dear sir i am disposed
to say that for ought i now see it is probable
that i will comply with the request of your
fellow citizens in respect to the first of august
next on the terms you propose should any
thing occur so to change the minds of the
committee as that they will not need me 
you will please let me know by the first of
may so that l may be free to engage myself
elsewhere your obedt servant
s r ward
from this letter the committee aa a matter
of course enrolled the name of mr ward
as one of their speakers subsequent to this
however the committee received a letter from
him stating that owing to business matters
c he should be obliged to dcclinejseiv
ing us at buffalo on the first of august upon
the terms intimated in a former letter stat
ing that if he did he should embarrass his
business sic
the committee not wishing by any means
to embarrass mr ward in his business or
other engagements immediately wrote him a
letter releasing him from his obligation which
of course they supposed was all that he asked
but it seems that he has now taken a public
opportunity of thrusting the javelin at them
and all because they would not consent to
give him twentyfive dollars together with hit
raveling expenses for making a first of au
gust speech in the article above he freely
makes use of the name of mr garnet and
says that we would not agree to give him a
single red cent over and above his expenses
whether mr garnet authorized this assertion
on the part of mr ward or not we do not
know but this we do know as mr
ward has assumed to mention his name that
both of the gentlemen in our opinion have
entirely disregarded the true principles of
genuine greatness for they both agreed to
come to buffalo and both backed out as to
mr garnet the published proceedings of
our meeting will show in what estimation
we hold him because we did not see fit to
pay him jorty dollars he refused to come
even after assuring us by his letters that he
would come god being willing hid mr
garnet not said positively that he would be
here we never should have used his name on
our bills and consequently we should have
got rid of paying the printer for that job
and as mr ward seems disposed to find
fault with our paying laigely to printers
we will assure him that bis friend whose
name he uses with such emotionsof pity has
been the means of incurring a portion of the
expenses and secondly we inform bimthai
we do not know that it is any of his or any
persons business what we pay for printing
or what we do not wepaid him aceoiding
to his request in advance for ooe notice in hi
paper and that we believe is ll that should
concern him especially when the editorial
sic which he promised us in relation to our
celebratioo haa never appeared the twenty
five dollars bonus was not found forthcom
ing neither wasthe editorial although be had
promised it alas what an effect the ahrugh
ty dollar will have we are sorry to see it
so in this ease it betrays a want of interest
and feeling upoo the pan of the wonhy
editor much to be lamented we exhort
him to repentance he seems to be wonder
fully concerned about tbe terms upon which
mr beman came to buffalo we simply re
mark upon this point that whether he
believes that mr beman came simply for his
traveling expenses or not is nutter of ia
differeoce to os mr beman has a soul too
big with pilanthropy and boa oo moch in
terest in the welfare of mending humanity to
make and cents a standard pore phil
anthropy pium pis him to act toe and his letter
to tbe buffalo committee will ever be borne
to mind with the moet pleasing recollection
wruld that we could say as much for tbe
letters of mr ward and mr garnet that
j w quincy and tbe auburn committee
possessed a great deal of liberality and mag
naomity we do not hesitate to believe but
be that as it may our friend ward possessing
as utile a be does should certainly not un
dertake to draw a contrast between them and
tbe buffalo committee the buffalo committee
are responsible for their acts and when they
wish tutoring in regard to their duty they
will call upon some candid man and not one
who assumes to have so much sympathy with
us that he would not apeak of us at the au
burn celebration and at the same time
would publish us to tbe world through tbe
column of his paper he closes up his
article by inquiring when will black men
learn to pay their own laborers as liberally as
they pay white men  dieusing the very
language which were a white man to use he
would be quick to condemn we admit that
the buffalo folks have need for improvement
in many matters but we fear that if they
wait for certain rrr editors to set the ex
ample unless money can purchase it they
they will wait in vain

an appeal in behalf of the western
new york astislavery fair
earnestly desiring the abolition of slavery
in this land and being deeply convinced that
this result can only be accomplished by renew
ed efforts to change our present corrupt moral
sentiment the undersigned mem hers and
friends of the western new york amslaver
society again make their sppeal to the
fnenda of the sltte in behalf of their annual
bazaar which will be bekl in rochester in
december next
while we have been cheered and gladdened
by the progress already made and the good
alteady done and while we rejoice to observe
that friends have been raised up to plead the
cause of the bondman among persons and in
quarters where we had least expected them
we still aee the harvest to be great and the
laborers to be few sod instead of relaxing
our efforts we are impressed with a sense of
the duty of doubling our diligence and ap
plying more closely oot energy to tba means
of advancing this holy causewe appeal the
more boldly to our friends because tboee for
whom we plead cannot plead for themselves
while we are surrouoded by our domestic
circle with none to molest or make ua afraid
there are three millions of men and women in
our own land doomed to abject slavery and
chains robbed of every rightavileoeml
personaland political remembering thorn
m bonds as bound with them we desire to
ulead their eanae as though they were os our
own limbs and the knotted lash were applied
te our own book
while to obuin mesas foe enlightening the
f public mind is the strong motive for folding
our nrnon fair it in oot the only one a
great amount of good may be traced directly
ito socli occutoaa many who are now at
tire worker in behalf of this holy rooternent
became first interested in it through the m
sttumeiitahty of tboee annual exhibitions of
anuniavary mdoatry tact and skill
the present object of tbe rochester anti
i slarerj bazaar for the general enlighten
ment of the public mind o tbe subject of sla
very recognizing the north star published
ra thia city as an efficient antislavery in
strumentality we propose that the funds raised
by the sale of articles at the bazaar on
behalf of which we here appeal shall be
mainly appropriated to the support of that
important paper
we gatefnlly acknowledge the prompt as
aistxnce rendered to our last fair by our
friends and coadjutor in various parts of our
own state wisconsin and michigan and we
earnestly solicit their continued cooperation
i with os in tbe good wotk that no time may
i be lost we especially recommend to them the
immediate formation of sewing circles in their
various towns with a view to making articles
for the rochester bazaar we would also
in this connection render oar heartfelt thanks
to our british frieods for the valuable aid ex
tended by them to our last year s fair and
we would again warmly solicit their generous
assistance it is due to our transatlantic
friends to say that for much of the interest felt
in our last bazaar we were indebted to them
and we are persuaded thst their continued
cooperation will essentially ptomoie the suc
cess of nur approaching december bazaar
and tbe advancement of the cause of the slave
in our land
we hope that the foregoing appeal will
commend itaelf to out philanthropic friends on
both sides of the atlantic and that they will
cordially unite with us in the effoit here pro

as you are already aware at the
very beginning of the hungarian rev
olution sereral secretaries were ap
pointed in kossuths cabinet one of
them understanding bohemian anoth
er croatian another italian another
french and german among them i
had the place of translator from the
french into the magyar while we
were still in pemh i worked in the
chancery at buda and had only now
and then an opportunity of seeing our
kossuth but since the chancery was
removed to debreczin i have been
almost every day at his sider rather
i might sav day and night for hardly a
night in the week passes away in which
we are not compelled to be busy i
gay tee for the great man always em
ploys more than one at a time i will
accordingly endeavor aa far as words
will allow me to introduce you into
our work room and to let you behold
with your otvn eyes as an observer
t the liberator of whom in america
there is no just conception w o is
even unknown in the neighboring counj
tries and whom few of your corres
pondents can describe for there are
not many who have had the opportunity
of carefully studying a kossuth
i hardly know how to begin as there
is hardly ever a pause in the course of
his activity to start from but for ex
ample i will write down for you the
doings of yesterday
j yesterday morning after i had break
tasted i hastened to the chancery
that is to say to kossuths house which
contains four apartments his sleeping
chamber a parlor the chancery where
we four correspondents have our places
and a small room for copyists three
couriers with dispatches were in the
room as i entered and kossuth sat in
his usual place with a pen in hia right
i hand mid in his left the dispatches just
brought in i had come rather too
late for it was already a quarter past
five oclock and another secretary had
prepared in my place two dispatches
which were sent off before five as i
entered he was employed in several
ways his hand was writing his mouth
was dictating his eye glanced at and
read the opened dispatches and his
mind directed and followed the whole
he looked paler and more suffering
than usual a glass of medicine stood
by his side from which he tasted from
time to time as if it were the means of
keeping up his physical existence in
deed though i have often worked at
his side from early in the morning till
i late at night i do not remember having
seen him stop to take any nourishment
except this mixture and though he
does sometimes eut i can assure you
that the amount of food which he con
sumes is hardly enough to keep a
young child from starving
one might almost say that the physi
cal part of him had no longer an e is
tence of its own the man is nothing
but a spiritual energy lor if it were
not so the perishing sickly hull would
long since have been dissolved in spite
of ail the wisd m of the physicians
but he is perhaps the only living being
whose mighty will is alone sufficient by
its own force to urge forward the
wheels of physical nature and keep
them constantly in movement he
will not be sick and he is not great
as are his bodily infirmities and suffer
ings he is strong and indefatigable
his spiritual resources his will his
enthusiasm endow bun with the pow
iers of a giant although his physical
strength is not more than that of a boy
of six years he bids defiance to
death that threatens him in so many
different maladies his spirit keeps the
body alive the spirit is still young
and vigorous and can bnly cease to be
so when the too great tension shall
have irritated the nerves to such a de
gree that they refuse to obey the will
and thus the organism destroys itself
i do not express myself clearly but
words will serve me no further but
to our in bore
i had scarcely taken my place when
he b gun to dictate a letter to bern foi
me to write and so we were employed
some f ur hours during which i wrote
two letters and each of my three col
leagues three all by his dictation ht
i himself had in the meantime preparec
two dispatches one for perczel tin
other for comorn
after nine oclock he left us work ir
abundance for the whole day and wen
with the ministers szmere and dus
click who came for him to the hou
iof representatives taking along wit
him some papers on which he hat
made several memoranda
he came hack about four oclock ir
the afternoon accompanied by seveia
representatives with whom he har i
conference of two hours answering
their questions and suggestions thii
did not prevent him from examining
the documents we had prepared during
his absence or from dictating nvrt
letters while be was thus dictating
to in three or four letters with totally
different contents being given off to
gether by the same lips we had to bi
exceedingly careful in takiog then
down
at stx oclock came more dispatchei
and verbal inquiries all of which wen
answered without delay my dinnei
consisted of a glass of wine a piece o
ham and some bread which i had or
the table beside me and disposed o
with the best appetite as i was writing
the representatives with one excep
tion went away the one remaining sal
down at the side of kossuth and begar
to help us this made five secretaries
and to give you some description of tht
labors of the evening i will tell yot
that from halfpast seven to balfpasi
eight he dictated to us at the saint
time five letters all of different con
tents one of them was to dembinski
one to bern the third to paris tbt
tourth to vienna and the fifth to gyo
tiygos two were in german one ii
french and two in hungarian
is it a mitt who can do such things
after tbit he waa for some time en
gaged in figures which ho reckoner
and reckoned in a state of almost per
feet abstraction while he was thui
occupied his friend and family phvsi
cian the doctor and professor buga
pal came in and interrupted him he
greeted the doctor kindly pointi d him
to a chair and returned to his occupa
lion as before the doctor took his 
hand which he yielded to him willing
ly as if it did not belong to him and i
held it for some fifteen minutes feeling
the beat of the pulse after which he
withdrew without any further notice
from kossuth
at  oclock the head of one of my i
colleagues was already nodding and
both myself and the one opposite me
could hardly keep our eyes open
the clock struck twelve and the j
noise of the departure of the copyists j
from the neighboring room roused him
from his reflections whit time is
it gentlemen he asked of us and j
when we told him it was just after  i
he became unquiet and a cloud sud
denly spread over his brw he rose
from his seat saying has no express j
arrived from peath no was the
answer and he began to walk up and
down the room he did not seem to
think that it was high time to seek rest
and as if to prevent us from having
such au idea he said there is work
to be done yet
finally after waiting vainly for an
other hour he said to us let us take
a little ret gentlemen while we are
waiting  will call you when i need
your help he went into his bedroom
and we arranged ourselves on the
benches and slept with our fatigue as
soundly as in the softest bed but our
rest was not of long duratioa between
three and lour oclock the expected
dispatches arrived still half asleep
we took our places and kossuth that
watchman of his country dictated to us
as before at six in the morning wo
received permission to go away while
he went for a bath though with the re
quest to be there again by eight oclock
we are young and strong and such a
nights watching now and then will not
injure us hut it is not so wi h him
how long can this hero of the nine
teenth centurythis guide of our
fatherland amid the foes that surround
ithow long can his spirit sustain the
contest that it ever carries on with the
little of physiol nature that is attached
to it
my friend if beyond the ocean in
the free and happy america there are
men who feel sympathy for our good
cause who desire the success of our
efforts do not ask their prayers so
much for tne triumph of the magyars
as for the life of kossuth for hungary
cannot be conquered so long as this
incomprehensible being whose name is
kossuth is spared though russians
and austrians enter the country by
myriads and though thousands of our
brethren fall as sacrifices for freedom
he is the image of liberty equality
and fraternity he is the incarnate
spirit of justice he is the washington
of hungary and so eljen kossuth
a fearful dream
the last saturnalia
some ninety years ago there flour
ished in glasgow a club of young men
which from the extreme profligacy of
its members and the licentiousness of
their orgies were commonly called
the hell club besides their nightly
or weekly meetings they held one
grand annual saturnalia in which each
tried to excel the other in drunkenness
and blasphemy and on the thesb occa
sions there was no star amongst them
whose lurid light was more conspicuous
than that of young mr archibald b
who endowed with brilliant talents and
a handsome person held out great
promises in his boyhood and raised
hopes which had been completely frus
trated by his sunsequent reckless dissi
pation one morning after returning
from this annual festival mr archibald
 having retired to bed dreamed the
following dream j
he fancied that he was mounted on
a favorite black horse that he always
rode and that he was proceeding to
wards his own housethen a seat em
bowered by trees and situated upon a
hill now entirely built over and form
ing part of the citywhen a stranger
whom the darkness of the night pre
vented his distinctly discerning sud
deul seized the horses rein saying
you must go with me
and who are you exclaimed the
young inan with a volley of oaths
whilst he struggled to free himself
that you will see by and by re
turned the other in a tone that excited
uncomfortable terror in the youth who
plunging his spurs into his horse at
tempted to fly but in vain however
fast the animal flew the stranger was
still beside him till at length in his
desperate effort to escape the rider
was thrown but instead of being
dashed to the earth as he expected he
found himself fallingailingfalling
slid as if sinking into the bowels of the
earth
at length a period being put to this
mysterious descent he found breath to
inquire of his companion who was still
beside him whither they were going
where am i where are you taking
me he exclaimed
to hell replied the stranger and
immediately interminable echoes re
peated the fearful sound to hell to
hell
at length a light appeared which
soon increased to a blaze but instead
of cries and groans and lamenting as
the terrified traveler expected nothing
met his ear but sounds of music mirth
and joillity and he found himself at the
entrance of a superb buildi g far ex
ceeding any he had seen constructed
by human hands witbin too what a
scene no amusements employment
or pursuit of man on earth but was
there being carried on with a vehe
mence that excited hit unutterable
amazement there the panting horae
still bore his bruts tider through the
excitement of the added race there
over the midnight bowl the inebriate
still drawled out the wanton song or
maudlin blasphemy the gambler for
ever plied hie endless game and the
laves of mammon toiled through eter
nity their bitter tasks whilst all the
magnificence of earth paled before that
which met hia view
he aoon perceived that be was
among old acquaintances whom he
knew to be dead and each ho observ
ed was pursuing the object whatever
it was that had formerly engrossed
him when finding himself relieved ol
the presence of his unwelcome conduc
tor he ventured to address his former
friend mrs d whom he taw
sitting as had been her wont on earth
absorbed also requesting her to real
from the game and introduce him to
the pleasures of the place which ap
peered to him to be vrry uniiko what
he had expected and indeed an ex
tremely agreeable one but with what
a cry of agony she answered that there
was no rest in hell thst they must
ever toil on at those very pleasures
and innumerable voices echoed through
the interminable vaults there is no
rest in hell whilst throwing open their
vests each disclosed in his bosom an
everburning dame these they said
were the pleasures of hell the choice
of earth was their inevitable doom in
the midst of the horror this scene in
spired his conductor returned and at
his earnest entreaty restored him
again to earth but as he quitted him
he said
rememberin a year and a day
we meet again
at this crisis of the dream the sleeper
awoke feverish and ill and whether
from the effect of the dream or his pre
ceding orgies be was so unwell as to
be obliged to keep his bed for several
days during which period he had time
for many serious reflections which ter
minated in a resolution to abandon the
club and his licentious companions al
together
he whs no sooner well however
than they fi cked around him bent on
recovering so valuable a member of
their society and having wrung from
him a confession of the causes of his
defection which as may be supposed
uppeared to them ridiculous they soon
contrived to make him ashamed of his
good resolution he joined them again
resumed his former course of life
and when the annual saturnalia came
round he found himself with a glass in
his hand at the table when the presi
dent rising to make his accustomed
speech began with saying gentle
men this being leap year and a year
and a day since our last anniversary
sic
the words struck upon the young
mans ear like a knell but ashamed
to expose his weakness to the jeers o
his companions he sat out the feast
plying himself with wine even mort
liberally than usual in order to drowr
his instinctive thoughts till in the
gloom of a winters morning he mourn
ted his horse to ride home sum
hours afterwards the horse was fount
with his saddle and bridle on quietly
grazing by the road side about hal
way between the city and mr bs
house while a few yards off lay th
corpse of his master
now as i have said introducing thii
story it is no fiction the circum
stances happened as here related at
account of it was published at the time
but tho copies were bought up by thi
family two or three however wen
preserved and the narrative has beei
reprinted crotrs night side of jva

the desert of sahara
north of the mountains of the moon
in abyssinia lies the great desert of
sahara stretching  miles in width
from its southern margin and  in
length between the atlantic and the
red sea it is a hideous barren waste
prolonged eastward into the atlantic
for miles in the form of sandbanks
and interrupted to the west only by a
few oases and the valley of the nile
this desert is alternately scorched
by heat and pi ched by cold the
wind blows from the east nine months
in the ycur and at the equinoxes it
rushes in u hurricane driving the sand
in clouds before it producing the dark
ness of night at midday and over
whelming caravans of men and animals
in common destruction then the sand
is heaped up in waves ever varying
with the blast even the atmosphere is
of sand the desolation of this weary
waste boundless to the eye as the
ocean is terrific and sublimethe dry
heated air is like a red vapor the set
ting sun seems to be a volcanic fire
and at times the burning wind of the
desert is the blast of death there are
many salt lakes to the north and even
 the springs are of brine thick incrus
tations ot dazzing salt cover the
ground and the particles carried alofi
by whirlwinds flah in the sun like
diamonds sand is not the only char
acter of the desert tracks ot gravel
and low bare rocks occur at times nol
less barren and dreary on these inter
minable sands and rocks no animal nc
insect breaks the dead silence not a
tree nor a shrub is seen in this land
without a shadow in the glare ol
noon the air quivers with heat reflected
from the red sand and in the night il
is chilled in a clear sky sparkling
under a host of stars strangely
 but beautifully contrasted with these
i scorched solitudes is the narrow valley
of the nile threading the desert foi
 miles in emerald green with its
blue waters foaming in rapids among
i wild rocks or quietly spreading in a
i calm stream amidst fields of corn and
theaugust monuments of past sges
dreaming for a breakfast down
in aroostook county maine a h
fcnan and an irishman happens jbe
journeying together through the most
interminable forest of that regioo and
by some tnixhap had lost their way and
wandered about in a pitiable condition
fr a while when they fortunately came
across a miserable hovel which was de
serted save by a lone chicken as this
poor biped was the only thing eatable
to be obtained they eagerly oespatched
and prepared it for a supper when
laid before them pat concluded that it
was insufficient for the support of both
himself and sawney and therefore a
proposition was made to hit companion
that they should spare their chicken
until the next morning and the one who
had the most pleasant dream should
have the chicken which was agreed to
la the morning sawney told bis dream
he thought angels were drawing him
to heaven in a basket and be waa never
before so happy lpon concluding hia
dream pat exclaimed  ocb aure
and by japers i saw you going and
thought you woudnt come back after
the chicken and  gat up and ate if
