i have not forgotten the promise that
i made you before leaving america lo
give you a letter occasionally for the
liberator v on have doubtless learn
ed t ie this that the steamer m which 
came over made i he shortest passage
ever known phis  need not inform
you added much to the pleasure of the
voyage among the unusually large
number of passengers on hoard were
iuur or five slaveholders and among
these was a judge chinn a louisiana
slaveholder who had been appointed
by our democratic government nsj
consul to naples and who was on his
way out to occupy his post the steam
er had scarcely left the shore before it
was rumored that an american slave
was on board and that he was going
out aw a delegate to the peace con
gress at paris the latter part of the
rumor gave additional interest to it and
soon there was no little anxiety nini
lested on the part of passengers to know
soup thing o the history of the ugitive
mv narrativea fw copies of which
i iiad with me was sought alter and
extensively read the reading of which
jiiodueed considerable sensation among
flu passengers especially the sluve
huldnig and proslavery portion of them
i bis judge chinn had with him a free
colored man as servant and  was
somewhat anxious to know what kind
u protection be was to receive in trav
elling in this country for you will rec
ollect that i made application to john
m layton before leaving america
lor a passport which was refused ine
so upou inquiring of tins servant lie
showed ine his passpor which proved
to he nothing less than a regular pass
port from the hand of the secretary of
state true it was not from mr clay
ton but it was from his immediate pre
decessor mr buchanan this proves
conclusively that if a colored person
wishes the protection of the u states
government in going into any foreign
country be must not think of going in
any other capacity than that of a boot
black wherever the colored man
gots he must carry w ith him the badge
oflavery to receive the protection of
the americans the act of govern
ment m denying to its colored citizens
the same protection that it extends to
the w lutes is more cowardly and mean
it possible than any act committed for
years but it is entirely in keeping
with american republicanism i am
glui io see that the english press gen
erally has denounced this act of high
handed injustice and oppression
  p
as you are aware the congress met
on wednesday the d at i oclock
and strange to say among the first
tnut  saw on entering the hall were
ihree slaveholders w ho caino over in the
auie steamer with me one ol whom
was judge chinn but whether they
wt re members of the cougress or uot
i am unable to say at any rate they
wn supplied with the same card ol
admission that members had how
ever they did not show any symptoms
of colorphobla so natural to the amer
ican taste a circumstance occurred
ti the close of the first session which
imws how easily americans can lay
vmth their prejudices when they reach
lns country while i was in conver
sation with richard cobden esq
member of the brgisli parliament and
ictor hugo the president of the con
liicss  observed a man standing near
hi whom i recognized as one of the
poengerh mi tin same steamer wilh
me iron america and who during the
k oyae was not at all backward in ex
kug his belief in the inferiority ol
niggers ad who would not deign
j to me during lb whole pas
 at the close of the conversation
jtftl was leaving the parties with
the north star
whom  had bcn talking this man ad
vanced towards me with his bat in one
hand and the olhor extended out and
addressed me with how do you do
mr brown i hope i find yau well
sir why sir you have the advan
tage of mel do not know you why
sirsaid he dont you know me i
was a fellow passenger with you from
america i wish you would introduce
me to mr cobden i felt so indignant
at the downright impudence of the fel
low that i left him without making any
reply the change from an american
to an european atmosphere makes a
wonderful change in the minds of ame
ricans the man who would not have
shaken hands with me in the city of
new y ork or boston with a pair of

rica m de tocqueville minister ot
foreign affairs gave a splendid soiree
to the members of the congress i
perceived no difference vvhatevey in the
attention paid to those of a fairer com
plexion than that paid to me i could
but contrast the feeling that pervaded
that assembly of men and women from
all parts of the globe to the low mean
and contemptible prejudice so common
in the united states here were rep
resentatives and ministers plenipoten
tiary from all governments including
the united states messrs walsh and
rush were there and you know that
they are proverbial for their proslave
ry feeling the whites and blacks
were all together and i did not hear
the word nigger once if there was
any difference paid to one more than
another that difference was certainly
paid to myself not on account of my
complexion but on account of my iden
tity with the oppressed millions in ame
rica on being presented to madame
de tocqueville i was received with the
same courtesy that characterized the
reception of others but as soon as it
was mentioned to the distinguished la
dy that j was an american slave all
conventionalities were laid aside by a
cordial shake of the hand that gave me j
double assurance that  was not only
safe from the slavehunter in paris but
that  was a welcome guest in the sa
loon of the french minister of foreign
affairs while there i could but
think of hie bitter cold night in the
winter of  when i xvas compelled
to w alk the deck of the steamer swal
low n the hudson river on account
of my complexion i could hut think
of my being excluded from the saloon
of the steamer huntress on the pas
sage from portland to bath in the slate
of maine but a few days before i left
america by w hich exclusion i was com
pelled to fast twelve bourn
from the concord iml democrat
survey of the field
to the cause of human freedom in
america the year that has passed lias
been a glorious year to that small
but faithful band of pioneers who a few
years since solitary aiid alone cut
from the mountain that stone which has
become a great mountain it is more
than the prestige of the good time com

long night of persecution and threaten

few deserve and fewer live to enjoy a
triumph of w hich we eleventh hour sol

slavery aggressive
we h ave called the period of the
adoption of the federal constitution a
crisis in the history of slavery because
at that time the slavepower which has
since made such formidable usurpations
was a trembling petitioner for the li
cense to exist even at all
a reference to the madison papers
w ill show that a continuance of the
slavetrade till the year  was con
ceded to the clamors of south carolina
and georgia and we think it clear ev
en from such fragments as remain to
us of the debates of the federal con
vention that a majority of the mem
bers of that body looked upon the ex
tinction of the slavetrade and slavery
as synonymous and it was univer
sally supposed at that time that the
number of slaves could only be kept
from diminishing by fresh impoitations
for this reason the word slave was
carefully excluded from the constitu
tion that when human bondage be
came a thing of the past no trace ot
its existence even much less suspicion
of it connivance shrnrld leave its slain
upon that instrument i think it
wrong to admit in the constitution the
idea that there can he property in mani
so said mr madison in the conven
tion and in so saying he echoed the
sentiments of a large majority of the
members from all sections of the coun 
try throughout the debates on the
slavery clauses of the constitution it j
is very clear that the advocates of sla
very actede ntirelv on the defensive it
could not well be otherwise since nl 
most every statesman eminent in those
early days of the republic has left on
record his unqualified condemnation of
the system some of the heartiest dei
nouncers of slavery were from mary
land and virginia
butin the thirtythree years which j
lad elapsed between the adoption of
ihe federal constitution and the ad
mission of missouri the posture of af
fairs had entirely changed slavery
now for the first time became aggres
sive and the protection of liberty
which was intended to he the rule of
our government had grown to be the
rare exception by the stopping of
the foreign slavetrade and the stimu
lus which the domestic traffideceived
from the increase of territory mary
land and irginta had been seduced
from their allegiance to higher and hu
mane sentiments and had already be
come the guinea coast of america
the admission of missouri by what
was falsely termed a compromise lor
there can he no compromise with what
is absolutely wrong no iruce bytween
god and satanthrew at the pres
tige of victory and a control of balance
of power upon the side of the slave
holders since that tatal and perfid
ious day f reedom has been constantly
driven to the wall a small aristocra
cy insignificant in point ol numbers
and justly obnoxious to christian free
men from the basis on w hich their claim
to superiority rests scattered over a
wide extent of territory and only com

im ingiishing characteristics of 
america slavery
in comparing american slavery with
the inode of servitude which have ex
isted among other nations and in other
ages of the world we find that although
agreeing with some of them iu many
particulars it differs in one important
point from them all slavery where
ever aud whenever it has elsewhere ex
isted has been as impartial as death
there was no one whom the chances
of fortune or war might not one day or
other reduce to bondage but with
us complexion has been made fhe cri
terion for determining the capacity of
a human being for freedom it is a
singular fact tkal white the african pky

another distinguishing characteris
tic of american slavery is that it is not
ouy permitted but actually fostered
by a nation foremost of all iu receiving

emplifying the great idea of human
brotheihood it is congenerous with
nothing in our political system and isi

posed between master and slave the j

such foundation for american slavery
here the slaveholder justifies himself
either by the color of his victim claim
ing to be only a fulliller of the prophe

geance or he appeals to the fact that
his inheritance of oppression was de
volved upon him from his ancestors

improper interference by its order
through its agepts with the affairs of

formed you the administration gave
such instructions as were calculated to
secure the early formation of a state
government and with a constitution
prohibiting slavery this was in my
opinion a wise and patriotic measure
j on fhe part of the administration and
it was completely successful
 but i am informed and have good
reason to believe that a portion of the

ijrar southern politicians intend tobnngi
some railing accusations against the

allege to be the extraordinary and im
warrantaple instructions to gen riley i
it is intended to allege that these in
structions exceed any power that be
longs to the federal executive in the
premises
i have much more apprehension from
an agitation of this and kindred quesj
tions in congress at this session than
from any question relating to foreign
nations that may arise in a century i
fear that mr calhoun is about to make
a final effort under some fatal impulse
to throw a portion of the southern states
out of the union whether he will
succeed or not this will probably bej
 his last session here i still trust that
mr calhoun will lie deterred from pur
suing the course he has marked out for
himself for it is quite certain that the

a washington correspondent of the
cleveland true democrat describing
an interview withthos c mcdonald
esq u s consul at st catharines
for some months past and bearer of
despatches from the american legation
at rio de janeiro to our government
atwashington says
y r hat interested us most deeply was
his description of the extent and horrors
of slavery and the slave trade on that
coast
not less than thirty or forty thou
sand are brought there annually and
the mass of them in american vessels
under the american flag on the afri
can coast disguised elsewhere
and what is worse these vessels

one vessel which he saw and named to
us was owned and controlled by the
rev mr baptist minister in
the village of in massachusetts
well said mr mcdonald slave
ry is a shame and disgrace to our na
tion we are the derision of other na
tionsthe english taunt us for it
surely the great doctors of new en
gland theology who have been teach
ing for years that slavery is no viola
tion of the christian faith or church
and that christianity not only permits
but sometimes requires its believers to
become slaveholders maynow con
gratulate themselves that their seed is
bringing forth fruit after its kind
how the tender and endnring human
love shown in the following incident
related by mr mcdonald contrasts
with the trateful and hollow selfishness
of those pretended christians and
christian ministers of new england

went to the white house there
w ere a number of persons present and
the interview was attended with a great

to all concerned i was astonished at
the ease exhibited by the president
and the tact displayed by him in his re

over the principal chief presented the
president with several small paintings
executed by the young people of his
tribe as evidence of their improvement
in education and advancement in civ

purse w hich was sent to the president
by one of the indian girls which was
the work of her own hands they had
not been paid their annuity which un
explained had caused some little un
easiness among them
this however was at once removed
upon being informed that the absence
cf their new agent wm h bell esq

conveyance what an incalculable
amount of animal suffering is to be sav

the state of the weatherthough the
mercury stand at ten degrees below or
one hundred above zerothough the
rain descend in torrents or the snow
hide the face of the earththough the
wind rage tempestuously or not a leaf
is stirred by the breeze no matter
what the condition of the road either
in highways or byways no matter
what tiie distance to be traveled wheth
er ten or ten hundred miles seated in
an elegant and spacious car as agree
able as any parlor or saloon and pro
pelled on level hands of iron by a pow
er that never tires and with a speed ah
rnost equal to the hight of birds the
traveler performs his journey without
suffering or fatigue at times the illu
sion is so complete that it seems as if
he alone stands still and everything
else in in motion gardens and fields
groves and forests hills and valleys
towns and villages hurry past him with
magical effect until he finds himself at
the end of his journey it may be hun
dreds of miles from home by an agen
cy and a process never dreamed of by
the uncounted generations of men tinea

among tbe working daaees of uj town or

ptide and point the slaveholders at tbe sooth

an emphatic denial and a lulling refetatioo of
all their malignant slanders some of tbe
most successful w halemen out of tbe port of

than forty now in california they bate
i nhown themselves as keenly alive to tbo at
tractions of gold as their white fellowdtiaens
 am glad of this proof of s common origin
a common identity while in new bedford
 had the pleasure of perusing several letters
fiom a number of old and intimate colored
friends now in the gold region those letj
lers gave me a far more fsvorahfl impression
as to he probable success of the gold hunter
than any letters which i have seen floating
about m the newspapers it is quite evident
from these interesting letters that the wealth
 of alifoima is as it ought to be shared by
colored as well as white men not one of
the company of colored persons from new
bedford expresses any regret at going to
california and ail seem delighted with the
prospect before them
hoi once iiwi has found a place wham it
i bids lair to be amply rewarded the soft
j handed thinker is there no match for the
hard fisted worker the black man can dig
gold as well as the white man why wont
the ulouization society send some of its vie
lims to california instead of sending them all
to liberia l if it would do the former and
i leave nit the latter it would be far more like
ly to convince the colored people of its disin
t tercsted desire to benefit their condition than
any efforts now making are likely to do but

a
californiaanother compromise
the very unexpected intelligence received
a loitnight ago from california that the con
vention assembled at monterey had agreed
upon a constitution by which slavery and
involuntary servitude flicept for dime
should be for ever excluded from the state of
california lias been on all hands looked upon
with distrust it was thought too good news
to be true the more one leflects upon the
circumstances in which that form of constitu
tion was agreed to the more suspicious does
the case appear ist the section of the
constitution excluding slavery was agreed to
at once unanimously and without discussion
i bis to say the least was very singular
the convention was composed of fortyeight
memberstwentyfive from the southern
statessome of them known slaveholders
ami twenty three from the northern states
all ot whom it cannot be supposed were very
fine  nends of freedom nd the opinion
ol the smth with respect to slavery in cal
ifornia has not been kept secret reverdy
johnson we conceive expressed it when he
aid that the climate and soil are well adap
ted in slaveiy and that it must and would
i tn aiilornia at all political meetings
in the southern states the rightnot only
the unfit but tbe determination ot slavehol
dels in can v tlo ir property to california has
for the last twelve months been one of the
mo i productive topics of declamation
mj slaves have lieen carried into california
under the impression that they would he as
sate to their owners there as in any of the
slave stales and they are there now and
doubtless slaves still lastly the place
i where tbe convention was heldnamely
monterey is fai distant troin the centre of pop
nai tun and peculiarly accessible to govern
ment officials patronage and influence how
under all these circumstances so peculiarly
encouraging to opposition the antitlavety
section refeired to could he allowed to pass
without discussion and unanimously remains
a mystery
still further the doings of the administra
tion icspecting california with scarcely an
attempt at dissimulation have all pointed to
a different icault the head of the admin
istration is currently reported and there has
been nothing in his course before ot aince hia
election to the presidential chair which a
fords any contradiction to the report when
at the beginning of march laat a bill tot the
establishment of a government in california tn
which there was no provision against slavery
was before the house to have uaed his in
fluence hi favor ot the measure the nu
melons officers and agents sent by the gov
ernment iu california have been without a
known exception if not strongly biased in fa
vor ot slavery at heat negative on the sub
ject and of course ready to fall in with any
scheme however iniquitous which was
thought to have the sanction of their princi
pals at home but especially by the appoint
ment ef mi king of georgia a doubledyed
slaveholder and au unblushing advocate of
slavery to what was named a mioeralogtcal
survey but what seems now to have been a
secret political mission has the administra
tion given evidence of its intentions on the
subject of slavery in california
have the intentions of government been
fiu strafed if slavery by the action of the
i onvenijon is forever excluded from caltfor
nia they undoubtedly have dm that such
will nut be the case is now abundantly appa
tent the slaveiy members of the conven
tion probably knew ibis and therefore did net
manifest any anxiety on the subject
but the late news from california requires
confirmation it is possible that the action of
the committee may be tsverged by the final
action ot the t onveqtioc it is also possible
that california with us present boundary will
be admitted into the union as a free stale
we v this s possible but we are not saa
guiie enough to think that tl is likely sla
veiy baa never yet tailed citherby open or
cancelled measures to get all that it has ask
i ed and it will not tail now what it cas
ual accomplish by chicanery sad conning it
will accomplish by bravado and bluster
cilflfcun and hu company  soothers demo

iierinem and all that if they are exclodad
from ajiiwriua w ith that harlequin ver
i sauitty u hk h is always chacaeaeostic at the
accomplished puktimnn they have sees fit to
j change their optmoe upon stale law their
position is not now the cemparauvelt modes
me that etch state must decide for itd
whether or not it will admit slavery but ths
the people of california and of course of eve
ry othea territory of the uehed states hav
oe more rifht to exclude slavery than con
gross has and that not until california ha
become a state has she any right to regular
her domestic policy immediately on lb
heels of this southern manifesto appear pat
agraphs in tap official papers from the ash
iegton letter writers proposing a compru
mice it is discovered that california will
its praaant boundary is too large for on
stale that it must be divided into three au
that a bill will be inttoduced into the senate
which will provide first for the esiablishmen
of four territorial governments to wit ist
that for new mexico d that for deseret
d that of california north of  deg 
min and weal of deseret and th the pat
of california south of  deg  min
it will also ptovide that the territory uotll
of  deg  min shall be authorized forth

be admitted also that a ne
state shall bejßwhe same lime admitte

boundary between texas and new mexicc
bat will provide that the question be submit
tad to a board of commissioners this pr
ject it is said will be supported by leading
men of both parlies and is beginniug to tin
favor at washington
peihaps these flying tumors are all lal
possibly they are nothing more than the usu
gossip with which w ashing ton correspondent
amuse their readers but in the circumstance
they carry only a too sorrowful air of probi
bility mpnwhile the papers are full of thi
rumored compromise and what is rather re
markable the whigs are unusually busy gi
ing currency to the explosions of souther
bluster and in magnifying their importance
and the danger likely to accrue if the demand
of the south are resisted coupled alway
with the expression of a hope that no cans
will supervene to endanger the harmony o
the union
the fears and suspicions expressed above
may be unfounded we fervently pray tha
they may be but in judging of the acts n
slaveholders and calculating the probability
of slavery extension experience has showi
that it is impossible to be ovei cautious am
fearful compromise is the american hobby
the chance in favor of a whole measure
where a compromise can be effected is a ver
small one the excuse for ibis new compto
mise if one should be made will be the dan
ger of dismemberment we are sorry to bi
compelled to confess that we do not imagim
this danger to be nearly so great as mam
doughface northerners would have it believ
ed fbr our part we should be happy to bi
delivered from the burden curse and innder
able shame of every slave state in the union
the not them states would jose noth
ing and gain much by such a result ttu
this will not be the south with all he
bluster knows well how weak she would b
without the strong arm of the north to suj
pert her in wickedness and oppression comi

ducting the man chattel ami can major jones
even under the laws of virginia plant an ac
tion against either
we do not know what the law of vug mu
may be and a does not matter a great deal
for thesode of a slave state cannot reasonably
be expected to be either very just or very wise
but speaking rationally on the subject w
should suppose that whether the properly ii

ought the man to be punished for running
away with the horse there is or uught t
be as much ground for supposing design n

the case is clear that he was sinned againsi

dick tlupublisher of said paper ygjassur
ua that they are not tuggers jljlu lc
cepi tlieir proposal
the batesviile aik eagle a dippy
 shabby looking imie tout and a halt aquart
concern filled up almost wholly with adver
 tisements has tli notice of us ery won
j detful is it not that such a great eagle shoulf
make so condescending an offer  on sight o
k the paper we do confess to having had saint
misgivings about our proposal aud a sligh
inclination to back out on further reflection
however upon the honor done ns by the fa
gle no leva than that of making us the sub
jecl ol one of its longest editorials we reolv
ed to make the best of our bargain v
j might have got over even this difficulty bu
there wg still another obstacle which w
etiuld bv no means overcome irwastht
j thought that the eagle might consider u
mean it is not pleasant to be thought meai
s by any one least of all is it pleasant to b
s thought mean by men of such true nobiltt
and manliness as the citizens of arkansas
 they arc all lionorable men they would a
soon think of flying to the moon as of takm
any mean advantage of any one were oni
to charge them with stealing from a poor de
spised black man they would treat him witl
 well merited contempt if not with a coat o
 tar and feathers were one to charge then
with stealing the black man himself and evei
women and children he might think himsel
fortunate if lie escaped hanging on the highes
tree how very dreadful it would be to b
 considered mean by even one such honorabli
man we dared not run the risk as t
 the proviso mentioned by the eagle we an
 fully aware of its impoi lance we shouli
have imagined however that uhenthpedi
tot was on the subject of provisoes he might
with gieal propriety have added one or tvvi
more he might for example have require
an assurance from us previous to granting th
great fawn of an exchange with his lillipu
tian sheet that we were over six feet high
that we were not marked with the small pox
that we were long lank lean hungrylook
ing that we were redhaired that we had
hawknose that we wrote with a gold pen
that we did not cease to smoke chew am
spit continually that we could handle a cat
onine tails thatthat in short we were
 man exactly after the heait of the batesvilh
eagle made to order without a soeck of ani
but real saxon or norman blood in our veins
all these conditions the editor of the eagl
might have required they are all to ou
thinking quite as germane to the case of ou
 ability to make a good newspaper as the very
important proviso mentioned wemnt tak
a little time to arrange our answer v
it
should be very aoiry indeed to make any mi
take a blunder here would rum us forever
fortunately there is no necessity lor haste
i rome was not built in a day we will in
form the editor of the fage by and bye if hi
will confess his inability to find out for him
self meanwhile we will try to keep ou
j faces as white as we conveniently can an
r if the editor of the eagle should still suspec
us of being somewhat too dark we may re
mind him that lie blackness ot his heart be
mp as he is to the extent of his mean ability
the vile pandei tor and supporter of the rnfa
toons system of lavery will bring him a
j least to a level with the darkness of our color
so there vvr ieaye the matter to quote th
j veiy elegant and classic latin of the eagle

ed a series ot lecture to he delivered in the

most eminent literary and scientific men o
the country the hrst was delivered or
monday of last vk by hon horace mann
i of massachusetts the able successor of johr
quincy adams in congress this lecturt
was earnest eloquent and interesting arm
we judge cannot fail in have been suggestive
of much serious and usetul reflection on the
part of those who listened the lecturer at
tacked ihe prevalent vices of the age and
especially thoe most prominent in this count
ry with an unsparing hand he was justly
sever upon gluttony drunkenuess and
vicious indulgence showing that only whils
tri obedience to the laws of nature which are
the laws ol god can man attain to any high
 dege ol intelligence vutiie or happiness
ihe lecture by inn casa on thursday
evening wa a different sort of affair it
was full of the growth and greatness ot
america and her institutions doubtless ill
very true but not on that account any the
less flattering to jonathans vanity which
heaven knows needs no flattery there was
also a very frequent reference to leonidas
aristides theimopylar arereminding us
altogether too forcibly of the essay ot a school
boy who has just read his second latin book
at school the lecturer s name drew a very
j litge and taabknablc crowd who appeared
interred and mstructed we do not know
i whit was the general a subject or whether
he bi j any particular subject besides
amencs leonidas and tbemopyhr be
talked at considerable length cf the egyptian
pyramids and the wonders of ancient art
were it not presumptuous in us to character
ize the effort of such a man as geo case
who has long bees before and is well known
to the world we should call itnothing in

account of their recent experiences
new yoax nov th 
we left rochester as you know about a
week since with a little colored boy about
five years of age and took the cars to alba
ny we were amused on the way in watch
ing the countenances of our fellow travelers
how their brows knitted with astonishment
when then eyes fell on the happy face of the
child and they made the discovery that hia
skin was dark reproach and scorn were
next depicted on those unhappy haggard
anxious faces and they looked at us with
an expression that said who on earth are
you one person daring the day having
more christian charity than his neighbors
thinking that we did not look quite out of out
minds suggested the query was the little
boy lor sale the boy was happily uncon
scious of his color being anything to be mar
vclef at and looked all his enemies in the
face with the puie trust and confidence ol
childhood we reached albanv in due time
and the steamboat oregon was awaiting
the train we started down the hudson riv
er about  past  oclock and the general
saloon becamtttl once the scene of excite
ment there were two white ladies and a
little colored child in company of course
the lad could not joinus at the suppet table
we weie not disposed to fight the battle on
this occasion so we went down without him
we had the privilege of sendingour little friend
some supper and he we suppose on accounl
of his tender age had the privilege of eating
it in the saloon where have they picked
him up w s the question whispered by all
ye however were much fatigued with out
long days journey and soon put an end to the
scene by retiring to our sleeping apartment
we have met since our arrival in this city
with an instance of colorphobla in a quartei
where we least expected it we accompa
nied a friend to visit the asylum for the blind
and there wc most certainly encountered
blindness of a twofold nature a death had
occurred in the establishment on the day wt
visited it and we were consequently informed
that we could not then go over the institution
but feeling tired with our walk we seated
ourselves in the pailor where there were six
or eight young ladies inmates of the institu
tion at work we were introduced as fneods
from england and chatted with these blind
ladies during our stay we asked several
questions about the establishment its rules
and regulations who were numbered among
its distinguished visitors the names el
henry clay and lewis cass were mentioned
just as we were preparing to leave one ol
our party asked are blind colored chil
dren admitted here some say that the eyes
are the seat of expression but could you have
beheld the malevolence and animosity eviden
ced in those sightless faces on this question
being put you would not be of that opinion
we never used to have colored people
was the rejoinder now we have five or six
but ihey are not allowed to board in this es
tablishment and we never associate with
them they are kept by themselves and are
taught separately then followed on the
part uf these young ladies a simultaneous
hurst of indignation against the colored peo
ple in general suppressed murmurs that they
had ever been brought from africa the trou
ble they cause in this country and vehement
declarations that they would never sit at ta
ble with colored people and on no account
would they consentjto marry one of them one
of out party endeavored to impress upon the
minds of these doubly blind ladies the extreme
folly and sin of their present cruel prejudice
against their colored brethren aud sisters and
we trust that our visit to the blind asylum
has not altogether been in vain

we still led deeply impressed with ihe

i viio that for all the antislavery action

 kesolved that then is ample power un

i io ilus dire alternative but firmly be
uni slavery will be finally abolished by
il v ooperitiou ot the friends of freedom both
norili iul south
i resolved that vve regard ihe institution 
ii aiikifan slavery as belonging in its origin
most barbarous agesa relic ot tlie
iioiiuable form ot war and that what
t r s and aspirations we may indulge in
ercttct to the bettering of our social poliii
i l j religious condition aside from ihe an
iismvuy platform of action we hold and be
ihat through the instrumentality of the
 nned mates government and the american
fluffh slavery in this country will he over
hrown
j resolved that recognizing the duty to
withdraw all voluntary support from the slave
svsipui to maintain personal punty and con j
 ieicv and to neglect no opportunity to
a tin antislavery question upon the hearts
nhe people we earnestly recommend to all
droiiliuniats to abstain from the products of
slave labor and prelei products ol tree la
mr i far as is practicable
rtulved that inasmuch as llu slavehol
det has no right to keep hi slaves in bondage
old theiefor that tho siave has a light to es
aje to freedom it lie can and we have con
pintiv itti right to hiudei him from doing
 retake and reenslave him and as
at haveno light to make promises which
iiiimt lightfully be kept or laws which can
not rich thill v be obeyed it follows that the
provision of the american constitution which
the giving up ot the runaway slave
o his master ought never to have been adopt
ed and ought not now to be obeyed nor have
vc any right to promise obedience to it
resolved therefore that we hereby repeat
ti announcement of our fixed purpose never
n aid in the recapture and reenslavement of
tbe escaping bondman nor tupromise support
i oitedience to the constitution while it con
jitc ihe provision alluded to but will always
oik best of our ability as opportunity of
jis help the fugitive to gain and keep that
priceless blessing which he seeks and to
a let lie has an inalienable right
resolved fuat we have no right to aid o
promise toaid in putting down by bloody vi
olence an insurrection of the slaves tor free
join because if it is right to fight in defence
 our most sacred and precious rights the
slaves would be light in such an insurrection
hid of course to fight against them would fj
rung out it on the other hand it be wrong
to fight in defence of our own lights still
iiiu must it be wrong to fight against the
iiujot sacred anu precious rights of our leliow
jn 
therefore resolved that while hecon
ulution requires us to go at the bidding oi
an slave state and suppress by force the ef
tort oi the slave to win liberty by violence w
lave no right to promise and will not promi
pport oi obedience to tliat consimmon
in resolved that as we have no right t

the literary world publishes th
following extract from a letter recentlj
read before the ethnological society
at a meeting held in new york iron
the hon george squier minister o
the united states to central america
giving a brief account of some anti
quarian researches in which he has
heen engaged
although i have been much occu
pied with otficial business says mr
squier i have in the intervals whicli
ottered during the progress of my ne
gotiations and since their termination
been able to pay some attention to the
antiquities of the country i have suc
ceeded to an eminent degree in obtain
ing the coniidence of the indians and
have secured some of their vocabu
laries in fact the indian pueblo ol
subtiava has presented me a formal
address written in tho aboriginal
tongue and would rise in arms tomor
row at mjr call in presenting it the
spokesman exclaimed with startling
emphasis the spaniards have had
their feet on our necks very long we
hope the sons of washington will over
whelm them as they have us we hate
then it sounded strange to hear the
indian talk of washington but his
name familiar in every rancho and
haiti sons ol washington is a com
mon salutation from barefooted inotut
on the toed tbs indians or subtiava
have dug up for me a number of their
idols and are now exhuming more
they impose but one condition that i
shall have no spaniard with me when
i go to see them and shall keep the
ocalities secret these idols though
much emalter cloeely resemble those
of copan in workmanship and were
no doubt dedicated to the same or a
very similar purpose  have eight in
my possession ranging from five and a
half to eight feet in height and from
four to five in circumference the
laces of most are mutilatedan evi
dence of the fanatical zeal of the early
spaniard who waged a war of exter
mination upon the superstitions of the
aborigines they did not however
aueceed in eradicating them for they
are blended in a singular manner and
no ineonsiderabie proportion with
the calboiis rites imposed by the con
qeeroas
uetty an indian within the sound of
the bells af the cathedral offers his
libation of title ground parched corn
and sugar mixed with water to the
gods of the fields for the success of his
crops end secretly burns gums from
the forest before an earthen idol or a
caned atone carefully hidden from the
scrutiny of the priest in some obscure
corner of his hut upon these matters
they however maintain all the reserve
of the indians of the north strength
ened by fear of exposure to the rigors
of the priesthood some of the sta
tues to which i have referred have
the same elaborate headdresses with
others ot copan one bears a shield
upon his arm and still another has
risen above its head the sculptured head
of an alligator all are very ancient
and the places of their deposits have
been handed down from one gene
tion to another the fragments oi
many are to ho found within a few
miles ol leon and there must origi
nally have been a great number scat
tered over the country
perhaps the most remarkable locali
ty with the exception of the island ol
ometpe in lake nicaragua is the isl
and of momotnmbita in the lake ol
monagua i paid a visit to this island
early in july it is a beautiful volcanic
dome rising with all the symmetry ol
a sugar loaf from the midst of the lake
before it towers the great volcano ol
motnotombo from the bare and black
ened summit of which still rises the
smoke of internal fires momotombita
is indeed a remarkable island and the
traveliar who gazes upon it from the
shore of the lake is not surprised to
learn that under the shadows and
amidst the gloom of its dense forests
fringed by the stems of ages stand the
rude and frownfng statues of the gods
of aboriginal superstition
many of these have been removed
and are scattered over the country
and some i believe have been sent
abroad a number still remains but
the largest of all i brought away with
me at the cost of a days bard labor
and at great risk in passing  miles
upon the lake and in a gusty night
and a boat scarce able to sustain tiie
great weight this bad resisted the
exertions of imen on one occasion
after moving it a few rods they bad
abandoned it in despair the boatmen
thought me mad and crossed them
selves devoutly when  proposed to
carry it away they offered prayers
on the lake and made vows after
breaking down one or two carts 
finally got it to this city in safely and
shipped it with ten or a dozen more
via kialejo and cape hope for wash
ington but to return it seems that
there were originally some thirty or
forty of these statues of various sizes
and more or less elaborately carved
arranged in one place in the form of a
square all looking inwards the di
mensions of the square cannot now be
ascertained hut the few remaining fig
ures and fragments show that the state
ment is correct
it is a singular fact and another
evidence of the prevalence in america
of the doctrine ol the two reciprocal
principles of nature the active and
passive male and female that these
figures were represented some as male
and some as female the indians of
i honduras says herrara wprshidken
two images male and female vvich
they call the great father and the great
mother and of which he says a little
further on the sun and the moon were
also representatives i have heard ol
other localities similar to this which 
propose to visit and shall therefore not
repeat what was told me concern
ing them
 must not however forget to men
tion that there has lately been discov
ered in the province ot vera paz 
miles northeast of guatemala buried
in a dense forest and far from any set
tlements a ruined city surpassing
copan or palenque in extent and mag
nificenceand displaying a degree of art
to which none of the structures of yu
catan can lay claim the government
of guatemala sent a commission to ex
amine it hut their investigations were
soon interrupted by the civil commo
tions of the country and they were
only able to bring away some rude
plans and imperfect drawings  shall
go there as soon as my duties will pea
mit  learn also of other interesting
monuments near by in honduras and
san salvador of which no public men
tion has has yet been made i shall
pay all the attention i can to these
although there is too much for man
to hope to do well but here goes
notwithstanding
victor hugo
the celebrated poet dramatist and
j novelist is a short man of apparently
i thirtyfive although he must be con
siderably older than lie appears in
form he is full in stature low his
bead seems vastly disproportioned to
i bis body the forehead is immense
and w hite as snow although he is not
bald his hair is black complexion
blonde mouth nose and chin small as
well as his eyes which are dark and
overhung by the brow expression
thoughtful and rather sad his neck
is so short and his shoulders so broad
j that he seems to wear his monstrous
head like the patagonians between
his shoulders nverthelcss hugo has
by no raetun an ugly or uninteresting
person fits dressand one may as
well attempt to sketch the outline of a
horse without his hide as to convey
the least idea of a man without his
dresswas a dark blue pants
and white vest with cotytir a la byron
this matter of the collar is peculiari
ty in paris everybody wears a stand
ing collar except hugo and montalem
hert and almost every one but these
wears short hair
hugo seemed always extremely
busy when i was in the chamber
reading pamphlets or opening and
reading letters and answering them
and at the same time laughing and
chatting with great animation and hu
mor to the numerous members who
called at his desk as a man of genius
and letters victor hugo stands in the
very first rank in france as a legis
latoros a popular speaker however
he seems not to have been se entirely
successful how much of this ill suc
cess has been owing to that absence
of practical ability which men of
genius often exhibit in tbe management
or discussion of public attain and how
much has been owing to tbst feeling of
jealousy so eften exhibited by proctieal
men st any infringement of men of let
ters upon what they deem thpir pre
rogatives is not easily determined it
however very certain that the grtti
poet was by no means toeceanl to
his first appearance in the tribune
and that itc has not been there since
a caricature of hugo has recently
caused some little merriment as it baa
collected a crowd at the windows of the
firint shops it presents a short fat
ittle man with a huge head sattiog in
a contemplative attitude pen in hand
upon a pile of boohs lettered poetry
romance drama re these booki
rest upon a cheat filled with bags am
labelled rentes hugo is wealthy
upon this pile of books sits the little
man with a big head hia elbow repos
ing against the towers of notre dank
one heel resting on the dome of the
french academy and the other upon
the theatre frauaais while on bin
right is porte st mart me in the back
ground are caught glimpaea of the
most unearthly objects that one would
suppose even the imagination of the
prince of horrors could evoke
there are various amusing pendptus to
the piece for instance a swum of
little are striving to climb the
great poets legs and to kiss the soles
of his boots the application of the
caricature to hugo is easy at paris
e stuffing and smoking
e dr culverwell says that medically
 speaking snuffing and smoking are
d both abominably unwholsome they
are delightful relaxations personally
e speaking for i have been a snuffer and
 a smoker  can bear witness to the
great comfort and satisfaction i have
derived from them
a cigar during an evening stroll is
 highly agreeable and companionable
but it is habit only which renders it
necessary it is pleasant  admit and
indies do likewise to catch the whiff
s of a fine havana on a frosty night of
an outdoor walk nor do i object en
e tering a bachelors crib where only
 real tobacco is going onbut a five
minutes stay therein is enough
 to those hom smoking causes to
 spit it is productive of great depres
sion and considerable nervous irritabili
ty to those who say they swallow their
 saliva it is equally pernicious to those
who are insensible to secretion it acts
 locally and its influence is conveyed
 by the nervous extremities to the brain
it would appear illnatured and cyni
cal to forbid a solitary cigar but as in
i this page i have only to do with its
salutariness i cannot speak in its favor
i have never suffered from it
may say someone welland good
 i do not forbid you taking one but it
surely cannot be wholesome for those
who do besides what is agreeable it
is very difficult to believe can be hurt
ful nevertheless it may be so and
smoking in the majority ofinstances i
am convinced is so
what is the property of tobacco
sedative stupefying creative of vom
iting and if swallowed in the form of
an infusion poisonous
let any man ask himself after spit
ting and puffing if he feel better for
it the reply generally is oh it is so
soothingit gives rise to such agreea
ble thoughtsit carries the mind back
to the pastit makes a man comforta
ble even in bis troubles how happy
r every one appears with a cigar or a
pipe in his mouth from the lord to the
basketwomana geat deal of this
may be true but on the other hand
the great smoker is generally shaky
and nervous and like the drinker
never happy hut when engaged in his
 favorite propensity of what use is
he then to anybody or even to himself
none the little smoker the occa
sional smoke breather before he
gets through his first or give him cred
it for two or three is left with a dry
mouth and a nasty taste a desire to
drink and although some will deny
that smoking provokes drinking ex
copt coffee or water few can dispense
with grog ale or wine other people
it muddles makes them swimmy and
very disagreeable to talk to
many men smoke twenty or thirty
cigars or pipes in a day and a young
town buck thinks it derogatary to his
buckhood unless he can whiff away
two or three to say nothing of the
nuisance of smoking the habit capti
vating and socializing as it may be
held to be is decidedly bad very bad
for delicate persons as to chewing
it is an expensive habit it is so beast
ly a one that there is little fear of an
invalid resorting to it it is equally
pernicious nay more so then smok
ing
snuffing is sometimes used medicin
ally and with much success light
i stimulative snuffs are useful in the
affections of the head and eyes and as
a gentle refresher i have no objection
to it but real snuffing where a man
i consumes half an ounce daily and soils
half a dozen pockethandkerchiefs in
the twentyfour hours for those sort of
snuffers awake purposely at night to
take a pinch is i contend very enerl
yating very depressing except at the
intermediate moment and extremely
hurtful even to digestion for despite
all the precaution the snuff or its juice
bah will get down the gullet
halt a dozen pinches after dinner
are allowable young men should par
ticularly avoid becoming snuffers a
very short indulgence makes them look
ten years older these habits are
very easy to acquire and very difficult
to leave off but it is not as some peo
ple say dangerous to abandon them at
the eleventh hour of your life
mayhap such may not be necessary
but i have known people give up amov
ing and snuffing which they bad in
dulged in for years af a moments
notice and those people have been my
patients and they have sooo found ma
son to thank mo for the advice
op a ciaiy
a deputy of his statnic majesty cal
limg on i catholic rsikst
the reverend father geiburg a
catholic priestsays a late german
paperwas lately awoke early in the
morning by his servant who said that
a visitor was iu the room below and
wanted to see him immediately the
good priect not feeling very well or
being reluctant to leave his downy
couch at so early an hour sent down to
know the business of the caller but
was told that as it was a matter of
the most vital importance it would only
be cotnmunicatud to mr geiburg him
self the servant described bin as a
well dressed gentlemanly person and
this induced the priest to bare him sent
ap to his bedroom so that after the
business was settled be might consign
himself for a few more boors to the
arms of somnus it was however
otherwise fated sleep did that morning
no more refresh the energies of the fat
priest the visitor was ushered in
and took a seat near the bed side
m whom bare i the honor of addres
sing said mr geiberg you see
before you the most miserable man
waa the answer whilst the visitor went
to the door and locked it inside so as
to prevent intrusion explain sir
explaio begged the priest probably
having visions of comfort of religion
absolution and a well lined purse
my errand is a most painful one re
turned the stranger painful both to
me and to yourself but my mind is
made up and it must be done he
goes for a confession thought the
priest know then sir continued
the stranger that last night i was as
is my custom busily engaged iu read
ing the word of god i was not only
reading it but also interpreted it tomy
self and derived much consolation from
it it was near midnight when i read
of the evil spirit how it in former times
appeared to men i could not believe
itl could not conceive how the al
mighty ruler in his wisdom could
create a power to tempt and mislead
weak mankind
the priest by this time must have
got much interested presently re
sumed the stranger i heard a noise
in my room and looking round j ob
served that i was no longer alone the
evil spirit was with mehe stood im
mediately behind my chair unhappy
man said he in a deep voice to dis
believe the word of god i knelt
down but he commanded me to rise
rise continued he no peace no
rest shalt thou have no comfort no
happiness shalt thou know until by thy
hands one of those who preach and sin
against me lias suffered death with
these words the spirit disappeared and
to save my soul from perdition  have
come to obey himyou must die
the reverend gentleman must have
been awfully confounded by this dis
closure he preserved bis presence
of mind and at once proposed to sacri
fice another priest instead of him to
which his visitor demurred the mani
acfor such he wasand mr gei
berg had of course discovered it then
beckoned to him to get up at the same
time taking from his pocket a good
sized knite the priest then coolly
