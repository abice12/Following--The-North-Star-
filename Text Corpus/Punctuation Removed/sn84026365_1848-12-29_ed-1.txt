message of the governor of
virginia
governor smith ot virginia in liisj
message this year refers briefly to
controversy concerning the attempt to
abolish freedom in our new territories
in a stylo that would not discredit the
chivalry of south carolina
but gentlemen i regret to see a
determination manifested in certain sec
tions of our union to exclude our
southern population from our new ac
quisitions  am mortified also to be
lieve that this determination is the re
sult in part of the conviction that we
will submit to such exclusion it is my
anxious desire to see this question set
tled during the session ot congress
which commences tiiis day hut it not
 have great confidence in the patriot
iun ol the senate of the united stales
and have strong hope from the position
and character of the president elect
that he will not permit this unjust and
oppressive policy to he c msummated
by giving to it ins official sanction it
however the policy of exclusion should
prevail by the passage oi the w ilinot
proviso or any other kindred measure
then indeed the day of compromise will
have passed and the dissolution ot our
great and gl irious l nion will become
necessary and inevitable may god in
his mercy however pass  cup from
our lips in the meantime  tecoin
mend the passage of firm and temperate
resolves similar in character and prin
ciple to those unanimously adopted by
the general assembly on the sill day
of march 

but not content with this by all
the arts of legislation we force him
below that position in the scale oi hu
manity t which he is naturally entitled
and is this state of things forever to
continue are the promptings of be
nevolence and the pleadings of philan
thropy to be in vamr iam aware that
our policy as indicated by our laws
cannot be relaxed the stem necessities
of our condition forbid it but there is
a way in which  would hope the condi
tion of the free negro might be alle
viated it is to deport bun l nd him
beyond our limits into communities
where the disabilities which op pres
him here do not exist where his moral
and intellectual qualities may be de
veloped and the great problem solved
t hi fitness and capacity foi freedom
shall u he done gentlemen or will you
s ill retain this class among us  a state
of hopeless neverending degradation
in my former messages i presented
this subject fir consideration and was
denounced fvmn ditf reiit quarters for
the inhumaney of mv proposition 
now repeat it and the question is w ho
is justly liable to this chargehe who
wishes to  eon ive tin free negro to
other places where fin will he freed
from our smildcgrudmg legislation
and where he would ha a right to
learn to stand up atd f i and say i
am a manor he who persist in re
taining him m our midt ibject to the
inexorable legislation k which  have
adverted lhi question  leave with
you and with the country without mi
easiness or apprehension
but the objection t the removal ol
ou free negroes upon the ground of in
hu u tility is not well considered m
other respects it is impossible that
such a population can have strong local
attachments indeed it is a teehng
very much weakened with all classes ol
our population from the habit ol emi
gration which has long prevailed
scarcely a tail of the highest re
the north star
 tm m a vwk ml l ilp k l
mjtcclability and wealth which has no
sent eut oue or more of their member
to people our western valleys ou
laves too with better habits and will
feelings of a purer and rilnre dbuiesim
character than those usually poesse
by our free negroes are dath emigrat
ing to the southu and thal frequently
from the necesities of masters with
out regard to domestic ties by out
law if a slave be freed he is jpin
pelled toleave the state no matter how
strong may he his attachments or whai
ties may he sundered we
familiar with the policy of removing in
dian tribes by force upon a large scale
and within a few years past and in
i deed we are indebted to thi policy for
the homes we occupy and the noble
stare or which wo are wafiisrty puw
with all proper deference then to the
opinions of others i conclude that there
ts in this objection nothing that presents
any re il difficulty
but the free negro seriously affects
i the value of our slaves he awakens
in the slave new appetites and wants
teaches the road to crime makes him
restless increases the spirit of insub
ordination and consequently imposes a
severity which otherwise would he un
necessary of the eightyone negro
convicts now in the penitentiary ten are
there for the crime of stealing and en
ticing away slaves
nor is this the only way in w hich
the free negro act injuriously in
every community of whites there are
some to be found with vicious and im
iroral propensities who are tempted to
jinmit crime from the ease with which
trev can obtain in the free negro a con
venient tool in this way nnd in many
others which h would not be proper
perhaps to enumerate the beauty and
purity of our social state is seriously
demoralized
although the fifty thousand free ne
groes in our statewith few exceptions
are known to be thriftless and unpro
ductive and live mainly by depreda
tions upon the labor of other yet they
congregate in our villages and do the
little jobs that arise in the progress of
ordinary labor wholly superseding by
the smallness of their compensation and
the character of its payment the em
ployment of white men thus creating
a moral necessity for the emigration of
no inconsiderable portion of our labor
ing white population i can appeal
with confidence to the experience of
every member of the general assembly
in support of the truth of the above
views and i ask if this of itself does
not give this subject a claim to your fa
vorable consideration
the legislation in relation to the
free negro to which i have heretofore
adverted is the result of long experi
ence and intimate knowledge of the free
negro race and cannot be relaxed
and we must deliberately and calmly
ask ourselves whether we will not at
oncein a bold and comprehensive spirit
adopt the policy i have recommended
which is plainly requisite for its happi
ness and the true interests and pros
perity of the state it is difficult to
imagine a policy more interesting to the
country or more fraught with the g od
of all concerned to us the good will
le broad deep and allpervading not
an element in our character not an in
terest in our beloved people hut will
feel its refreshing influence may 
not then hope gentlemen that in press
ing this important measure for the third
time upon your attention i shall not
have done so in vain
of the right to consummate this
measure  entertain no doubt i at
tempted to make that plain in my last
message the details of the plan are
few and simple and can be easily exe
cuted nor is there any difficulty in
finding places to w hich to send them
liberia the french and english is
lands and some of the free states
especially n vork and massacuhsetts
are all eager it i am to believe the evi
dences before me to receive them
the british islands  have no d mbt
from information in my possession
would pay the expense of all those sent
to them and massachusetts a few
years ago in an elaborate exposition tn
the american people admitted and
undertook to convince others that the
free negro is on american citizen nnd
entitled to go nnd come at will with
ihis acknowledged right he could there
find a home and not a vessel would sad
from our shores for that ancient and
prosperous commonwath hut would
lie happy to take a a cheap rate from
fifty to one hundred passengers then
where is the difficulty r in ten years
at an expense of j a year out
state mav be treed from the curse of
lour free negro population profoundly
convinced of the wisdom and humanity
of this measure and its allpervading
importance to ur beloved common
wealth i earnestly recommend it to the
general assembly

there are two kindij ot what may he
called thanksgiving there is a grati
tude which showing itself in thought
and word as love for the giver of ail
good things temporal and things jir
ttualshows itself also in act when
ever occasion is given in love for man
and unfailing duty in the unrestricted
imparting to others of whatever good
is given in wide philanthropy in re
membering those in bonds as bound
with them the poor aa having them
always with ua and this thanksgiv
ing whether it ifaowe iteelf in iu prac
fc
right is of no sextruth is t xf colorgod is the father of os alland all tfae breirejf
tical attitude or its devotional n equal
ly beautiful aod acceptable
 there is another kind which i less
j worthv its grantee is profession or
at belt se  fdeception recognizing
temporal woods as the  beginning aed
end of all blessings h one things
heedful in life it dwells on itsfmppt
nes in securing those if it oes secure
them with sixth intense vividness l tot
it seems kkc thankfulness ilcallstt
self gihtfful because it is jped and
exults thatil is not as other men lyejt
forgets that chiist said a rosfi hfc
cdhsisteth not in the abundance of the
things which he possessethtid values
itself and others by comparative worldly
possessions it forget that we are
not to live hy bread ajpnt d by
iwd slewthat body its
comforts and luxuries by material gc
quisitious and triumphs does it live
this kind of thankgiving is in
vainglorymaterialismiownesaof mioo
yet it is the ordinary vice of so
ciety this age and place have merits
as compared with others we are not
so indolent as some nations nor so
quarrelsome as others nor so sensual
as others and so on hut this one vice
this tnatei ialism this moneygetting
this living by bread alone is our
peculiar sin and must be recognized as
such and especially today beenuse
i think it conies so close to oer thanks
giving as often to counterfeit it inter
cept it and take its placeboth hnviqg
much the same foundation namely a
very vivid sense of temporal blessings
having said thus much i shall leave
the subject of abstract gratitude leave
the genuine and turn my attention to
the counterfeit which so besets it
for it does in truth beset us bn ev
ery side there is no one class into
which our minds so readily divide men
as rich and poor and from childhood
up we dwell to an extravagant nay
insane extent on this one idea a
prosperous inan is one who makes
money bn unprosperous onewho does
not yvhen we say a respectable man
a substantial man a solid inan we
mean a man of independent property
this is our ideal man aud i is a na
tional characteristic the romans dei
fied poverty and we find among others
nations a reverence for the willing ab
stinence from material blessings with
which we have no sympathy at all we
cannot understand for instance such a
man as the chinese hooi whose char
acter is stated in one of their sacred
books with an epigramic brevity which
is worth quoting in contrasting illustra
tions of our wcfrkyss a wise and
good man was urn a piece of bam
boo was his dish a coacoanut shell was
his cup his dwelling a miserable shed
men lied because tiiey could not endure
the sight of his wretchedness vet
hooi did not change the serenity of his i
mind a wise and good man was
hoi vve do not find this stoical
and placid renunciation of all material
comforts among us in any cause it
not only is not fashionable hut it is pro
nounced anything but wise and good
it is recognized as wise and good to
compromise principle a little a mini
mum in older to succeed in life jt is
not considered wise and good to live as
friend hooi lived if necessary for the
sake of an uncompromising abstrac
tion
and thus the temptation to fall in
with the popular estimate and sacrifice
conscience to comfort the soul to
bread is very terribly strong it
takes many shapes it comes to the
mechanic in the form of poor work and
much puffi ig it comes to the merchant
in the form of buying too cheap and
selling too dear it comes to the lawyer
i and the preacher in the form of sup
porting bad causes and opposing good
ones it come finally to the majority
j of the community in their political re
lations just now in a peculiar form
which because it is very important and
just now very apparent i shall take as
i the illustration of my text
another presidential election has just
passed the plans i spoke of long
since a year ago last august you may
remember as being then made to place
yet another slaehoding president at
the head of this nominally free repub
lic have been developed consummated
and carried through carried through
with theeonsent the approbation nay
the enthusiasm of a majority of you
if the fact seeifled to me important
enough to alluue to then when i was
here as an occasional preacher arid had
no ties with you you can hardly think
it strange if i hold it enough so to speak
of now when the majority t you have
defined your position on it and that po
sition so widely different y u know
from mine
 do not complain of rne for introduc
ing this subject again now that the
i electis past there are peculiar
j reasons for introducing it now that a
large majority of you who belong tn
the whig party have wholly changed
your position since the election ilu
points which complicated the question
before are left behind now the ques
tion is not n w whether a choice ol
evils could have been avoided not
whether a third party was practicable
not whether mr van buren was a til
leader of that party these were point
which complicated the question before
whig speakers dwelt clnetly on then
but they are gone now for do yoi
not see that by your express ns of de
light at the result of the election yoi
have voluntarily foregone all the de
fence you had when you candidly la
msnted for the necessary evil d
not you see that your very first cheei
for president taylor renounced tha
plea forever accepted him ns a gom
and thus identified your position will
hisso as to endorse him as a fit pre
sident lor you before gd and man
the question is not now whether it wtt
roghesm n y fripay december  
your duty to oppose when you though
opposition fruitless you have nt til
urn opffbecd hut going to the other ex
tre me jo havw accepted tije triuropl
asapcnr tviumph and rejoiced over it
ana fan tin i you art now to be held ac
countable the facts of his elect im
were before you jpd you all knew 
might have known them du knev
that hit nomination was flu
words of yur greatest man not fi

first brought forward by uitraslnverj
men avowedly as the ultraslavery can

then threw th wihnct provian on th
floor you kne that
men of the electioneered flw
and chose htyi on this groundbar
gaining however for as malty north
ern votes as they wanted you knew
that he was a man professedly of noi
the smallest political knowledge a inert
slaveholder and never could heve been
nominated of chosen but by this ultra
slavery influence you knew nil this
or ought to have known it audfyet
when the time came and this so huinii
iating final stroke of the slave power
triumphed vwu accepted it as your tri
umph anf illuminated your housesf
and why did yog triumph why
did the north or any part of it feel
this joy other reasons may have
mingled but ido from my soul be
lieve blush as  may to say it thavthis
one great reason stood and foivei
will stand in history underlying all
dvertopping all this that slaver pr no
slavery consistency or inconsistency
honor or dishonor that spirit in the
northern people which lives bybread
alone had secured its pjtqtfctive
tariff
protection that is the ton fasci
nating word which has taken its turn
this year and paralyzed tire conscience
and heart of new ft gland as k mis
called patriotism did last year there
is no intrinsic harm in protectitn as
there is nothing intrinsically wppng in
bread but w hen protection means
compromise of principle when protec
tion means help tome gained by the
sacrifice of honor the sacrifice of
pledges the sacrifice of the rights of
freedom and of the slave when it
means my dividends increased by my
consent being given to the proportion
ate increase of slave territory when
this is the meaning of that omnipotent
word then  say from sue i protection
god protect us for we need to be
protected against earthly blessings
which gain so utter a triumph over our
souls we need to be protected from
the condition which lives by bread
alone and to which all things else are
a visionary dream
a year ago many of you were indig
nant at the course pursued by the dem
ocratic paity in regard to the war
vou called it base and wicked and so
it was you said they shut their eyes
to plain facts took back their own
words were indifferent to honor jus
tice and humanity and voluntaiily con
sented to extend the area of slavery
but if it was base and wicked to do
this as they didto make these sacri
fices because carried away by the
bloodstained glory of war by the
childish love of renown by the con
temptible pride of biute forcetell me
how you christen it when precisely
these selfsame things are done only
under different circumstancesand more
glaringly by the other party from the
enthusiasm not lbr renown not for
force but fora protective tariff
do you doubt these things they
are easy of proof the dust of con
ffict and the smoke of victory may hide
them now hut history will recoid them
with terrific plainness i thiuk no one
even now who took much part in the
canvass in this stale can dübt that it
was that lenible bread alone which
carried the day other things were
freely agitatedthey would do to talk
aboutthey would do to salve mens
consciencesimpracticability f a third
j party objections to mr an buren
choice of evilsthese would do to help
i out those who hated to acknowledge the
base reality but a reality it was none
the less a lew thoroughgoing men
might stand for party merely as party
through everything a few unthinking
men might be sincerely convinced b
ha low c newspaper arguments and
shallower demagogue declamations
that g neral taylor was a second
washington and that the buyer of 
slaves was on tbe wlmle an antislavery
candidate and in many minds tiiec
j things come in secondarily to palliate
the deep wronglolness o the act still
the deep wrongorlnes remained and it
was that simple overwhelming tariff
firstly and lallv umn wlnch the con
i science of the north found shipwreck
 thus much for the motive and as for
j e act it is so old a story that i am
wearv of telling it a generation
hence and it will be acknowledged by
all a party professing to be antisla
very and antiwar has elected to tin

listened this week to frederick doug
lass and as i sat and looked at that
extraordinary man and trembled before
the voicanic words in which the accu
i mutated wrongs of an outraged race
bursttheir way through soul and
heard the depth of fiery earnestness
with which he depicted his own and his
brothers bondage and the withering
sarcasm with which he denounced the
hypocritical religion of our siaveholding
nation when i heard this and remem
bered that this man himself body soul
godgiven genius and all was once the
victim of this terrible institution and
that three millions were there still and
more coming i fell good heavens as
if  were a recreant to humanity to lei
one sunday pass in the piolessed
preaching of christianity and leave
the name of slavery unmentioned 
felt it a base selfish sluggishness in me
ever to let that fearful institution
pass from my thoughts as to omit the
mention of its name at least in prayei
or in preaching and so help me god
 nevei will again
and when farther i thought of the
position of this man among us coming
to us with his genius his virtues im
burning eloquence his sacred cause
coming and going without enthusiasm
without applause almost without a
friendly hand to grasp his in sympathy
and when on the other side i recalled
the enthusiasm you had called up with
in but a few days at the name of a mao
you never sawa man of no genius
no eloquence no sacred causenot a

feel insulted if i denied to any one o

of being called so there are times

jiointed to draft resolutions expressive of the
objects of the meeting wm lambert hen
ry bibb and ed j cooper were appointed
after a brief absence the committee returned
and through their chairman presented the
following preamble and resolutions
whereas the rights and liberties of the
citizens of the fiee state of michigan have
been trampled under foot and sacrificed to the
tyranny of southern slaveholders by the
unrighteous decision rendered in the late sun
brought by giltner troutman co of ken
tucky against comstockgorham and others
of michigan
and whereas in our opinion the said de
cision has deprived us of all protection and
security in our lives our liberties and in the
pursuit of happiness for truly it may now in
said of us that the birds have nests and tin
foxes have holes but the colored america
hath not where to lay his head in peace no
not even upon the soil that gave him biitli
heaven knows we have difficulties enough t
encounter in this boasted land of liberty te
ligion and bibles without being hunted dow
like the beasts of the forest
and whereas many of us have worn tli
galling chains of slavery and lite bee
hunted down and carried back and passd
through the fiery ordeal and we know 
sad experience its withering effects upoi
lnith body and mind and its damning inffn
ence on the soul we therefore cannot no
ever will believe that man has a right to hol
his fellow man as property therefore
resolved that we hold our liberty deare
than we do our lives and we will organiz
and prepare oursclves with the determination
live or die sink or swim we will never hi
taken hack into slavery
resolved that we will never voluntarily
separate ourselves front the slave popularity
in the country for they are our fathers am
inotheis our sisters and our brothers tliei
interest is our interest their wrongs and thei
sufferings are ours the injuries inflicted oi
them are alike inflicted on us therefore it i
our duty to aid and assist them in their at
tempts to regain their liberty
resolved that as it is our earnest dem
to be a peaceable and sobei portion of tin
community we will always abide by the eon
stitution and laws of this and all other state
which recognize no slavety within their boi
ders for we are not slaves but human beings
and never will snnmit tamely to be convene
into goods and chattels
resolved that this meeting appoint a com
mittee to draft a petition to ongress pravinj
lor the repeal of the law of  relative n
the recapture of fugitive slaves
after the reading of the foregoing pream
hie and resolution mr in lambert tool

listened to and read with lament interest by
the members of those noclefies published

pajietpjbr the press in pamphlet
they wive found their way through the
crowded city aad the quiet country havni
been preserved by the levers of liberty for all
as mementoes of the pastand become in some
j part a part ti the periodical literature of the
friends ofthe oppressed at the anntol
meeting of the western new york ami
j slavery society the executive committee
lay their report before the members of the so
tejetjr trusting tliat for the sake of our great
and hy cause it will be received with tlie
attention the importance of thntcausedemaads 
ami jhoping earnestly that all may be tfheered
by the signs of progress it makes known aud
stirred up to greater exertion by the evidence
it reveals fr the sad want of sympathy for
the enslaved in ibe public mind at the com
mencement of the year which is now closed
ihe committee made arrangements o raise
funds and employ lecturing agents in the
field the sum of  was pledged the
greater part of been paid and the
services of joseph c hathaway and chaites
l remond two wellknown advocates of the
cause secured as lecturers it was hoped
and confidently expected that with the sums
pledged these agents might be able to collect
enough in places they lectured in to be sus
tained in this we wete disappointed and
after a fair trial we were under the painful
necessity of dismissing them from the service
of the society
frederick douglass ever ready to do all in
his power to keep others from a bondage be
neath which he has suffered grievously of
fered to labor in ibis vicinity when his time
could be spared and has occasionally held
meetings in the neighboring towns by which
natch has been done to awaken the people to
a sense of their position and duty in this
connection we would speak of the north jstar
in this city as a cheering sign of promise and
aid of the character of the paper and the
reputation of its editors it is neediessto speak
for the paper is read by many and the labots
of those who conduct it are known and highly
valued by every intelligent lover of liberty and
light it is not easy in this day of beading
to measure tlie influence of the press and the
fact that in our city a weekly sheet is printed
and circulated devoted to the dissemination
of antislavery truth cannot but have a pow
erful influence on the public mind we hope
for a long continuance of the north star in
our midst and an increase of its circulation
and influence at the commencement of the
year we also resolved to open an antislavery
office and reading room in which an agent
should be employed to correspond with per
sons in different sections of the state attend
to the management of the office and raise
funds lot its support and for the society a
pleasant room was leased for a year in the
j most central part of the city by soliciting
th citizens a sunt was laisod sufficient to
furnish desks table showcase and a carpet
was purchased hv the ladies society thus
making the room attractive in its furnishings
i a good supply of newspapers from the ex
change list of the north star comprising
most of the antislavery and reformatory pa
per hi the country and many able political
and religion papers was placed iu the room
conveniently arranged and open for all to read
free of expense an assortment of anti
slavery  rooks was also purchaser the sale of
which it was hoped might spiead much in
formation and be a means of helping to sup
port the office as this was the only free
reading room in the city it was expected
that it would become a place of resort and
thus a means of light and usefulness the
fact that it has been visited by but few is a
sad proof of the little desne for information
on the part of the community catharine a
f stebbins was employed as agent for three
mouths and on the th of june when her
term of service expired sarah c owen was
engaged and has since bsen employed both
 those agents have made efforts to aw aken in
terest obtain funds and keep the public
aw are of the advantages freely open to all who
chose to avail themselves of them but their
success has not been such as to afford great
encouragement foi the continuance of the
office
the dissemination of radical antislavery
views for the past few months has been hin
dered by the fierce excitement of a presiden
tial campaign one of those periodical con
tests in which conscience is disregarded right
trampled under footand profligate mendacity
cunning trickery and bold bad acts for
which the very erpeiratoß blush in tlieir
calmer moments stifle for the time the better
i nature of the people and close every ear to
apjcalsfor the slave and yet in the election
which lias just been decided the clear eye of
the aliolitiomst can read evidences plain as
the noonday sun that the antislavery
question is reaching the nations heart and
becoming tht question w hich shall swallow up
all minor ones as the rod of aaton did the
ruds of the magicians of pharaoh in the story
of den time
the candidate out great party was a
j slaveholder a warrior grown grey in thecflpp
and on the plantation wedded to slavery bv
ry conceivable tie of birth fortune and
education and yet his supjrters have tried

every christian and philanthropist the duty u
lend then direct and untiring exertions for in
speedy overthrow
resolved that ihe age in which w
live is an age of progressive reform am
that all ministers laymen legislators or pri
vate citizens who disregard its requirements
o tar ns to close their mouths and stop thei
ears against the cries of the oppressed an
guilty of conniving at the flagrant injustice
unworthy the stations they occupy and trai
tors to the race of man
 resolved that god is a god of justice
and human reason and everyday experience
are fully demonstrating the fact that his jus
tice will lie mete out upon this guilty natior
for her sins of commission and omission will
regard to three millions of her subjects unlesi
she speedily repentsand lets the oppressed gc
free
 resolved that in the various relation
of hfe which we sustain to our fellowcitizens
we acknowledge too little attention has beer
given to our identity with our colored citizens
believing that upon it and their exertions de
pend the success of emancipation
 resolved tbit while we hail with joy
every evidence of progress on the port of those
who have heretofore been hostile to the snu
slvery movement we regard the free soil
platform as an unwarrantable compromise oj
the principles of human liberty and believe
that abolitionists are loudly called upon not
only to advocate the immediate emancipation
of every slave on tl american soil but also
to refrain from the performance of any act
which gives unction or countenance to the
exuteaoe of slavery anywhere tor a single
hour

our being would have made us all ot one hue
therefore it is the duty of the fnenda of hu
manitv to labor with untiring zeal tor the
overthrow of every uw which deprive the
colored american of oue right enjoyed by
those ot a paler complexion
 resolved that tt is the duty of every
colored man gf the state of new york to
spurn with indignation the offer of voting un
der it constilutitm for the price of two bun
died and fifty dollars
m resolve that we feel oprselves justly re
i buked liar the shameless custom of excluding
colored children from our schools and semina
ries of learning by the resolutions of the
english friends and the presents which they
have kindly sent to the mimes who defended
i the rights of the daughter of our respected
t fellowcitizen frederick douglass to the
privileges of seward seminary from which
she was excluded by the teacher mias tracy
ioa account of her complexion and we are
l happy to add that but one patiso voted for the
r proscription
j whereas actions speak louder than words
s that within the representative may be seen
 the character of the constituencythat nc
i people are better than their laws or their law
makersthat a stream cannot rise highei
i than its source that a sweet fountain cannoi
send forth a bitter stream that a good tret
cannot bear evil fruit therefore
resolved that the election of a warrior
 slaveholder and bloodhound importei to tht
j highest office in this country proven that tht
vast majority of the american people are ai
j heatl slaveholders slavetraders and blood
hound importers and only need to be placet
in circumstances favorable to slaveholding anc
slavetrading to become slaveholders and slave
traders
by john dickresolved that whatevei
evils exist in the present day and whatevei
other reforms may be agitated perhaps good
and likely to be productive of the best results
yet as slavery is the great sin and damning
curse of this nation that reform is the reforrr
which of all otheis demands the first plact
in the efforts of reformers without which ali
i other reforms will be valueless
resolved that the thanks of the westerr
i new york antislavery society be and here
hy are presented to the ladies in england scot
land and ireland who have given most unmis
j takeable evidence of their interest in th
 cause of the oppressed and downtrodden ir
this land by their valuable contributions tr
j the antislavery bazaar just held in this city
by frederick douglass whereas the
constitution of the united states by prpvid
ing for the slavetrade for twenty years a slavt
representation in congress by putting dowr
slave insurrections and the return of fugitive
slaves is a constitution against liberty in fa
t vor of slavery and such an instrument as nc
man w ho believes slavery to be a sin can con
i sistently support therefore
resolved that the only way by which we
 can free ourselves from the guilt of slavery
is to stand on the ground of no union with
slaveholders
i by dr chase of cleveland ohio
resolved that every effort made bv the
citizens of the south for the emancipation o
their slaves should be hailed with feelings ol
heartfelt satisfaction
resolved that congress should exercise
all its rightful power to wipe the continuance
of slavery from our national banner
j resolvedthat wedeeply deplore the factthat
other nations are and must be compelled tc
regard our professions of love of liberty su
perlatively selfish while we perpetrate the
 worst form of african slavery in our midst
by daniel poindresolved that pe
titions be extensively circulated for signatures
 requesting the legislature of this stale to
 instruct our senators in congress to use their
influence to have all laws in the district ol
columbia abolished which tolerate slavery
and the slavetrade and in case of failure to
i urge the removal of the seat of government to
a free state
by giles b stebbinswhereas the
north star is established in this city con
ducted with ability and fidelity and owing to
i the fact that it is circulated in this vicinity is
the organ through which we usually make
known our appointments and places to our
friends therefore
resolved that while we would not dis
courage abolitionists from subscribing for
other able and uncompromising antislaverv
newspapers we wish to urge upon all the
importance of subscribing for and aiding to
support the north starthat we rejoice ihat
i it has lived successfully through the first the
trying year of its existence and bids lair to

i hut to no two ways and means is the en

i george w clark e v capron and
richard sully concurred ii the expression
that they had io such prejudice but were
happy to accord to colored friends tlie same in
social life as to others
giles b stebbins remarked that there was
no cause for wonder that colored persons
themselves would shrink from opportunities
ofttimes cheerfully accorded when it wat
remembered what their treatment had been at
the hands of the whites reminding him of a
fugitive slave he had once assisted who or
being asked if he had any white blood in hit

frederick douglass had some words it

urging upon them always to treat man as man

length and with much ability the unite

thereof awarded their suffrages to the caodf

in butchering mexicans and his unwavering
fidelity to the bloody code of slavery the

apposite figures and called forth many de

that church in all the circumstances of the
case is one of the most degrading claim
w d could make and it is to be taken will
some allowance as a desperate means of de
fence seized only as the very last resort
what does all his triumph over what he re
gards our inability to point out the link
that binds st thomas church to the pro
i testant episcopal church of america imply 
i it implies that no such link exists that st
thomas church is neither in fellowship will
or in any wise responsible for the conduct o
that church or that the relation if any exists
is so equivocal and involved in so much dark
i ness that it will bejmpossible for us or an
one else to expose it to public viewthat th
i ordinary rules in denominational fellowship d
 not apply in respect to that churchthat ther
j is a wule difference between st thomas
i church in philadelphia and the white epis
i copalian churches throughout the union
i that though called by the name she has m
j the rights of a legitimate child of the pri
i testant episcopal church we do adm
that there is some justification for this clairr
i and that the relation of this church to th
j main body is somewhat mysterious thi
st thomas chqrch is treated as the offtprin
j of the bondwoman by the mother church an
that her relation to the abrahamic farnil
requires some little explanation she has a
the boast of having regularly descendedwhil
she enjoys no part of the inheritance she i
a sister episcopal church but her homely
and unhandsome features exclude her fron
the company and society of her sisters sin
has a mark upon her and her mother cauno
endure the sight of her she is black an
must not be allowed to associate with her sis
ters as it will injure their prospects in tin
world when company comes from abroad
i especially from the south to attend tin
general convention this unhappy child
must be meanly locked up or locked out
i whichever you please to have it lest he
j dark presence should give offence to the strung
era and thus mortify and lacerate the feelings
of her more comely and beautiful sisters
her mother is ashamed of her and her si
ters shrink in horror from contact with her
i a member of tbe family yet treated as an
i alien a sister yet treated worse than a
stranger when her name is called she is
made to answer by proxy lest her unme
lodious voice shall offend the refined and
sensitive ears of her dear episcopal sisters
j this is the oppressive position of the protest
ant episcopal church the mother and this
is the degraded position of st thomas
chutch the child and for the latter to glory
in her individuality in such a condition is tr
glory in her shame while the mother is
thus proved to be a she monster of oppression
j and tyranny the daughter is proved to be a
cringing and degraded slave we repudiate
the daughter for seeking to defend her wick
edness from just rebuke we regaid the
protestant episcopal church as no more
worthy to be called the church of the living
god than is a den of thieves and we calj
upon st thomas church to dissolve the
union with this old enchantress at onceas the
only means of vindicating her own self re
spect and placing herself in harmony with the
cause of right eon freedom
we might just here say a few words m re
ply to w ds allusion toahe impropriety and
coarseness of our language he seems
greatly annoyed by our redenes of speech in
calling his dear mother church an old hag
this grates hard upon bis sensitive and refined
ear we are by no means insensible of tbe
defective character of our language and are
not without hope of some improvement to this
particular we never expect however to
become so perfect in the use of language as
to please an opponent so fastidious as w i
we might adopt him as our model and use
the word apollyon when we mean tbe
devil and uae pit when we mean a
ami yet we could hardly hope to escape un
friendly eiittciam in this respect we bold to
the laigest liberty consistent with truth
may we be allowed to ask what better name
would he have to apply to a church which
claims to be the church of the living god and
yet retains wtthm ns communion sa good
christian men gutijv of the crime of man
stealing we apprehend after all it is not
so raneh the coarseness of tbe words which
we employ as the coarseness of the things

i that an impartial jury would do so ths
partiality of w d is very strong and it is
not impossible that it may yet lead him to
caat a veil over this brand of guiltiness
against the church of his partial regard hut
when he makes the attempt may we be there
to see
there is one other thing with which ue
are pleased it ia that the rev mr alien
referred to in a former article of ours as a
slaveholder proves not to be a slaveholder
this is satisfactory so far as it goes though
by no means all that can be rightfully de
manded we have been repeatedly told
when in philadelphia that this rev mr
allen was a slaveholder the denial as we
understand it merelydenies that he is now a
slaveholder hut does not say that he has
never been a slaveholder nor does it deny
that he has preached in st thomass church
while he was known to be a slaveholder
nor do we understand the denial to say that
the act of holding slaves would havo been a
harrier lo his occupying the pulpit of si
thomass church on this point we should
i like to be informed whether if bishop meade
a bishop in good and regular standing in the
protestant episcopal church should propose
to preach in st thomass church he would
i be admitted a e have doubt that he would
i be admitted nor have we any doubt that any
slaveholder would lie admitted into that pul
pit who possessed the authority of an ordm
ation phe reason of our confidence is drawn
in part from the d article of religion
found in the book of common prayer
 cording to the use of the protestant episco
pal church in the untied states of america
j the article referred to is as follows
it is not lawful for any man to take ujou
him the office of public preaching or minis
tering the sacraments before he be lawful
j ani rnt to execute the same and
those we ought to judge lawfully called
which bo chosen and called to tins work by
men who have public authority given unto
them in tbe congregation to call and semi
ministers into the eorda vineyard
w have now come to a point where
 ma y mak e some further inquiries that
i link in regard to our alleged inability i 
find which w d makes such a flemish nt
trumpets we have quoted here an artie
of the religion of the protestant episcopal
church having a direct and unmistakeabl
bearing on the very question at issue and the
investigation ot which may throw noim
light on the mysterious link which hinds st
thomass church philadelphia to the pro
testant episcopal church of america the
first question is as to the genuineness of tins
article ihe answer is we have given bur
authority namely the common prayer
book of the protestant episcopal church tu
the united states of america the next
question is as to whether the article is bud
ng upon a part or upon the whole protestant
episcopal church obviously and unavoid
ably it it lie binding upon any it is binding
upon all or if otherwise the exceptions
would have been stated the next question
is does st thomass church receive ami
this hook of common ptayer or does she
reject and repudiate it  if the former how
can she escape the obligation which tins
article imposes and if the latter how dare
she assume to be a protestant episcopal
church here is the rub that church is
either under the authority and in cotuniunion
with the protestant episcopal church d
america or its tide is a gross fraud upon the
public if she is under the authority of he
church she is bound to receive whom the
church may see fit to senda slaveholder or
any other villain and it she is not under the
authority of the church then are all her j
ular pretensions before the world an tumui
gated imposition take which alternative
you please one or the other you must take
ami that early or sutler the imputation ot a
somew hat suspicion character but we look
not for dodging we shall watch foj good
nil ue have strong reason tor doing other
wise we shall therefore expect you to al
low that the article in question is biimling
upon st thomass church and that while
she remains in the protestant episci i
church she is solemnly bound to honor id
comply with it
we shall be able to give a little more light
on this link at a future time as we mean
to make ourselves thoroughly acquainted
with the government of the protestant kpi

we leave w d tar the present anu wo

messrs editors in your editorial of

the real question at issue between w d

is not whether ordination is right nor is it
whether christ was in favor of oi opposed to

question at issue the question is this is

joying the calmer satisfaction of knowing that j
for the present at least  have but the j
one point to keep in view and here  would i
take pleasure in dispensing with further pre
liminaries and proceed at once to consider
how the affirmative part of tills question has
been sustained by you hut there has been
so much dust raised round and about it
whether bv the heels of your retreating forces
or lv the hurry and bustle of arranging your
main body yet occupying the field i am not
anxious to determine but all this must be
eleued away before we shall be prepared to
see how you have disposed of what you now
admit to lie the only point at isue
in my second communication with the
north star  explicitly stated that my re

said respecting st thomaschurch our
readers know that  adhered to this strictly
h is true that as a foundation for a future and
separate argument we submitted whether
or not the protesant episcopal church either
in her general or diocesan onventions lias
ever declared herself hostile to the antisla
very movement ami substantially said lasted
this charge from her own published docu
ments and after that is done then show the
link that holds st thomas church in the
same hostile position besides this point out
if you can m any part of iny long letter so
styled the least allusion to t lie church at large
much less anything like a defence of its anti
slavery character this is the false position
you have vainly tiied to force me intoyou
have even made me complain that the episco

of neutrality this  said not with infer
ence to the episcopal church generally but
 said it as you ought to have known with
exclusive reference to st thomaschurch

the line of argument pursued by s h foster

t of the various churches on the subject of sla
very does he not look into their several

is true he is brought np from the pit this
time not for the purpose of ridiculing ordina

to show the practical working of a rigid ad
herence to an exclusive rule the ex
planatory motive is duly appreciated but i
i must say i do not see any great improvement
in the image the devil is the devil paint
him as you may and i cannot allow the
posubihty of his appearing in holy orders j
for any purpose w hatever why so fond of
dressing the archfiend in robes and then
holding him up to view iet the execrable
shape go back to his punishment worn
and weary of removing obstructions that
were skilfully placed in my path  have at
length arrived at an elevated spot where 
can take an unbounded survey of the particu
lar point at issue
it is affirmed by the north star that st
thomas church philadelphia is hostile to
the antislavery movement how is this po 
sition sustained  the protestant episcopal
church in the united states is arraigned
witnesses are called up and examined two
scriptural rules are brought forward to fix
upon her brow the brand of hostilityby
their fruits ye shall know them inas
much as ye did it not unto these the least of
my brethren ye did it not unto me the
former of these rules refers to sins of commis
sion the latter lo sins of omission this
seems to be more relied on as testimony to
fix the brand of hostility negatively fwell
let us admit the force of this to its full extent
which may be thus expressed she has not
done what she ought to have done in the
cause referred to verbal testimony is next
j called up and says she has never treated
slavery as a sin it has never expressed the
first word of sympathy with the iitislavery
movement or even thanked god for its exist
ence or expressed a hope that the movement
would succeed i shall not attempt to de
preciate the character or lessen the force of
this negative testimony we are travelling in
a pleasant road now and seem to be accom
panied with congenial spirits hence we ad
vance rapidly next appears documentary
i evidence containing names both of the living
and the dead these doctrines represent lay
men and bishops uniting to exclude from the
theological seminary n y two young
men of wellcultivated minds noble aspira
lions and sterling worth merely because
their skins were not colored like their own
they disclose the additional fact of certain
colored episcopal churches being denied re
presentation last of all the graveyard
 tombstones inscriptions on coffinlids all
have been made to utter with one united
 voice against the criminal at the bar but
what does all this array of testimony amount
to  what would be the verdict of an impar
tial jury from the testimony adduced i
i have no doubt but they would fix the same
brand of guiltiness upon her forehead that
marks every other denomination of professing
christians in the country the guilt of un
christian prejudice against the people of color
but who ever denied this whoever sought
to make light of palliate or conceal it you
do the writer of this great injustice to sup
pose that he is blind to or the least insensible
i of the withering spirit  hatmeets us in all
tbe various white churches in the country
 but what bearing has this upon st thomas
 church  how do you fasten the guilt upon
j her merely to say that she is a branch
lot the church shown lo be guiltof the sin
jot omission on the great question of human
liberty will not answer is the son lobe
i held accountable for the sins of the father
jsuiely not  shall not fuither antiepate on
this point should a regular and direct at
tack be made here  stand ready to meet it
approaching the close of your remarks i
observe the following statement designed par
tially to show the practical working of a
strict adherence to a rule exclusive and
partially to show that our church by her
practice is hostile to the antislavery move
j ment while you would not admit fred
erick douglass m k delany or charles l
remond to speak for the slave the rev t
allen a notorious slaveholder has been re
i peatedly an occupant ot the pulpit of that
i church now so much of this as relates to
mr allen in justice should be recalled
your mind has been greatly abused with re
gard to that pious and devoted man so far
is he from being notorious as a slaveholder
that be claim no human being on raith as a
slave so you must look for some other oc
cupant of that pulpit that will render you
greater assistance in making out your case
ouce more after first naming yourself you
have taken the responsibility of attaching the
j names of two other gentlemen equally re
markable with yourself for their dignified
bearing and aelfaespect and who  am sure
do not feel hemaelve highly complimented
in being represented aa complainants for not
having been aa freely admitted into the pnlpu
as mr allen so l think wc may regard
their names at misplaced and yrar own left
singly and alone on the top of sev
eral yean will yet have to para away before
i shall attain tbe age of fifty wens it not
 seniority might claim the right to aay a
 word tu you oat modesty but aa it is i for

bear take the following for a reply to the
complaint we have a ferge fonts ratoon
under the control of the vestry in which
messrs harned bacoo boad burleigh dr
elder and fort though not feast dr j j g
bias have ail severally spoken they catered
through tbe door whfcti was unbolted then
and ramaira an to tbe present what bow ia
the present state c thfr queatjto af
firmed that st thomas chartfi was bufeth
to tbe antislavery movement to sustain
this charge you have show that the general
episcopal church is gmity of entertaining un
holy prejudices against their colored brethren
you may say if you please that you have
shown her to be proslavery but i inquire
have jou pointed out the prosiarery link that
holds st thomas church in the same bosui
position  in this you hate completely failed
st thomass as yet remains unaffected in
view of the unfounded charge that has been
brought against her i find her look mg the
accuser full in the faceno joints trembling
no mnscular motion w hatever is perceived that
indicates either shame or remorse bat i be
hold her standing on the firm ground of her
individuality with all that calm composure
which conscious innocence inspires you
may if you please violate every rule of pro
priety by condescending lo use coarse old
hag descriptions of the mother church the
offspring nevertheless will continue to siand
forth justified decared innocent of the slan
derous chaige of hostility to the cause of the
slave by the united voice of the thinking
discriminating and impartial portion of your
readers

the free soil demonstration
the free soil party having passed through
the ordeal of an electioneering campaign
armed and equipped according to the usua
custom may now be regarded as a legitimate
political party destined doubtless toact a con
spicuous part in the mighty struggle between
liberty and slavery which is yet to he witness
ed upon american soil
at no time since the consolidation of the
present union has there been so favorable ar
opportunity for the formation of such a party
the elements have long been generating hu
we do not believe they will work well in r
political movement unless it is an age or twe
in advanpe of the times a long lime mus 
elapse before expediency will give place u
right in political affairs the oldschool abo
litionists have been laboring year after yeai
to effect a change in the public sentiment ol
the country in regard to the institution ol sla
very its brutalizing effects upon the bodies
and minds of its immediate victims and its
moral and political bearings upon the charac
ter and destiny of our county no labors
have been considered too severe and no sacri
fice too great to be made for the promotion ol
the desired object cursed as incendiaries
reviled as heretics and anathematised as fana
tics they have pursued their onward and up
ward course never retreating but always
advancing with a steady pace and theii
zeal has ever been tempered to suit the pecu
liarties of the limes from a little band ap
parently harmless either for good or evilthe
have become a powerful body in whose hands
rest the future character and destiny of out
country the above assertion may seem alto
gether too broad but considering the lelatior
of cause and effect we feel fully assured tha
j time will reveal its truthfulness the libert
party was an offshoot from the oldschool anti
slavery organization the slow process o
j moral warfare was uncongenial with its ambi
tious spirit heedless of the warnings tin
admonitions and entreaties of its fraterna
friend it rushed headlong into the arena o
political strife where it struggled througli
brief and inglorious existence until it wai
i compelled as an act of selfpreservation t
i merge itself in the free soil movement
may its unenviable fate be a warning to ihos
political bodies which assume that it is law
ful to do evil that good maycome tin
advent of the liberty parly may be regardei
as the commencement of a series of analytica
experiments upon the political conscience o
the country but the project was premature ii
its inception and development the requisil
means were not at the command of the party
which sadly overrated its own influence it
hopes of success were based upon fictitiou
grounds for its fraternal friend refused to re
cognize it as the exponent of true antislaver
principles and its dismemberment was bu
the fulfilment of the prophesies which attend
j ed its birth
the free soil party may he regaided a
the second experiment it is a slight advanc
upon the former embodying its most availabl
elements and destined sooner or later to b
absorbed by or expanded into some othe
movement originating in the exigencies of lb
times neither theliberty nor the free so
party can claim the merit of laying its ow r
foundation for it was designed by othe
heads and worked out by other hands and
in building upon it the political parties hav

from the n y ailv
colifornia gold
arrival of don jose dalvear the first discoverer nj
the ifold mineslntnesting dnelspemenf
don jose dalvear the celebrated spanish
geologist whose famous treaties on the age
of the earth must he known to many of
our readers has just arrived at new york
from the gold regions of california by way
of panama cbagres and new orleaqp
bringing with him a large amount of gold
ore estimated to hr worth more than a milllion
of dollars the result of his labors by the aid
of a large body of indians long before the
existence of the gobi mines became known
to the residents of california generally
signor dalvear went out to california
nearly two years ago in consequence of
certain information which he had received of
the geological character of that country with
the firm belief that vast mines of precious
metals would be revealed there upon careful
investigation he was encouraged to this
enterprise also by his confidence in the
powers of a certain magnetic instrument
i which he had invented called the goldome
ter by whose aid he expected to be directed
j at once to the gold placers if any such
j existed nor were his expectations disap
pointed his scientific calculations proved to 
lie founded in truth and profound wisdom and
i his new instrument the goldometer ful
filled his highest hopes in less than two
months after reaching california he struck
i upon one of the richest gold mines in that
country upon an obscure branch of the sao
ramento river in a grorge of hills extremely
rocky and difficult of access and seldom vis
 ited by the native california disguising
i his object under the pretence of purely
scientific research he obtained tue aid of
i some fifteen nr twenty simple and  faithful
 indians and steadily pursued his task col
lecting often more than looo worth of gold
in a single day which he concealed in a deep
ravine without exciting any suspicion what
ever until after the discovery of gold at capt
sutters mill when the mountains were
ransacked by gold seekers and signor dal
vears gold placer the richest in all cali
fornia was lset with greedy adventurers
it is now found that the real mines or sources
of the gold he in the gorges of the moun
tains and not in the beds or sandsof the
rivers
don jose dalvear was beyond all ques
tion the first and real discoverer of the gold
minec of california and he deserves the
more credit for this as his discovery was
based ujion profound scientific calculation and
was not the result of accident the evidence
of these facts which he possesses inthe shape
lof well attested documents from persons
high in in california place the
matter lieyond all doubt
signor dalvear now visits the united
 states where he was for several years a
 resident for the purpose of disposing of his
gold and investing it in safe and improving
i property and also for the purpose of obtain
ing the necessary apparatus and material for
constructing his new instrument the gold
j ometer which is now in great demand in
i california hut the means of constructing them
j was not to be obtained previous to leaving
i california he sold his ow n instrument a very
i imperfect one for  w hile they can
in reality be made for less than o the
person who purchased it confidently expected
to make a handsome fortune by simply finding
gold placers and selling out the right ot
digging to the gold workers as  the
li principle upon w hich the new goldometet
fj or gold finder is ttwstrucied we have no
knowledge signor dalvear it is under
stood will for the present keep it a secret
i as it would lc impossible to protect a patent
j if one were taken out it is very simple in
tj construction and is worked somewhat like
the oldfashioned vvitchhazle roj formerly
used in seeking for water
signor dalvear is ol opinion that vast
t deposits of gold will yet be found in the
r united states of a qnaiuy vastly superior ui
that recently discoveicd in n lrgima and north
carolina and that the other mineral riches ol
 this country are inconceivably great the
 signor is profoundly skilled in the mystenei
of chemistry geology electro and ital
j magnetism and other curious branches of
philosophical study which it must lie granted
i he has turned to good acooun in the present
r instance we believe it i his intention w
publish some account of his invention ot tb
 goldometer before returning to california

a scene on the mississippi
i that i took my departure from
the crescent city on board the steam
p t of cincinnati
j captain h while lying in port
there wag a youog man ol noble nfh
pearance came on board and took bertha
for himself and wife for some port in
indiana and paid the fare but when
he brought her on board of the boat
the captain told him be would bare to
tako his wife down on deck for ho
thought she had some nigger blood in
her here some words followed be
 tween the husband and captain wwch
ended in putting the lady on deck and
refunding the passage money they
informed me fhat they were from baton
rouge and were on the way to indiana
 to purchase a farm
the young lady had at her breast one
j of he fairest and prettiest children that
i ever saw apparently about ten months
old the mother was of a truly femi
nine appearance she had long black
hair dark blue eyes and a very deli
cate form boon after she came on
board the boat was nut in motion for
her destination up the father of riv
ers the weather was fiue but rather
warm for that time of the year the
evenings were very pleasant in fact it
was the only time for enjoying our
selves there might be seen in every
direction small troops of passengers
promenading the decks watching the
vessels as we glided past them as it
were with lightning speed some were
discussing the policy of the present
war whilst others were looking forward
with pleasing anticipations to the time
when they should see their friends and
relatives all was life animated life
the boat herself seemed to feci her im
portance and darting through the wa
 ter with majestic strides she left a dark
cloud of smoke suspended in the air
ike a banner far astern in the wake
of the boat could be seen the rippled
waves sparkling in the rays oi the
moon giving strength and beauty to
the splendor of the evening but our
happiuess was not ot long endurance
for upon the boat landing at natchez
the captain informed the authorities ot
that town that he thought he had on
hoard of his boat a young runaway
slave they of course repnired imme
diately to the boat but could not find
their victim until she was pointed out
to them by the captain they then
dragged her ashore and put her in jail
until her husband could get what he
had forgotten namely a certificate
showing that he was legally married to
her the boat shoved of and we left
them in tears i could not myself de
tect anything in her countenance or
conversation that would condemn her in
the north from walking in the highest
circles of society now this is hut an
everyday occurrence in the south
where the institution of slavery pre
vails and yet northern christians have

answers its beneficent purposes except

full blessings of that and to nearly all
the excellent uses of life are postponed

fight the battle of life as fiercely as the
j worst
the good and generous man age to
cull some happiness out of their cares
while suffering for the present and la
j boring and praying for the good time
coming but the average of human
history is a mournful story punctuated
all alongwith tombstones and embellish
ed with the monuments of those who
have died to atone for the sins of the
j world
these deaths however mean some
thing that more than compensates for
the melancholy which they awaken
the cross of the sacrificed is the
mystic symbol of the worlds eventual
redemption every martyr ascends to
the father to receive good gifts for
men every life loyally devoted and
generously offered up swells the trea
sures laid up for the world the
children of the slayers become the
heirs of the slain the victims whom
their fathers slew become sacrifices for
them the slaughters of each genera
tion are the sacraments of the next
and humanity will at last be regen
erated in the blood of its own martyrs
this must be the divine philosophy
of that providence which sends its
chosen ones out into the world like
sheep among wolves the world must
work out its own redemption through
the divinity of labor and the sacredness
of suffering this cup may not pass
till it is finished but not until the
whole system of suffering and sacrifice
is ended and the divine order insti
i tuted will the earth be regenerated
tariff philosophy the mail
which is always on hand to advocate
protection by tariff sticks to the
i profound argument that because for
eign governments have partly deprkfed
our laborers of their markets our gov
ernment has a right to go on and deprive
them of the whole or a part of what is
left the model government of eng
land burdens and trammels our farmers
who wish to trade with the inhabitants
of that country and this passes whith
j the mail for a reason why our govern
ment should burden them still more
o logic
the mail cannot see how the proper
reward for labor can be secured by an
open and direct competition with the
pauper labor of europe does it see
i how the ohio farmer can raise corn and
sell it hiring free labor in competition
with the stolcu labor of kentucky i
why don t we have a tariff against the
i slave states but if the pauper labor
of europe actually can make goods and
send them to us cheaper than we can
j afford to make them then we must do
just as we should have to it an inex
i haustible mine of cloth were discovered

fool would think of manufactuaiug cfotli
j in such circumstances r who but a
fool in the staging business would asli

t but the moment you begin te talk kin
to practical manufacturers they will tel
you that our domestic fabrics are bettei
land more durable than the foreign
r oaee this in many instances is true
imte here sometimes learned to out

itesats lower then tbe american tb
i honesty of a honjg manufacturer ii
more reliable than that of ft foreign
oneoat of ghlwith equal skill
ftud care in regard to the pjearaice
of oar goods we can beat foreign pau
i per labor and this is ft natural war of
r retaining our market it ift all humbug
i ft the mail refy well know that the
i euf of our manufactures ibpend at
aon a tariff for their
f of them would exist and be piswbre
t if the tariff were entirely abolished to
t day because our natural advantages
lor roan u fact a ring and the skill of our
people more tbso counterbalance the
i greater cheapness of labor abroad
the idea that a great nation having
t plenty of soil water power coal cot
ton intelligence cannot find profitable
work to do without restricting its own
citizens from trading abroad is so
stupendously absurd and ridiculous that
t one has no patience to argue against
it
i take the several countries of the
world the problem is to make them
all rich by their industry will the
i mail say that every one of them will be
i bene fitted by having its trade with the
i rest restricted we think pot it
i will probably say thftt there may be
some countries so situated that let the

more irregularity a revolu
tion occurred recently in the kingdom
of nepaul india in consequence of a
religious vow made by the queen that
she would sacrifice  people to
the gods if the king recovered from
sickness he did recover and the
queen was about to execute her vow
when the people rebelled and deposed
the reigning family english paper
we consider this conduct ol the peo
ple of nepaul decidedly irregular the
proposed sacrifice it is true was some
what large but it was strictly in ac
cordance with the conventional usages
and longestablished customs of the ne
paulitans the timehonoured plat
form of the kingdom had always inclu
ded a special plank for human sacri
fices the royal consort had only
strengthened and widened it making it
in current phrase broad enough for
every true citizen to stand uponin
deed specially made capacious enobgh
for them to lie down upon the citi
zens who arrayed themselves aganst
the extension of an institution which had
been sanctified by a hundred years
of usage werewe speak it in sorrow
rather than in anger bolters the
much injured family just deposed had
gone merely for thediffusion of an
institution which the high priests had
proved to be the corner stone of the
nepaulitan state measures not
men had hitherto been the motto of
the dominant party but these irregular
bolters have reversed the rule and gone
for men against that shortened measure
of manhood which the court prescribed
in the language of lord noodle
where is such conduct to lead what is
the tendency of making an issue on lit
erally a mere sectional question
what will be the consequence of this
arraying one part ofsociety against an
other the next step after this interfer
ence will be abolition we repeat the
abolition of rights guaranteed by the
constitution of the state why should
the people of nepaul have given up for
a merely temporary question the old
issues which have so long divided the
quiddoes and quoddoes of that pros
perous state and under which the for
mer had maintained power for twenty
five years we charge this to the spirit
of revenge on that part of the parti
sans of the old leaders who were some
years ago decapitated by the order of
the queen consort in gratitude for the
timely appeasing of a royal colic
these partisans had seen scores of
heads fall without deserting their alle
giance yet when orders came for the
sacrifice of  livesthe same us
age only a little more diffusedthey
bolted on the hypocritic pretence of re
gard for humanity and the rights of peo
ple we charge moreover what is in
finitely worse that the quiddoes and
quoddoes have united in an infamous
coalition under the specious and tak
ing pretext of free heads for the
avowed purpose of breaking down the
old party and we denounce the mon
grel alliance to the scorn and indigna

in neals gazette contrasting the po
liteness of americans with the boorish
ness of englishmen especially the
travelling portion of them closse with
the following anecdote illustrative of
the difference between the people of the
two nations in good breeding
a friend of oars happening to lose
his way in manchester accosted a well
dressed person apparently a merchant
and politely asked tor information the
jfthn bull stopped stared at our friend
and exclaiming confound you dont
you bother me hurried on would
an american whatever his taste have
answered a stranger thus rudely
another friend of our was once
ascending loch lomond in a steam
boat when a shower of rain coming on
he noticed a lacy near him who had
neither cloak nor umbrella and taking
off his mackintosh he offered it to her
her husband who proved to bo a
scotch barrister immediately stepped
forward to thank our friend saying
you must be an american for i
never knew an englishman to do such
an act
