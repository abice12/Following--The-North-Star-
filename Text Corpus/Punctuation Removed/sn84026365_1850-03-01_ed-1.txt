letter to the hon william
j nelson member of the
house of representatives
new york th february 
my dear sir as one of your im
mediate constituents permit me to ex
press to you my views on the resolu
tions lately submitted to the jsenate by
mr clay they are skillfully drawn
and their true import seems to me to be
generally misunderstood and in many
instances intentionally misrepresented
various considerations combine to ren
der these resolutions acceptable to
that class of our northern politicians
who are anxious to be popular at home
without forfeiting their share of the pa
tronage which is dispensed at wash
ington by the slave power the res
olutions are eight in number and i will
examine them in their order
i this proposes the admission of
california us a state without the im
position by congress of any restriction
on the subject of slavery and wiii
suitable bouiularut these word im
ply that the present boundaries are un
suitable and must be altered let
me call your attention to the true rea
son for this reservation about bound
aries and respecting which the reso
lution is silent during the war and
before the cession of any territory the
house of representatives passed the
wilmot proviso prohibiting slavery iu
all the territory that might be acquired
on this the south with one voice de
clared that they would not submit to the
exclusion of slavery south ofdeg m
the legislature of alabama resolved
that they would not recognize any
enactment of the federal government
which for its object the prohibi
tion ot slavery in any territory to be
acquired by conquest or treaty south
of the line of the missouri compromise
at a public meeting in charleston
and at which i believe mr calhoun
was present it was resolved that it
would be debasing and dishonorable to
submit to the prohibition of slavery
beyond what is already yielded by
the missouri compromise and innu
merable have been the offers and eff
orts of southern politicians to extend
tho compromise line to the pacific
hence it is not the exclusion of sla
very in california o the north of that
line that offends the south and to ad
mit this antislavery state bounded on
the south by deg m is doing no
more than what the south has consen
ted should he done and is in no sense
a compromise but the free state of
california extends south of this line
and hence her southern boundary is
unsuitabte and hencfe mr clays reso
lution makes a tacit provision for de
priving the stgte of so much of her ter
ritory as hia southern friends have re
solved shall not be consecrated to free
dom mr foote of mississippi obser
ved in relation to this resolution
 see no objection to admitting all cal
ifornia above the tine of dg m in
to the union provided another new
lave state be laid off within the pres
ent limits of texas to this laying
off another new slave state mr clays
compromise opposes no obstacle had
mr clay proposed the admission of
california with its present bounda
ries his offer wouldso far have been
a compromise ns taconcede something
to freedom es a consideration for the
surrender of the wilmot proviso
second resolution
 the next resolution declares that
as slavery does not exist by law and
is not likely to be introduced into any
of the conquered territories they
should be orgautsed under territorial
joveromemi wityput any restriction
rkiht is of no sextruth is of no oojxr
on the subject of slaverythe propo
sed assertion by congress that slavery
does not exist by law in the territories
is hailed as an all sufficient balm to the
consciences of those who recoil with
horror at the idea of being in any de
gree responsible for the extension of hu
man bondage and what let me ask
is this declaration but the enunciation
of a bald truism we all know there
is no law mexican or american recog
nizing slavery in the territories mr
clay adroitly avoids drawing any infer
ence from this acknowledged fact but
expects thit the good people of the
north will draw for themselves the in
ference that because slavery does not
exist by law therefore it is prohibited
by law property in elephants does
not exist by law in new york but still
it exists because it is not prohibited
by law mr calhoun and the great
mass of the slaveholders contend that
in the absence of a prohibitory law
men women and children as well as
horses and sheep may be held as prop
eriy in any territory oi the united states
and this doctrine mr clay himself no
where denies nay further mr cal
houn insists and i believe truly that
slavery never has been established by
law in any countrythat after proper
ty in man has been acquired then and
not before laws are passed to protect
it the slaveholders ask for no act of
congress authorizing them to carry
their property into the territories
all they ask is that no prohibitory law
shall be passed and then they will car
ry their slaveswhere they please and
keep them by their own strong hand
without law till in their territorial leg
islatures they shall pass such laws on
the subject as they shall find needful
not a word mr clays compromise
contravenes this legal theory or pre
vents its reduction to practiceslave
ry did once exist by law in these terri
tories why does it not now mr clay
answers the question by telling us that
mexican law abolished it now he
perfectly well knows that the mexican
law not only abolished but prohibited
slavery if that law was repealed by
the conquest then the old law was re
vived and slavery does now exist by
law if the jaw was not repealed by
the conquest then the law is still in
force and slavery is now prohibited by
law why then does not mr clay
fairly and honestly declare that slave
ry is now prohibited by law be
cause this would indeed be a com
promise and would render the proviso
nugatory and would secure the terri
tories from the curse of slavery the
very emission of such a declaration
implies a denial of an existing prohibi
tion and in such denial he wellknowns
the wholo south concurs so far
then is mr clays inconsequential tru
ism from being a compromise that it
surenders to the south even more than
she has demanded and throws open to
the slaveholders the whole territory
north os well as south of the
line rut to reconcile the north to
his total surrender they are to be fa
vored by congress with an opinion
that it is not liklv that slavery will
be introduced into any part of the con
quered territorywhat is only im
probable is at least possible and
hence this legislative opinion would
in fact be a solemn and official de
claration that there is no legal pro
hibition to the introduction of slavery
it is not pretended that this opinion
which congress is to volunteer is to
have any legal force whatsoever but
what if time shall prove the opinion
to have been erroneous will it be any
consolation to the north for having by
their act blighted immense regions
with human bondage that they have
been fooled by an opiuion mr downs
of louisiana in reply to mr clay as
serted that there were already in the
territories some four or five hundred
slaves and another member declared
that there would now have been plenty
of slaves there had not their masters
been apprehensive of the proviso if
mr clay is correct in his opinion the
slaveholders have been strangely mis
taken it was openly avowed during
the war that the territory to be con
quered south of tideg m should be
a slave region before our army en
tered the city of mexico we were offer
ed all texas proper and the whole of
new mexico and california north of
thirtyseven degrees an extent of ter
ritory equal to nine stntes of the size
of new york the offer was rejected
and thousands were slaughtered to ob
tain territory south ofdeg kim to be
peopled with slaves from the first
mention of the proviso our northern
editors and politicians in the slave in
terest opposed it as unnecessary be
cause as they assured us the soil
and climate of these territories were
unsuitable to slave labor the slave
holders knew better and never endor
sed the falsehood of iheir allies mr
waddy thompson of south carolina
minister to mexico announced to his
brethren writing of california sugar
rice and cotton find there their own
congenial clime recollections of
mexico p 
did the south make war upon mexi
co only to acquire free territory is
she now threatening disunion and civil
war for a privilege she is not likely
to exercise 
upon what does mr clay rest his
strange unnatural opinion almost
exclusively on the exclusion of ala very
from tbe californian constitution he
does not pretend that this exclusion
was owing to the unfitness of the soil
and climats for slave labor we all
know that tbe unexpected discovery of
om uidnl utoml is cdiforaj
a large northern population
averse to slavery and jealous of tlx
competition of slave labor in diggin
gold but does gold exist in desere
or new mexico or is there a large
northern population in californiasoutt
ofdegom is it logical to infertha
slavery is not likely to be introducec
into these territories even with the
sanction of congress because undei
totally different circumstances it ha
been excluded from california new
mexico is separated byan imaginarylinc
from texas and about halt of it is
claimed by that slave stte la it likely
that texan slaveholders will not cross
the line with their property or occupy
territory they claim as their own
the settlers in deseret have formed
a constitution virtually allowing slave
ry by not prohibiting it the gold
diggers in california are concentrated
far north of deg m the city of
san francisco is also north of that line
while south of it is a large area where
there is little to obstruct iheintroduction
of slavery under these circumstan
ces there are probably very tew men
in congress who would dare on their
oaths to affirm the opinion expressed
by mr clay that opinion is at best
a calculation of chances a calculation
on which no man would hazard a thou
sand dollars yet this miserable calcu
lation is offered to the north as a com
pensation fer the surrender of all the
political and moral blessings which the
proviso would secu
mr clay utterly demolishes gen
casss argument against the constitu
ality of the proviso and affirms most
positively the right of congress to
prohibit slavery in the territories
but how stands the question of duty
and moral consistency between these
two gentlemen undeniably in favor
ofthe general he has not indeed
undertaken to solve the nice and diffi
cult question whether human bondage
is a curse or a blessing he is sen
sibly alive to the atrocity of flogging
two or three hungarian women but
makes no comment on laws which sub
ject thousands and tens of thousands
of american women to the lash he
calls upon the nation to express its in
dignation at the execution of a few
hungarian insurgents taken with arms
in their hands but gives no opinion
how far it would be right or wrong to
shoot certain of his own country if ta
ken in revolt against worse than austr
ian oppression but he contends that
whatever may be he moral character
of slavery congress has no constij
tutional right to prohibitd and there
fore not to prohibit it on the olher
hand mr clay frankly declares that
slavery is wrong a grievous wrong
that to propagate slavery is to propa
gate wrong heaffirnsthe constitu
tional power of congress to prohibit
i this propagation of wrong and then
 calls upon congress to permit slave
j holders to propagate this wrong when
and where they please over the whole
wide extent of our conquered territory
with the single exception of what may
be included within the state of cali
fornia before god and man gen
casss conclusion from his premise
is just ified while the conclusion drawn
by mr clay from his premises is con
demned as hostile to morality and hu
manity
third fourth fifth and sixth
resolutions
 this resolution merely gives to
texas more territory than she
tled to and less then she demanws and
is so far a compromise of territorial
claims but in no degree a compromise
between the friends and enemies of hu
man rights since what is to be taken
from texas is to be immediatly thrown
open to the slaveholders
 texas had before annexation
pledged her duties on foreign com
merce as security to certain creditors
these duties by annexation were
surrendered to the united states mr
clay proposes that the united states
shall assume the debts due to these
creditors if texas will relinquish her
claims on new mexico if justice re
quires the nation to assume these debts
their assumption ought not to depend
on the cession of territory by texss
if in justice we do not owe these debts
their payment by us will in fact be a
gratuity to texas for the relinquish
ment of one of the most impudent and
fraudulent claims ever made we
have official information communicatad
by general jackson to congress that
i the texans when defining the bound
aries of their new born republic at first
determined to include california and
beyond all question they had then as
much right to san francisco as they
now have to santa fa the proposi
tion of mr clay is therefore to pay
texas for territory to which he admit
she has no title and then to throw open
the territory so purchased to the slave
holders in this i can see no conces
sion to the north
 congress is to declare it inexpe
dient to abolish slavery in the district
of columbia except with the assent ol
maryland and the people of the dis
trict and making compensation to tb
slaveholders the unlimited power
congress to abolish slavery in the die
trict is ifully conceded yet he calls oi
congress not to do what many ofili
members and vast multitudes of theii
constituents believe it their moral dutj
to do la this proposal i can find nc
other compromise but that of consci
ace
 the next proposal is to prohibi
the importation of slaves into the dra
trict for aale in other words the in
habitant are to bava a tnonopiy of um
trade m human he tag time
rochester n y friday march  
people are not to be deprived of th
privilege of importing as many slave
ms they may want for thejr own use
nor of seuing husbands atd wives am
children to be transported to the ex
i trutnilies of the uuion but ioreign tra
ders shall no longer be permitted ti
glut the washington market with tbeii
wares the moment the resolution
passeshuman chattels will rise in value
in the capital of our republic i object
not to the abolition of the trade since
it will remove one of ttarmany abomin
ations with which ssarmy has disgra
ced the sent of ourjjutbnal govern
ment but i deny that the proposition
involves the slightest concession on the
part of the slaveholders says mr
clay himself almost every slave
i holding state in the union has exer
cised its power to prohibit the intro
duction of slaves as merchandise
the power is exercised or not accord
i ing to convenienceand as it is thought
most profitable to breed or to import
slaves 
seventh resolution
 we now come to a grand specific
forgiving ease to northern consciences
for allaying all irritation and for res
toring a healthful action throughout
thepresent morbid system of the con
federacy i will give the recipe in
full resolved that more effectual
provision ought to be made by law for
the restitution and delivery of persous
bound to service or labor in any state
who may escape into any other state
or territory of this union that 
may not be accused of injustice to mr
clay in my subsequent remarks i
will quote from his speech on this
point i do not say sir that a pri
vate individual is obliged to make the
tour of his whole state in order to
assist the owner of a slave to recover
his property but i do say if he is pre
sent when the owner of a slave is
about to assert his rights aud regain
possession of bis property that he aud
every one present whether officer or
agent of the state government or pri
vate individual is bound to assist in
the execution of the lows of then
country i will go with the farthest
senator from the south in this body
to make penal laws to impose the hea
viest sanctions upon the recovery of
fugitive slaves and the restoration of
them to their owners
such is the panacea and such is the
mumier in which our medical adviser
proposes to admiuister it he must
not be surprised should some difficulty
be experienced in compelling the pa
tient to swallow the draught
mr clay has long been a favorer of
those field sports in which the prey is
man and he has the merit it is be
lieved of being the first to conceive
the grand idea of securing a national
intercommunity in these sportß by
means of international treaties so
eaiiy as the th june  as se
cretary of slate he proposed to the
british government to throw the can
adas open for this sport and in return
to british sportsmen should be accord
ed the privilege of hunting west india
negroes throughout the whole extent
of the american republic but john
bull rejected the tendered reciprocity
and churlishly replied the law of
parliament gave freedom to every slave
who effected his lauding on british
ground
about the same time we requested
from mexico the boon of hunting ne
groes over her wide area the desired
favor was denied but we have since
forcibly added almost half her territory
to our own hunting grounds of all
the game laws in existence that of
 which regulates the chase of ne
groes is the most horrible yet mr
clay is dissatisfied with it and calls
upon congress to make it more effec
tual and of course more horrible
should a virginian come to new york
in search of his horse and find him in
the possession of another who claims
him as his property how is he to re
cover the animali only a jury of
twelve impartial men drawn by lot
shall pass upon the conflicting claims
neither party has any choice in select
ing the jury nor can either establish
his claim by his own evidence but if
the virginian is hunting a man and
sees one that will serve his purpose
and who will fetch a thousand dollars
in the southern market but who claims
to belong to himself how is he to se
cure him why he may catch his
man as well as he can and without
warrant may carry him before any jus
tice pf the peace whom for sufficient
reasons he may think proper tq select
and swear that the man he has caught
is his and the justice may surrender
the max to perpetual bondage degra
dation and misery various officers
besides justices are authorised lo aid
so that the virginian has a wide choice
surely this is hunting made easy by
law but it is not found so easy in prac
tice latterly various states have pro
hibited their own officers from assisting
in the chase of human beings and ci
r tizens rarely lend apy unpaid assist
ance hence a new game law is
i deemed needful and clay as we
f have seen is pledged to go with the
farthest southern senator the most
i devoted lover of the sport to make it
i effectual the judicciary oipmittee
have accordingly reported a bill now
before the senate agree said
i mr mason one of the farthest south
ertt senators in his speech on this bin
th jan i agree that the federal
t government haw no power to impose
duties of way kind upon the officers of
state governments as such of
i course the obligation imposed by the
llur of uw justices of tbs ptsts
god is the father of u  all and all men are brethren
and other state officers to catch slavei
i are void and our northern legislator
have a right to prohibit them from par
i licipating in slave hunts to obviat
this difficulty it becomes necessary t
select other than state officers to adju
dicate upon questions of higher impor
than any with the single exception o
life and death that ever exercise thi
talents learning virtue and independ
ence of the most august tribunals o
any civilized country and who ar
the grave and reverend judges appoint
ed by this bill to sit in judgment on th
liberty or bondage of native im bon
americans among these judges art
twenty thousand postmasters eacl
one of these new judges is authorized
to adjudge any man woman or chtld
black or white to be a vendible chat
tel and this judgment is to be founded
on any proof that may be satisfactory
to said postmaster in the words of the
bill either by oral testimony or affi
davit nor is the testimony either oral
or by affidavit of the interested claim
ant excluded and from this judgment
there is no appeal slavery is no lon
ger confined to one color the south
ern papers abound with advertisements
offering rewards for fugittve slaves
containing the caution that the fugitive
will probably attempt to pass for a
white person a few years since a
maryland slaveholder caught in phila
delphia a white girl mary gilmore
whom he claimed as his slave the
case was brought before a pennsyl
vania judge and occupied two days
and it was proved by most abundant
overwhelming evidence that the al
leged slave was the orphan daughter
of poor irish parents f the mother had
died in the philadelphia hospital and
the daughter had never been in mary
land by a pending amendment to
this bill every man and woman who
prompted by the holiest impulses of
our nature shall harbor or conceal
the prey from the hunter is to be vis
ited with fine and imprisonment a
few days after mr clay introduced his
resolutions bruin k hill slavetraders
in alexandria wrote a leter since
published in the newspapers stating
for the information of a free mother
in new york who wished to redeem
her daughter from bondage that they
cannot afford to sell the girl emily
for less than eighteen hundred dollars
why this prodigious price they
add we have two or three offers for
emily from gentlemen from the south
she is caul to be the finest looking wo
man in this country
should this devoted victim escape
from her keepers and be afterwards
found concealed in her mothers house
not only is she to be carried back and
mbjected to the fate intended for her
nut the mother is liable by the then
present uill to be sentenced to pay a
ine of five hundred dollars to the
ljnited states to pay messrs bruin
ind hill one thousand dollars for dam
lges and be imprisoned six months
we hope for mr clays reputation
no farthest senator from the south
will ask for heavier penalties for if he
loes mr clay is pledged to vote for
lie heaviest sanctions that may be
proposed but suppose this poor girl
ihould find her way to peekskill in
stead of new york and iu your ab
sence with bursting heart ask to be
sheltered in your house from her pur
suers can you for a single moment
admit the possibility that your wife the
mother of your children could through
fear of the law so unsex herself as to
turn the trembling fugitive into the
street or betray her to the hunters
a thousand times rather would you see
the partner of your bosom enduring
mr clays heaviest sanctions than
bringing ignominy upon herself and
covering her husband and children with
shame and confusion of face by com
mtting a crime so foul and damnable
mr mason in his speech insists on
the right of the hunter to enter peace
ably any enclosure or dwelling where
such slave may be found lor the pur
pose of taking him should this as
serted right be incorporated into the
compromise bill then may southern
ruffians and northern doughfaces ere
long be roaming through our bed
rooms and ransacking our closets ic
search of pray should an attempt be
made to enforce the heaviest sane
tions for which mr clay is ready te
vote he may be assured the prisons ir
new york and new england are toe
few to hold the vast multitude of mer
and women who would willingly tenan
them rather than peril their souhi b
betraying the fugitive or assisting it
his capture mr clay very kindly de
clines requiring a private individua
to make the tour of his whole state if
search of a slave but be insists tha
all who are present when the game it
started ought to follow the hounds
could he but enforce this obligation
we should have some grand turnouti
in new york and new england sonn

is addressed to the jurisdiction of tk
state intowhich the fugitive may ea
cape of course individual citizens
as uch are under no constitutional ob
ligation to volunteer to catch slaves
but suppose a positive law should en
join each individual to betray or aid in
capturing the fugitive the question put
by the apostles when legally forbidden
to teach in the name of jesus would
then recur whether it be right in
the sight df god to hearken unto you
more than unto god judge ye it is
not merely the right but the duty of a
christian to refuse an active obedience
to any and every lawof man which he
believes contravenes the commands of
his maker and then like the apostles
to offer no forcible resistance to the
penalties attached to hit disobedience
mr clay may rest assured that the
bill of pains and penalties promised in
his th resolutions will not have the
composing influence he anticipates
filling our prisons with pious benevo
lent kindhearted men and women will
have little effect in suppressing agita
tion in his compromising ano
dyne mr clay has omitted an impor
tant ingredient ample provision is
to be made for the recovery of south
ern slaves but none for the recovery of
northern citizens if the constitution
gives the southern planter a right to
seize his slave in new york or massa
chusetts equally explicit is the grant to
citizens of those states to enjoy all the
rights of citizenship in south carolina
yet if certain of our citizens free
holders and electors at home think
proper to visit that state a prison is
the only dwelling they are permitted to
occupy and should the state to which
they belong send an ngent to inquire
why they are immured a a jail and to
bring their case before the supreme
court of the united states he is com
pelled to flee at the hazard of his
life
 the last item of this grand com
promise is virtually a guaranty that the
american slavejtrade vile and loathsome
as it is shall be held sacred from pro
hibition or obstruction by the federal
government for all time to come the
stars and stripes shall forever protect
each counting vessel that shall be freight
ed with human misery and despair and
manacled coffles shall without molesta
tion be driven across the continent
from the atlantic to the pacific the
slave trade in the district that is in
one single market mr clay pronoun
ces detestable and talks with honor
of the corteges which pass along our
avenues of manacled human beings
but why thia sudden outburst of indig
nation against a lawful commerce is
it dishonorable to sell merchandise
has not mr clay himself proclaimed
that is property which the law makes
property why does he dishonor the
washington manmerchants is it
base to buy and sell human beings
mr clay forgets that this detestable
trade is in fact supported by the gen
tlemen breeders who sell and the gen
tlemen planters who buy but this
trade which is so detestable and
these corteges which are so horrible on
a very little scale are now to assume
national importance protected and
sanctioned by the government of the
whole republic
such sir is the magnanimous com
promise which so many of our whig and
democratic politicians now that the
elecjofls are over and the solemn
pledges made in favor of the wilmot
proviso supposed to be forgotten are
willing to accept as a mighty boon to
human rights and a mighty barrier
against the further encroachments of
the slave power in my ears the only
language addressed by these eight res
olutions to the north is the cry of the
horseleechgive give no test can
detect in them no microscope can
make visible the most minute concession
to human liberty not one single inch
ol territory does the proposed compro
mise secure from slavery that is not al
ready rescued from its power not one
single human being wih it sav from
bondage
the extension of the missouri line to
the pacific would at least have render
ed all on the north of it free soil but
says mr clay most truly although
with a frankness almost insulting to
the north i say sir in my place
here that it is much better for the south
that the whole subject should be open
on both sides an imaginary line of 
deg m than that slavery should be
interdicted positively north of  deg
m with fveedon to admit  exclude it
south of  deg m at the will of the
people
but mr clay exclaimed oo earth
ly power could induce me to vote for
the positive introduction of slavery south
or north of that line and t this he
roic hvowal the galleries applauded
but the galleries are not deeply versed
in southern tactics mr clay need
apprehend no coercion to extort his r
luctant vote for a purpose no one de
sires or demands the south have
with one voice denied the power of
cbngtess either to prohibit or establish
slavery in the territories said mr
ging t pf alabama in repy we k
no act of congress to carry slavery
any where i believe we congress
have just as much right to prohibit sla
very in the territories me to caerry it
there we have no right to do one or
the other other southern senators
t avowed their concurrence in the doc
trine advanced by mr king hence
mr clayos defiance of any power on
f earth to make him do what nobody
wants him todo was at least a rhw
torical flourish
 g wifialto
john dick pitstn
whole no 
contend a full and unqualified
surrender of all ihe demands of the
north why did certain ultra senators
object to iff a show of resistance
might have been deemed politic ae
tending to make northern men snppoee
there must be something granted to
them although they could not tell
what it may also suit the party pur
poses of some to prolong the present
agitation that they may manufacture
more patriotism ftr the southern mar
ket and lastly if any really wish to
form a separate republic in which they
expect to have more power than they
now enjoy they will of course reject
all concession however great but k
is incredible that the mere alaveholfe
ers the men who are only anxious to
open new markets for the sale of their
stock and to acquire more votes in
congress should be averse to a pro
position that offers them all they have
ever asked and all that congress ean
give them with the exception of the
suppression of the right of petition
and the censorship of the post office
and these are not now in issue
but we are told that unless we yield
to the demands of the slaveholdeas they
will dissolve the union and what ara
these demands which mr clay adnti
we have full right to refuse why
that a small body of men not probably
exceeding  shall be at liberty
for their own aggrandizement to blight
with the curse of slavery our vast pos
sessions south of  degrees  minuts
and whatever portion of mexico it shall
hereafter be found convenient to seize
thus at a time when cruelty and op
pression are elsewhere giving way be
fore the increasing intelligence and
morality of the age we the model
republic are to be the instrument ot
extending over illimitable regions now
free a despotism more accursed than
any other known throughout the civi
lized worlda despotism that not only
enslaves the body hut crushes the in
tellect through which man is enabled la
distinguish good from evila despot
ism that annihilates all rights sets at
naught all the affections of the heart
and converts a being made in the im

the bights wrongs and hopes of la

discount by dr william elder of philadel
phia jmt week at washington hall in this
city the great question of labor in its re
lit to capitalof which it has been said
lfcestudious everywhere are pondering it
tie philanthropic everywhere unintentionally
eften and indirectly are strengthening it it
reminds one of the fabled sphinx sitting by
the wayside it demands of the politician the
philanthropist and the christian unriddle
me thia riddle or i will devour theehow
to employ and pay the peoplelwas dis
cussed by a man who combines the roosi
genial humor with a profound and farreach
ing philosophy and consecrates both to the
cause of humanity and great was the satis
faction all present experienced
mr eldet beautifully portiayed the icu nti
ty of labor and capital the advantages oi co
operative industry the futility of strikes
and organized antagonisms generally and
the tendency of the age to associative enter
prise nothing ia gained he remarked by
be laborer in combinations against wealth
the spirit which prompts fraternity to break
down the power of capital equality impels an
unity among caphalisls to maintain its power
the former pursues its object without the aid
which the latter in its own defence can so
readily command hence all combinations
against capital save in a very limited and
partial degree had been unsuccessful and
would alwsys be the true philosophy was
for labor to count to cosx to solicit capital
to form an alliance with itto make use
of iu power for right purposesin a word
to render identical labor and capita and by
cooperative industry and associative action
accomplish that which the two in indepen

never could hope to effect

the canadian question in england
the london times of the th ult in a
long article on the subject of canada winds
up by saying
when we have to deal with elements so
violent and capricious it is almost idle to cal
culate their action on the principles of reason
justice or selfinterest itself the orbit of a
comet that sweeps rapidly across the heavens
once in two centuries can be calculated with
tolerable certainty but who can measure and
predict the humors and vagaries of spoilt
children or any selfwilled unprincipled
mind it is however evident and will
probably have some weight even with the
canadians that by annexation they would
give up a good certainty or a very problem
atical advantage all things considered a
canadian settler is in a most enviable condi
tion there is not a being in the whole world
pretending to civilization who is so lightly
taxed for all the actual expenses of gov
ernment the canadian population have to pay
about s id a head the rest of their taxation
which ia not much being the interest on a
debt contracted for roads canals and other
improvements likely before long to be re
munerative to the province from those
taxes which an american citizen pays to the
federal government the canadian is en
tirely free as they are borne by the mother
country the recent acts of the imperial
legislature have deprived canada of a pro
tection from which it never derived any sub
stantial and permanent advantage while the
repeal of the navigation laws has given new
facilities for the disposal of her produce and
the employment of her ships whatever
the effect of that measure on the rest of our
empire there can be no doubt that canada
will have a large share of its benefits her
commercial relations with the united states
we would hope are still under revision an
entire freedom of trade between the two
countries would be for the benefit of both j
and certainly is deseived by the high and
generous spirit which lias animated the coun
sels of the british legislature on these im
portant questions we are well awate thatj
a large party in the united states believe
that by continuing and even aggravating the
present barrier of customs against canada
they will ultimately fotce her into annexation j
such a consideration we hold to be foreign to
a question of commerce or of customs and
unworthy of the giowing friendship between
england and the united states all these
things as old homer says lie in the lap
of the gods whether canada is one day
to add her start to the union is as purely
conjectural as the possible disruption of the
union itself it is however certain that if
england is really destined to lose her last
footing on the continent ot the new world
that event will not be caused or much has
tened or much retarded by any tricks of
legislation all thepower attainable by sucb
devices is that of doing ill what heaven will
otherwise do well

the price of the union
what an alarming and melancholy illus
tration of the depraving influences of slavery
has been exhibited in the halls of congress
within the past w weeks after all that
has been said and done to expose the baibari
ties and cruelties of the slave system henry
clay a man endowed with persuasive and
commanding oratorial poweis comes for
ward and attempts to mingle light with dark
ness to unite freedom with slavery a work
 which tlie author of christianity to say
nothing of common sense gives us to under
stand is impracticable to prevent a dissolu
tion of the union is the object which the
able and plausible kentucky orator contem
plates in his efforts to effect the adoption of
 what are called the compromise resolutions
let us look at the object or end and then
at the means proposed to effect that object
 the object to prevent a dissolution of
the union what is this union which is so
much lauded and what are the privileges
which it secures it is a union by which
three millions of men are held in cruel bon
dage it is a union in one half of which no
 expression can be given to those deep feelings
of haired to slery and love of liberty which
burn in every true and maniy heart it is a
union in which the right of petition js denied
and in which free men are imprisoned and
sold as slaves such are some of the privile
gea derived ftom the union any one of which
every freeman knows is a sufficient cause for
condemning and destroying that union
but what are the conditions on which
henry clay proposes to effect the continuance
of so glorious a union there are eight pro
posed but as one of them is of such a charac
ter that no christian or freeman can accept
the rest need not be considered i allude to
his seventh resolution which presented in its
true light amounts to this namely
that when a man who has been com
pelled to work all his days without wages
ssiose wife and children have been torn from
him forever sold on the auction block sub
jected to the most brutal treatment and him
self gtoaning under sufferings tor which no
remedy can be had attempts to escape and
who would notj from so horrible a state and
while the north star that lighthouse which
god seems to have set in the heavens for this
very purpose beckons and guides hiig on
when such a man heaven guided comes
among us weary hungry panting with fear
and imploring our protection we are deman
ded forsooth to extinguish every spark of
humanity within us and deliver him up to the
tender mercies of his bloody pursuers
who of us will consent to terms like this
to perpetnaie such a union u has been de
scribed or any union whatever no one it
seems to me who hates tyranny loves man
and reverences god the slaveholder is lit
tle aware of the deep sympathy existing in
multitudes of breasts for the fugitive slave
how many a fond and fearless lieart
would rive to throw
its life between him and the foe
aud i trust that to the free north it may
ever be truly said

there is a very prevalent error in commu
nity that supposes that opposition of free

slavery rests chiefly if not wholly in theii
sympathy for the enslaved african thu
feeling undoubtedly has and should have its
due weight the cries and groans of three
millions of men and women shut out from the

subjected to all the wrongs of cupidity cruelty
and lust cannot but stir the blood and awa

unmeaning words is a fact to make our
whole nation put their bands on their mouths

i the world and its creator disguise itseek to
hide the truth even from ourselves as we
will there stands the damning tact that we

bears upon the blacka of the south its effects
upon the vast majority of the white is no way

the degradation attaching thereto a large ma

the great mass of them do not eren own
land bought and sold like their colored
brethren they are not but saying this they
are scarcely lees dependant than their neigh
bor chattels forced to work with slates
to associate with slaves independence bold
ness and jhe spirit of freemen is a stranger
to them nowhere in the old world is a
state of more abject indigence than exists be
tween the slarehclders and white laborers of
south carolina and what is worst of all
the evil is increasing socially proscribed
and without a single free school every gene
ration is growing up poorer more ignorant
and more degraded
to us who have breathed but in sight of
schools free as the air of heaven it seems in
credible yet it is nevertheless true that such
a prodigy as a system of free schools is ut
terly unknown in every slave state the
poor white children are in all of them as fa
tally doomed to ignorance and consequent bar
barism as the slave children what must be
the result of such a state of things requires
no prophet to foretell the slave states must
get rid of their slavery or they must sink
whites and blacks together into a state little
short of heathenism talk of such a commu

utterly preposterous they cannot long sup
port anything but chains
yet such is the institution bringing forth
such fruits that we are required to plant
anew upon gods free eaith nay a free en

nineteenth century are threatened with intes

do it well if so it must be give us revolu

weekly review of the congressional
proceedings
it would require sheet six times larger
than that of out north star to record the
speeches made from week to week in the
national congress and the state legisla
tureson the subject of slavery and connected
therewith wishing to give our readers a
full and ample assortment of intelligence we
propose in future as in the present instance
to lay before them an editorial review of the
moat important of these speeches weekly
instead of publishing the speeches of indivi
duals entire
the past week has been no exceptien to
previous ones in the agitation of slavery in
the halls of congress that subject in
some form or other has been constantly
pressed upon the consideration of both the
senate and house mr fitch of indiana
made quite a lengthy speech in the house on
thursday february th in which he took
up the slavery question his discourse
though on the northern side and containing
many excellent hits at the blustering brag
garts of the south was nevertheless so
untruthful and contemptuous in its tone to
wards the real fnends of freedom at the
north as to give it the appearance of a mere
harangue designed for personal and political
effect among other things mr fitch made
the following observations
the north is charged wiili an intention
of violating the constitution in legislating
upon this subject of slavery tlie constitu
tion guarantees rights in common to all the
states and certain special rights to the slave
holding states yet though special they
are constitutional rights and as such should
be recognized and protected in the state
where they exist and the gieat mass oi
the northern constituency have as little idea
of interfering with those rights as of peimit
ting interference with their own there are
exceptions to this there are  am sorry tc
say northern disuniomsts but they are
few in number and of limited influence
can the same be said of the southern the
latter arrive at the same conclusion with the
fonder from adverse premisesreach the
same goal by a different road in aiding the
accomplishment of the ultimate design of the
northern disunioniststhe men they were
wont the moat contemptuously to denounce
the south add nothing to their own strength
they do but divide the responsibility of an
odious cause the pseudophilanthropy of a
few of these disunionists at the north the
garrisons and abby folsomsa philanthropy
manifesting itself by an officious intermeddling
with the property rights of the south insti
gating the escape of thp slave while if turn
its back upon the free negro leaving him to
steal or starve a philanthropy which in
stead of expending its pecuniary means as it
legally might in ministering to the wants of
the black already free or sending him to the
country of hts origin wheie he could attain
the dignity of a citizen invests such means
in printing incendiary publications or hiring
emissaries to create discontent in the save or
increase that already existing this kind of
mistaken philanthropy with its attendant in
direct efforts at disunion is unjustly charged
to the entire north while the south appar
ently seek to precipitate its consequences
on tuesday feb ilh mr venable of
north carolina made quite a long speech in
opposition to the docrines and measures of
the free soil party and in defenpe of
slavery his speech seems in part to be a
reply to one made by hon horace mann
which we have not yet seen mr venable is
the worthy colleague of that young republi
can minister of human bondage mr cling
man who led the way at thp commencement
of the session in a long dull and tedious ar
gument in favor of his bloodshedding and
maniqtbruting system
the first part of mr venables speech is a
recapitulation of the dangers to which the
south would be exposed in case of a dissolu
tion of the american union he defies such
dangers but ridiculously whines because
northern men are not willing to abandon the
wilmot proviso lest the south ahpnld ex
pdse herself to such dangers by dissolving tfre
union on the adoption of that proviso this
is like a band of villains threatening to blow
out their own brains unless peimitted to
plunder whom they please and pleading lot
the latter privilege as the least of two evils
he greatly dislikes a remark made by mr
palfrey a year ago that a large number ol
colored persons resided in new bedford and
that most of them had paid for themselves
with their heels this is evidently a sore
point upon which to touch slaveholders mr
venable expresses himself thus with respect
to the danger of the dissolution of the union
we cannot avoid the conviction that
unless that disturbing cruse is removed it is
impossible for the government to extend its
existence without such internal convulsions
as must sever the tie which unites the states
of this confederacy
he ridicules the idea that the president
can by physical force perpetuate the union
and speaks of equal justice as the only founda
tion upon which the uniou can stand the
speaker then goes on to give a narration ol
the causes which have been for some time
operating and which have served to bring
tha nation and the union into what he con
siders its present perilous condition we
shonld be amused if we were not shocked
by the speakers solemn warnings against in
justice and unequal legislation and by the
mock fervor with which he portrays the fate
of nations and governments which have in
time past fallen into ruin from these causes
for a slaveholder that most unscrupulous oi
all earthly tyrants to stand up before thii
nation and the world and lecture on behali
of justice and equj legislation is the con
summation of audacity and the climax ol
hypocrisy mr venable displays great
adroitness in outing the blame of the present
agitation upon the north he says
i am aware air that it belongs to the
policy of those who pursue a system oi
wrong and oppression to divert attention from
themselves and fix the blame of disturbance
and disorder upon the wronged and op
pressed
it is notorious that for whatever agitation
now exists in the councils of the nation the
south and pot the north is to blame it
was in obedience to the insatiable and out
rageous demands of that section of the un
ion that texas was annexed and that the
mexican war was waged and as a conse
quence the present territories forming the
field of contention were added to this gov
ernment
it is equally notorious that the south from
hi first declared its intention to hr the ex
tension of slayerjr over the free soil ac
quired by the war in mexico in view ol
these plain facts which are too generally ad
mitted to need proof or illustration an attempt
to make the north responsible for the present
agitation can only originate with one pro
foundly skilled in the use of impudence and
temerity no the north is not to blame
we wish it was it ought to have long since
assumed an aggressive aspect to slavery but
this it has never done the real abolitionists
at the north are yet but a handful the
overwhelming mass of the people are still
clinging to the compromises and guarantees
given by the constitution to the system of
hnmao bondage mr venables allegations
ought to be true but the facts are against it
the speaker in the following remarks
doubtless utters the bentimeuu of all the raen
stealers of his section
i recognize no party ties uniting me to
ohose whose system of aggression has for its
result the equalization of the black and white
raceswhich looks even remotely to the pos
session of civil or social oquality of those
races at the south at least amongst them
selves it may be a trotter of taste with which
it does not become us to interfere neither
will i acknowledge party allegiance to those
who vote for or approve the wilmot proviso
or any equivalent measure the abolition oi
slavery in the district or elsewhere by con
gress or the obstruction of the recapture ol
fugitive slaves by state authority my con
stituents have declared disunion preferable to
any of theae results and so instructed me at
the polls
oh that there was manliness enough al
the north to meet the issue and to say to the
south boldly we of the north are pre
pared and we will god helping us stand as
firmly by freedom as you of the south have
resolved to stand by slavery in such a con
test it is easy to see on whose standard vic
tory would peroh we must not follow this

of the same sort to present from othei
quarters
the senate on wednesday feb ao wa
the scene of a warm debate on the union
slavery and the admission of california a
mi clemens from alabama led off as the
champion of slavery among the liotheada
of the south there is not a more violent sla
verydefender than he though but recently
elected to the senate and perhaps scarcely
known five years since beyond the limits ol
his own state he talks of and to senators ol
forty years standing as though he was in
every respect theiz equal cass clay and
benton are handled by him with all the free
dom and careless indifference with which he
would throw about an old shoe it is quite
probable that his swaggering immodesty and
open rudeness have already won for him the
contempt of his brother senators though we
very much doubt whether he has the sagacity
to see or the sensibility to feel it
mr clemens is apposed to mr clays com
promise resolutions we shall not weary
our readers with any extracts since he brings
nothing new nor important to the considera
tion of the subject he hqs all of footes
impudence without his graceful flow of
language
robert c winthrop who has remained
singularly quiet since losing the speaker
ship has at length opened his mouth and
his bpeech shows no abatement of his attach
ment to slavery nor qf his desire to conciliate
the favor of the human fleshmongers who
prowl about the capital he said the presi
dent was at the helm and by the blessing of
god he trusted that he would be hailed as
the pilot who had weathered thestorm this
is just what we should expect  the opening
of a speech from this panderer to the slave
power he went on to bind himself by the
cords of feu years growth to the slave sys
tem in the following emphatic manner we
copy from the tribune
ten years ago when he was acandidate
for qongress he said that if it was his for
tune to be elected he would deem it to be his
duty not fo agitate the subject of slavery
that he had no sympathy with any fanatics
and that whenever the interests of the north
were assailed lie would defend thenr a
plague on both houses had been his con
stant exclamation he thanked his god that
he was incapacitated from commencing ultra
ism in any way if he had the approval of
the ultraiats he should inquire in the lan
guage of one of old what evil have i done
that they should speak well of me as to
mr roots resolution instructing the com
territories to bring tn territorial
bills with the slavery restriction he regarded
it as fraught with the greatest cpischief
hence ha voted to lay it on the table and he
oanqe to the conclusion that the honotable
member mr root for the sake of a misera
ble notoriety put in peril a cause of which he
professed to be the proudest advocate if the
resolution had been pressed on the house all
hope of legislation would have beep at an
end and california not admitted during this
session if the wilmot proviso was dead
its death lies at the door of mr root and
the epitaph on the tomb ought to be here
lies the victim of restless vanity and the
headstrong rashness of the gentleman from
ohio who held it up deliberately to receive
its deathblow it was a fatal blunder
that resolutionbut mr winthrop had sought
the favor to say to his constituents and hia
country that these gentlemen are not the
proper judges of his votes there has never
been a party under the cloak of philanthropy
that has been so vituperative and abusive as
the free soil sect he did not believe that
there was ever witnessed in the history of
this or any other country such audacity and
false statements as the presses of their parly
have exhibitef he had his it and
more than his share here and at home
there was a nest of vipers in his district
who had ben biting a file and havingbroken
their own teeth they want the uae of the
teeth of honotable members of this house
if slavery be extended to new mexico and
deseret it will be through the agency of just
such toadies as this same winthrop this
speech of his if we do not mistake the spirit
of massachusetts will gain few friends and
add largely to the list o his political ene
mies his attempt to mako what he alleges
to be the imprudence and rashness of mr
root an excuse for his own treachery tp the
principle of freedom will he fully compre
hended in the old bay state
we now turn with pleasure from the slave
bolding to the antislavery side of the con
gressional proceedings and by far the most
important of these is the speech of the new
member of the house from pennsyvania
thaddeus stevens his effort a reported in
the globe of saturday morning feb d is
one of the most powerful eloquent and
acathiog deuunciations of alavery to which
the slaveholders in congress were ever called
upon to listen s s foster could scarcely
have been much more severe in his conclu
sions nor more logics in his mode of st
riving at them than wte sttvene wt
had intended to extract largely from thia
speech in the present article but are per
suaded that our readers will be better pleased
to have the article entire in our next weeks
paper
the senate has bedpcompatativelv dull
the south has had the largest share of its
time and attention r o
no union with slaveholders
the following is the petition which was
so furiously denounced ind so contempt
uously rejected s few days ago by the ame
rican senate we observe that the penn
sylvanian has published the namea ot the
signers in a black square as a mark of its
indignant displeasure and with a view to
excite against them popular odium but we
greatly miscalculate the material of the peti
tioners if any measure of a malignant and
scurrilous print such as the paper in ques
tion shall either alarm or disquiet them
the objection to the existing union of the
north and the south is founded upon the
rocls of immutable principle and can never be
removed by vulgar abuse nor dignified con
tempt this treatment will have no other
effect than to deepen the conviction and to
strengthen the determination of the noble i
men ahd women who signed the petitition to
persevere in their bold and conscientious ef
forts to free the northern states from the
ctirce and guilt of being parties to this slave
holding confederacy lei the heathen

to the senate and house of reyresenlathes of

we the undersigned inhabitants of pennsyl
vania and delaware believing that the fed
eral constitution in pledging the strength of
the whole nation to the support of slavery
violates the divine law makes war upon hu
man rights and is grossly inconsistent with
republican principles that its attempt to
unite freedom with slavery in one body poli
tic has already brought upon the country
great and manifold evils and has fully proved
that no such union can exist but by the sac
rifice of freedom to the supremacy of slavery
respectfully ask you to devise and propose
without delay some plan for the immediate
peaceful dissolution of the american union
ihe following resolution introduced by
mr fiarrison find adopted by the afstssaohu
setts antislavery society is being exten
sively quoted and commented upon as evi
dence of the bigotry and intolerance of its
author and of those who co operate with
him in breaking the chains of the hopeless
millions who writhe in bondage under the
ponderous weight of our bloodstained union
io us the alleged intolerance is nothing
more than the intolerance that truth and jus
tice must always create against falsehood and
cringe fhe stand point of mr garrison
differs from that of his accusers he looks at
the union from the cottonfieldthe slave
shambles and the canehrakes of the south
he reels the lot of the bondman to be his
own and remembering those in bonds as
bound with thorn be feels every eulogy
upon the union to be a rivet in his chains
and the resolution is but a natural expression
of his sense of the wrongs of the oppressed
j f d
resolved that it is with deep regret
we peroeive that the poet longfellow has
prostituted his fine poetical genius to eulogize
the bloodstained american union as freighted
with the hopes and interests of humanity
as being a noble ship invulnerable to the
rock and proof against the storm built in the
most skillful and workmanlike manner
whereas the history of its creation and its
ernise demomatrates it to have been
 a perfidious bark
uuiu i ti ecupe aiul rigged with curses dark
rotting through all her timbers leaking from
stem to stern laboring heavily on a storm
tossed sea surrounded by clouds of disastrous
portent navigated by those whose object is a
piratical ofie namely the extension and

educationkindness
the subject of educating children i feel to
be one of vital impotlance and viewed by
many very incorrectly but think it more
an error of the head than heart instead oi
taking the way in which we were educated
for a basis on which to improve knowing that
those who have gone betore us had not as
much light as we have we seem to take it
for au exact pattern children are often found
fault with when they ought to have soothing
words of encouragement and one of the
fiist qualifications sought alter in a school
teacher ought to be the very desirable one of
possessing a faculty of governing by love in
stead of rigor  have recently heard of a
school teachers saying that he should as
quick think of taking a gun in his school as
a whip or any instrument with which to in
dict corporeal punishment this is as it
should be io think uf mending the heart
by bruising the fleshhow absurd and how
debasing is it not astonishing that we should
ever have imbibed so low so degrading an
idea it was evidently from the bottomless
pit fur it never had a higher oiigin god
is love and every thing that emanates ftom
him is pure lovely and elevating and how
dssirablehow indispensable that those
who assume the dignified stations of parents
guardians and teachers should be directed
from above instead of descending and im
pulsively yielding to our lowest naiuies in
correcting our children who ever knew it
to fail of having a good effect on a child to
appeal affectionately to their pure mindto
their reasonto show them the consequences
of sin the sufferings that inevitably follow a
wrong course assuring them that it is their
good their happiness we are aiming to in
sure and not the giatification uf our own
missguided pasiousome would say as 
have heard ihemwe have tried that found it
of no use and ar last had to resort to w hip

they have not iiad sufficient patience that
they have not given jhe child time and al
though our great exemplar has enjoiued it
upon us to forgive seveniy limes seven yell
believe in the case of children who are com
paratively innocent and much easier wrought
upon by christian kindness than their super
iors in age so much as ill at would not be
necessary i think our forbearance and for
givaness a vety lew tunes as a general thing
would accomplish the desired object  have
frequently heard it said well i would make
them mind at any rate but i believe it would
be very wrong to be determined to make the
child yield at once unless it could be done by
mild rnd persuasive means because like be
gets its like harshn ss calls out its w orst
possions which should be carefully suppres
sed and never called it into action
we should he untiring in our kind efforts
to cultivate everything in children that is
lovelyto nurture most assiduously that spirit
of affection ale love which god has implanted
in their hearts and as much as possible
while they are young give it the predomi
nance teaching them that this unerring prin
ciple which most assuredly is from our
creator should be cherished and strictly ad
hered to we ought in all cases to manifest
to them a yielding on our own part and after
we have said all to them which our godgiv
en our highest nature dictates we should
then leave them to their own reflections

we extract the following from an ad
dress recently delivered in philadelphia at
the colored department of the house of
refuge by the hon w d kelly
jt is gratifying to find that meg in high
places of the nation are beginning to appre
ciate the social condition into which ages of
injustice slavery and oppression have plunged
the nominally free colored people in
ftiiladel pbia and elsewhere in out country
we hail this fact as an earnest of the pro
gress which society will yet make on this
object r d
thus far  have spoken chiefly of our
white population but what  have said is
equally true of those for whom this building
is designed the colored man is depressed
hy the causes that depress the white man
no  the agencies which strengthen aud de
velope the anglosaxon child would if fairly
applied give him a sturdy competitor in his
dark neighbor the existence of a colored
community in otir midst is coeval with slave
ty its members encounter not only the pre
judice of color but go where they may let
their worth and ability be what they may
they are recognized as the deesepdants ol
slaves and too oiled treated as though they
deserved no better than their fathers fate
they are with us yet not of us dwelling
m our midst they are a distinct community
defied the right of citizenship they are
til subject to our laws and we can no more
neglect  their moral intellectual and social
condition with impunity than we can expect
contagious disease to desolate their poor
homes and leave our loved ones untouched
 know not how to speak of them as a com
munity numbering less than onetwelfth of
our population living chiefly in dependent
employments with comparatively few sources
of revenue and fewer wholesome incentives
to ambition they nevertheless present to the
eye of the careful observer as wide a range
of character and perbape of condition as is
exhibited by society at large slavery being
the negation of mails tight to himself it ot
comae denies him the right to possess or ac
cumulate property it necessarily keeps him
in ignorance whether manumitted on our
own soil by the wise legislation of our fa
thers or elsewhere through the promptings
of benevolence they are all come to freedom
in poverty and ignorance the condition ol
the fugitive slave and we have many of them
is still worse in dread of the law by which
he would be surrendered if taken he strives
to live in concealment until the chase is over
idle and without resource he soon exeausts
kis slender stock of clothing sod contracts
the vices of his least thrifty and most de
graded brethren yet despite all advene
ciieiunstaoom they are an improving people
they have their own churches and private
echoole they maintain and conductassocia

the prejudice against color is unknown in
france and prominent among her distinguish

alexander duma gerard ami others you
have not forgotten that two youths of african blood
gained the highest honor in the college at paris
in the year  and dined on die same day with
tlie king of france the dercendant of st iouis
at die palace of die tuilerie and let me add il

we copy tlie following letter fietn the
national antislavery standard it may
give our readers some insight into the labors
trials and hardships of those who pioneer
the way of our antislavery reform mr
and mrs foster have been and still are
laboring in comparatively an unculivaed
and long neglected region stout hearts and
an enduring zeal both of which they large
ly share are needed in the conflict which
they are now wagingf d
our next meetings were at palenville di
rectly under the deepfurrowed frowning
brow of the old catskills and only two miles
from the mountain house here we held
four meetings at the first there seemed an
involuntary uprising of the place to defend
slavery or apologize for it an elderly man
called the slaves cattle we showed the
congregation that if he were right they were
in the practice of baptizing cattle into the
name of the father and of sitting at ihe com
munion table with cattle we afterwards
learned that this man is a rumselling elder
in the church the bible was brought for
ward and quoted in defence of slavery and
although the minister of the dutch church
did not think the bible sanctioned it he after
wards wanted some explanation of abrahams
position towards those servants born in his
house indeed had not the subject for that
evenings discussion been the terrible system
of american slavery and those who were
apologizing for or defending it been in high
standing in the church or making high pro
fessions of republicanism and democracy
the whole affair would have been richly ludi
crous it was however truly pitiful and i
olushed and grieved for my race
the three following meetings were quiet
many of the church members having with
drawn and no one came forward to reply
yet when we announced our meetings closed
the dutch reformed clergyman who had
attended throughout but had kept aileuce
since the first meeting gave notice that he
would hold a meeting there the next thurs
day evening to show that the church of
christ had been misrepresented and slander
ed mr foster rising said if the church
ttad misrepresented no one was so deep
ly interested to know it as himself as it was
not his intention to misrepresent any one
therefore he should endeavor to be present to
listen to the discourse lie has gone today
ind will probably stop and reply tomorrow
svening
in palenville we obtained but five subscri
ijera but several others will probably sub
scribe while mr foster is there as there
was quite as much interest manifested to obj
lain information by books as in other places j
in this section at our last meeting in palen j
ville a unanimous vote of thanks were ten
dered us for our lectures and an invitation
given ua to return and discuss the question
farther
 will here suggest that next summer a
convention be held in this vicinity when by
the promulgation of truth having swept the
charming valley below we adjourn to the
heights above and refresh our spirits by a j
view of the varied scenery rich beautiful
grand and sublime
from palenvipe we came to hudson
w here we have held four meetingsthe three
first in temperance hall which were con
siderably disturbed by rowdyism and the last
in friends meeting house which being larg
er and more commodious than the hall we
believed would secure us from further out
rage yet even hither the rowdies followed
and proceeded to still greater extremities
by throwing eggs and other missiles one of
which bit our excellent friend aton c
macy
although we had designed to hold other
meetings in the place we gave notice at the
close of this that at this late period we did
not feel it our duly as in years gone by to
speak in disturbed meetings the liberty of
speech which had been trampled under foot
all though the country was now regained in i
the north save in a few benighted corners
and we chose to speak elsewhere to those
who were eager to listen to this allabsorbing
question of the age
injustice however to the masses who at
tended our meetings it must be said there
was an evident desire to have older and some
of the city authorities weie present at all the
meetings save the first trying to preserve
order their failure to do so must have
been owing to an unpardonable lack of effici
ency somewhere in numerous instances i
have seen greater turbulence fiom much
greater numbers entirely put down and or
der preserved by one or two efficient private
citizens i learn there is a class of rowdies
here who have given the place much trouble
foi a long time past in disturbing temperance
meetings and m commuting other shameful
outrages on the citizens such as taking off
gales tearing up doorsteps overturning out
houses and the like if the citizens know of
no better means of protection than by physi
cal force i can assure them their present
forceless system is woise than nothing these
river fiowns are to be commiserated foi be

the true destiny of our country
there is a genuine anglosaxon destiny
i of which we can conceive that would be
truly glorious in itself and beneficial to
mankind but it is a destiny of liberty not
of license it is a destiny of peace not ot
war it is a destiny of justice and noble
ideas not of invasions and violent annexa
tions it is a destiny whose emblems and
implements are not the bomb and the bowie
knife but the priniingpiess and the bible
it is a destiny of raising up the fallen races
and administering wise and equal laws
wherever our dominion extends not of tramp
ling under the hoofs of the warhorse the
prostrate red man black man or dark
browed mexican science commerce and
christianity have given england and the
united states the two anglosaxon powers
an almost immeasurable influence over the
rest of the human family but rod has put
this sceptre into their hands for no idle and
vainglorioua purpose but to promote the
welfare of mankind did the grand vision
of a true and providential destiny the real
mission god has sent them to accomplish
dawn upon the minds of our statesmen and
orators our rulers and people they would
sheathe the sword forever they would
trust not in uncertain liches but in the
living godnot in carnal but spiritual
weapons this is the only worthy destiny
the only one that heaven will bless or futu
rity honor it is impious to talk as if any
people were fated to be ambitious and grasp
ing and a terror to the tace and not a bles
sing we might with as much propriety
say that an individual was destined to be a
knave or a ruffian the creator has in one
sense destined all his children to be good
and true to obey hiß laws and share in his
promises he is not willing that any should
perish but that all should come unto repent
ance but men have been gifted with the
power of choice and the opportunity of good
and of evil and if they come short of the
glory of god they may be said to have fius
trated the divine plan and not fulfilled their
mission and destinv as immortal beings
these two nations are capable ifthey have
grace to seize the memorable opportunity of
leaving a mark upon tho history of mankind
above all greek all roman fame they
can make themselves felt for goodwe yet
hope that in a measure they are doing soto
the remotest isle of the sea and to the
savage tribe whose name even has not yet
been domesticated in a civilized tongue they
have the saving ideas of science freedom and
christianity that are able if diffused to
keep the lifeblood flowing in stiong and
pure tides thtough their own heaits and also
to stir the deep sleep of paganism with fresh
and waking pulses of regeneration they
have both the personnel and the materiel the
ships tools arts studies truths men to do
this magnificent work they and their allies
of kindred european races if faithful to the
high vocation wherewith they are called
and obedient to the heavenly vision can
in two centuries change the aspect of the
whole habitable globe and make the solitary
place glad and the desert blossom like the
rose
but if abjuring this kingly power of bene
ficence and turning aw ay from this sublime
mission of realizing the kingdom of cbiist on
earth they bow themselves down to the base
uses of mammon and of mars they will fling
away an opportunity of usefulness such as
has been rarely afforded in any juncture of
history if they consent to track the old bloody j
tound of sordid guilty ambition and seek not
to bring other tubes and races under the obedi
ence of god and harmony with his laws
but in subjection ito their own tyranny then
it requires no prophets eve to foresee that
that are destined to fall a prey to the same
passions suicidally acting on themselves
which have poured the vials of wrath upon
other countries their prodigious vices wil
be whips enough to scourge them the im
mense agencies which might have proved the
instruments of an incalculable beneficence
will become when perverted only the heavier
millstones about their necks to pull them
down to perdition destiny is a fearful word
and when we pronounce it we remember
most vividly the life of that mighty man who
called himself the child of destiny but
whose star brilliant as it was rushed head
long in an illfated moment from the zenith of
its glory into eternal night imperial as the
nations are doth not the lord sit upon the
circle of the earth and bring the princes
lo nothing and make the judges of the earth
as vanity 
a little matter
the governor of maryland calls attention
in a message exclusively devoted to the inter
ests of slavery to a matter in which penn
sylvania is directly concerned it is that of
the imprisonment of jonathan little in hun
tingdon county on the charge of kidnapping j
it seems some virginian of high character
has called his excellencys attention to the
matter and represented little as being a
poor man who is unable to obtain counsel
and be therefore recommends that the state
furnish his means of defence we hope it
will be determined nothing would sooner
bring the nonslaveholders of that slavery
ridden state to think of the evils of slavery
and of some early plan for getting rid of it
men are reached sometimes through their
pockets when they can be reached in no other
way let them be called upon to sustain a
few such contests for the benefit of other
peopled interestssuch as they are injured
rather than benefittedand a change will be
very apt to come over the spirit of their
dreams
as to the finale of such test cases i
matters little whether the maryland slave
holders succeed or fail all the slavecatching
laws which can be concocted and all the de
cisions of courts that may be obtained in favor
ol slavery will go for naught while the in
herent impulse for freedom animates the
heart of the enslaved and the means of suc
cor sre within his reach selfemancipation
will go oh in defiance of the machinations of
the slaveholders and their hired sjayehounds

sovereignty of the state of kentucky to
these sovereignties he acknowledged alle

acknowledged any allegiance to a southern
confederation now or in the prospective he
would tell them that he utterly repudiated
such allegiancehe would not live under
such a confederation applause his duty

m the whole series of propositions which he
had submitted to the senate the resolution
had been passed without a word of intimation
on his behalf for he had not written a single
line to any member or officer of his legisla

he begged thatgentlemen would in the
continuation of this debate restrict them
selves within the limits of senatorial decorum
avoiding all personalities for one if the
contrary practice was to be continued and
offensive personalities were to be indulged in
he did not and could not know how far he
might be able to trust himself in vindication
from the personalities of any man no matter
who he might be but he had risen to vin
dicate himself from the charge of inconsis

it was known many years ago that the wild che

properties indeed this fact was known to the
aborigines and a decoction of the leaves or bark of
this tree has ever been regarded hy their physicians
as one of the moat effectual remedies in many dis
eases this fact several years since arrested the
attention of dr wistar a highly respectable practi
i ionei of virginia he investigated with care the
healing properties of tlie wild cherrytested its
effects when administered alone and when in com
bination with oilier remedial agent he found that
its natural virtues might be greatly improved and
by combining it with ingredients whose properties
were well proved and generally recognised a medi
cine was produced which constitutes a remedy of
great value in pulmonary affections and diseases of
the chest and throatdiseases which are proverb
ially prevalent in our cities and large towns and

oliver godsmith
by noble butler
after the perusal of irvings life
of goldsmith we feel that justice has
been done to the author of the de
serted village and the vicar of
wakefield the literary merits of
goldsmith it required the malignant
meanness of a kenrick to decry but
to make his personal character the ob
ject of unfeeling jests has been fashion
able we owe a debt of gratitude to
the american goldsmith for a true por
trait of one who wopld not have dis
dained to call him brother
we will not now attempt to speak of
goldsmiths literary character his
works are in the list of the worlds
classics his poems the world has by
heart every one who has gone be
yond the school reader has read and
felt the traveller and the de
serted village the simple and effec
tive style the beautiful imagery the
noble sentiments are appreciated at all
times and in all countries no change
of schools in poetry has diminishea
goldsmiths fame he spoke to the
human race and the human race un
derstands him there is nothing in
his works to excite the stormy passions
k is to the gentle feelings that he ap
peals his poeins are like landscapes
full of quiet beauty and grace where
the tree bends calmly over the water
and sees a sky below as unbroken as
the sky above while over the whole is
spread the gentle melancholy of indian
summer his prose works are written
in a style which in graceful freedom
and transparency can scarcely be sur
passed and are full of exquisite delin
eations of character sound observa
tions on life the most delicate humor
and the kindest feelings few
works says one of his biographers
referring to the citizen of the
world exhibit a nicer perception 
more delicate delineation of life ant
manners wjt humor and sentimenl
pervade every page the vices and
follies of the day are touched with the
most playful and diverting satire and
english characteristics in endless va
riety are hit off with the pencil of a
master he even made abridgement
of history delightful and natural histo
ry as entertaining as a persian tale
it is said that when langton made
his first visit to johnson he had from
perusing his writings expected to find
him a decent well dressed in short a
remarkably decorous philosopher in
stead of which down from his bed
chamber about noon came as new
risen a large uncouth figure with c
little dark wig which scarcely coverec
his head and hisclotheshangingloose
jly about him it is seldom that the
appearance of distinguished men cor
responds with our expectations bui
we do not know of any author whost
external appearance and conduct wen
so well calculated to disappoint the
readers of his works as were those o
oliver goldsmith his works give yot
the idea of a most polished gentleman
kindhearted indeed but extreme
shrewdof one whom you would not
think of attempting to deceive yot
imagine him dressed in the most perfeci
manner in which no part of the dresi
excites particular observation but the
whole conveys sn inexpressible idea ol
btcomingnetf you expect to find one
who manages his affairs in such a judi
cious manner that all goes on smooth
ly
but he who became personally ac
quainted with goldsmith after having
formed such ideas of the man wan
e gk r g iou y disappointed there was
his little plain person decked in a fan
tastic manner a bailiff perhaps was
entering the door while a sturdy beggar
was walking off with the money which
which should have discharged the debt
he might have been perceived cursing
his credulity which had just been im
posed upon by one successful deceiver
and pawning his clothes for the benefit
of another with respect to worldly
thrift there was nothing but wisdom in
bis mouth and nothing but folly in his
conduct the visiter could almost
imagine a mysterious union of two in
dividuals iu the same body a man to
think and speak and a child to act it
seemed as if some charm prevented his
true nature from manifesting itself in
actionas if the thought starting from
his brain like an oberon was in its
passage to action changed into a puck
but this character with all its strange
contradictions was one which all but
the envious man and the fool were
forced to love when he died in the
midst of his difficulties the feelings of
bis acquaintances burst forth in that
expressive exclamation poor gold
smithan exclamation in which pity
for his failings was over balanced by
affection for his virtues the principal
charges that have been made against
the character of goldsmith are the
charges of improvidence and vanity
that he waa improvident ia too mani
fest and a severe penalty did ha pay
for his fault he was led to incur
debts which pressed upon him continu
ally and at last crushed him to the
earth but we believe that he never
entertained a dishonest intentioo during
his whoielife his knack at hoping
led him into innumerable difficulties
when he was about to incur some debt
hope pointed to abundant sources of
revenue and overwhelmed reason with
her volubility the kindness of heart
from which a great part ot bis careless
ness with regard to money proceeded
affords some palliation for his faults
he felt so much of the distress of the
miserable that he found it impossible to
resist the inclination to relieve them
even whilp at college his benevolent
feelings led him into difficulty the
following story shows his disposition
he was doing the same thing in differ
ent forms all his life
he was engaged to breakfast one
day with a college intimate but failed
to make his appearance his friend
repaired to hie room knocked at the
door atid was bidden to enter to bis

evenings stroll be had met with a wo
man with five children who implotxd
his charity her husband was in tire
hospital she was just from the country
a stranger and destitute without food
or shelter for her helpless offspring
this was too much for the kind heart
ol goldsmith he was almost as poor
as ncrself it is true and had no money
in his pocket but he brought her to the
college gate gave her the blankets
from his bed to cover her little brood
and parttif his clothes for her to sell
and purchase food and finding himself
cold during the night had cut open his
bed and buried himself among the fea
thers
poor goldsmith was buried in fea
thers tbe greater part of his life while
he was immersed in feathers to keep
himself warm if another sufferer had
come to him with a piteous tale he would
have given up the feathers too he
was totally incapable of resisting an
appeal to his charitable feelings
crowds of the needy surrounded him
he would pawn his property to raise
money for them on one occasion the
poor woman whom he owed for the hire
of his appartment entered his loom
and told a piteous tale of distress her
husband having been arrested in the
night for debt and thrown into prison
his feelings were so excited that he sent
off to the pawnbrokerss a borrowed
suit of clothes aad raised money enough
to release his landlord from prison
his answer to griffiths who threatened
him with the jail is a most affecting
outpouring of despondency sir
says he i know no misery but a jail

 poor goldsmith was conscious o
his imprudence and generosity was s
natural to him that he did not think o
it as a palliation he was able evei
to give good advice on the subject o
prudence and knew all the maxims o
thrift in a letter to his brother hen

had learned from books to be disinter
ested and generous before i was taughi
from experience the necessity of being
prudent i had contracted the habit
end uotions of a philosopher whil  wai
exposing myself to the approached o
insidious cunning and oftfin by being
even with my narrow finances charit
able to excessl forgot the rules of jus
tice and placed myself in the ver
situation of the wretch who thankee
me for my bounty when lam in the
remotest part of the world tell him this
and perhaps he may improve from mj
example
fortunately prudence is not the only
virtue in the world if it were so
goldsmith would have been the mos
incorrigible scoundrel that ever breath
ed but this man who was so har
rassed with pecuniary difficulties could
not be induced by any prospect ol
gain to swerve from his principles oi
give up his independence if his room
had been filled with bailiffsif starva
tion or the jail had frowned upon him
wherever he turned his eyes they could
not have driven him from his principles
those who considered money the great
god were astonished at his childish
simplicity in this respect instances
of his firmness of principle were re
lated as excellent jokes by those who
could scarcely find words to express
their virtuous abhorrence of his impru
dent generosity while he was liter
ally living from hand to mouth one
parson scott who had received two
fat livings for his political subservien
cy was deputed to engage him in the
support oflord norths administration
the parson made what he considered
a good story out of his embassy
i found him said he in a misera
ble suit of chambers in the temple i
told him my authority i told him i
was empowered to pay most liberally
for his exertions and would you be
lieve it be was so absurd as to say i
can earn aa much as will supply my
wants without writing for any party
the assistance you offer is therefore
unnecessary to me and so i left
him in his garret highminded par
son we can imagine the sublime
contempt with which the round fat
oity man of god looked upon the mis
erable sinner before him and so i
left him in his garret how parson
scotts eve twinkled as be related his
story no doubt he told it again and
again and considered that he had per
formed his part of the entertainment
when he had got through with it when
the wiae ones called tor parson sootto
good story how complacently he sat
shaking his laurels as the bursts of up
roarious laughter pealed around him
sir john hawkins relates another ex
ceedingly good story the earl of
northumberland who then bold the
office of lord lieutenant of ireland
wm willing to extend to goldsmith the
patronage which his high post afforded
sir john was at northumberland house
when the poet made bis appearance
ho waited in the outer room to
learn the result of tbe visit gold
smith on coming out told him that in
reply to tbe gracious offers of oasis
tance be had mentioned tbe situation
of his brother who stood in need of
help thus exclaims sir john
did this idiot in tbe affairs of the world
trifle with his fortunes and put back
the hand that was held out to eseiat
him the lawyer wasoe unfortunate
as the ptrton in tbs attempt to under
stand this singular idiot who thought ol
others more than ha did of hitnself
to be coxtijued
classes ilf russia
the nobles number about 
including those in poland finland
and the baltic provinces and are di
vided into some fifteen different classes
some of the nobles are hereditary and
others have received their honors as a
reward of their merits it has been
the policy of the emperors ever since
peter the great to create as many
nobtes as possible in order to weaken
their power many of these nobles are
exceedingly poor but very proud dis
daining all manual labor and looking
with contempt at a merchant however
wealthy they wear a badge which
designates the exact order of nobility
to which they belong on the left breast
of their coat and to this the common
people pay the greatest deference
the son of every nobie is also a noble
many ot these nobles are exceedingly
refined in their manners most ot them
speak french which they learn in
childhood and many speak it better
than russian this custom was set
by peter the great
of the merchants there are 
 they are divided into three
guilds according to their property
but each man may estimate his proper
ty at what he pleases those who are
worth loooo may enter the first
guild those worth between looo and
loooo may enter the second guild
and those worth under looo belong to
the third guild
the clergy form a class by them
selves and marry among themselves
like the tribe of levi among the jews
the number of men belonging to thi
order is  but their entire fami
lies number half a million the bishops
are taken from the order of monks and
are unmarried all the rest of the
clergy must be married and they can
not marry a widow or be married the
second time this latter rule makee
them take good care of their wives
they are readily known by their long
beards and black dress they are not
much respected except in their offici
al capacity for they aro extremely ig
norant and many of them are very low
in point of character avarice and
intemperance are common vices among
them the most opprobrious epithet
one russian can bestow upon another
is to call him the son of a pihest
tere are  serfs in russia
of which  belong to the
crown and  to the nobles
the serfs are bought and sold with
the land some of them are mechanics
but the greater part are farmers each
serf has as much land as he can culti
vate the use of which he pays for in
money or in kind these rents are
very reasonable and many of the serfs
become very rich for their property is
sacredly protected there is no coun
try in the world where a man can rise
so rapidly as in russia the lecturer
mentioned the caso of a man who has
j risen from the condition of serfdom to
be the owner of  serfs in
peter the greats day the highest
offices in the army were open to the
serfs
the dress of the sefs for the most
part is very rude they live in a
cabin fifteen or twenty feet square
containing one room in the centre of
which is a table and around the sides
is a bench which being turned over at
night forms their bed this cabin is
kept intensely hot by a stove but the
injurious effect of so great a heat is
counteracted by the smoke which is
produced by shutting off the flue when
the wood becomes charred
there are ibqqoou jews who live
in the western part of russia they
are confined mostly to poland the
reason of there being so many jews
in this country is that kosimer thr
king of poland was married to a
jewish lady by the name of esther
as the jews say through whose in
fluence bis kingdom was opened as an
asylum to the jews when they were
persecuted by every other nation the
jews are very poor and ignorant
though better educated than the mass
of the russians they are known by
their peculiar dress and dark complex
ion many of them especially the
women are extremely handsome
