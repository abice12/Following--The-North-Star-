from the pennsylvania freeman
speech of wendell phillips
delivered on saturday afternoon the  th inst at the
assembly buildings philadeljh a
our object is the abolition of slavery
and these meetings which lie hold are
mainly but the means for that purpose
there is of course a great variety of
opinions as to the most proper means
for the abolition of slavery it is na
tural there should beas long as men
think independently and it is only
from independent thinking that such a
cause as ours or any unpopular cause
gets either sympathy or aid it is very
natural therefore that there should be
great varieties ot opinion as to the
means by which slavery should be at
tacked and doubtless it is equally true
that when slavery is abolished it will
be accomplished by the union of men of
all ideas or rather i might say it will
be the result of the efforts of all men
whether united or separated who hon
estly hate the institution and earnestly
labor to put it down the abolitionist
therefore because he proposes a par
ticular method in which to attack sla
very by m means asserts that that is
the only channel through which the
great current of public sentiment can
move still it is equally a truism with
what i have been saying that there is
such a thing as a good way and a bad
way an efficient way and an inefficient
way a way that wastes means and a
way that husbands them a way that
will hasten results and a way that will
postpone them indefinitely now the
duty of those men who have devoted
life and influence feeling the cause to
be worthy of life and influence is cer
tainly this to use all the means in their
power to point out which is the best
way and to press it on the attention and
to recommend it to the adoption ot the
community in general the abolition
ist therefore when he presses upon his
fellowcitizens a peculiar method by
which slavery is to be abolished by no
means asserts that there may not be
honest labor in another direction by no
means is he so wild and ignorant as to
suppose that all minds like all watches
can keep time together not even as
near as all watches can and you know
charles v found he could not keep
them together
the duty however of adopting and
of perseveringly recommending the best
method is just as important when we
recognize this idea of human nature as
when we do not especially when we
can consider further that slavery is an
evil by no means of a slight chaiacter
by no means of a narrow extent but
that it has covered the land for two
centuries that it corrupts almost every
element of the national character that
we meet it in its influences at every
turn that like the skeleton in the
feasts of the egyptian there is no reli
gious no rejoicing anniversary to which
slavery in the present state of the
country is not and ought not to be a
guest you will remember the com
plaint of the clergymen who went to
form what they were pleased to term
the evangelical alliance and who
thought they had got four thousand
miles away from the plaguespot of
their country but to their dismay and
discomfiture it was flared in their faces
at the very moment they wished to unite
the christianity of the world in a set of
abstractions causing them to cry out
in very shame and distress is there
no place free from this abomination
well now the duty of the abolitionist
is to see to it that there be no place
where the conscience of the american
jfatitm can exist into which the preach
cr of an awakened responsibility on the
subject of slavery is not introduced
well again you must not expect
that reform is a matter of peace it
never was and it never will be the
greatest the only perfect reformer that
ever appeared on earth said he came
not to send peace but a sword re
form is always aggressive it cannot
be otherwise the moment it sinks
and lulls itself into quiet it ceases to be
reform and yet whenever there ari
ses a call for a great and national re
form there always starts up a variety of
characters and the natural inevitable
consequence is collision and it cannot
be otherwise you will find that in all
history you will find that in every state
of society the moment there is a call
for a reformation there will appear men
of great charity men who are like the
hindoo fanatic their religion con
sists in putting out their eyes their
charity thinks to cover a multitude of
sins by sealing up their eyelids instead
of getting rid of the obstruction to a
clear and searching vision these are
the moderate men these are the men to
whom luther alluded when he described
erasmus his cotemporary men who
strive to walk upon eggs without break
ing them they are men who think
that moderation is the secret of success
when on the contrary there never was a
reform carried by moderate means or
moderate measures and especially
when the evil sought to be eradicated
had spread its roots through the whole
stiucture of society
the whole progress of christianity
exhibits a series of great moral battle
fields it was not by moderate means
i that its principles have been promul
gated luther aad fox were not mod
j erate men lamartine is not a moder
ate man he is a bold outspoken
man it has not been by softspoken
language that the masses of europe
have reached painfully and step by
step that elevation where now the
swarthy brow of labor begins for the
first time to be cheered and warmed by
the benignant rays of gods sunlight
these moderate reformers constitute a
class against which there must be di
rected not the attacks but almost the
suspicion of men that fear to grapple
with a great national sin then there
is another class of reformers who
always come up when a reformation is
proposed who are like the men in our
state legislatures always ready to
vote for a bill but are sure to saddle it
with an amendment which will secure
its defeat these were the coloniza
tionists of our early enterprise men
whose tears always flowed at the
thought of the black man being so far
oft front his native soil whose health
could only be secured while the breeze
of his native hills fanned his cheek
these are the men who claim to be
abolitionists and vote for henry clayj
thinking they can no where place their j
head sosaely as in the lions mouth
these are the men who under the
plea of regard for our principles be
tray them i make these remarks to
i show that nothing strange has happened
to us because it is the fate of every re
form to find these classes of individu
als more dangerous from their proxim
ity their disguise therefore must be
exposed they must be contended
with the abolitionist therefore is
obliged to be an aggressive man not
oi  on the institutions and evils of so
ciety but on thi s  who propose plans
i for lelieving them this is his voca
tion to seethat the energies of the
great national conscience are not
wasted it is his duty to see as far as
god has given him ability that the cur
rent is not shifted from its proper chan
nel he becomes therefore necessa
rily an aggressive man a fighter a
sentinel his means are small the
evil is great his time is short ruin
looms in the distance he must meet it
and meet it with such materials as he
has at hand again all these consid
erations receive more importance from
the fact that the institution in tire midst
of wdiich fie stands is so overwhelming
so strong so mighty and from the ex
tremely erroneous views that prevail on
all sides of him concerning it for in
stance on this day there are gathering
together in various chapels those who
call themselves the representatives of
the religious sentiment of the nation
those who presume to represent the
christianity of man and there is an
activity on their part they can re
member the hindoo translate the bible
into all the tongues of the globe flood
all the sandwich islands with enlight
enment christianity and civilization
they have gathered together every vil
lage from maine to georgia to interest
in the ends of the earth all those who
sit beneath their ministrations but
the bible to the man who speaks the
tongue their mother taught the bible to
the oppressed on the banks of the po
tomac the rights of man to the thou
sands of alabama and arkansas they
have no voice no ear for their com
i plaint they are silent beneath the
idea that their position discharges them
i from all responsibility in the matter
the idolatry of the people on the other
l side of the globe the pope of rome
who is blessed with all the aid which
i wealth and science can afford that is
i their care and over that they watch
with individual responsibility but the
l wrongs and miseries of three million
f slaves in the southern territory and fai
 worse than that the corrupted sensi
bilities of fourteen millions who stanc
with their feet upon their necks al
f this is tabooed to those who represen
t the religious sentiment of the americar
 people well now here is a duty foi
the abolitionist to perform before he cai
t hope to topple down this great bastih
e of oppression and infamy he must ge
n the religious sentiment on his side
nothing less can grapple with it ev
right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren
erything else it can bribe everything
else it can overwhelm everything else
it can bully when he shall once
bring to his side the religious enthusi
asm of the old puritanic stock with all
the vigor of that age when they took
their life from the european side jus
tice and humanity shall triumph this
is the only way according to all human
probability in which it will ever be
done of course we speak with refer
ence to the manner in which things are
usually done in the world or the man
ner in which history informs us they
have been accomplished in all past
ages we have no idea what the an
gelic state of man may be in future
times the period may come when he
will act upon higher principles but if
man is to be what he has been there
is nothing that can outdo so powerful
so subtle so determined an institu
tion as slavery but the religious senti
ment
the mistake of some abolitionists is
that they go cap in hand to the door of
what they are pleased to call a church
almost asking pardon for what they call
schismatic movements when the pope
excommunicated luther luther did not
apologize he excommunicated the
pope the world will decide which
was in the right we are bound to
exclaim with melancthon we are
the church whoever separates from us
separates from the church chris
tianity is always the highest idea of the
age it is always the leader of civili
zation why i recollect a year ago
this month the new york evangelist j
said in a long article that the church
had been recreant in its duty that re
formers not connected with the church
not even professors of religion had
anticipated the church it said the
church was asleep and i am sure i w ill
not dispute that but the socalled
church is not the vital embodiment of
christianity it is not gods represent
ative on earth you will remember
what the scotch chieftain said when in
vited to quit his seat at the foot of the
table and take the head of the feast
he replied where macgregor sits is
the head of the feast and so it is in
religion where good is done there is l
the church infidelity never fathered
a noble action i claim them all for
christianity a noble thought has
never come up from her every goodj
and every perfect gift comcth down
from the father of lights there can
be no christianity except what is
christlike and to imagine that any
thing outdoes the church of christ is
blasphemy i know no apostolic sue j
cession except the men on whose heads
gods own bands have rested the
luthers the pasclrals the oberlihs
the howards elizabeth fry the clark
sons and others through whose works
god has called up christianity step by
step in its onward march
christianity docs not exist in an idle
organization mark me i am not saying
that the church organization of this land
is an idle one and i will try shortly to
prove to you that it is not i am laving
down a few rules by which i will try to
prove which is the infidel which is the
head of the table
christianity is ever active it cannot
exist in an idle church the blaster
comes to the door and knocks in the
voice of a new idea he says to the
church come up higher he wants
the world to take another step in the
direction of right justice eternal
truth it is now the cause of the drunk
ard now of the slave now of the bat
tlefield and now the cause of moral
purity no matter what it is it
knocks at the door if the sheep hear
the shepherds voice they will answer
it and come out and follow him to the
wilderness if there be no answering
appeal then their religion is a matter j
of habit and not of principle there
never was a man who loved truth and
justice and humanity whose heart
would not have leaped in his bosom at
the summons to do battle in behalf of a
higher phase of gods providence no
matter what the consequences to him
personally may be an illustration of
what i mean is suggested by the cir
cumstances in which i stand in great
britain the friends were a noble band
in behalf of the slave before the earli
est times of wilberforce they did
their duty well and it was to men
whose names an ungrateful world has
forgotten we owe it that the vessel of
antislavery reform ever reached a safe
harbor it was to the allens the
dillwyns and others whose money was
poured like water who never counted
day nor night that the negroes owe
i their liberty the friends in great
britain now have no abolitionism in
them i will tell you why i judge them
so it they had a spark of antislavery
in them when the question of tory and
whig and the corn laws and all the
j other liberal and republican questions
j came up their hearts would have leaped
j in the cause and they would have been
like their fathers found battling in be
half of freedomjustice andhumanity
but they were abolitionists by habit
and consequently their hearts did not
leap in the cause and they were not
found following in the footsteps of their
fathers
now there is another difficulty and
a very great difficulty too which the
abolitionist meets with at every turn
we come to the american people with
the idea that it is the wisdom of chris
tianity to serve the human race and
ask them their idea of our slave sys
tem well they are steeped to the
lips with the idea that the negro is pro
perty we cannot get this idea out ol
them if you argue with a man till
i midnight and finally succeed in en
lightening him so far as to enable hirr
to distinguish between man and brutish
beasts he all at once learns that capt
sayres helped a man to gain his liberty
rochester n y friday june  
and asks you if you approve of stealing
slaves it you approve of aiding the
slave to escape it is impossible to get
it out of his mind that between him
and the negro a shadow of the slave
holder ever stands you cannot enable
him to comprehend the great and what
should be selfevident truth that a man
has the first right to himself frederick
jdouglass once applied to a lady asking
her to give him something to help the
antislavery enterprise and this pious
old lady who left forty or sixty thou
sand dollars to the church where she
worshipped told him she could not con
scientiously give anything to a man
guilty of the enormous crime of steal
ing himself now the means by which
the abolitionist is to eradicate this idea
is to meet the american at every turn
to ring it in his ears man is not pro
perty tell him it is right to aid the
slave to escape turn the slaveholder
over to every epithet of truthtruth
mark you but no word should ever
be spoken for the purpose of exaspera
tion and no truth should be left un
spoken from fear of exasperating any
the slaveholder and his abettors
should be met on every side with the
assertion of the negros humanity let
the cry be the negro is a man and let
it be enforced by all the severity which
it is possible to bring to bear upon the
mind and conscience of the american
people i know the broad capabilities
of the anglosaxon language for sar
casm reproach and denunciation but
i also know that the anglosaxon race
has a capability for singing which sur
passes the utmost capacity of the lan
guage to denounce their sin and there
fore no man need fear of erring as
jong as he confines his reproaches and
denunciations within the dictionary
another generation will wonder at the
tameness with which we rebuked the
slaveholder
but i wish to pass in review some
of the other relations that bind us to
slavery now there is the state that
is another great element and the ques
tion is with the abolitionist what he
shall do with the church and state
there is no disposition to shed blood
to raise an insurrection that will not
do every body ignores that you
must create a great public sentiment in
favor of abolition is the cry we all
agree to thatbut how is this great pub
lic sentiment to be raised shall it be
done by these mild men that sit under
the shadow of our institutions to re
buke in the abstract the institution of
slavery mild means have been tried
for a long time and the institution lias 
been growing stronger and stronger j
under these mild attempts to
it we must try some other means
but you would not abolish the union
say they in order to get rid of slavery
why it is by no means certain that we
would not but you might get rid of
slavery quicker some other way this
is not the question this is an ameri
can question the question of a man
whose life is in accordance with that ol
the politician described by a certain
author to be a man who served god
as not to offend the devil now the
american people love a compromise
it is bread and meat to them and
therefore the americans first question
is can you not get rid of slavery quick
er some other way i was not born to
abolish slavery no man was sent into
the world to abolish slavery or intem
perance or anything else he was
sent into the world to do his duty and
after he has done that consequences
are gods you say by staying in the
union you might abolish slavery in a
short time by exciting insurrection i
might do it quicker still perhaps
were i to drink every day in public
sam johnsons toast fleres to the
first insurrection in jamaica it would
help materially to bring about this rej
suit who knows but that it would j
startle the slaveholder quicker than any
thing else but it is not the quickest
but the rightful way which you are
bound to take you have no right to
remain in the union in order to abolish
slavery any more than you have a
right to remain in the church for the
same purpose our first duty is to con
sult the light in our bosom a light
placed there for our guidance by the
hand of deity and its guidances we
are bound to follow without looking at
ultimate results which are gods one
great fault of the american people is
that they cannot trust god they are
not only afraid to trust him but they
do not know what it means to walk by
faith and not by sight you must prove
it to a man good must spring up under
his feet this is one of the compro
mises of our character which has cor
rupted the church we had good sense
enough when the vessel of state was
launched there never were more
faithful people than the early friends
and methodists they got rid of slavery
in the church but they were mystified
j by the relations into which they w re
cast by the workings of a corrupt poli
tical government and became entan
gled into it lost sight of their responsi
bility to god and went on acting under
the government and taking part in it
touched pitch and necessarily became
defiled and now slavery has not a bet
ter bulwark than the society of friends
 nor a stronger champion than the meth
odists of the united states what has
turned these men aside from their oppo
sition to slavery an affection of the
j atmosphere in which they have been
brought up we have been probably
dreaming that slavery would be abol
ished some how or other just as a
liberty party man told me the other
day who will vote for john p hale
whose principles he dont dare even tc
i aska man who has not yet found oul
i whether man has property in his fellow
i man after speaking to this libert
party man upon the subject of the na
tional conscience he said this is j
just what i told our convention last
week i told them that after the next
election we must lay down some great
principle laughter
we have been told we are alwavs
told that it is not a proper time just
now to abolish slavery this has al
ways been the cry and it ever will be
as in the case of property so in the
case of slavery the miser always de
sires a little more than he has and the
slaveholders and their coadjutors say
the time is just a little ahead tnis
has been the cry since the adoption of
the constitution what are the facts
why the slaves have increased from
thousands to millions and the slave
power has ramified itself throughout all
the departments of state church and
society but there has always been a
good time coming when the chains
should be stricken from the limbs of the
slave and he should rise up a man
it was to be in  when the slave
trade was to be abolished indeed
this was the general conviction and so
the people went into partnership with
georgia and south carolina until that
event should come to pass the aboli
tion of the slave trade came at last but
unfortunately it found an unexpected
guest at the board the cotton interest
was seated there the value of slave
property had so greatly increased that
the exteimination of the evil was out of
the question but they said again let
us look a little ahead when slavery
gets cooped up in narrow limits and
has no more virgin soil to burn out
then said randolph the slaves will
accumulate so fast that their masters
will run away from them laughter
this would have been a capital way of
getting rid of slavery but unfortunately
the masters have not yet concluded to
run away from the slaves and they are
equally unwilling to let the slaves run
away from them laughter well
they said the mississippi will shut sla
very in it cannot go beyond that
river but when slavery arrived at the s
mississippi and found it was hard press 
ed from behind it very quickly leaped
over the mississippi and established itj
self on the other side of that majestic
stream and now they tell us that sla
very is to run away off to mexico so
far that it will never get back laugh
ter it will be time enough to believe
this when we see slavery running butj
that will never be if you let it take its
own time for it it is needless to talk
of the slaveholder giving up his slaves
or of slavery running away slavery
can only bo overthrown by uniting
against it the religious sentiment of the
land to do this we must agitate must
sjtcak must write portly men with a
great deal in their pockets and very
little in their heads laugh at tracts and
books and abolition speeches and
pretend to despise their influence and
perhaps in their ignorance they do de
spise it
george sands and la menais began
to talk to the inhabitants of paris to
write tracts and scatter them among
the people and louis phillippe and
his government laughed at george
sands and la menais and their tracts
and speeches but one morning the
rich and wise monarch the napoleon
of peace saw before his palace the
blouses who had counted their number
and heard them utter the words of geo
sands and la menais and in a few
minutes you might have seen an old
gentleman with a woman packed under
his arm and an umbrella in his hand
marching at a brisk pace towards the
railway station they bad talked him
out of his palace they had talked him
out of france they had talked france
into a republic applause so let
us talk everywhere and let us talk in
season and out of season let us say
everywhere and on all occasions the
negro is a man and has a right to life
liberty and the pursuit of happiness
he has a right to himself and let us say
we will help him to gain his rights that
we will help him to escape the prison
house of bondage let there be no
shrinking let us come boldly up to
the mark lam reminded of what dr
howe told me this afternoon in reiai m
to an interview he had with captain
sayres in the prison at washington
the captain remarked it is true i
have violated the law of this little plot
of ground which you call the district
of columbia but i have not violated
any law of the kingdom above ap
plause let us remember this and
act upon it and not cease our efforts
til the land shall be rid of this foul
curse till our national escutcheon
shall be purged from this foul blot
which has so long disgraced it and our
country shall indeed be the home of
the free and the land of the just ap
plause
from the london times
eeevatiojvof the masses
we are aware however that no
theory wall satisfy those who suffer a
stern reality of degradation and denial
the needy millions want something
more than the cold eye of justice or
the illusive smiles of freedom
they want house food and clothing
the want work and wages they want j
time to live and time to die and for
these purposes the assistance of that
state to which they contributed so
much and which undertakes to protect
them from a foreign foe and should also
render aid against domestic ills the
state is wise and good and great in
j the eyes of humble men they fear it
they worship it they love it what
childlike confidence does the honest
laborer repose in the gentlemen who
rule the destinies of his little sphere
j the british laborer is taught from his
childhood to look up for counsel and
aid for our part wc have continually
j urged that it is the duty of the state to i
fultil such expectations we have re
jected and denounced the system of
leaving things to take their course and
the poor man to shift for himself as utj
terly inapplicable to our social state
amid such obloquy we have impressed
upon the state the duty of supplying
work to the willing and relief to the
destitute of protecting the more help
less sex or age of enacting by law thej
dictates of humanity and common
sense of adapting legislation to the j
facts of the case of laying the chief j
pressure of our fiscal burdens on those
who are most able to bear them
we cannot better denote the spirit
of our advice than by referring to the
chief stigma we have had to endure
not a month has passed for many a
long year without a repetition of the
charge that we were falling into the
errors of communism the smallest
interference with wages time circum
stances of employment was compared
to the frantic demands of a rustic de
magogue that was our offence we
aimed too much at a domestic a pater
nal protecting legislation
now we do not hesitate to say that
much of our present peace and secu
rity arises from the extent to which the
nation has complied with these princi
ples imperfect and partial as that com
pliance has professedly been the
population of these islands know and
confess with more or less readiness that j
it is under a kind and thoughtful gov j
eminent anxious to assist the weak and
relieve the poor every child of pov j
erty knows that there are laws and in j
 stitutions of charity with a powerful
section in the press and senate laboring j
to give them more efficacy and scope j
the vast population of the factory and
the mill feels that its rulers watch over
its strength its education and its comi
fort this state thus rises up before j
the national mind as reasonable and
tender in point of fact under very
great hindrances and drawbacks the
dream of the communists and social
ists receives its nearest possible fulfil
ment the state becomes a society for
i the common good giving to all its mem j
bers a rateable in the common benefit
and stock providing for the sick and j
aged from the funds of health and
strength and securing the weak from
excessive competition the british
empire is a great and friendly society
we have often described it in that char
acter and done our best that it should
act up to the responsibility implied
hence it is that we alone stand when
every realm is shaken and revolution
like the beacon fire glances from throne
to throne in one month the whole of
central europe has not only quailed
but succumbed why need we count
up twenty states austria has capituj
luted that speaks for the rest aus
tria with her untold army with her
hundred and fifty thousand men to spare
j for italy with her gigantic ally with
her undisputed ascendancy with met
ternich has submitted to the common
fate surely the fallen depths will say
art thou also become weak as we
art thou become like unto us there
is scarcely aught left for revolution
but its course is from the west what
next if vienna had its hungary itsi
poland its venice and milan has not
st petersburgh also its moscow its re
bellious poles its teutonic tributaries
its siberian tribes its circassian foes
nay the capital itself is built on new
territory meanwhile thus far eng
land pursues the even tenor of her
course revolution shrinks from a me
tropolis where it cannot find one re
spectable malignant it sinks at once
into a vulgar burlesque
boundlessness of the creation
about the time of the invention of j
the telescope another instrument was
formed which laid open a scene no less
wonderful and rewarded the inquisi
tive spirit of man this was the mi
croscope the one led me to see a
system in every star the other leads
me to see a world in every atom the
one taught me that this mighty globe
with the whole burden of its people and
its countries is hut a grain of sand on
the high field of immensity the other
teaches me that every grain of sand i
may harbor within it the tribes ami fam
ilies of a busy population the one
told me of the insignificancy of the
world i tread upon the other re
deems it from all insignificancy for it j
tells me that in the leaves of every
forest and in the flowers of every gar
den and in the waters of every rivulet
there are worlds teeming with life and
numberless are the glories of the firma
ment the one has suggested to me
that beyond and above all that is visible
to man there may be fields of creation
which sweep immeasurably along and
carry the impress of the almightys
hand to the remotest scenes of the uni
verse the other suggests tome that
within and beyond all that minuteness
which the aided eye of man has been
able to explore there may be a region
of invisible and that could we draw
 j
aside the mysterious curtain which
shrouds it from our senses we might
see a theatre of as many wonders as
astronomers have unfolded a universe
within the compass of a point so small
as to chide all the powers of the micro
scope but where the wonderworking
god finds room for all his attributes
where he can raise another mechanism
ot worlds and fill and animate the evi
dence of his glory chalmers
we learn our virtues from the bosom
friends who love us our faults from the
enemy who hates us we cannot easi
ly discover our real form from a friend
he is the mirror on which the warmth
of our breath impedes the clearness of
reflection

fenelon was a roman catholic and
arch bishop of cain bray in france
he was a man of file finest feelings of
the greatest benevolence and he uni
formly practiced the law overcome
evil with good lie was always kind
and affable to the lowly mild and
courteous to the ignorant philanthropic
to the miserable gentle both
to friend and foe the consequence
was that he won all hearts his
diocese was often the seat of war but
the english germans and dutch even
surpassed the inhabitants of carnbray
in their love and veneration for him
at such times he gathered the wretch
ed into his residence and entertained
them for his known goodness had
surrounded him with a power which
even contending armies could not
resist and the consequence was that
his dwellings were safe even when
towns and villages were lying in
smoking ruins around him the fol
lowing is an instanse of his great kind
nesshe observed one day that a
peasant who had been driven from his
home and to whom fenelon had given
shelter ate nothing he enquired the

the following was first published in
the london christian observer
a slave in one of the islands of the
est indies who had originally come
from africa having been brought un
der the influence of religious instruc
tion became singularly valuable to his
owner on account of his integrity and
general good conduct
after some time his master raised
him to a situation of some consequence
in the management of his estate and
on one occasion wishing to purchase
twenty additional slaves employed him
to make the selection giving him
instruction to choose those who were
strong and likely to make good work
men
phe man went to the slave market
and commenced his scrutiny he had
not long surveyed the multitude offered
for sale before he fixed his eye upon
one old and decrepit slave and told his
master that he must be one the
master appeared greatly surprised at
his choice and remonstrated against
it
the poor fellow begged that he
might be indulged when the dealer
remarked that if they were about to
buy twenty he would give them the
man in the bargain
the purchase was accordingly made
and the slaves were conducted to the
plantation of their master but upon
none did the selecter bestow half the
attention and care that he did upon the
poor old decrepit african
he took him to bis own habitation
and laid him upon his own bed he fed
him at his own table and gave him
drink out of his own cup when he was
cold he carried him into the sunshine
and when lie was hot he placed him
under the shade of the cocoanuttree
astonished at the attention this confi
dential slave bestowed upon a fellow
slave his master interrogated him upon
the subjecthe said tou could net
take so much interest in the old man
but for some special reason he is a
relation ofyours perhaps your father
no massa answered the poor
fellow he no my fader he is
then an elder brother no massa
heno my broder then he is an
uncle or some other relation no
massa he no be my kindred at all
nor even my friend then asked
i the master on what account does he
excite your interest he my ene
i rny massa replied the slave ho
sold me to the slave dealer and my
bible tell me when my enemy hunger
feed him and when he thirst give him
drink
tobacco and teeth lt has long
been a popular whim that tobacco was
a preservative of the teeth tending to
prevent tartarous excresences which
inflame the gums and render the
bloodvessels irritable and tender ir
cordell an experienced dentist of al
bany in a late work on the effects of
tobacco alcohol and drugs on the teeth
gives the following testimonyl
have found much more difficulty in
fitting artificial teeth in the mouths of
tobacco chewers than others owing to
the irritable and tender state of the
gums tobacco causes the gums to
recede from the teeth whereby they
l become loosened
nature has placed the natural eye
of men in the front sid of the head
false edneation or natural perversity

some men so that it looks out at the

antislavery feeling in virginia
a recent number of the richmond south
erner contains the following article after
deprecating the existing debates in congress
on the subject of slavery the editor pro
ceeds
the country proposed to be ceded to us
by the late treaty with mexico it should be
remembered the almighty has wihnot pro
visoed should the free states consent and
that they never will that slavery shall be
allowed there still the climate and the
country would forbid it why therefore
should we contend for that which profiteth us
not which we can never pessess js it not
wisdom on our part to say to the north we
be brethren and if we cannot possess this 
property on such terms as will be mutually 
agreeable let us not have it at all let usj
not take that which must bscome an apple of
discord and a bone of contention to us and our
successors and which must end in a separa
tion of a people whose fathers have given us
so godly a heritage
and now as to this slavery question
fellowcitizens of the south let us in good
feeling reason one with another it should
be remembered that great britain has abol
ished slavery in all her colonies france
denmark sweden and other countries of
europe except spain have done so likewise
is it natural to suppose that the other powers
of europe will long suffer imbecile and en j
foebled spain to hold on to it when she
g ves way the entire civilized world with
tiie exception of brazil will be arrayed
ajainst us on this question now what is s
our policy is it not wisdom on our part to i
avoid having the question of slavery agitated i
ii our political institutions the north has
pedged itself to maintain intact and inviolate
tie compromises of the constitution let
u therefore abandon the acquisition of ter
ritory and free ourselves from this untoward
di kculty
it is not generally known yet it is never
theless true that twothirds of the people of
virginia are open and undisguised advocates
of ridding the state of slavery and after
the year  when the census is taken their
views will be embodied in such form as to
startle the south we speak understandinoiv
we have within the last two years con
versed with more than five hundred slave
holders in the state and four hundred and
fifty out of the five hundred expressed them
selves ready to unite on any general plan to
abolish slavery upon almost any terms
abolition fanaticism at the north has not
produced this but the annexation of texas
snd the acquisition of territory have done it
virginia may be put down as no longer reli
inble on this question when she goes the
district of columbia is free territory then
delaware and maryland will also go and
north carolina and kentucky will follow
suit tins will surround the extreme south
with free states and when that day comes
and it will not be very long we would just
as lief own a parcel of wild turkeys as so
many slaves
a telegraphic despatch from washington
savs despatches havebeen received from the
city of mexico which speak with entire con
fidence of the ratification of the treaty
speech of giddings
on the bill to pay the executrix of benjamin hodges
deceased for a slave who left his master in prince
georges county in august  and was sup
jtosed to have escaped on board the british fleet
mr giddings remarked that the recommit
ment of the bill in order to obtain a report of
the facts involved as proposed bo the gentle
man from vermont mr collamer would be
equivalent to a rejection of it no said he
we must take the case without proof  we
must reject it there is not a scintilla of le
gal evidence in the case
mr chapman desired to explain mr gid
dings yielded the floor and said he would
refer the committee to the affidavits on file
there were three of them
mr giddings resumed lie said he would
assure the gentleman from maryland that he
had carefully examined those affidavits not
one of the witnesses attempted to speak to
any fact within his knowledge they each
referred to what they heard other persons say
who knew no more in relation to the matter
than the witnesses themselves i repeat said
he we have no proof to a single fact involved
if we legislate on the subject we must do so
in utter ignorance of all the circumstances at
tending it yet ido not regard that as a
matter of much importance when compared
with the principles involved before i entei
upon an examination of the case however 
wish to say that the charge which southern
members have raised that northern gentle
men have introduced the subject of slavery
into this debate was not unexpected to me
lt is in strict keeping with their usual prac
tice what are the facts a slaveholder in
treduces a bill appropriating the money of tin
nation to pay for human flesh my frienc
from new hampshire objects to its passage
for the reason that he is unwilling to have tin
burdens of that institution thrown upon tin
people of the free states and straightway
five southern members follow him in debate
each charging him with introducing the ex
citing subject of slavery into the discussion
do gentlemen suppose they can thus misleac
the public do they believe that we shall si
here with silent tongues and sealed lips am
sutler such bills as this to pass this body
assure them most respectfully that we shal
oppose all attempts to involve our people ir
the expense the guilt or disgrace of slavery
l no northern man has ever to my knowledge
introduced that questionhere except for the
purpose of separating the people of the fret
states from its support no sir if any
southern man can point to an instance ir
which members from the north have bronghl
the question of slavery into this hall excepi
to defend our people from the encroachment
of that institution let them now rise and sus
tain their charges with proof mr g paus
ed a moment and then resumed mr speak
er where are those gentlemen who made
these charges  why sir they now roai
you gently as sucking doves
i now proceed to examine the case before
us i repeat that the claim is entirely un
supported by proof but the petitioner state
that she is the widow of benjamin hodges
late of maryland that he owned a slavi
who in  was taken away in august o
that year bv the british army on their retun
from this city to the chesapeake bay now
sir this statement of the case gives the peti
tioucr ro claim upon this government unles
we have become holden by some act of ours
this seems well understood by the petitioner
and by the committee who reported the bill
they therefore refer to our treaty of peace
with great britain signed at ghent on th
th december  the first article o
which provides that each party shall evaeu
ate all territory places and possessions ta
ken during the war without destruction o
carrying away any of the artillery or othe
public property originally captured in sak
forts or places and which shall remain thereir
upon the exchange of ratifications of this
treaty or any slaves or other private pro
perty
our government claimed under this treaty
that england should pay our slaveholders loi
all slaves taken from our shores by the britisl
fleet when tiroj left our coast england re
fused and the subject was referred to the em
peror of russia he decided that the british
government was bound to pay for slaves thus
carried away when they left our shores after
the signing of the treaty this led to the
treaty of st petersburgh dated the th
june  by the first article of which pro
vision is made for establishing a board con
sisting of two commissioners and two arbitra
tors to determine the claims presented by the
people of this government this board was
constituted the joint agents of both govern
ments ilis britannic majesty appointed one
commissioner and one arbitrator and the
president of the united states by and with
the advice and consent of the senate ap
pointed the other commissioner and arbitra
tor england never trusted this fund to con
gress for distribution that was to be done by
the joint commission the second article
provided for the ascertaining of the average
value of slaves
the third article read as follows
when the average value of slaves shall
have been ascertained and fixed the two com
missioners shall constitute a board for the ex
amination of the claims which arc to be sub
mitted by them and they shall notify the
secretary of state of the united states that
they are ready to receive n definite list of the
slaves and other private property for which the
citizens of the united states claim indemnifi
cation it being understood and hereby agreed
that the commission shall not take cognizance
of or receive and that his britannic majesty
shall not he required to make payment for
any claim for private property not contained in
said list
there is no pretence that the slave in
question was named in said list the report
of the committee admits that lie was not
calls from various parts of the hall were
made for the reading of this article again
mr g again read it and proceeded this
sir was our distinct compact with great
britain we solemnly stipulated that no
claims should be made on that government
nor should she be required to make compensa
tion for claims other than those contained on
the list furnished by our secretary of state
today we are called on to appropriate this
money to the payment of other claims we
are asked to violate this solemn treaty to dis
regard the pledged faith of the nation in or
der to give this slaveholder the benefit of the
body of the hones and muscles the blood and
sinews of his fellowman
but sir in order that no room for cavil
should be left the fifth article provided that
the decision of the two commissioners or a
majority of the board shall in all cases be
conclusive as to number value or the owner
ship of slaves or other property for which in
demnity is to be made they were riot
only to confine themselves to the list furnished
them by our secretary of state but their
decision upon the claims mentioned on said
list was to be entirely conclusive upon the
parties
under this treaty the members of this
board were appointed met in thiscity organ
ized took the oath of office and called on the
secretary of state for the list mentioned it
was furnished but there was no claim for
this slave upon it they proceeded to exam
ine and adjudicate upon claims presented on
said list y hen they had completed their
lajors they found the amount of all claims
allow ed on said list to be twelve hundred and
lour thousand nine hundred and sixty dollars
 hls was the precise amount of claims allowed
by the board who acted as the aoents of g
i ntam and of the united states and on
the loin of november  at london an
other convention was entered into by the ist
artide of which it was provided that his
biitannic majesty should pay to this govern
ment the sum just mentioned for the use
at the persons entitled to indemnification and
compensation by virtue of said decision
n to divert this money or any portion of
it to the payment of other claims would be a
violation of the trust reposed in this goverp
ment a breach of this solemn covenant and
a total disregard of our pledged faith if
there be one cent more than to meet those
claims there has been a mistake or a fraud on
our pait in  as chairman of the com
mittee on claims i held a correspondence
with the department on this subject and was
then informed that abont four thousand dollars
of this fund had not then been paid out to
those to whom it was due i now understand
there are about two thousand dollars still
remaining undistributed but it belongs to
the person to whom it was awarded as much
as though it were bank stock and when
tl ey or their heirs call for it at the treasury
they must receive it whether the demand be
made this year or a century hence the bill
therefore is nothing more nor less than a
proposition to pay for the slave from the public
treasury
the committee who reported this bill admit
that the claim does not come within the pro
visions of the treaty yet they say the peti
tioner lost the slave and they propose to pay
for his loss sir shall we pay for all slaves
that have been lost any other man yvho
has a slave run away has an equal claim with
this petitioner the owner of any one of the
thousandfugitives now in canada has as much
claim upon the national treasure for compen
sation as the petitioner it we pay this claim
the money must come from the pockets of the
j people the people of the free states must
pay at least threefourths of it if we pay
i this shall we pay for all fugitive slaves
j there are probably thirty or perhaps forty
thousand masters who will present claims on
us for their locomotive property each of which
i is as meritorious as the one under considera
lion
mr chairman at the very moment we are
thus called on to legislate for the support of
slavery in maryland and in the other slave
states we are told that we have no power
whatever over that institution that it is so far
beyond our control that we must not even
discuss its merits now sir i desire that
southern gentlemen shall take some position
and that they shall remain in it at leastduring
this session of congress if we have juris
diction of slavery in the states let southern
men admit the factand let us at once abolish
it from our union and wipe out the foul blot
that has so long disgraced our national char
j acter if we have not jurisdiction of it why
i are we called on to legislate for its support
jlf it be a state institution why is it con
stantly dragged into the discussions of this
j hall why are we called on to take juris
diction of it why are itsirurdens sought to
be cast upon the people of the free states
why are we to participate in its crimes a
year or two since we were not permitted to
speak our views in regard to slavey for the
reason as southern gentlemen then said that
j we had no power over it today they ask us
to legislate for its benefit yes sir it is au
established fact and history will record it
i that we are now legislating upon the rights of
j a master to his slave in maryland not at the
instance of northern members no the bill
was reported by a gentlemanfrom south car
olina mr rhett and we northern men sit
here with all becoming gravity and solemnly
enter into an investigation of this mans right
j to the body of his fellowman in that state
i repeat sir we have jurisdiction of this sub
 jeet or we have not lam willing to leave
the selection of either horn of this dilemma to
j southern men they may take their choice
i but let them choose one or the other let us
know hiere to find them i have at all times
denied that a have any constituilc  powers
in relation to this institution but if we have
the constitutional right to legislate on the sub
ject and to appropriate the treasure of the
nation in the manner proposed then sir let
us change the form of the bill before us and
give the two hundred and eighty dollars which
it appropriates to the slave instead of the
master that proposition would be much
more consonant to my feelings and is equally
within our power and much nearer our duty
 would go further and would grant fifty or a
hundred dollars to each slave who shall es
cape from his master as a bounty for his en
ergy and to begin the world with but south
ern men will start hack with horror at this pro
position tet sir if we are to appropriate
the money of our people on this subject i in
sist that the appropriation shell be for the pro
motion of freedom and not of slavery  re
peat that i arm willing southern members
should choose either position they may
give us jurisdiction of slavery or they may
retain it in their several states but if they
place it in our hands then i propose to abolish
it at once to strike it from existence but
sir i tell southern gentlemen that we will not
take jurisdiction of it today and deny that we
have any power over it tomorrow we
will not face to the right to the left and to
the rightabout at the bidding of the slave
power
sir i insist that we have no constitutional
power to sit here and appropriate our time to
the investigation of this matter of slavery
lt is an indignity to the people of the free
states they sent us here for no such ob
ject i say to gentlemen of the south take
care of slavery in your own way we will
have nothing to do with it its blessings and
its curses its evils and its benefits its vices
its crimes its guilt and its disgrace are yours
keep them to yourselves we will not con
taminate our moral or our political purity by
any participation in them
even during this present discussion gentle
men have complained that vve northern men
are striving to extend our power over slavery
this is their perpetual cry on all occasions
why sir from the time  first took my seat in
this hall to the present day i have opposed
all attempts to connect slavery with this gov
ernment i repeat what i said a few days
since that as early as  i was driven from
my seat in this body for presenting resolutions
denying the power of the federal government
to involve the free states in the support of the
coastwise slave trade
mr holmesof south carolina interrupted
mr giddings who yielded him the floor he
then stated that mr giddings was not cen
sured for presenting such resolutions but lor
presenting a petition for dissolving the union
and surreptitiously sending it to a committee
of the house
mr giddings resumed sir it is a most
lamentable fact that whenever we speak upon
this subject slaveholders in this house be
come for the time being actually demented
now there is not the least doubt that some
phantom is haunting the disordered imagina
tion of the gentleman mr liolmes to the
effect which he has named sir my resolu
tions are upon record and will bear to those
who shall follow us the sentiments i have ex
pressed here today
mr holmes interrupting mr giddings re
peated what he had previously said
mr giddings resumed the gentleihan is
entirely mistaken his assertion is false tho
surelynot so intended
mr gayle called air giddings to order
the chairman mr sims of s c deci
ded that mr giddings had violated no rule of
the house
mr giddings resumed sir i well know
the gentleman from south carolina is incapa
ble of asserting an intentional falsehood and
his persisting in the assertion is conclusive
proof of his dementation  repeat that in no
instance from my advent to this hall down to
the present day have i ceased to oppose all
interference with slavery  have endeavored
to the extent of my humble powers to separ
ate the government and the people of the free
states from all connection with it i shall
continue those efforts aqd thousands and tens
of thousands of others are exerting their
moral and political influence to effect that ob
ject and we sjrall not coase our exertions un
til by gotjs blessing we shall redeem our
selves and the government from all support of
that institution

new england convention
this body of the true and the tried friends
of emancipation assembled in boston on
i tuesday th may and continued its meet
ings during three days our engagements
at home denied us the privilege of being pre
sent after the first day we are therefore
i unable to give our readers an account of its
final doings the day of its assembling was
very tempestuous dark and rainy the meet
ing in the morning was therefore quite thinly
i attended though large considering the wca
i tlicr the morning meeting was chiefly oc
jcupied by our valued friend j n buffum
he had recently been in washington and
seen the noble drayton sayres and english
j the three men who for doing a deed in per
i feet accordance with the law of nature and of
god are now confined in our national prison
the account of his interview with them was
deeply affecting they are confined in se
parate cells each dark and loathsome two
meals aday and those consisting of corn
bread and herrings is all they get except
what they are able to purchase with their
own scanty change buffum asked them if
they had any money very little was the
reply whereupon he gave them six dollars
and bade them be of good cheer drayton
appears to be a man of nerve though well
aware of the ferocity of the men into whose
j hands he has fallen he is calm and selfpos
isessed and conversed with great freedom of
his position it was not until buffum spoke
of having seen his draytons wife and child
ren and gave him the assurance of edward
m davis that his family should not suffer
that ho gave signs of emotiona tear now
stole down his rugged cheek that
said he to buffum is all i now desire lam
ready for anything that may await me oh
j shame eternal shame on the nation boasling
its liberty and christianity while such a man
for such a deed is confined to a dungeon
friend buffum itformed us that he called
at the office of the national era in the hope
j of hearing something of the situation of these
j noble men hut strange as it may seem
neither the editor of the era nor its publisher
has dared to visit these men in prison gid
dings the whig could go baily the li
berty party man could not let this be
remembered
when friend buffum sat down william
j lloyd garrison reported a series of resolu
lions from the business committee which
brought several speakers to their feet and
quite an interesting discussion took place on
the several resolutions but mainly on the
motto of the american antislavery society
no union with slaveholders mr
thompson of walpole desired the conven
j tion to inform him what they meant by the
raotte in question there were many who
jdid not understand it and for their sake
rather than for his own ho desired an cx
planation air pierpont too did not under j
stand the motto and proceeded to show that
l the convention that adopted it were at fault
that they were in union with slaveholders
jby using thenational post office mr gar
rison and mr burleigh replied to mr pier
pont showing to the govern j
tments monopoly in carrying letters is a very
different thing from swearing to support a
constitution pledging them to return fugitive
slaves to bondage and to shoot down the
i slave in trying to gain his liberty by force j
it strikes us as being rather a small business
a mind like that of mr pierpont to be
framing such an argument to ease his con j
science he might as well say that the i
emperor of russia is in favor or in union
with republicanism because he leads a letter
from america as to say that we who have j
abandoned the political franchise are in union j
with slaveholders because we use the amer
ican post office it was however admitted
by our friends if using the post office placed
them in the necessity of upholding slavery it
was their duly to abandon the use of the
post office mr pierpont was asked if he
was ready to do this and he answered no
and how else could he answer there was
no way of escape
the meeting in the afternoon was large
and spirited occupied mainly with the same
question that had engaged the attention of the
meeting in the morning mr phillips was
the chief speaker dwelling at large upon the
justice and the expediency of maintaining our
i present exalted positionno union with
slaveholders mr foster followed but
called attention to the church rather than the
i government the afternoon meeting ad
journed from the melodeon to meet in fan
euil hall in the evening
the meeting here was worthy of the time
the place and the holy cause of freedom
which it nret to promote charles c bur
leigh arid william  cbanning were the
chief speakers their addresses were of the
highest order sweeping along with them the
judgment and sympathies of the great audi
ence before theip we hops to be able next
week to give our readers some of the excel
lent resolutions and other proceedings of this
convention
speech of hon j it giddings
we have crowded out some original articles
this week in order to lay before our readers
a part of the noble speech recently delivered
by this fearless representative in congress
in comparison with this speech how tame are
the speeches of the great liberty party
candidate and how contemptibly cringing is
the course of the national era the era
and its friends are always talking about its
latitude and the duty of using soft language
to suit it why does not giddings put in
the same plea he is in the same place
and is liable to all the abuse a an y
other professed abolitionist i liable yet
without a word of cunoiliqtiqn ho pours the
most scorching truths upon the naked hearts
of slaveholders and is ready to take the con
sequences give us the man who is an

was therefore with feelings of no ordinary
pleasure that we witnessed their reappear
ance at the recent anniversary meeting of the
american antislavery society in new
york we in common with others hailed
their presence and noble songs on that occa
sion as evidence of their return to their
former position on the antislavery platform
and took both as an expression of regret that
they had faltered and erred in singing com
plimentary songs to henry clay in this
however it seems we were mistaken the
i lynn pioneer and herald of freedom which
i seems to speak by authority says they
i meant no such thing and couples our humble
j name with its declaration in such a manner
jas toleave the impression that we sympathise j
i with him in this view of the case it therej
i fore becomes our duty to speak of this matter
again though we had hoped that it was
settled to the satisfaction of all concerned
i and are quite sorry that any further reference
j to it is rendered necessary
j it is a little singular that papers like the
lynn pioneer and the chronotype should
j seem anxious to make out a case of nonre
pentance for the hutchinson family the
singing in honor of henry clay if we may
credit their former professions is as much at
variance with their idea of antislavery duty
and testimony as with that of william lloyd
garrison wendell phillips ourself or any
other friend of the antislavery cause it
seems to us that the course of these papers
is to be understood in the light of their strong
dislike of the american antislavery society
lather than in their regard for the honor in
tegrity and fidelity of the ilutchinsons the
occurrence at the new york meeting has
furnished them with another opportunity of
pouring out their venom
the only point of difference between our
self and wendell phillips relates to the
manner of receiving the hutchinson family
into our meetings he thought it necessary
to prescribe special terms on which the pre j
sence and songs of the hutchinson family
were welcomed into our meetings whereas
we think that the constitution of the society
settles that question and leaves it out of the j
power of any member of the society to say
who are welcome and who are not welcome
on its platform either to sing preach or
pray it leaves each member to decide for
ujrij or herself his or her fitness to sing or
speak in our meetings we therefore thought 
and said at the time to some one near us 
that we regretted the course pursued by our
friend phillips and thought it would have j
been far better to have left each member
the meeting to draw what inference he pleased
from the presence and songs of the hutchioj
sons we are free to say however that j
our inference was substantially the same as i
that of mr phillips we took their songs j
as an evidence of their having ceased from j
doing proslavery evil and a resolve to demote j
their powers to the cause of the slave we i
may also add that we believe so still we
cannot but believe it when two of their numj
her within the last ten days assured us per
sonally that such was the case how could
it be otherwise  the attempt of the pioneer 
and the chronotype to make the reverse
appear cannot but do that family great
injury and stamp them as popularityseeking
knaves rather than highminded honest asd
devoted friends of the slave if the view we
now take of this matter be not in accordance
with the views of the hutchinson family we
hope they will do themselves and the public
the justice of defining their own position and
not leave it to mr clapp or any one else to
do it for them
eastern tour
one of the most interesting visits which it
was our happiness to make during our recent
eastern torn was to the house and home or
the houses and homes of the hutchinson
family in milford n h while in new
york during the anniversary week we had
been invited by the family to make an anti
slayery visit to their mountain home
with a view to stirring up the good people in
that region to their duties in respect to
slavery we consented and dropped a line
to them stating that we should be with them
on saturday night and would lecture as
many times during sunday th may as to
them might seem best accordingly on
saturday having the good fortune to meet
with our good antislavery friend loring
moody in lynn we proceeded to milford
on arriving at the village we scarcely knew
the place such has been the rapidity of its
growth and improvement within the last four
years
the ilutchinsons are about a mile and a
half from the village on the border of a most
beautiful valleyten or fifteen miles in length
and six or eight in width surrounded by
verdant hills forming just a nest of beauty
suited to such birds of melody we found
asa hoeing judson building a stone fpnce
and john ploughing to us this vyus one of
the most interesting sights which wo have
seen in a long time here were a pompnny
of the most popular vocalists in this country
yhose songs despite the unwelcome truths
which they frequently contain never fail to
draw a crowd of delighted listeners whose
music is itself a fortune to see such per
sons possessing such powers instead of
being out constantly seeking sordid gold
which they have only to seek in order to
find deliberately working away on their
farms yrapt in the sweet associations of their
own mountain home earning probably with
their hard toil about a dollar per day and
content with that when by sinking them
selves to mere singers and getting some city
notions about work they might gain hun
dreds is a most rare and interesting sight
it was no makebelieve this work their
hands were hard with toil we felt them in
the hearty shake of friendship which they
gave ns they ceased from their various
labors only long enough to give us welcome
and then to work they went again it was
just the treatment which put us fully at ease
at their home for it showed them to be men
intent on the happiness that waits on industry
mr moody and ourself held four meetings
in milford on sundayone at ten oclock
again at halfpast one another at four and j
another at seven in the evening all of which j
were very well attended they were realj
oldfashioned antislavery meetings full of
life and spirit in addition to our humble
advocacy the hutchinson family and another
interesting family of sweet singers known
as the dunbar family of the same place lent
the aid of their inspiring music we shall
not soon forget those meetings nor the de
voted friends of the cause who did so much
to make our meetings successful it was a
sabbath days journey toward the heaven of
peace on earth and good will toward men
cincinnati may  
dear douglass since my last t have
held meetings in this city in harrisonstreet
church in sixthstreet methodist church in
union baptist church baker street ad
dressed the sons of temperance in sixthj

last delivered an address in bakeistreet

the colored orphan asylum on which occa
j casion a handsome collection of upwards of
sixty dollars was taken up for the support of
j the institution on wednesday evening lec
tured in bakerstreet church on thursday
 evening addressed the united daughters
 a society having for its object the liquidation
 of claims against the a m e church du
ring the intervals i have been engaged solicit
i ing subscribers to the north star
i
i stated in my last the number of colored
residents in this city to be about  among
whom there is a great deal of real wealth 
consider the colored inhabitants of this place
i so far as real estate is concerned to be in as
 comfortable a condition as any place i have
yet visited either east or west i speak
intelligently and knowingly when i say there
 is a great deal of real estate possessed by col
ored people here i had not the least idea of
it until i investigated among the real esj
i tate holders in the city many possess most
j oxctdlent farms and large tracts of land in
different counties several of whom i know j
who possess from one to eleven hundred acres 
of land each with the wealth possessed by j
j the colored citizens here great tilings might
i be effected if properly applied
there are various mechanics among the
colored people some of w hom are doing fine
j business among them i perceive extensive
smithing establishments many carpenters
shoemakers bricklayers plasterers and in
deed most of the mechanical trades amply
demonstrating our capacity to take care of our
i selves there are among the respectable me
chanics none who stand more conspicuously
j than henry boyd frequently spoken of and
whose name is widely known among abolitionj
i ists his establishment is on the corner of
i sycamore and eighth streets and is quite an i
j extensive furniture manufactory lie gives
constant employment to eight or ten hands inj
iris established and sells off his furniture as
fast as they can make it bedsteads are the
staple article and these rate in prise from
sß to   saw in his furniture rooms j
some of the finest articles mr boyd a few
years ago as you have noticed was a slavej
and now is not only able to take care of him
self but give constant employment to some
five or six white men as well as a number ofj
colored there being both employed thereby
enabling thei the white men to take carej
of themselves mr boyd  believe takes
no active part among the colored people
this i regret as he might be very useful he
is a subscriber to the north star
there is one colored gentleman who keeps
a fine confectionary and public saloon sev
eral who keep smaller saloons and places ofj
entertainment several groceries of respectaj
ble dimensions and many who sell and
trade in market this is what i desire to
seeour people coming out of the old em
ployments of domestic servitude and menial j
occupations this must be done if we exj
pcct ever to he elevated to an equality with j
the dominant class
of societies there are some six among
which tlie united colored american
stands foremost now numbering some three j
hundred members it lias several branches
and a grand head all of which aic located in
cincinnati
there are five or six churches among the
coloredpeople some of which are of the in
dependent denomination and some are in
connection with the white church governj
ments of these the bakerstreet baptist
church and new street methodist church
stand so connected the former having its own
pastor who is a colored man the congrcgaj
tion possessing full ownership in the property
while the latter has a white pastor and the
church if i mistake not belongs to the white 
methodist conference there are also sev
eral sabbathschools one i believe attaches
to each of the churches ard i can bear testi v
mony to the excellence of the one belonging
to the free wesleyan church harrison st
this school  found very interesting
there is a fine school taught here by mrs
eleanof thomas formerly miss henderson
a young lady of acquired accomplishments aj
student of oberlin mrs thomas lias some
 or more pupils in hey school all colored of
course and as she is herself of the proscribed
race does credit to it as a literary teacher
the high school formerly under the
charge of rev hiram gilmore i did not find
in the condition i expected aside from the
location and arrangement of buildings i was
disappointed in many respects the principal
schoolroom is above the true wesleyan
church a fine building of medium size on
harrison street entrance from the back yard j
for the purpose of making room an adjacent
back building has been erected but these asj
well as the main apartment have its accessby
a flight of high stairways from the yardwhich
reduces the story to a mere loft comparatively
i should have no objection to this arrange
ment had it been the result of necessity but
knowing as i do that it was selected as a
matter of choice and that too in the neigh
borhood of so many pyeferable spots that
might have been obtained as the purchasers j
had ample means i cannot but give my dis
approbation to the selection of the place as
not at all being such as would have been 
made by any person who bad in charge a
high school for white children instead o
colored the location is an outoftheway
background place and appears as though it
were chosen to hide the pupils from public
view if it be argued that there would have
been a difficulty in obtaining a more eigible
spot for such a purpose i answer that the
success would have been as probable as that
i of the colored orphan asylum in a fine
i central part of the city and many of the col
f ored churches
j the former pupils of the cincinnati high
r j school are not what i expected to find them
i i here most cheerfully almit that there has
t been some progress on the part of many sev
 eral ltttle misses having learned musicam
excellent accomplishment and two or three
i youths on whom particular pains has beem
xj taken qualified to some extent in the useful
f branches of a business education but the
most of them have learned comparatively
nothing instead of a substantial qualifica
cation such as i expected to find in these
 pupils a respectable knowledge of the ele
t ments of science generally sorry am i to say
it that the most of those that i have seen and
j examined know but little about those branches
i of education
composition or the correct construction ofi
sentences appears to he foreign to the former
pupils of this high school many of them
now after having finished their educa
cation as it is termed by many when putting
their hand to paper write as though there
was no such letter as a capital i this i
much regret and itwould appear as though
the greater part of the time of the pupils
j was spent in preparing for exhibitions which
of course make great displays of seeming
qualification whether or not there be any
thing real lam borne out in this opinion by
j the display of music on the part of many of
r the little misses the whole of whom
 play the same pieces and when done with
these go no farther besides the parents
s of several of them quaintly observed that
x their daughters were rather indifferent about
c music although they had great talents for it
and certain i can say they have in reality
but the secret of tho matter was that these
f misses had been taught for the purpose of ex
hibiting in the school and so soon as they havq
j done with their exhibition excises all i
j done in the main
 expect here to meet a rebut on the part of
the friends of the school but cannot help it
my mission is to assist in the elevation of the
oppressed and downtrodden of our land in
order faithfully to do which we must speak
the truth and expose error and this i shall
do though the heavens fall
i wish it not to he thought that i would
not award to mr gilmore what is due him
far be it from me and i disclaim all or any
such intention i thank mr gilmore most
heartily thank him for the motives which
prompted him but really think that he fell far
short of attaining the object of his project or
even adopting the proper method for his at
j tainmert tn the estimation of cincinnatians
j generally it was a very good colored school
viewing it in the light of a colored school it
probably as veiygood not having it in my
power to determine what qualifies a colored
school but one thing i do knowit was very
far from being a good school
mary k miles the accomplished young
lady who was induced to leave the east by
j mr gihnoie and come west to assist him
did not get an opportunity to make herself
useful mr gilmore having withdrawn from
the school shortly after her arrival it falling
into the hands of ether principals miss miles
did not understand in coming to the west
that she was to hold an inferior position in the
female departments but the arrangements ap
pear to have been made and she had but to
leave her situation or act as a mere monitor
she is a noble giala faithful friend of the
slave and nobly has she sustained her posi
tion v
the high school at present numbers fifty
pupils and is under tile charge of dr child
j and lady assisted by tiieir daughter i am
in hopes they may tench their children some
thing more substantial anefiuseful than mere
j exhibition displays they are very fine peo
pie and no doubt will do their duty there
is another school here taughtby rev mr
j clemens pastor of the true wesleyan chapel
a very amiable gentleman this is said to be
in a prosperous condition
i would call special attention to the colored
orphan asylum of this city this is an in
slitution got up through the industry of the
colored ladies and geatleeaenin  for the
use ard protection of orphans rejected from
participation in the state institution of similar
character the ground anclbuikling cost con
siderable and much expense was incurred in
repairing and fitting it up there are now four
teen of these little creatures thrown by
chance upon the cold charities of the world
are able to find a good and cwmfoirtbh blame
the present matron is mrs bowler the
relict of a brother to the mr bowler who is
at present i believe a prominent citizen of
portauprince hayti
although the institution is not in every pary
ticular complete yet it is well kept neat and
clean and vigorous efforts are now being
made to establish a school department book
department and in every other respect make
it what it should be the white citizens of
the place have been very liberally disposed
toward the asylum and it has recently en
gaged rev w p newman a qualified and
talented gentleman to act as travelling ft
nancjal agent who has recently returned
j front a tour apd reported very favorably a
donation occasionally fiom abroad maybe the
means of providing a home for some forlorn
motherless child and i ask through this me
dium the friends of humanity at a distance to
remember the colored orphan asylum of
 cincinnati this claims upon
i the state and it is a burning shame that the
legislature does not make an appropriation
j annually for its support
the colored citizens of cincinnati have a
fine cemetery which was consecrated with
ceremony by rev samuel lewis on the bth
inst i was to have spoken also on the occa
sion but by some mishap did not arrive in
time but like the foolish virgins found tho
doors closed when i arrived or in other
words the ceremony over and the people
coming away this truly is a lovely spot
i two and ahalf miles from the city on a beau
tiful macadamised road leading north if
j was purchased by a company of gentlemen of
the united colored american association
laid off in several hundred family lots with a
reserved tract for promiscuous interments
this is a most praiseworthy undertaking on
the part of the colored citizens and how
shameful the necessity of a separate burial
place for the dead america is drinking a
double draught of infamy
a most heart rending occurrence took
place in covington ky opposite this city
on friday morning last as follows a slave
holder named mullin back of covington in
grant county sold to an infamous souldriver
by the name of rust a man woman and
child who were placed in covington slave
prisonfor such it is in realityfor safe
keeping previous to his going down the
river by some means the parents learned
that their darling babe but twenty months
old was to have been left behind the fran

her husband for his pocketknife which was
veiy smallcut the throat of herwjhild held
her neck to her husband while he deliberately
cut her throattheno yes then like a
man and a hero deliberately cut his own
throat but owing to the smallness of the
knife did not succeed in quite taking his own
life a noble woman more deserving of
fame than the queen of the amazons or a
semaramisworthy thrice worthy to be as
sociated in history with the noble wife of as j
drubal most noble man a virginias 
the manly and heroic deed that thou hast
perpetrated shall live in the heart of every

political creeds and parties
we abolitionists who are but onlookers at
the political strife and party jars which are
now about to come to a crisis can afford to
laugh at aud sometimes even to pity the
grotesque and singular performances which
are every now and then got up by the differ
ent political parties for the gratification of
the public the election of a president is a
serious matter or ought to be a serious mat
ter but after all it is ridiculous enough i
there is very little choice between cass and
clay and taylor they are all three the easy i
tools of the southern oligarchy yet what
a fuss is made about the election of this or
that man who is supposed to be the avail
able candidate of the whig or tho demo
crat vote the ticket stand by your
partyno disunion are the cries
that we hear on all hands and how little
in the midst of all this sound and fury and
hubbub does the innocent adherent of these
parties know what is his own political creed
the party is the only thing that is in his
mind he must go with his party and vote
for the candidate appointed by his party
to think or act for himself is entirely out of

than three weeks have winged themselves
away with lightninglike rapidity since i
last wrote to you and although no obtruding
business cares have prevented me i have not
until now found sufficient leizure time to re
sume my pen in truth  have scarcely even
yet been able to arouse myself from the in
toxicating influence which my sojourn in this
isle of the south has thrown around me
you are not to infer from thence that port
auprincc is a model of beauty and magnifi

lofty minarets a realization of the bright pic
tarings of oriental fiction far from it
when launching out upon the atlantic 
left the princely city of new york behind
me and found myself upon the broad waters
out of sight of my native land
caelum untlique et undique poutus
i had looked my last upon cloudcapped tow
ers and gorgeous palaces true there is a
pleasurable something in a view of portau
pripcej situated as it is in the bosom of its
ampiiheatre of rills with its long and regu
lar streets gradually rising in almost terrace
like gradations from the harbor to its eastern
extremity and it is also indebted for a por
tion of the favor with which a stranger re
gards it to the sense of novelty which he
experiences while gazing upon houses with
roofs abruptly rising to a peak and long gal
leries oygrrhanging the sidewalks iut we
would search our bosoms in vain for that
feeling of awe and admiration which a con
templation of the oldworld capitals is said to
awaken by the combination of pilaster and
shaft and architrave in their architectural ma
gica magic to which many of the cities in
our own republic can pretend and although
there are quite a number of fine buildings in
this island metropolis still they only seem to
bring into bolder relief the saddening desola
tion which the ravages of time and fire have
produced yet amidst it all there still
breathes a spirit of former magnificence and
in the variously designed fountains terraced
promenades and public squares neglected we
read the evidences of an earlier and a brighter
beauty but if art and its achievements have
been suffered to languish into decay and re
flect back no longer the borrowed light of
genius nature that requires no foreign aid
j still revels here in untrammeled splendor and
j in the contemplation of its creationdated ex
i cellence we forget to sigh over the perishable
results of human effort
well indeed does this lovely spot deserve
the appellation of its aboriginal inhabitants

it has fallen restored to it the name bestowed
by its earlier possessors as it was in the

lightful commingling of music beauty and
perfume that prompted the wild fancy of the
followers of columbus to imagine an el do

savannahs of the floridas or upon the coasts
of the spanish main still
the waves dash gaily on thy shore
fair island of the southern sea
as bright in beauty as when of yore
it blossomed a welcome to the brave genoese
mho had left his dear home oera stormy main
to bring a new world neatli his monarchs reign
to reap the rewards of a monarchs breath
honors andpraise disgrace and death
basking in beauty it doth seem
like the bright picturings of a dream
which marks some snfiling infants sleep
ere it hath bitter cause to weep
oer all the sorrowings and ills
the guilty woes the deeds of orimo
with which mans wayward folly fills
his life een in its earliest time
as when the grecian artist wrought
upon a masterpiece of art
to form his ideal beauty sought
from various shapes each lovely part
and blent them in one glorious whole
to charm the eye transfix the soul
and hold it in enraptured fires
so seem the glad waves to have sought

the oathbound guardians of the sacred
rights of the people of this town met at one
oclock this afternoon to act in conformity
to their high obligations and giant indulg
ences to vice and crime after very grave
not to say prayerful deliberations these sage
civil fathers came to the following pious
and patriotie conclusion in reference to the
several applicants for license to kill
for so much gold we license thee
a draught to sell
that bows the strong enslaves the free
and opens wide the gates of hell
for public good requires that some
since many die should live by rum
there are hearts to break there are souls to ruin
from the ways of peace to the paths of sin
there are homes to be rendered desolate
there is trusting love to be changed to hate
there are hands that murder must crimson red
there are hopes to crush there is blight to be shed
oer the young and the pure and fair
till their lives are crushed by the fiend despair j
this is the liquor we equip you to sell
which curses the earth and peoples hell
which quenchefe the light on the inner shrine
of the human soul divine

the presiding genius and masterspirit
among them the man who made all the
motions and carried his determinations thro
or in other words toioed the boat was w c
d q kind of an antediluvian rumseller he
said he had always lived in a tavern had
been brought up by the side qf q bottle
thought ao his fath e t i believe was a
liquor seller before him so he got it in the
natral way whats bred in the bone
stays long in tile flesh he said he was
a greater friend to the temperance causa than
i was or esquire peet that if he could have
his way about it he would stop the making j
importing and retailing of liquor that he 
would go for a law making it a penal offence
to manufacture import or use intexicating
drinks  many other nice things he said
only did not which are recorded in the
book of chronicles such as calling a temper
ance fnember of the cause j w peet
who would not go for license a hypocrite
c this is the man who moved and
through whose influence the board granted
license mr a hardly knew whether he
was in the body or not or under what
star he reigned he said he had read
the statutes over and over forty times
and yet he behangedif he could tell any
thing aboyt it he was entirely at a loss to
know how to act he confessed his ignor
ance and said he had written to more eru
dite heads for counsel on the subject but
got no light whether we were under the
law of  or the old law or whether we
were without any law on the subject he
could not tell under the old law lie
said he was in favor of license under the
law of  he was opposed to any but tem
peiance license under the law of  he said
iie was a nolicense man under the present
state of thingshedidnt know but he should be
obliged to go fur license though he very much
regretted the state of the law which might
impel him to that course and many otliet
erudite things said he too numerous to
mention they may be found in the chroni
cles when the scribe asked him if he would
vote license he kinder did and kinder
didnt and the scribe who understood it
recorded his name fur license mr s said
wal lie didnt say much of anything i
guess his mind was pretty much swallowed
up in the mind of the grand scribe when
he was asked by the grand worthy patriarch
if he voted license be kinder nodded yes i
sir and the scribe put down his name for
license
the scribe then very delectably recorded
his own vote for the same groat moral and
sublime purpose thus moralized and thus
voted three of these sworn conservators of the
public weal
o judgment thou art fled to brutish beasts
and men have lost their reason
thus have these men voted and that too 
after the town has twice voted no license
there were two members of the board who
exhibited some moral principle and decision
on the occasion who opposed the action of the
majority and nobly refused to vote a license
for so vile and ruinous a business or give
any countenance to it declaring that they
would sooner resign their office than be
guilty of so great a wrong they took a
commonsense view of the subject and acted
with reference to the right and true they
considered themselves as acting under the
law as amended in  the law of  only
having been repealed that they wore
clothed with discretionary power that inns
for the accommodation of travellers might be
licensed as temperance houses that taverns
or liquor houses were not necessary but
were sources of corruption and crime that
they were under oath and bound to act for
the public good and could not therefore grant
license
all honor to these men their action on
this subject will ever be to them a source of
satisfaction and will secure for them the re
spect of true men the others will probably
get what they wanted and cared most for
the favor and the votes of liquor men and
those who go for party liquor or no liquor
but what then ah echo answers what
then in the language of the bible shame
ful spewing shall be on their glory lleb
d chapter please read the whole chapter
these men have licensed three tqverns in this
little place when one public house is allsuffi
cient they have said under oath that
three liquor houses are necessary in this place
who believes any such thing they have
said under oath that the public good de
manded three rum taverns here who be
lieves any such thing they have said un
der oath that the men they have licensed to
make drunkards and idlers and gamblers
and profane swearers and paupers and crimi

good moral character who believes that
men engaged in such a work of demoraliza

caste among the sons of temperance
in a recent number of the albany patriot
we find a long letter from george w clarke
the distinguished antislavery vocalist in
which he brings to light an important fact
relative to the sons of temperance it ap
pears that in  mr clark was invited to
talk and sing on the subject of temperance at
a division of the sons in the city of new
i t ork and being anxious to promote the good
cause he accepted the invitation in con
sideration of his services he was elected an
honorary member and afterwards a regular
benefit member thus giving him a good op
portunity to become acquainted with the char 
acter and influence of the organization but
his impression seems not to have been at all j
favorable and he has therefore made a public
declaration of his unwillingness to cooperate
with them one reason for this course is his
conviction that the order is founded upon
the unchristian principle of caste of prejuj
dice against colorand will not admit colored j
persons gs this position has often been j
denied fie takes considerable trouble to estaj
blish it by extracts from reports and letters i
up shews that samuel r ward a wellj
known qqcj highlyrespected colored minister
and editor of ah antislavery paper united
with a lodge of the sons of temperance in
cortlandville n y when information of
the fact reached the grand worthy patri
arch in new york he immediately suspended
the deputy of that district and sent a special
deputy to inquire into the matter who took
from the division its books papers docu
ments c and as one his reasons for doing
so says they had actually initiated a colored
manan act strictly prohibited by a reso i
tion of the grand division in view of
these facts mr clarke concludes his article j
by saying
i was aware that the colored people of
this country had been silly enough to send to
england for a charter to organize themselves
into odd followshaving been refused a
charter by tlieii countrymen in the united
states but i was not aware that after hav
ing excluded colored persons from the privi
lege of membership in the subordinate di
visions the grand division had actually
denied them theright of organizing divisions
among themselves slaveholders oppress
ors of men unjust and cruel arc received
with open arms but a man with sable
brow however talented just and pure in
life is rejected verily one looks in vain
for a semblance of christianity here alas
for the poor colored man he is excluded
from the statehe is excluded from steam
boat cabins and dining tables he is excluded
from the schools and collegeshe is excluded
from the churches unless he submits to the
degradation qf the infamous negro pew
he may however if he can build his own
church his own school but the sana pro
fessedly a benevolent institution yield to the
wicked prejudice against color and descend a
step lower not only refusing him the negro
pew in their temperance church but deny

it is an abiding disgrace to the nation that
such a man should be allowed to retain the
place he holds the only effect of such a
religious teacher is to dishonor and to disgrace
religion itself the truth of this has long
been felt andacknowledged here by men of
all parties so strongis this feeling that the
committee of the house who had the ar
angement of the funeral services of mr ad
ans refused to permit mr sheer to have any
part whatever in those services this was a
signal and most significant expression of their
estimation of the man and although the re
verend rejected expressed much indignation at
being thus excluded there was rejoicing
among all parties when they heard of it so
much is he despised by those around whom he
lawns and plays the toady
some tune since there was some talk of
making a move for the abolition of slavery in
tho district of columbia mr slicer came
forward with a paper to which lie solicited
signatures praying for the continuance of
that blessing it chanced to fall from his
pocket and was picked up by some of the
colored citizens of washington who kept
it in grateful remembrance of mr slicer
whose name if i am not mistaken headed the
list
about that time the pulpit of the colored
methodist church in this city was vacant and
was supplied in turn by the ministers of the
several churches in the neighborhood when
it came to ue turn of brother slicer the
members of the church both bond and free
bearing in remembrance the interest air s
had shown in their allairs determined that
one holding such views of them as chattels i
not men should ot enter their pulpit lie
was accordingly met in the aisle by a strong
delegation of gentlemen of color who very
civilly but most distinctly gave him to un
derstand that he could not be permitted to
preach to them at first mr s was disposed
to take airs upon himself and claimed the
right to preach to them whether they
wanted him or no but he soon found they
not only had a better appreciation of his fit
ness for the ministry than the u s senate
hut were determined to act up to their views
and accordingly he made good his retreat and
stalked out of the church without waiting for
their ungrateful hands to put him out

dering the dearest ties in nature thus sepa

fine feelings from a system so foul and fiend
ish as slavery it would ha unreasonable
because a corrupt tree cannot bring forth
good fruit therefore knowing that with
out associative action we cannot render effi

invite the cooperation of the citizens of roch

to bear in mind the injunctions of jesus ail
things whatsoever ye would men should do to
you do ye even so to them remember
also the beautiful parable in which he calls
our attention to the sick and to those who are
in prison and concludes by tho forcible asser

unto me we feel assured all that have
hearts to feel and are careful to attend to the

mined to live for the good of our race instead
of devoting all their time to their own per
sonal easeall who feel bound to improve the
precious time allotted to them here by pto
moting as much as possible the cause of truth
and righteousness in the earth will come for
ward in the work of laboring to banish forever
the demon of slavery from our land and in
so doing instead of an example of corruption
and wickedness we should be a light to the i
world
we hope no one will feel too poor nor any
too rich to enlist in this holy cause the
christians influence in whatever situation is
always salutary and will certainly produce its
good effects we ask for the aid of men and
of women we call on the old and the
young the farmer the mechanic and the
merchant we ask all and every one to give
us their help to devote what they can spare
either of money or of the fruits of their la
bor to the work of restoring men and women
to themselves to their manhood to the rights
and blessings with which they were endowed
by our creator
for this object we propose holding a fair
in december next we ask the females in
the adjoining towns and country around us to
get up sewing circles and prepare such arti
cles as will be most saleable and to come fur
nish tables give us their company and help
us not only in selling those things thus pre
pared but iu convincing the public mind of
the necessity of our perseverance and fidelity
and thus be helpers in hastening the day of
emancipation

sketches of modern reforms
and reformers
n great britain ajsd ireland
down to the period of the trials of
took hardy and others for high
treason and of the successful attack
then made by mr erskine on the
doctrine of constructive treason the
english law of treason was infamous
among other things treason was de
fined to be waging war against the
king or compassing and imagining his
death or the overthrow of his govern
ment the law evidently contemplated
the doing of some act designed and
adapted to accomplish these ends i
but the construction of the courts had
subverted this principle and declared
the mere utterance of words high trea
son in the reign of edward iv a
citizen was executed for saying he
would make his son heir of the crown j
meaning as was supposed that he
would make him the heir of his inn j
called the crown another whose
favorite buck the king had wantonly
killed was executed for saying lie
wished the buck horns and all in the
bowels of the man who counselled the
king to kill it the court gravely
held that as the king had killed it of
his own accord and so was his own
counsellor this declaration was imagin
ing the kings death and therefore
treason so it had been held that
using words tending to overawe par
kment was levying war on the king i
and was therefore treasonable
the times of which i write were
prolific of state prosecu i ms erski le
was the ready counsel of the proscribed
reformers of the last century as brough
am of this his great effort on these
trials was to convince the court that
the juries had the right to decide upon
the character of the publication in
making up their verdicts or in other
phrase they were judges both of law
and fact in this effort he had many
a fierce conflict with the judges when
with his usual courage he braved
their rebukes and challenged the exe
cution of their hinted threats to com
mit him for contempt he always
argued this point fully to the court in
the presence of the jury and such
was his mastery over the reason and
the feelings that he sometimes pre
vented a conviction when he could not
obtain an acquittal it was in an 
affair of this sort that he had a quarrel
with mr justice buller a judge who
coupled double the imperiousness of
mansfield with half his talents and
whose frown glowing out from under
his huge wig has silenced many a bar
rister of more than common nerve
the respectable dean of st asaph
who breathed the mountain air of j
wales published a clever political
tract under the guise of a dialogue
between king george and a farmer
erskine went down to defend him
buller presided at the trial erskine
argued his favorite topic with more
than his accustomed ability the jury
listened with absorbing attention the
judge with impatient interruptions he
charged furiously against the dean
and told the jury if they believed he
published the tract they must render a
general verdict of guilty the words
of reason and power of the great bar
rister and his piercing eyes which
rivetted everything within their gaze
went with them to their room they
returned a verdict in these words
guilty of publishing only the
astonished judge ordered them out i
again with directions to render a gen j
eral verdict of guilty erskine inter
posed and insisted on their right to j
render such a verdict as they had i
the judge replied tartly and the jury i
retired again they came in with the
same verdict the judge reprimanded i
them while erskine insisted that their i
verdict should be recorded buller i
retorted explained his law to the re
refractory panfd and sent them out i
the third time they appeared with the i
same verdict the judge grew furious i
and said unless they rendered a gen
eral verdict he should order the clerk
to enter it guilty erskine pro
tested in strong terms buller ordered
him to sit down erskine said he
would not sit down nor would he allow
the court to record a verdict of guilty
against his client when the jury had
rendered no such verdict buller hint
ed at commitment erskine defied
him the jury were frightened and
in their panic assented to a general
verdict of guilty erskine excepted
and carried the case to the full bench
but the day of triumph was at hand
so clearly had he in his arguments ex i
posed the iniquity of the rule if in
deed it was law at all and so pertin
aciously had he contested it on the
trial of the dean that parliament
passed a declaratory act thus admit
ting that erskine was right giving
jurors in these prosecutions the
power to render a verdict upon the
whole offence chargedthat is making
them the judges of the law as well
as the fact i need not say that
after this prosecutions for seditious
libels became much less potent wea
pons in the hands of royal and minis
terial persecutors and reformers
breathed freer
it does the heart good to behold
talents like erskines devoted to such
purposes to see the foremost lawyer
of his time in the midst of widespread
aristocratic clamor and despite the
fulrninations of kings and ministers
and judges take the side of humble
men who are denounced as incen
diaries agrarians levellers french
jacobins traitors and infidels plotting
to murder their sovereign upheave his
throne and prostrate the altars of the
church and these are but a tithe of
the catalogue and for years perform
prodigies of labor for poor clients and
poorer pay thus blocking up the
avenues to preferment in his cherished
profession and all for the love he
bears the common cause such a
spectacle should go somewhat to blunt
the edge of those taunts so constantly
aimed at a profession which he adored
and adorned and which in every
struggle for human rights has furnish
ed leaders to the popular party among
the bravest of the brave the law
like every other profession has its
scum and its vermin and yields its
share of dishonest men but they are
dishonest not because they arc lawyers
but because they are scoundrels and
would have been so had they chosen
to be merchants physicians or horse
jockies
but we must leave mr erskine by
saying that he possessed ability and
learning to maintain the boldest posi
tions eloquence for the most thrilling
appeals imagination to sustain the
loftiest flights he was graceful in
action melodious in execution and had
an eye of whose fascinating power
jurors were often heard to speak he
was a wit and a logician a lawyer and
a reformer a man cast in the noblest
mould of his species
mr erskine was powerfully sustain
ed in his efforts for law reform by the
great liberal leader of the house of
commons ciiaries james fox de
serves a conspicuous place among the
early reformers of england entering
parliament in  when just turned
twentyone he rallied under the banner
of mr burke then the chief debater
on the whig side whose lead he fol
lowed through the doubtlul contest on
american questions and when victory
and peace and independence crowned
their efforts the chief resigned the
standard of opposition into the hands
of his younger and more robust lieu
tenant fox is called the disciple of
burke and after their unnatural es
trangement he gratefully said i
have learned more from burke alone
than from all other men and authors
he remained in the commons till his
death in  and although hampered
by aristocratic connexions and the
leadership of his party his generous
nature and warm heart through nearly
forty years of parliamentary life car
ried his great talents to the liberal
j side he headed the forlorn hope of
english freedom during the panic fol
lowing the french revolution and in
the darkest and stormiest nights of that
long and gloomy period his voice
sounded clear and firm above the tem
pest hurling defiance at his foes and
bidding the few friends of man and
constitutional liberty who stood around
him be of good cheer for the day of
their redemption was drawing on his
speeches against the stamp act the
taxation of the colonies the american
war the test act the suspension of the
habeas corpus the treason and sedition
bills the slave trade and in favor of
parliamentary reform religious tolera
tion catholic emancipation the rights
of juries and of peace contain vol
umes of liberal principles which endear
his name to the friends of humanity in
both hemispheres as erskine was
the first advocate that ever stood at the
english bar so fox was the first de
bater that ever appeared in its com
mons burke wrote of him after their
separation i knew him when he was
nineteen since which he has risen to
be the most brilliant and accomplished
debater the world ever saw his
argumentative powers were of the
highest order and his wit his invec
tive and his appeals to the judgment
and feelings unrivalled in the parti
san warfare of extemporaneous debate
he bore down on his antagonist with an
energy which when fully roused bor
dered on ferocity but it was the fer
ocity of impassioned logic and intense
reasoning not content with once go
ing over the ground in controversy he
travelled it again and again unfolding
new arguments and adding additional
facts till his searching and vigorous
eloquence had discovered and demol
ished every objection that lay in his
tradk the v ry embodiment of the
reasoning element in man lie saw
through his subject with rapid glances
grappled sturdily with all its strong
points despised mere ornaments re
jected all bewildering flights of the
imagination and shunned excursions
into collateral fields which skirted his
line of argument in these latter
respects he was totally unlike his great
master as his reasoning powers were
cast in the most colossal mould so his
heart was of the finest and noblest
quality mackintosh has justly said
that he united in a most remarkable
degree the seemingly repugnant cha
racters of the mildest of men and the
most vehement of orators his ap
peals to magnanimity to generosity to
integrity to justice to mercy thrilled
the soul of freedom while the tide of
consuming lava which he poured on
hypocrisy meanness dissimulation
cruelty and oppression made the
grovellers at the footstool of power hide
with fear and shame he was a states
man of the broadest and most liberal
views his capacious mind was stored
with political knowledge he had deep
ly studied the institutions of ancient
and modern states and no man better
understood the general and constitu
tional history of his own country nor
the delicate machinery which regulated
its complicated foreign and domestic
affairs as bold as a lion he never
cowered before the king his ministers
or his minions but gloried in being
the mouthpiece of outdoor reformers
whose radical principles and humble

mr fox was totally unlike his great
rival pitt was stately taciturn and of
an austere temper fox was easy so
cial and of a kindly disposition pitt
was tall and grave and entering the
house carefully dressedwalked proud
ly to the head of the treasury bench
and took his seat as dignified and dumb
as a statute fox was burly and jo
vial entered the house in a slouched
hat and with a careless air and as he
approached the opposition benches
had a nod for this learned city member
land a joke for that wealthy knight of
the shire and sat down as much at
ease as if he were lounging in the bacls
parlor of a country inn pitt as the
y adage runs could speak a kings
speech offhand so consecutive were
his sentences and his round smooth
periods delighted the aristocracy of all j
parties fox made the lords of the
treasury quail as he declaimed in
piercing tones against ministerial cor
ruption while his friends shouted
hear hear and applauded till the
house shook pitts sentences were
pompous and sonorous and often
their sound revealed their own hol
lowness fox uttered sturdy anglo
saxon sense every word pregnant with
meaning pitt was a thorough busi

despised the drudgery of the officeand
relied upon his intuitive perceptions and
his robust strength pitt was the greater

lactites and pyramids which glitter
around niagara in midwinter stately
clear ajid cold like the vehe

below pitt in his great efforts only
erected himself the more proudly and
uttered more full johnsonian sentences
sprinkling his dignified but monotonous j
state paper style with pungent sar
casms speaking as one having authorij

fast fox on such occasions reasoned
from first principles denouncing where
he could not persuade and reeling un
der his great thoughts until his excited
feelings rocked him like the ocean in a
storm pitt displayed the most rhetoric
and his mellow voice charmed like the
notes of an organ fox displayed the
most argument and his shrill tones
pierced like arrows pitt had an icy

physical education of girls
we copy from the new york com
mercial the following excellent remarks
upon the proper education of young
females in order to insure their health
and vigorous action even till age ap
proaches
shame on us that we who boast
of having raised woman in this nine
teenth century to the position in life
which she ought to hold so educate her
that not one of her powers physical or
mental can ever attain a full and
healthy action better go back to the
days of our greatgrandmothei s and be i
content withjdilworths spellingbook
and assembly catechismnay better
to far earlier days when neither cate
chism nor spellingbook detained the
damsel from the distaff or the loom
than rear for the coming generation a
race of nervous wives and sickly
mothers
when the boy runs merrily after
his ball or chases in the race or leaps
over the bound the girl must walk de
murely in the gardenbecause forsooth
running and leaping and jumping arc
ungraceful in the girl when theboy
roams freely over the hill or through
the woods in the summer or coasts
down the hill or skates merrily over
the pond in the winter the girl un
trusted unbenefitted walks pensively
by the side of her teacher to the vil
lage or takes a twomile ailing in the
sleigh once in the week she never
pitches the quoit never throws the
ball never slides down the hill never
roams through the woods because save
the mark all these are deemed unfein
inine in fact she never thoroughly
exercises her body at all and in conse
quence soon becomes unable to endure
any kind of physical fatigue
fit only for boys said a princi
pal of a large female institute to me
the other day when i remonstrated
with him on the importance of these
and other like exercises for girls for
boys indeed and has not a girl a 
physical system to be developed and
matured and invigorated has she
not fatigue to bear obstacles to encoun
ter hindrances to overcome enter
prises to carry out duties to discharge
has she not the burden of life to carry
and its toilsome road to travel for herj
self in her own sphere does she not
require and will she not require thro
life all the energy and strength and
endurance of which her system should
be capable it matters not whether
she is to live in the midst of fashion or
to move quietly in the circles of country
life or to find her lot upon missionary
ground or to struggle against unfore
seen adversity all that can be made of
her during her years of education phy
sically morally and intellectually she
will need to every woman in what
ever situation she may occupy life is a
furt stubborn earnest real to be
shaped and moulded by her own ef
forts or to be borne and endured by
i her own fortitude happy is she who
is prepared for it not by her own de
j spairing efforts in after life but by the
judicious careiul and thorough disci
pline of early education
how to keep off old age
intellectual culture is no doubt the
best and the strongest barrier which
the young can rear against the insidiu
ous advances premature old age
mental discipline is eminently healths
ful and lifesustaining we speak not
of excessive application but of diligent
and persevering culture and exercise of
mind ihe following remarks on the
subject by the rev mr winslow are
commended to the consideration of all
concerned and especially to young la
dies
the premature old age observed in
the appearance and infirmities of many
ladies in our country is not flip result
of too much study we do not begin
to study in this country as they do in
germany nor as many do in england
and france it is a common tiling
among the educated ladies of germany
to find those who can read and speak
three or four different languages andj
are extensively versed in mathematics
and natural philosophy
it is clearly proved that the high
cultivation of the intellect is favorable
to protracted usefulness and long lifej
highly educated men and women n
an average live longer and enjoy j
more even and pure health than those
of little or no culture the mind is
lifethe very essenceoflife and where
there is most of that it imparts life arvdl
vigor to the body it is believed that
thousands in this country annually die
some twenty years sooner than they
would had they bestowed a higher culi
tivation upon their intellect we must
be more intellectual and less sensual
more of what dies not and less of that
which diesif we would invigorate and i
prolong whatever of us is immortal
it is said to be better to wear out than
to rust out the truth is after all i
very few in this country can claim the j
honor of wearing out intellectually
but hundreds are daily dying through
mental rust why does the man of
business languish and die so soon on j
retiring to enjoy in idleness his gains
just because the lifegiving power the
mind ceases to act rust stagnation
disease gloomy spirits and death
must inevitably come the perpetual
tug and excitement of business as it is
done in this country frequently over
task and break down the mind not
so much by the intellectual labor as by
the excitement attending it now the
study of the languages sciences c
and the putting forth of the mental en
ergies in the form of written thoughts
for the world afford just that kind of
mental effort which is most favorable to
long and vigorous life accordingly
literary and scientific men are as a
class long lived if our females would
give up their dissipations renounce
their novels and their indolence put
away their inglorious rust and their
vainglorious excitements together and
rise higher in the scale of intellectual
thinking spiritual beings they might
secure to themselves and to their cbil j
dren a far more healthy youthful pro
longed earthly existence than most of
them now enjoy
an linglasii landscape
the landscape at last began to as
sume a more distinct character the
footpath carried him over the top of a
steep little hill and at his feet amid a
group of tall limetrees the hoar tower
of a very ancient country church was
to be seen rising wains were now
heard rolling at no great distancethe
voices of children at play reached him
next it was evident he was approach
ing a village the footpath led him
once more over a style and then ter
minated in a pretty wide road a rather
considerable pond of water out of
which some huge carthorses relieved
from plough were splashing the
screams of geese flapping their wings
when thus disturbed and flying over
the wide greensward that bordered the
road an open gate leading into a large
foldground and an extensive orchard
of apple pear and cherrytrees showed
that he was coming upon a large farm
and lie had proceeded only a few paces
further when lie saw the house before
him it was one ofnhose oldfashioned
farmhouses which had evidently once i
been the dwelling of some considerable
family the manorhouse belonging to
some large domain the building was
of timber and the huge beams painted
red with the intervals white and the
long roof was terminated at each end
by immense gables very richly orna
mented with carved weed and in which
were some fine old oriel windows and
the peaks and points of the rest of the
building might be seen towering above
the roof interspersed with quaintly or
namented and twisted chimneys thee
was a very handsome old porch adjoin
ing the centre of this front and before
it lay an oldfashioned garden which
reached to the road from which it was
separated by thick and closelycut
yew hedge ornamented at the corners
and along the sides with pinnacles and
other devices of topiary work a few
low walls covered with trained fruit
trees divided this garden at regular in
tervals and a straight gravel walk ran
up the middle to the door cutting these
walls at right angles and with a flower
border on each side filled with common
but gaudy flowers sweet peas lupines
lychnises roses and so on the gar
den was very gaudywith polyanthuses
auriculas narcissuses tulips and all
sorts of gay spring flowers and seemed
to extend to the other side of the house
where the trees f a second orchard
were discernible there was a huge
mastiff asleep before the porch the
foldyard might be seen from the road
and all sorts of rural noises were to be
heard proceeding from itpoultry cack
ling doves cooing pigs grunting and
cattle softly lowing little calves were
running about and a great many men
and boys busily occupied here and
there all the activity and stir of a very
large farm going on angelia by the

the mocking bird
this extraordinary bird is peculiar
to the new world inhabiting a con
siderable portion of north and south
america a warm climate and a low
country seem most congenial to their
nature they are accordingly more nu
merous in the southernthan in the
northern states the berries of the
red cedar myrtle holly gum berries
gall berries and a profusion of others
with which the luxuriant swampy thick
ets of those regions abound furnish
them with a perpetual feast winged
insects also which abound there even
in winter form a favorite part of their
food
the mocking bird builds his nest in
different places according to the lati
tude in which he resides a solitary
thorn bush an almost impenetrable
thicket an orange tree cedar or holly
bush are favorite spots always ready
to defend but never overanxious to
conceal his nest he very olien builds
within a small distance of a house and
not unfrequently in a pear or apple
tree rarely higher than six or seven
feet from the ground the nest is com
posed of dry twigs weeds straw wool
and tow ingeniously put together and
lined with fine fibrous roots during
the time when the female is setting
neither cat dog animal or man can
approach the nest without being at
tacked but the whole vengeance of
j the bird is directed against his mortal
j enemy the blacksnake whenever
this reptile is discovered the male darts
upon it with the rapidity of an arrow i
dexterously eluding its bite and striking
it violently and incessantly on the
j head where it is very vulnerable the
i snake becomes sensible of its danger
and seeks to escape but the intrepid
l bird redoubles his exertions and as the
snakes strength begins to flag he
seizes and lifts it up from the ground
beating it with his wings and when the
business is completed he returns to his
t nest mounts the hush and pours out a
torrent of song in token of victory so
tj perfect are his imitations of other birds
 i that a listener would suppose the whole
feathered tribe assembled together for
i a trial of skill

tiie best kind of exercise
of all kinds of exercise walking is
that which is the most universally at
tainable and at the same time the best f
calling so many muscles into action
and especially those of the lower ex
tremities of which the circulation is apt
to be more languidly and imperfectly
performed from hhe degree of resist
since presented by the force of gravity
to the return of the blood to the heart
calling moreover so much of the
moving apparatus of the body into re
ciprocal and balanced action flexor and
extension muscles being corresponding
ly exercisedwalking is undoubtedly
the best of all exercises for the pur
poses of health independently of its
secondary and by no means little use
ful effect of carrying the respiratory j
organs into freer and purer air and
exposing the system to the extraordina
ry and at least in the colder and tem
perate countries of the earth the
healthful influence of the direct rays of
the sun the degree of the exercise
must of course vary with the age j
condition and habits of the individual
but the decree of exercise that is in
o j
most cases servicable is generally
much linden ate d two miles a day is
the minimum distance which a person of
moderate health and strength ought to
walk if the powers of the system in
crease or are stronger to begin with
the minimum ought to be four miles
the object should be in most cases to
walk the four miles in an hour and the
invalid beginning perhaps by walking a
mile or a mile and a half in an hour
might gradually increase his rate of
walking until he had accomplished
this end quick walking calls more
muscles into action than slow walking
does and is therefore better the
muscles of the back and trunk neck
and arms are comparatively very little
used in walking a person can hardly
walk quickly without using them to a
very considerable degree it is a
maxim so sound and important as to de
serve frequent repetition that the
greater the number of muscles used
the more advantageous will he the
exercise the majority of people are
wont to think too much of the other
kinds of locomotive exerciseas car
riage exercise riding on horseback
and sailingtoo little of walking rob

tiie cup of cold water
a young englishwoman was sent to
france to be educated in a huguenot
school in paris a few evenings be
fore the fatal massacre of st bartholo
mews day she and some of her young
companions were taking a walk in some
part of the town where there were sen
tinels placed perhaps on the walls
and you know that when a soldier is on
guard he must not leave his post until
he is relieved that is till another sol
dier comes to take his place one of
the soldiers as the young ladies passed i
him besought them to have the charity j
to bring him a little water adding that
he was very ill and that it would be as
much as his life was worth to go and
fetch it himself the ladies walked on
much offended at the man for presuming
to speak to them all but the young
englishwoman whose compassion was
moved and who leaving her party
procured some water and brought it to
the soldier he begged her to tell him
her name and place of abode and this
she did when she rejoined her com
panions some blamed and others ridi
culed her attention to a common soldier j
but they soon had reason to lament
that they had not been equally compas
sionate for the grateful soldiercontriv
ed on the night of the massacre to
save this young englishwoman while
all the other inhabitants of the house
she dwelt in were killed
