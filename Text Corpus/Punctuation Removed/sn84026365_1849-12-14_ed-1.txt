letter from william w
brown
london nov d 
to wendell phillips esq
dear friend i observe in the a
merican papers an elaboratetliscussion
upon the subject of passports for color
ed men what must the inhabitants of
other countries think of the people of
the united states when they read as
they do the editorials of some of the
southern papers against recognizing
colored americans as citizens in
looking over ome of these articles 
have felt ashamed that i had the misfor
tune to be born in such a country
we may search history in vain to find
a people who have sunk themselves as
low and made themselves appear as in
famous by their treatment of their fel
low men as have the people ol the
united states if eolored men make
their appearance in the slave states as
seamen they are imprisoned until the
departure of the vessel ll lliey make
their appearance at the capitol of the
country unless provided with free pa
pers they are sold for the benefit of the
government in most of the states we
are disfranchised out children are shut
out from the public schools and em
barrassments are thrown in the way of
every attempt to elevate ourselves
and after they have degraded us sold
us mobbed us and done every thing
m their power to oppress us then if
we wish to leave the country they re
fuse us passports upon the ground that
we are not citizens this is emphati
cally an age of discoveries but i will
venture tile assertion that none but an
american slaveholder could have dis
covered that a man born in a country
was not a citizen of it their chosen
motto that all men are created equal
when compared with their treatment of
the colored people of the country sinks
them lower and lower in the estimation
of the good and wise of all lands in
your letter of the th ult you ask if i
succeeded in getting a passport from
the american minister tn london pre
vious to going to paris to attend the
peace congress through the mag
nanimity of the french goverriment all
delegates to the congress were
ted to pass freely without passports
 did not therefore apply for one
but as i intend soon to visit the conti
nent and shall then need one i called
a few days since on the american min
ister and was furnished with a passport
 which the following is a copy if it
will be of any service in the discussion
upon that subject you are at perfect
liberty to use it
legation of the united states of
america in england
passport vo 
the underaigned envoy extraordi
nary and minister plenipotentiary of
the united states of america at the
court of the united kingdom of great
britain and ireland begs all whom it
may concern to allow salffly and freely
to pass and m case of need to give aid
and protection to
mr william w brown
a citizen ol the united states going on
the continent
given under my signature and the
unprint of the seal of the legation in
fjondon oct   the th year
of the independence of the united
states
for the minister
john c b davis
secretary of legation
so you see iny friend that though
we are denied citizeuship in america
and re used passports at home whan
wishing to visit foreign countries they
dare not refuse us a passport when we
apply for it iu old england there is
o public sentiment here that hard
hearted as the americans are they fear
when will the americans fleam that if
the north star
they would encourage liberty in other
countriesthey roust practice it at home
if they would inspire the hearts of the
struggling millions in europe they
should not allow one human being to
wear chains upon their own soil if
they would welcome the martyrs for
freedom from the banks of the danube
the tiber and the seine let them libe
rate their own slaves on the banks of
the mississippi and the potomac if
they would welcome the hungarian
flying from the moody talons of the
austrian eagle they must wrest the
three millions of slaves from the talons
of their own they cannot welcome
the wanderer from the battlefields of
freedom in the old world as long as the
new world is the battle field of slavery
should the kossuth and the wimmers
t visit america they would be reminded
of their friends they left in chains in
austria by the clanking chains of the
americau slave
when we see the efforts that are
made in america to spread slavery
over new territory and to put back ev
erything like emancipation we must
admit that our country is in a deplora
ble condition but this instead of dis
couraging us should make us to labor
with renewed zeal we must not give
the americans any rest until slavery is
abolished there was a time in the
history of athens that the people want
ed the passage of more wholesome laws
and to keep their wishes before the
lawmakers they wrote them upon the
wall of the city until they gained their
point we will not write our wishes
upon the stone wails in america but
we will write them upon the hearts of
the people of the entire world until we
shame the americans into good man
ners
i was asked a few days since at a
meeting if  was not afraid that the ab
olitionists would become tired and give
up the cause as hopeless my answer
was that the slaves cause was in the
hands of men and women who intended
to agitate and agitate until the iron
hand of slavery should melt away drop
by drop before a fiery public sentiment
yours for the slave

mr clay on slavery and the
new territories
mr clay reached baltimore from
philadelphia on thursday last and met
with an enthusiastic greeting the
baltimore american after giviifg a
glowing account of his reception says
at  oclock yesterday morning
mr clay in accordance with previous
arrangement took his position between
two of the parlors on the lower floor o
the lioletr both the capacious rooms
were immediately filled almost to suffo
cation and the wish being loudly ex
pressed from alufarts of the room that
the venerable matesman should address
them mr clay gratified them by mak
ing a few remarks
after referring to the warmth of the
reception which had greeted his arrival
here and the strong evidences of friend
ship evinced towards him by those who
then surrounded him mr clay pro
ceeded to remark so far as our memo
ry serves us for the crowd prevented
the taking of notes that the gentlemen
of this city who had directed the letter
to him had referred in connection with
his return to the senate to the grave
questions which had yet to be settled
there great threatening and alarming
questions wnich had arisen out of the
war with mexico and the annexation
to our republic of territory formerly
belonging to that country all who
were acquainted with these territories
he thought must have reached the con
viction to which his own mind had been
brought that under no possible circum
stances was slavery likely to be intro
duced into the territories of california
or new mexico the climate the
character of the country and its inhab
itants and their industrial pursuits all
forbade the likelihood of slavery ever
being introduced there
that question had however divided
the people to an unexampled degree
and created animosities to a most la
mentable extent on the one side the
prohibition of the introduction of slave
ry into these territories is urged with a
resoluteness and perseverance which
would indicate that those who urge it
really believe that if this prohibition is
not passed slavery would be introduc
ed on the other hand the prohibition
is opposed with an energy and a perse
verance that would also seem to indi
cate that with them the belief exists that
if the prohibition be not passed that
slavery might certainly be introduced
but gentlemen said mr clay i ap
peal to youis there under existing
circumstances any probability that the
institution of slavery could be introduc
ed into these territories
indeed so far has the excitement
growing out of this question arisen as
to threaten the dissolution of the union
 might have consulted prudence by
saying nothing in reference to these
exciting questions bat asyou have re
ferred to them in your letter  have
deemed it proper to thus notice that re
ference and i would further say that on
one point  stand pledged under all
circumstances and in all stormsthat
is to stand bv the unionenlbusi
astic applause in its dissolution i
cannot see the remedy for any evil
whether real or imaginarynothing
nothing could be gainedall would be
lost byit by the diasolution of the
union i see introduced with it all the
calamities all the misfortunes and all
idle horrors of civil war cheer
untangling foreign alliances by the
severed portions of the union would
follow dissolution and warsbloody
desolating and continued wars would
succeedfuntu some bold and unscrupu
lous military chieftain should aaize the
right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren
liberties of all and convert the whole
into one militaiy despotism we should
then need no history of oureountry but
all that had been written in that of
greecein that of her phillip and her
alexandermight be read as applica
ble to us renewed and continued
applause
from tbe oberiio evangelist
state of jamaica
the correctness of one position which
i have taken in showing the state of
things in jamaica is questioned by
some and i wish to look at it and ex
plain a little farther
i sayas the cultivation is devoted
almost exclusively to exports and the
wants of the people are supplied by im
ports the true state and prospects of
the islaud may be very nearly deter
mined by comparing them for a given
year and by comparing each one year
with another
i am asked does this follow of
course it is acknowledged that in a
state of slavery it would probably be
true but not in a state of freedom on
the ground that the emancipated may
consume a fnuch larger part of the pro
ductions and be in a prosperous condi
tion though there should be a large
falling off inhe exports and that the
imports might vary greatly and yet the
island be in a prosperous condition i
am not here discussing the comparative
comfort of the inhabitants of jamaica
under the system of slavery and free
dom if i were to take up that ques
tion in the series of articles i have com
menced many of the facts i have brot
forward to show the commercial and
agricultural state might then be view
ed in another light on that question
i should show that the emancipated
people at least the majority of them
have gathered around them very many
comforts to which they were strangers
in the time of slavery except as they
became acquainted with them in the
aggravated manner of seeing others en
joy them at their expense i should
show also that the people consume
much more of the products of the is
land than they did formerly ido not
however see but my statement is sub
stantially correct since the peoples
consumption of their own products will
not give them means to pay for the sur
plus of imports and those imports are i
no permanent stock which forms real
estate or in any way increases the
wealth of the island but are for the
current consumption of the island aod
are really consumed by the inhabitants
the falling off of imports would not ar
gue the want of prosperity but the
contrary if the deficiency was supplied
by boir productions ttuljcbua iltt
met by the capital of the island or for
the want of capital which is available
for such purposes the surplus of im
ports becomes a debt in the shape of
mortgages in the hands of foreigners
we think there are decided signs of de
cay unless a foundation is laid by the
process for a resuscitation of capital to
meet those debts i see no way in
which this is being done unless it is in
the discipline the inhabitants are pas
sing through to prepare them for wiser
and more economical management in
the future

baptist gagging for anti
slavery opinions
from the concord n ii independent democrat
andrew t foss has been excluded
from the salisbury association this
is a matter for new hampshire anti
slavery to mark it is no sectarian af
fairit looms above the confines of the
baptist denomination into the region ol
common humanity it is extracathedral
no sect no party no church no coun
try can confine the antislavery cause
how can the salisbury baptist associ
ation
this is no personal quarrel between
foss and the salisbury association any
more than sectarian the phylacteries
of his creed are as broad as the mosl
popular divine among them hie
moral character unquestioned his stat
ure as full his form as comely as when
his hand penned theitrecords his chi
rography has not changed for none
of these things do the association care
the president of the baptist state con
vention thinks he is a christian and
would go to heaven anhonorable
man but his course injurious to the
cause of christ and the salisbury
association exclude himfor what
because he will plead the cause of one
hundred and twentyfive thousand
brethren of their own faith who are rob
bed of their dearest rightsand degra
ded to the level of beastsbecause h
will labor for three millions of human
beings crushed under the ponderoui
wheel of american slavery i call up
on the antislavery men and women ol
new hampshire to note this that in
the person of a t foss whom the
baptists of new hampshire have spurn
ed they are scoffed at and scorned and
the cause they have cherished as the
apple of their eye is spit upon and de
spised the salisbury association
have closed their doors against the
faithful foss let he heart of every
abolitionist be opened to him wel
come brother to our heart as long
as you stand upon the platform of anti
slavery i will not flurry myself abort
the high heeled soles of your theology
if my toes are not crowned into the
same fit and the cowhide boots of creed
are not used to grind into the dust the
already downtrodden dart i will stand
side by aide with men of ell creeds and
colors to labor for mankind though 
stand only on the cuticle hardened by
use that god ban given roe and 
venture to proffer you the welcome
of the abolitionists of new hampshire
invite you to the convenuoo ol
free souln the country throughthe
rochester n y friday december  
world over yes sod when that great
convention shell assemble end when
they shell coos from the north end die
south from the east end the west to
sit down in the kingdom of god christ
will invite you to e seat with the angels
and all the just made perfect to reign
with him forever
the cause of antislavery is a dura
tion cause and it becomes all true lov
ers of christ to notice how the arch
fiend of this sham republic is scaring
the consciencee of the professors
how he is gagging their mouths and
pressing them into his servicetake the
baptists as they are just now in oar
minds see bow they ere joined with
slaveholders on one side and striking
numb those who would undo the heavy
burdens on the other side
the american baptist missionary
unions constitution and treasury are
open to slaveholders although there is
a pretended separation the constitu
tion of the union says
all the members of the baptist
general convention who may be pres
ent at the adoption of this constitution
shall be members of the union other
persons may be constituted life mem
bers by the payment at one time of
not less than one hundred dollars
there is no prohibition hery or any
where else of slaveholders and their
money the only requisite for office
is members in good standing of reg
ular baptist churches here they in
vite merr who buy and sell the image of
god and keep their brethren in a worse
condition than heathen to participate
in their meetings and labors for evan
gelizing the distant heathen and in
teaching them a slaveholding religion
while a t foss is excluded from their
sympathy for his antislavery faithful
ness it is not only through this union
that slaveholders are recognized as
christian but by fellowshiping the
american foreign bible society and
the publication society and by sending
an agent in the slateholding states the
past year to collect funds for the union
treasury i merely allude to these
facts to show the true position of the
baptist professors who are attempting
to vote down antislavery in the person
of brother foss i leave him to enlarge
upon it
i know that it is pretended by most
of these sectarians that they hva the
cause of the slave near at heart how
much they love the cause will appear
from the following extract from an ac
count of the n h baptist state con
vention by one of its members the
convention was held october 
eld worth of fisherville presented
a paper containing rules of order for
the obsfervahceof the convention
there was nothing of special interest in
these rules except the fourth this was
substance as follows when any subject
shall be brought before the convention
and any member shall object to its be
ing discussed the president shall im
mediately put the questionshall this
subject be discussed if the conven
tion vote in the negative no discussion
shall be had thereon as the question
oi adoption was being put  objected to
the rule
ist as unprecedented in any delibe
rate bodies civil or ecclesiastical in our
state
d as destructive of sound rights in
its operation i called the attention of
the convention to the operation of this
rule in our state legislature which is
strongly democratic that the rule
would deprive the whigs of the right
to speak at all upon any measure how
ever they might deem it of vital impor
tance unless their democratic brethren
might by courtesy vote them the indul
gence that no political party in the
state would desire such unrighteous
advantage none would submit to it
that it had been tried in our national
congress and after a brief life of infa
my it had gone to the grave to be re
membered only with mortification and
regret no reply was made to my re
marks i did not expect itthe subject
would not have borne discussion ten
voted for it fewer against it and so
the rule passedand will show to the
world the singular and humiliating fact
that the miserable rag of despotism
which some years since was torn from
the back of the american congress
has been picked up by the n h bap
tist state convention and for one year
at least at most i hope she wears the
shameful deed
a report was read by eld wright
chairman of the committee on the a
fc foreign bible society highly com
mending the society  moved to amend
the report by adding at the cloae the
words we deeply regret that this soci
ety sent the pest year an agent into the
alaveholding states to collect funds for
its treasury the motion being sec
onded i commenced some remarks in
support of the amendment but here the
convention found an opportunity to try
their new made fourth rule and it work
ed admirably closing am lips in silence
previoos to the enforcement of the rule
elder wright had said we bad no evi
dence that such an agent had been sent
to the south l proposed to ask the
agent elder seaver who only a few
days before bad acknowledged the fact
and expressed bis regret that the soci
ety had so done it was at this point
that the rule was applied it was a case
where it was greatly needed the
agent of the powication society was
received with great pleasure and every
facility was granted him to promote the
interests of bis society a report w
made on this society hy prof e fr
smith commenting the society tom

fifteen minutest some of the agents
used more than an hour but i asked
but fifteen short minutes for brother
piper to be beard in setting before the
convention the condition and prospects

but they voted an emphatic no
there were other developments bear

fextension of slavery
letter from mr foot of mwusippi to
mr cungman of north carolina
washington november  
sir being casualty informed ofjour
recent arrival in this city i seize the
opportunity of invitiog your attention
to a subject of high importance to the
whole country and of especial concern
to the southern states of the confede
racyone of which you have the hon
or to represent in the councils of the
nation the session of congress is
almost at hand and indications are
abroad and every moment multiplying
which seem to render it quite probable
that the wilmot proviso and the abo
lition of slavery in the district of
columbia will be again brought for
ward either in the senate or house of
representatives and supported by the
zealous and unscrupulous advocates or
these mischievous measures with in
creased violence and confirmed perti
nacity it is most evident to me that
the union itself will be put in serious
leopardy by the movements thus mena
ced as i hold it to be certain that no
state ofthe south will patiently acqui
ssce in cither of the aggressions alluded
o i regret to perceive that there is
in erroneous impression widely preva
lent tat the north that the south is
neither in earnest nor united in any
icheme of opposition and resistance to
he insulting encroachments now so
lercety thrsnd it lhim imprsssiqn
s permitted to remain uncorrected un
il either of the meditated outrages re
ferred to shall have been perpetrated
t is to be feared that it will be to late
o save the republic from consequences
oo dreadful to be contemplated witb
ut a feeling of patriotic solicitude and
ilarm whereas it is my firm convic
ion that if the the sober thinking men
f the free states could once ascertain
he danger that demagogues and fanat
cal agitators are fast bringing upon
hem and their unoffending brethren of
he south by the advocacy of schemes
rf injustice and oppression which can
not possibly result in practical benefit
to any section or state of the confede
racy they would rise up without fur
ther delay and say to the agents of se
dition who have heretofore i sported
with their credulity and abused their
confidence that the period has at length
arrived when they will no longer per
mit them in their name to trample the
sacred provisions of the constitution
under foot aud embroil the legislative
councils of the nation in unseemly and
wicked controversy taking this view
of the matter and knowing that you
have had an opportunity of conferring
freely during the past summer with
pour fellowcitizens of north carolina
venture to lay before you the resolu
tions recently adopted by the southern
convention of the state of mississippi
and eall upon you to say whether or
not you approve of them and whether
they are in your opinion approved io
the state of north carolina and the
south generally being a prominent
member of the whig party you will
doubt lesa feel authorised to apeak in
language too explicit to be misunder
stood as to the probable action of our
political associates in the south shook
the present seetional contest be carried
to extremities in the convention of
mississippi you will observe both the
two great political parties of the coun
try were equally represented the res
olutions unanimously adopted by that
body may be therefore regarded as
declarative of thefriews and feelings of
the whole state however it may pos
sibly be elsewhere i can assure you
mom confidently that the people of
mississippi look upon the slavery ques
tion in its existing aspects as above
pasty lam satisfied that this is the
condition of things generally in the
soetb and i hope that you will feel
justified in expressing a concurrent
opinion
 bad the honor of addressing a few
days since inquiries similar to those
now propounded to you to your dis
tinguished colleague the hon willie

the physical indisposition with which he
is at present afflicted will permit to de

reply of mr chngman to mr foot
citt or washington
not  
dear siryours of the th ust
baa been received in which you ask
my own views as well as my opinion
as to wbat will be the course of the
south in either of the contingencies
referred to your position as a rep
resentative of one of the states and
the consideration due you personally
merit alike a prompt reply
having on former occasions given
my views in detail with reference to the
whole subject it is not necessary fur
me to do so at tvs time i proceed
therefore to give you simply the gen
eral results of iry reflections
the federal government because
it is the goverrment of the united
states is the trustee and agent for all
the states and their citizens every
dower therefore which it can ightfnl
y exercise it must of necessity exer
cise for the benefit of all parties to i
the territory of the united states be
ing the common property the govern
ment is bound to administer it as far ns
practicable for the benefit of all the
states as well as their citizens a
difference however exists among
them in relation to the institution oi
slavery when the constitution was
formed twelve of the thirteen states
were slaveholding that instrument
though it has cluuses expressly inser
ted for the protection of the rights and
interests of slaveholders contains no
provision for the abolition of slaver
anywhere if the government there
fore can properly exercise such a pow
er in any instance it must be because j
its duties as a general agent acting so
as to meet the interest and view of it
principals require it but fifteen of
the thirty states of the union still nnin
tain the institution of slavery it isj
obvious therefore that the govern
ment could not consistently with its
powers as a general agent exclude the
slaveholders as a class from nil partic
ipation in the enjoyment of the territo
ry pf the united lt is on the
contrary under srlemn obligations to
respect the rights of all it lias always j
heretofore as i understand its action
shown a sense of this obligation
when the muchtalked of ordinance
was adopted by which the territory
north of the ohio river was made free
all that portion of the country south ol
the river to the gulf of mexico was
toft to beimrajtted uy slaveholders
when slavery was abolished in the
northern part of the louisiana territo
ry the southern portion regarded as
most suitable for slaveholders was left
so to be occupied on the annexation
of texas when a provision against
slavery north of  deg  min was
incorporated much the larger and more
valuable portion was still left for the
use of slaveholders
but now it is proposed to adopt the
policy of excluding slaveholders ns
such from all the territory of the uni
ted states this would be an entire
revolution in the action of the govern
menta revolution which could not ocj
cur without a total violation of the spir
it and essence of the constitution
since those citizens who do not own
slaves are permitted to occupy every
part of the territory of the union it
has been doubted by many whether the j
government can rightfully exclude
slaveholders from any portion of the j
common property but even if there
should be a power to divide the public
territory for convenience between the 
two classes it is perfectly clear that
there can be no right to exclude one j
class entirely i have therefore said
that i should regard such an exclusion
as being as great a violation of rhe
constitution as the government could
possibly commit but even if this ac
tion should be viewed simply as an en
ormous abuse of power it would not be
the less objectionable the govern
ment has unlimited powers in relation
to the establishment of post offices
throughout the union if however
it were to withdraw all the post offices
from the aiaveholding states on the
ground that the citizens of those states
were not worthy of the countenance
and aid of the government we should j
have as much reason to complain of
such action as if it involved a clear in
fraction of the letter of the constitu
tion
j in a word if the government should
adopt the policy of excluding slavehol
dera as such from all hie territory of
the united stales it ould in soh
j stance and effect cease to be the gov
ernment of the united states while
the form of the constitution might re
main the same its character would be
essentially changed
ought the southern states to a cqui
esce in this great organic char ge in
oor political system ought they to
remain members of an association
which had in utter disregard of plain
constitutional guaranties degraded
them from their position of equality
as history furnishes no record of any
peophr who bays prospered after they
bad forfeited their selfrespect by sub
mitting to be degraded to a state of
political vassalage  hold it to be the
doty of the southern states to resist
this change that resistance to be
effectual should bo commensurate with
tbe riofenee of the attack this they
owe to the cause of constitutional lib
to justice and to their owe
honor
j with reference to the nhohtkm of
slavery in the district of columbia i
will simply say that waiving all eoe
john dict prtfw
whole no 
j troversy m relation to coqstitattenaj
r ghl arid obligation to the adjoining
state if such an event were to occur
at this time it would not tike place in
obedience to the wishes of the citizen
the district but would be brought
about at the instahe of the inhabitants
ot the states but these persons have
no i jnht to control the local affairs of
this district should congress there
fore thus act at their instigation it
would be guilty of an act of tyranny
so insulting and so gross as to justify a
withdrawal of confidence from such a
government
you ask in the second place what i
believe likely to be the course of the
south should such a contingeny oc
cur there was but oneof tbe states
having any considerable number of
i slaves in relation to which i had any
doubts from her position
and the powerful influences brought to
bear upon her i had some fears as to
what might be the action of kentucky
but i have been gratified beyond ex
pression by the gallant siaod which
that noble state has recently taken
she has thereby shown that she will
not abandon her sisters in tbe hour of
danger but that she will if accessary
take the front rank m the struggle for
the preservation of the rights and lib
erties of the white race of the south
 he union of both parties m mississip
pi is a type that will occur elsewhere
the southern states ought to have but
one feeling on this question as they
can have but one destiny i have no
doubt but that over the entire south
there vvoujj be a vastly greater unani
mity than existed in the old thirteen
slave states when they decided to re
sist british aggression if a few indi
viduals should attempt to take a differ
ent course they would be swept away
in the general current long before
the trouble should come to the worst
the south would present an unbroken
front
i am net aware sir that in making
so brief and concise a statement of my
views i incur the risk of misconcep
tion and misapprehension but i should
eel that i did not appreciate the mo
mentous nature of the subject if i
could attach consequence to mere per
sonal considerations

is prohibited or not is already the

compromise thats the word by ad

we repeat in solemn conviction that
this will result in a usurpation of those
territories by slavery as for new

south are willing to run the risk of riv

the north star
rochester december  
oar paper and its prospects
now that the second volume of the north
star is nearly completedthat the closing
days of another year of varied life are hover
ing around us and that the light of a new
year is soon to dawn it seems a proper i tide
in our own affairs to offer a few words upon
our paper and its prospects during the
present year we have purposely refrained
from afflicting our readers with narrations of
our own personal toils cares anxieties and
difficulties we hate anything like whining
 and shall indulge in none of it now if we
did not assume our piesent position intelligent
 iy we did assume it voluntarily and have
therefore met its responsibilities and duties
j most cheerfully and shall continue to do so
w hile we continue to occupy it of regrets
losses disappointments dangers and discour
agements we shall say nothing here they
i are the common lot of most men who under
take any great w ork for the welfaie of man
kind and we are not singular in having a
large share of such dispensations besides
this consideration we have the consolation
that the grace ol god has ever been sufficient
lor us and for all sorrows troubles and hard
ships we have been doubly repaid in the sat
isfaction which ever accompanies a faithful
discharge of duty our joys have far exceed
ed our sorrows and our experience has im
parted to us much that will be valuable to us
through life all this we deem a full com
pensation for our past labors and trials in ef
foits to keep our sable witness in the field
we shall therefoie make no complaints but
dispense at once with the past and look to
the evei bright and evei hopeful future
the first quemion which the friends of the
paper will ask and to which they wish a defi
nite and decided answer relates to the con
tinuance of the north star do you mean
to continue the paper  to this we answer
in all sincerity yes we do most certainly
mean to continue it that much has been
fully and we hope advisedly resolved upon
we have put away all doubt timidity and
hesitation the north star must and
will remain a fixed star in the antislavery
sky as in the brave old overhanging firma
ment it was not at the suggestion of a
fitful impulse or an effervescent aspiration that
we commenced the publication of this paper
we considered the demand for such a paper
counted the cost surveyed the gtoundand
engaged in the enterprise with a full pur
pose of heart our course is onward and we
shaii neither turn back nor turn aside and if
our earnest endeavors shall not be crowned
with success the responsibility and reproach
shall fall elsewhere than upon us with as
warm a heart and with as much zeal as that
with which we have commenced and with
which we have until now persevered we shall
continue happily for us thus far we have
fulfilled our hugest promises to the very let
ter and this is the best assurance we can now
give to our readeis of what they may expect
for the future the north star ought must
and as far as our fiat can go shall be sus
tained let all doubts be removed and let
readers and friends unite to help those who
are at least deserting itin that they display
a willingness to help themselves remember
that the most successful mode to defeat a
praiseworthy undertaking is to fold our arms
and doubt seriously doubt if the undertaking
will succeed
the stern necessity which called the
north star into being exists now with all
its former force palpableness and intensity

fancy sketch hut a simple picture of stem
and bitter every day realities they have
long existed and do now existand while
they continue to exist they will continue to
demand trumpet tongued all true hearts
right minds and industrious hands for their
complete overthrow and abolishment we
therefore say again and with additional em
phasis that the necessity which called the
north star into existence now imperiously
demands its continuance
but to these general reasons there are oth
er and especial ones which may be properly
added to the startling catalogue already addu
ced we are especially singled out from all
other people under the whole heavens as the
objects degradation we are the injured
it is meet that we should especially contend
lor redress we are the victimsit becomes
us to appeal to say that we suffer griev
ous wrongs is more touching than to say
that they suffer wrongs but above all it
is needful that the colored people should have
a living constant palpable and unmistakea
ble example to present in confutation of the
slander which insists upon the natural inferi
 ority of our race with which we are so per
petually and so injuriously assailed and
what may we ask is a better example than
the regular publication of large weekly peri
odical conducted by a fugitive slave who
has never had the advantage of a single days
schooling and has spent the best educational
period of his life under the dark and deprav
ing yoke of american slavery it is said
that we might be betted employed as a lectui
er than as an editor we answer that none
need complain on that score since we do both
and have probably delivered as many lectures
traveled as many milesattended as many
meetingsand labored as haid during the
past two years as any antislavery lecturer
now in the field what we have done we
mean still to do while life and health and
slavery endure it may be said that we say
this boastfully be it sohut who can say
that we say it untruthfully no man well
let no man who lias an antislavery heait in
his bosom refuse to aid the north star on
the unfounded pretence that its publication
would prevent our more useful and more suit
able occupation of the lecturing field many
of our warm friends have entertained this no
tion but they must now see that ihejiolion is
unfounded we admit the desirableness of
having efficient colored antislavery lecturers
in the field and that a part of these should be
fugitive slaves and of the latter those who
have more recently escaped are to our mind
decidedly to be preferred they tell their
story with a freshness and simplicity which
commends its truth to the hearts of those who
hear while the older and more experienced
speakers who confine themselves to their
narratives be thejf never so touching or har
rowing their effect upon the heareis is soon
lost in the frequency of their reiteration
we should have long since failed to make
ourselves useful in the antislavery field had
we confined ourselves to our simple story
but even if this were not the case this de
partment of labor is nowbetter provided for
than at any former time the clarks browns
bibbs watsons and crafts have all been oc
cupying the field of late their
narrations are doing a glorious work and we
thank heaven that such witnesses against
slavery have been so rapidly brought forward
there will be more of the same make and
mould raising their manly brows above the
surface of ignorance oppression and slavery
these men are an evidence that ethiopia is
indeed reaching forth her hand unto god
her sons are rising from degradation to re
spectabilityare seeking to do something no
ble worthy of manhood
to our old subscribers we would say there
is not one among you all that we can afford to
spare you are all needed upon our list and
yet mote we need your aid in extending the
circulation of the paper you have kind
ly borne with the early imperfections and
shortcomings of the editorial department ol
the northstar dont quit us until we give
signs of having ceased to improve the busi
ness of editing a large weekly journal like
ours may be easy enough to men of educa
tion aud reading but it will certainly not be
considered a light task for ooe who has to ed
ucate himself and instruct others at the same
time but wg promised to make no poor fa
ces si the commence meat of this article and
we shall now shun the very appearance ol
such an evil
we close this article by expressing our
neartfelt gratitude to our kind transatlantic
friends who continue to notice and appreciate
our humble labors and who have never de
serted uv in the hour of need they kindly
supplied us the means with which to com
mence our present work and have faithfully

report since that commencement we would
also mention gratefully the generous saemt

western new york amislavery society

sooner replying to mr whippet iae letter
 the national league published in the
 north star nojp anything from that
source touching the interests and prospects
of the oppressed and proscribed people to
whom we belong is entitled to very high re
 spec he is a geotletnan of acknowledged
 ability a profound thinker an aioqaent and
 forcible writer and withal an earnest friend of
 liberty from such a man we always differ
 reluctantly hi letter before ns display all
 the qualities of bead and heart which we hare
with pride and pleasure ascribed to him and
while we differ widely from him in his rea
 onings and conclusions upon the subject in
question we are aiocerely glad that so able a
 pen as his should be wielded by a sable band
and that he has felt called upon to record pub
 licly hi opinions with respect to the project
ed league perhaps it will not be assuming
i too much to account for the difference be
tween us and our esteemed friend on the
ground that we are more practical and less
 theoretical than h with abstractions and
 theories he is at home and in these he can
easily find objections to measures which we
 daam of immediate and practical importance
 he sees a seeming ceitainly not real incon
aistency between the end and the means by
which that end is proposed to be attained
with him the necessary but rude scaffolding
must not be arranged lest its awkward ap
pearance should obscure the magnificent edi
fice proposed to be erected
as an illustration of the truth of what we
hare just remarked we take the following
r from his letter
the expsdiency of an organized union
i among our people has long engaged my at
i tention and i cfo most freely confess that it
appears to me to be a subject that is fraught
with difficulties and dangers as well as prom
 ises and blessings
 haring confessed the difficulties and dan
gers to be apprehended from the formation of
the proposed league mi w gives his rea
sons for those apprehensions as follows
i believe that the motto union of the
oppressed for the sake of freedom will be
interpreted by tie proslavery press to mean
an union of the black against the while man
and the overthrow of american institutions
for however atangeand unnatuial it may ap
pear it is nevertheless true that the success
of any movement among ourselves is tnote de
pendent on the praise of our enemies than
the labors of our friends for of late our de
nunciations have been as uneiringly directed
against abolitionists as slaveholders when
you shall have launched the league in the
proslaveiy current of this nation you will be
obliged to answer the nautical questions viz
from whence do you hail  what ts your
object and to what port you ate destined 
or receive a broadside
you well know that we have no security
in the divine nature of our object for that be
ing interpreted in llte popular tongue means
devil incarnate and vestal purity of mo
tive a rapacious desire to corrupt all that is
good and holy in the affections of the riiul
titsde so deeply seated are the leligious
and political prejudices against which we have
ts contend that virtue and vice change tlieii
character to auit the complexion of tlie actor
during the recent eventful period of nations
the press lias been teeming with the lute ei
leagues for civil and religious reform
and the proclamation has gone forth that god
is on the side of the strong
it will be useless to say that this is not a
complexional question for its success would
depend on so stating it and the collision
springing from its action against public senti
ment would be more likely to increase and
concentrate existing prejudices than scatter
and disseminate them it is therefore no
less a dictate of interest than humanity to
avoid a complexional issue
here then are the reasons alleged against
the leagne plainly and strongly slated let
us examine them the first point made is
that such a league will be interpreted by
the proslavery press to mean an union ol
the black against the white man and the
overthrow of american institutions
it may be said in reply that the objection
is an old one and is as true as it is old foi
never since the day that moses called upon
the egyptian monarch to let the israelites go
free until the day that william lloyd garri
son startled this guilty land by a similar de
mand has there been a movement against
slavery and oppression but w hich has had in
its course to submit to the embarrassment ol
mijinterpretation misrepresent at ion and
even slander it is the common baptism ol
all great movements it is the forty day
fasting in the wilderness to try the faith and
to test the integrity of their projectors lei
him who cannot stand mirinterpretation nev
er attempt to stem the popular current foi
such an one will only attempt to fail bui
after all we think the apprehension of out
esteemed correspondent are much greater thar
the occasion will justify if the public mint
were as dark now on the subject of human
rights as it was twenty years ago and such
a movement had been proposed the ground
urged would wear a more rational aspect
but now when colored men cau speak wnte
and publish their views to the world with th
utmost impunity in tbo northern slate ii
seems almost worse than timidity for u tf
hesitate in the adoption of measures for oui
improvement and elevation from the fear ol
muinterpretation there is now in this com
trj a willingness nay a waiting to hai
what we have to say we are therefore
folly able to set ourselves righl before the
community in the first place we should at
tempt nothing but what would be right ju t
and secondly we should of course have the
sympathy of the wise and good of every c loi
 out righteous endeavors bet says ui
friend any movement among ourselves it
more dependent on the grout of our enem a
than the labors of our friends a stuguhu
notion truly are our movements then to b
shaped to the pleasure of our enemies an
we then to conform to their wishes to secure

ppmhauon of oar oppressors nowo do
aot believe that friend wkipper would b

contemptible policy and yet such might emu

huff wo do no know what he means shen
ho mye of late our denunciations have beu
unerringly directed against abohuomju ts

aware of it and the offenders ought to he ex

oor weapons ate not the dilfcr
enee is groat bat the grand argument against
the formation of the langne is that it will
present a ctmptjiomal ism this is a
danger to be avoided but is it true of this
movement do coloted men by associating
themselves together for the purpose of obtain
ing equal rights with all other citirons there
by mako a crifnplexiooal issue with their
white fetlowjeooniryiaee so it don not
seem us it strikes us that the issue is ten
dered from the other side the ground baa
already been taken that colored men shall
not possess equal etvil social and political
advantages with white men leaving us no
other alternative bnt to submit or to resist
now shall we tamely quietly submit shall
we remain io die house all day when others
are at work and merely sally forth in the
dark unseen lest we should seem  make a
complexional issue we sre not to say
to treacherous pennsylvania restore th e black
mans right of suffrage for fear of making
complexions issues wt are not to ask
admission for oor children into common
schools to avoid complexional issues
w eare not to go into the cabiu of steamboats
among  chut men dial we may void com
plexional issues but seuously the objec
tion is too palpably absurd to require the aid
of ridicule to expose it and yet it has its advo
cates in high quarters
for our part we wish colored men could be
induced to make any kind of an issue we
want some sign of lifesome evidence of a
common desire to improve ourqiresent condi
tion and to take some position in the moral
world at present we are for the most part
dead we ate seen in the worlds activities
only by proxy an occasional head is seen
to rise above the surface but his legs soon
give way for the want of sympathy and he
fallperhaps to rise againperhaps not
now an organization such as that suggested
hy the league would at least put us in
the way of doing something it would give
us a position but says our correspondent
the thing is impossiblethe oppressed have
adopted the religious creeds of our oppres
sors e this is true but onlv true of a
pat tof us there are some among us who
repudiate at least most part of the religion of
the land that assumes the natural inferiori
ty of the colored uiau we must however
stop here simply by saying that whatever
may be the difficulties dangers and hardships
attending it we are for the formation of a
colored national leagueand hope to have
the influence of our esteemed friend whip
pet to help forward that resultr o
father mathew in a difficulty the
state temperance cen vent ion assembled at
marietta in georgia last summer tendered
through judge lumpkin of that state a
cordial invitation to father mathew to visit
georgia in furtherance of the temperance
cause but the judge having subsequently
learned that the name of father mathew had
been attached in company with that of daniel
oconnell to a wellknown antislavery re
monstrance w rote to the reerend father
inquiring whether he hadtieeu correctly in
formed and it so whether lie still entertained
the same sentiments on the subject of slavery
after waiting one month the writer received
a very brief reply marked private and
which lias not been published in the
meantime says the judge the several
temperance associations in the state had pas
aed resolutions revoking the invitation so
far as they had been parties to it the
judge then wrote once more to father
mathew complaining that his reply explained
nothing and intimating that in these circum
stances his visit to the south could be pro
ductive of only evil to the temperance cause
no reply has been received to this com
munication and here is the summing up of
the whole matter by the judge
under these circumstanceswith a clear com
prehension i trust of the responsibility thus
incurred and with the most profound regret
as to the miscarriage of our hopes herewith
so long as  have the power at least and
with the hearty concurrence and approval of
the executive committee of the convention
withdraw the invitation so cordially and sin
cerely offered viewing our cause as we do
as the chief hope of man we must not per
mit it to be wounded in the house of its
friends we will welcome no one knowing
ly among us who fraternizes himself or
encourages otheis to do so with a faction
which would recklessly shiver the union into
fiagmeuis which would reck its unhallowed
hands red as crimson in human bloodwhich
in a word seems  combine m one mass all
the woist elements of thought action and
feeling peculiar to our troublous times
thus it is likely that father mathew io
trying to meet the views of the north without
offending the south will find himself deserted
by both this is exactly the treatment be 
deserves for seeking to he neutral in tbe
cause of human freedom may he profir by 
ihe experience

business of the country with all practicable
despatch and can see no good reason why
there should be further delay in the organiza
tion of this house members may endeavor
to console themselves with the difficulties of
 as a precedent but the cases are not
parallel at that time the delay was occa
sioned not by the speakers election but by
the disputed seats of the new jersey election
as the case now stands the obstinacy of one
or two individuals may prevent forever an or
ganization and it is therefore due to the leg
islation of the country that the whigs and
democrats the two great parties should unite
on some plan to put down that disorganizing
spirit which has manifested itself

it is well known to my friends that i
have not sought the place to which their pat
tialityhas long been striving to elevate me
and it is known too to a considerable majority
of them that  would have withdiawn at the
start if they would have concentrated their
votes on any other but in this matter my
own wishes if not my own judgment were
overruled by gentlemen in whom i have the
highest confidence and i therefore yielded
all along to their opinions  have all along
expressed my own desire that the house
should be organized and  have believed that
further delay would be detrimental to some of
the best interests of the country
i need not add then with how much re
luctance  saw myself the instrument of that
delay my friends however would not suf
fer my name to be under my own control
and it was not until today that i could obtain
their consent to retire from the position in
which i have been placed  beg leave there
fore now to say and to say publicly before
the house what i have before often said in
private that  can consent no longer to be in
the way of some kind of organization and
that i now withdraw the use of my name j
i desire publicly to thank those who have
all along been voting for me and to express
iny very warmest hopes that they will be bet 
tei able to concentrate their votes on some
other
on the delivery of this address great ex

the correspondent of the new york ex
press gives an account of a meeting of the
whig members of congress held to arrange
a course of action which came to a rather
interesting termination showing symptoms
of division and disoigautzation inthe whig
camp which will help to bring northern men
of that party to declare themselve more deci
dedly than they have yet done in favor of
freedom or as is quite as likely quicken their
movements in perpetuating and strengthen
ing their ignominious subserviency to the
slave power it is in substance this
mr toombe of georgia immediately af
i ter the organization of the meeting offered a
j resolution to the effect that congress ought
not to pass any law prohibiting slavery in the
territories of california or new mexico nor
any law abolishing slavery in llte district of

the reading of this resolution of course
produced great excitement the mol ton was
seconded and several speeches made in favor
of if by southern men mr hilliard of ala
bama asked
if it was agreed that the wiimot proviso
was no part of the whig creed and that it
was not whig policy to abolish slavery in the
district of columbia why not say so v

bkook ivs l  nov th
ms editor i avail myself of the pres
ent moment to take up my pen to inform you
ot what is going on in this region that mav be
interesting to your readers we have had
quite a stirring lime of it in these dtggins
for the last two weeks
first the ease of frances smith the tacts
in the case are theae the smith family were
claimed as the propeity of the late judge
gaston of newbern north carolina the
younger smiths are quadroons i pon the
jeath of judge gaston his heirs alter consid
erable consultation permuted wm smith to
go to work with the view of purchasing him
self for which purpose he repaired to the city
of washington and by his own industry has
succeeded in paying for lus own freedom at
the time of the sale of the property of
judge gastons heirs william prevailed upon
one amos wade merchant of newbern to
purchase his mother and sister in order to
save them from being sold to the far south
he has since redeemed his mother at the price
of fifty dollars which together with 
paid for himself makes five hundred and sev
entythree dollars he has raised by his own in
dustry he now appeals to the liberality and
humanity of the people of the north to assist
him in rescuing a young and beautiful sister
tromthe new orleans market and save her
from what may yet be it she is not rescued
a condition worse than death amos wade
writes that she is a good girl and i believe
a virtuous girl she is a member of church
and is respected by the members of her church
as a christian i have been offered one thou
sand dollars for het by traders but if your ob
ject is to free her  will reduce the price to

a christian girla virtuous girl  years
old and handsome and one thousand dollars
offered for her by traders what means
this oh ye christians and republican of
the north blush to think meetings to sym
pathize with and assist mr smith have been
held in brooklyn and new york but lam
ashamed to say they were very thinly attend
ed had these meetings been exhibitions of a
monkey with a red jacket on the churches
which were reluctantly granted for them to be
held in would have been filled to replet in
but when a brother comes to the muchbo ist
ed of and miscalled free north appealing for
to piotect a young and virtuous sister all
our great men tor new york is filled with
great men at least in their own estimation
land aloof the meeting in brooklyn waa
addressed by messrs jeremiah powers wm
kay george hogarth j c morrell and c
c hanington the meeting in new york
by the rev mr secost and messrs j pow
ers and j c holly r i lie collections were
liberal for the small numbers present the
spesksrs answered the several objections urg
ed against paying for persons claimed as
slaves
ist that we do not recognize the right ot
the slaveholder to property in his fellowbe
ings any more than the traveller recognize
the right ol the robber to his purse when he
surrenders it rather than his life bdly that
while laboring to overthrow the whole system
ot slavery we must not harden our hearts
and resist individual appeals as we would not
be feeling for those in bonds as though bound
with them dly that every person redeem
ed even by a compliance wuh the unjust de
inands of the fleshmonger is one less in ti
luesnes l slavery and one more fn tin hst
ot ireedom thly and lastly that if our
own mother sister or daughter was about to
be sold to the harems of the south all
other means failing to redeem her we would
not withhold the perishable dust on principle
but would meet it as a practical question and
rescue our dear relative with a firm laiih that
it would be repaid in enjoyment and propei
ty and that the slaveholders would he no
richer in the end
ihe second topic of interest to the friend
of the slave is the capture and caging of gto
liu hon a stout athletic black man who h
ten going around ettiodling the antislavery
public for the last twelve or fifteen months
he represents himself as a fugitive jusi arriv
ed last night from the south awl by tin
means obtains money and sympathy when
evet ho goes he was caged ahum twelve
months ago tor playing tlie same game itts
causes that led to his arrest at this tune tie
these he has been calling on geutlemen utr
king lus false representations and when they

recapture the gentleman sent to the office

of dr parkman created a tremendous
ens jtin throughout the city and its vicinity

that he had been inveigled into some house
robbed murdered and the body secreted
and d that be bad been killed within the
walls ot the medical college and ins remains

iawards were being otlered to any person who
should find the doctor dead or alive else
where the college building was kept under
the strictest surveillance the cellars coal
bums and other recesses m which a body
millit be easily concealed were searched in

dr webster had locked up and gone
the question of searching the premises un
der the special control of dr w ebster was

mr littlefield descended lluougb m p

with amazement that be could not explain

officers in attendance lor the o y marshal
the hole m the wail was ihen nlarged so as
to admit ihe ingress of lutl eld and two
officers who brought the j oi the body
out they consisted of the vei paru ol

dr websters residence in cambridge with
instruction to arrest him they arrived at

officers met him at the gate and told him that
the college officers were met in eonsehatioi
on the aulmbct of lr parlun asa disappear
ance sod had sent tor him to attend it he
made no objection and while on the way to

and referring to dr parkman having been
at the college oaid that be atojiped at the
doctora house on friday morning and re
quested him to call at the college for his
money between one and two oclock that
day the carriage waa halted at the jail
and the patty went into the office and then
for the brat time dr vi ebster began to per
eeiva that there was something strange in the
proceedings of tbe officers and asked what
they had come to the jail for when their des
tination was the college in grove street re
marking also that they had come out of the
way clapp then aaiddr webster it is
no uae to disguise our purpose any further
y ou are under arrest on suspicion that you
know something about the death of dr
parkrnan pqrta of w hose body have been
found under yonr laboratory we shall look
no more for the body upon hearing this
accusation dr webster staggered back
wards as if struck to the heart and uttered
various exclamations about hi family arid
children and also saying the villian i
am ruined or the villian he has ruin
ed me all who wete present agree that
he did not sav he was betrayed one of
the officers think from some broken sentences
that he caught that the prisoner said some
thing about some one having placed the limbs
where they were found for the purpose of
obtaining the reward and that the discovery
of them there would involve the prisoners
rain
when asked if he was willing to go to the
college and view the remains he consented
and was carried rather than led to the car
nage
after he returned to jail ihe prisoner be
came somewhat more calm he stated that
no one had access to his apartments in the
college but himself and could not have such
access but with his keys he not only had
the keys of these apartments in his posses
sion but also the key a large one of the
watercloset under whieh the lemains were
found this closet was within the laborato
ry and not accessible from without that apart
ment and tbe door was locked w hen the
limbs were found below
saturday morning brought with it still fur
ther discoveries officer rice in arranging
things in the laboratory found in a recess
formed by thebrickwork of the furnace and
chimney a teachest apparently filled with
specimens of minerals but emitting a strange
odor he at once upset the chest and found
in the bottom bedded in hemlock bark the
left thigh and the halfroasted trunk of the
body the skin had been wholly burnt or
tripped off from the trunk the thigh was
only stained with the bark all the parts
found are such in size that they may very
well have belonged to dr ps body the
missing portions and supposed to have been
burnt up are the head contents of the body
left leg and foot arms and hands and right
foot
among the secondary facts it may be
stated that four bloody towels were found in
the vaut a very laige clasp knife with
hunting figures on the blade was found with
the trunk in the tea chest some grapples
made of cod hooks with lines and lead
sinkers attached were found in dr websters
apparatus room this room is in the rear of
the lecture room and connected with it by a
door on the inner side of the apparatus
room is a large closet w ith several hundred
bottles of chemicals arranged on shelves
near the door of this closet on the floor
commence scattered marks of blood which
extend the whole length of the apparatus
room and appear on nearly every step of ihe
stairs leading from the room down into the
laboratory dr websters official duties as
a professor required of him no handling of
bodies nor was it allow able to have subjects
in that part of the building early last week
dr webster ordered a tin box three feet
long one foot wide and  inches in height
of mr waterman in court street the
cover w as to be fitted so as to be soldered up
when used on sunday a pair of trowsers

winslow lewis martin gay and j b is
thacher tor such further examination as
can be made of them
the doctors mentioned entered upon the
investigation of sunday and found fragments
of calcined bones fiom each of the missing
parts ol the body r lhere was something
like the appearance of a wide stab on the
left side of the trunk but it was not made
absolutely clear whether the incision was
made before or after death
it is said that drs parkman and ebster
wete classmates in college tor a quarter of
a esntury or more dr webster was occu
pied a distinguished position id the scientific
world as professor of chemistry and miner
alogy in harvatd university of which the

an associate editor of a general scientific
journal whose title has escaped us publish
ed by hilliard gray at co
some of dr parkmans friends assuming
that dr webster killed dr p suppose that
au angry altercation occurred at the interview
on friday and that dr parkmam who occa
sionally used very blunt language said some
thing which so exasperated dr webster that
the latter suddenly dealt him a mortal blow
with some implement at hand and then to
conceal the rash and fata deed resorted to
ihe means far disposing of the body which
have iteen described above
in consequence ot threats against the medi

the rochester ainal meeting
the western n t antislavery society
will hold their annual meeting on th bth and
th of january in the city of rochester
which our friends in the city and country are
earnestly invited to attend we feel that the
injunction neglect not the assembling of
yourselves together ought most faithful
ly to be adhered to remembering it is by uni
ted efforts that the bonds of the fettered slave
must be broken we know that the laborers in
the great work of reform are comparatively
few but truth is mighty and we are
encouraged in believing that the day of re
demption draweth nigh as tie are assured
that the faithfulness of the few tried and devo
ted friends of freedom has already sundered
the chains and set at liberty many a despon
ding asplive and the reflection stimulates us
to a greater devotedness knowing full well
that the corrupting and demoralizing effects
of slavery on our white as well as our colored
brothers and sisters call loudly and impera
tively upon our holiest feelings for energetic
action while opportunity is yet afforded
considering the disabilities we are laboring
under and the apathy of the mass around us
on this vitally interesting subject much has
been done in these parts during the past year
but a steady petsevering uncompromising
devotion is indispensable and we hope that
while we labor with untiring zeal to strike at
the root of this infernal system we shall re
member that bursting the fetters should be
followed by the genial influences of sympa
thy and elevation and that during our delib
erations some suggestions may be made with
regard to devising means to place the escaped
bondmen in situations in which their long
buried intellect their manhood shall he called
out that they may be prepared to receive the
truth that they may be recipients of gods
love and thus be enabled to enjoy the boon of
liberty of which they have so long been rob
bed we again say to our friends far and
near como up to our annual gathering where
by a free and spontaneous interchange of sen
timent we may scatter seed that will eveatu
ally yield a rich harvest

to those who are familiar with the page  of
this paper it is unnecesary to speak of its
merit to those who have not seen it we
may say that we regard it as one of the very
best antislavery instrumentalities now in the
field
we are the more interested in it because
the editor is one of our oppressed race and
admirably qualified y his talents and moral
worth to perform with credit the arduous
task of editing a paper devoted to our eleva

will give us their liberal aid

cap job hull tu tba mintmla
ter of maasachoaetts and coined all
tba money that m made there he
wae ia a new line of business for in
the early days of the colony the cur
rent coinage of the people consisted of
the gold nod silver money of england
portugal and spain these coins be
mg scarce the people were often forc
ed to barter their commodities instead
of selling them
for instance if a man wanted to bay
a coat be perhaps exchanged a beafa
skin for it if he wished tor a harm
of molasses be might purchase it with
a pile of pine boards musket bullets
were used instead of farthings the
indians had a sort of money caled
wampum which was made of clam
shells and this strange sort of specie
was likewise taken in payment of debts
by the english settlers bank bills
had never been heard of there was
not enough of any kind in many parts
of the country to pay their ministers
so they thad to take quintals of fish
bushels of corn or cords of wood in
stead of silver or gold
as the people grew more numerous
and their trade with one another in
creased the want of money was still
more sensibly felt to supply the de
mand the general court passed a law
for establishing a coinage of shillings
sixpences and threepences capt
john hull was appointed to manufac
ture the money and was to have about
one shilling out of every twenty to
pay him for his trouble of making
them
hereupon all the old silver in the
colony was handed over to capt john
hull the battered silver cans and
tankards  suppose and silver buck
les and broken spoons and silver
hilts of swords that had figured at
courtall such curious articles were
thrown into the pot together but bv
far the greatest part of the silver con
sisted of bullion from the mines of
south america which the english
buccaneers who were little better
than pirates had taken from the span
iards and brought to massachusetts
all this old and new silver being
melted down and coined the result
was an immense amount of splendid
shillings sixpences and threepences
each had the date of  on one side
and the figure of a pine tree on the
other side hence they were called
pinetree shillings and for every
twenty shillings that he coined you will
remember capt hull was entitled to
put one shilling in his pocket
the magistrates soon began to sus
pect that the mintmaster would have
the best of the bargain they offered
him a large sum of money if he would
give up that twentieth shilling which
he was continually dropping into his
own pocket capt hull declared that
he was perfectly satisfied with the
shilling and well he might be for
so diligently did he labor that in a
few years his pockets his money
bags and his strong box were over
flowing with pinetree shillings this
was probably the case when he came
in possession of a grandfathers chair to
rest himself in
when the mintmaster had grown
very rich a young man samuel sewel
by name came acourting his only
daughter whose name i do not know
but we will call her betsey who was a
fine hearty damsel by no means so
slender as some young ladies of our
own days
on the contrary having always fed
heartily on pumpkin pies doughnuts
indian puddings and other puritan
dainties she was round and plump as
a pudding with this round rosy miss
betsey did samuel sewel fall in love
as he was of a good character in
dustrious in business and a member of
the church the mintmaster very readi
ly gave his consent
ves you may take her said he
in his rough way and you will find
her a heavy burden enough
on the wedding day as we may sup
pose that honest hull dressed himself
in a plain colored coat all the buttons
of which were made of pinetree shil
j lings the buttons of his waistcoat
sixpences and the knees of his small
i clothes were buttoned wiih threepen
j ces thus attired he sat with great
dignity in his grandfathers chair and
being a portly old gentleman he com
pletely filled it from elbow to elbow
on tbs opposite side of the room be
l tween the bridesmaids sat miss bet
j sey she was blushing with all her
might and looked like a fullblown
peony a great red apple or any other
round and scarlet object
there too was the bridegroom
dressed in a fine purple coat and gold
lace waistcoat with as much other
finery as the puritan laws and customs
would allow him to put on his hair
was cropped close to his head because
gov endicott bad forbidden any one
to wear it below the ears but he was
a very respectable young man and so
thought the bridesmaids and miss
betsey herself
the mintmaster was pleased with
his new soninlawespecially as he
had said nothing at all about her por
tion so when the marriage ceremo
ny was over capt hull whispered a
w ord or two to his menservants who
immediately went out and soon return
ed lugging a pair of scales ttiey were
such a pair as wholesale merchants use
for weighing a bulky commoditv was
now to be weighed in them
daughter betsey said the mint
msster go into one side of the
scales
miss betsey or mrs swel ns we
must now call her did as she was bid
like a dutiful child without any ques
tion or why or wherefore but what
her father could mean aniens to moke
her husband pay for bor by the pound
n y ch would have boon a
dear bargain she had not the least
idea

legend and would hardly be convinced

merely tried however to tell it in a

excitement here as it was several day
before preparations could be made tc

also an altar for worship and some
other evidences of human labor frow

ther it will pay to be worked as it ii
mostly all rock and will require s
great outlay of tools and machinery tc

this discovery if properly pursued
by competent observers may prove ot
the highest historical importance it
will establish the fact that the minera
wealth of that region has been known
to preceding generations and the relici
which may have survived may enligh
