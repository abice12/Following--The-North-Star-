to my colored brothers and sisters in the
free so called and slave states of
america
it has been a long time impressed upon
my mind to send you a few lines to the
north star expressive of my deep
sympathy for you my dear friends in
your mock republic
from a child my mind has felt your
persecutions and bonds as being bound
with you and every day my humble
breathings are towards you and longs
for your deliverance and i hope the
time is not far distant when the rightful
ruler of the universe will stay the
hands of the proud oppressor although
every way at present appears closed
up when i first read of the ameri
can congress passing the fugitive slave
law i cannot express to you the burn
ing indignation which filled my bosom
as i perused the statement in lloyds
gazette oh the heartless wretches
who could frame and support such a
fiendish production i pity them from
the bottom of my soul and would a
thousand times sooner be a flying fugi
tive than the wretch who could sign j
or put in force such a satanic law
surely there never was a conclave in
the darkest ages of the inquisition but
would have shrunk from such an inven
tion of cruelty your oppressors may
have white faces but their hearts are j
as black as the botloiuiets pit ihey
are graves and sepulchres which are
full of all uncleanness and iniquity
and how is it possible that men commit
ting such deeds can expect to escape
the damnation of hell which sentence
i am sure was soanded in the ears of
much less guilty hypocrites of old
after reading the passing of that in
famous hill  settled down a little
hoping the freemen in the north would
never prove uch traitors to humanity
aa to deliver up the noble fugitive hut
when i heard of our friend hamlet
being seized by northern men in new
york and sent back into slavery i
was surprised oh the condign dis
grace that ages will heap upon such
traitors names i loathe them and
their acts with perfect j gust and so
does every friend of humanity on this
aide of the water indeed but little
else is talked of here but the atrocities
in your mock model republic and boast
ed land of freedom the names of
your congressmen who framed and
aided the passing of that infernal bill
will be handed down to posterity as the
vilest of mankind they may think
that they are the great ones of the
earth but they may rest assured that
their names stink in the nostrils of ev
ery honestminded man and as sure 
as day succeedeth night they will re
ceive the reward of iheir doings if
you my dear friends act up to the
light which a divine band has stamped
upon your hearts you will make a much
more peacelul end than your oppress
ors and your names will be held in
everlasting remembrance therefore
envy not the oppressor and choose
none of his ways for when the wicked
grow up as the grass aud when all the
workers of iniquity do flourish it is
that they shall be destroyed forever
what honestminded man could envy
the life and character of a zachary
taylor or a calhoun with their cruel
deeds and rocky heartsyes hearts as
hard as a millstone which could not
be penetrated with the cries of our
common humanity and what can 
say of the recreant lickspittle daniel
webster or the fawning spaniel
minded millard fillmore the servile
cruucher to southern lords and human
fleshmongers and the head of a con
gress of vipers who appear to be rap
idly filling up the measure of their ini
quities for their acts are an outrage
against every child of man
you my dear colored friends are
infinitely better although many of you
are in cottonfields than those vile
men who are the slaves of avarice
the covetous whom the lord abbor
etb and robbers of the fatherless and
widow the oppressors of the poor the
offenders of the little ones of christs
flock the enslavers of the bodies and
ouls of downtrodden humanity and
all for achans portion
thou cursed lust of gold what myr
iads have sacrified their all for thee
take courage my dear friends your
deliverance draweth nigh for the lord
shall fight for you only be followers of
truth and righteousness and you shall

never gave nor never will give true
happiness
be true and kind to each other for
you shall certainly be delivered by a
high hand and an outstretched arm for
hear you not already the sound of the
chariot of freedom its sound is in
every breeze and rustles amongst the
leaves of every tree it murmurs in
every running stream and roars in

 to pay my subscription to the north
star the current year may its course
be onward until it shall have witnessed
the entire emancipation of man from
slavery the infamy of the fugitive
slave bill is showing itself in its nat
ural deformity and the poor white
slaves of perjured kidnappers at the
north stand up in all their beauty j
mr u s commissioner ingraham ofj
philadelphia a man of eminent legal
attainments but totally lost to every
sense of humanity and justice is a fair
specimen of the wretches that infamous
law clothes with authority to sit in
judgment on he liberty of freemen i
the idea that even a jury of twelve
impartial men may even be clothed j
with power to decide whether i shall be
sent a slave for life to a southern cotton
field is terrible but when such men as
ingraham with an offer of a bribe are
to have the sole power of deciding
whether i shall be a slave for life to
somesonthern manstealerev ery feel
ing is aroused and one involuntarily
exclaims give me liberty or give me
death is this in accordance with
american freedom to make laws
clothing bribed wretches with power to
send freemen into slavery hold up
to the gaze of the world the represent
atives who dared sanction directly or
indirectly such a law the president
who approved it and the slaves who
dare execute it there is infamy
enough for the whole tribe to cover
them so deep in disgrace that the
sound of the archangels trump will
never reach them surely such men
no wretchescan never be count
ed worthy to attain any resurrection
hut that of deep lasting and damning
disgrace
it has been suggested by a silver
grey and huiflter that ingraham
should be removed from office i think
however he should keep his place
he is the right man to hold office lin
der the fugitive slave law no man
having a soul or conscience would for a
moment think of taking office under it j
the law is approved by the northern
doughfaces and ought to toe adminis
tered by ingraham to show forts its
beauties  hope the removal ot in
graham will not be urged indeed i
regret having signed a petition to repeal
the law its working will do more to
open the eyes of the people than two
thousand antislavery lecturers so
please say nothing about repealing this
law this bantling of northern dough
faces and under the special protection
of silver greys and hunkers

american slave emancipa
tion and british political
reform
on tuesday evening a public meet
ing of the working classes and others
in this cit friendly to the emancipation
of american slaves and a just measure
of political reform in the british house
of commons was held in the city hall
candleriggs street to adopt resolutions
against the infamous fugitive slave
bill recently enacted in america and
in favor of political reform in this coun
try the following gentlemen occu

john stephenson cooper alex
simpson andrew cortoy a person of
color c c
on the motion of mr a simpson
mr matthew cullen was called to the
chair by acclamation
the chairman in a clear and effect
ive speech stated the objects for
which the meeting had been convened
and which he said had been wholly
got up by working men to affoid their
fellow workmen of this city an opportu
nity of expressing their sympathy with
the oppressed wherever they were
and he was happy to see from the nu
merous attendance before him that
their efforts were appreciated and that
oppression or the oppressor found no
sympathy in their bosoms
mr malcolm macfarlane then came
forward amid loud cheering and pro
posed the first resolution which de
nounced slavery as subversive of the
most obvious principles of reason jus
tice and religion and calling upon
america to grant immediate emancipa
tion to the three million slaves she
holds in cruel bondage he enforced
the sentiments of the resolution in a for
cible and argumentative and feeling ad
dress which was listened to with mark
ed attention and elicited frequent and
prolonged applause
mr wilson seconded the motion
which was carried by a unanimous
show of hands
mr thomas brown proposed the
secqpd resolution which repudiated
the unchristian and degrading doctrine
should hold properly in man
and denounced the fugitive slave bill
as a flagrant insult on humanity and
not binding on the conscience of any
good citizen he enforced his motion
in a most eloquent and thrilling speech
which made a deep impression on the
audience and met with frequent mani
festations of approbation he then
made a few remarks as to the nature
and effects of slavery ard proceeded
as followsi shall sir with your per
mission read a few of the more atro
cious clauses ofthis fugitive slave bill
so that you may judge for yourselves
whether the men who framed it or the
men who sanctioned it had any desire
to let the oppressed go free and will
it be believed uiat the defenders of
such a bill the supporters of a system
which consigns to a felons doom the
man who is humane enough tosuccor
the flying fugitivewill it we say be
believed that the defenders of that bill
have publicly secured the sanction of
some of the most eminent theologians
of america leonard woods f and
thomas stuart men of europeanf ce
lebrity in theological literature both
of them approved of the information to
the course pursued by that archapos
tate d webster for his treachery to
the cause of liberty by adhibiting their
names to a congratulatory address
thanking this endorsing his declaration
that the north was under a moral obli
gation to the south to send back the
caped of the oppressed as if forsooth
there could in any circumstance te a
moral obligation for an immoral act
yet these are the men who talk of the
fanaticisms of the abolitionists the ex
travagance of their language and the
heterodoxy of their sentiments as if
forsooth men who had made a cove
nant with death and an agreement with
hell were fitted to occupy the posts of
senators we are not here to defend
the abolitionistswe are not here to
say amen to the sayings and doings of
anybody but this we will saythat for
the errors of the abolitionists where
they have erred we have to thank the
apathy the lukewarmness the stolid
indifference and the determined oppo
sition of the churches of america
such language may seem strong but it
is not stronger than the crisis requires
it may be objected to as personal by
those who have a morbid dread of per
sonality there is a class pretty nu
merous in our times with whom your
words are all very well ao long as you
deal in sage generality so long as you
shoot your arrows in the air they ad
mire the archery and applaud the
archer but the moment you begin to
take up arms they have done with you
j the moment you begin to specify you
are deemed horribly personal those
men forget that a duty is not created by
smiles so neither is it annihilated by
frowns we are not then to be deterr
ed by any posthumous fear of offence
from the utterance of our honest indig
nation against a system of iniquity
which is the aim ofvillany the course
of america in the matter of slavery is a
downward course its steps take hold of
i hell going down to the chambers of
death unroused by the fat of the great
republic of antiquity this greatest of
modern republics is standing fast upon
the rock on which they split she is
rousing the vulture hat is yet to prey
upon her vitals she is now sowing
broadly throughout her ample territory
the dragons teeth which shall ere long
spring up armed men and yet she
hears not the steps of doom along her
future windings while the nations of
europe are shaking from their fetters
while the spirit of freedom is summon
ing the nations from their slumbers
and they are shaking from them the
dust which has for ages clung around
them reappearing in renovated glory
america seems ready to wrap around
her the night clothes of old europe
and has cast aside the thing more close
ly to herchartered freedom it is
deeply to be regretted the compromise
into which the men who achieved her
independence entered with the slave
power it has worked as all compro
mises ever work in vitiating the good
worker without in the least reforming
the bid during the ware of the rev
rochester n y thursday january  
olution the prejudice against color had
little or no existence the negro
messed at the same table with bis com
panions in arms and mingled with them
on a footing of at least equality frank

very society and washington eould
write letters to a colored woman but
prejudice has grown apace it has sto

struck at last with iron hands for
merly slavery waabarely tolerated now
it is a venerated thing a pattern insti
tution andtfcv slaveholder overwork
ing the man it is now their delight to
honor and execute his behest the
american people have prostrated the
manhood of their nation by constituting
themselves the watchdogs of the plant
er it is vain for political tricksters to
shut from the eyes of the woild the in
famy and odiousness of the position of
mr webster talk not to us of law
demanding the degradation there is
a law nobler and fairer than any parch
ment enactment which spurns itthat
law written by the finger of the creator
in the human soul respect for the
laws of earthly authority is good but
when human laws are in opposition to
the divine then the path of duty is plain
let us then endeavor io sustain this sen
timent in opposition to the obsequious
hindrances to mere authority without
reference to the fact of whether that au
thority is legitimate and let us remem
ber that as all power is of god so
whatever power is not a copy of the di
vine will is a power unworthy of being
obeyed and holding such principles let
it be known that such are our princi
ples let us hold them in the face of
tyrant magistrates wherever we meet
them let our master know he may
break but they will not bend us so
shall we by our unswerving attach
ment to our principles cheer on and
sustain our transatlantic friends who
are at this time bearding one of the
fiercest and most despotic tyrants that
the strife of party or the war of princi
ples ever ushered into existence up
then we say to our brethrenup in
freedoms manly part from greybeard
old to fiery youth and on the nations
naked heart scatter the burning words
oftruth these are stirring times that
are parsing over ustimes fitted to test
our faith the truththroes of a new
epoch are upon us society enfeebled
and decayed seems like some weath

whose ruins these storms are ready to

concluded amidst loud and continued
cheering
mr john stephenson having second

ried
mr james rattray hen moved the
third resolution protesting aaginst the
policy which deprived so large a por
tion of the people in this country of the
elective franchise which being sec
onded by mr andrew paton was also
carried
mr james hoey after a few perti
nent observations read the following
appeal and remonstrance
to the working men of the united
states of america who are invested
with the elective franchise
fellowworkmen we the
working and unenfranchised classes of
the city of glasgow in north britain
have resolved at a public meeting held
on the tb nov  to address you
our brethren in the united states rel
ative to your connection with the insti
tution of slavery in your country and
more especially in reference to the re
cent passing of the fugitive slave bill
by the legislative houses of assembly
and congress respectively as re
gards the propriety of the course we
thus adopt let us state in substance
that our claims upon the industrious
portion of western republic are
such as enable us to throw aside all re
serve in giving a full and open expres
sion of our thoughts and feelings and
we feel ourselves perfectly freein using
the language of expostulation remon
strance and likewise reproof the
circumstances in which we are rela
tively placed admit of candor as well as
plainness of speech having a com
mon origin a common language and
a common ancestry we feel in some
measure bound to you as brethren of
one family although the restless waves
of the great ocean incessantly roll be
tween the places of our habitation be
sides there is also an undisputed kin
ship in our relution to the universal
brotherhood of men we are disposed
to hold last by the truth of that declar
ation that god hath made of one blood
all nations of men that dwell upon the
face of the earth the aimospherer
ic act ion of certain latitudes may tinge
our complexions with divers colors yet
notwithstanding human identity is com
plete in the inner man there are the
same kindly affections and generous
emotions among every race under
heaven the negro mother of central
africa is possessed of ns much fervent
love for her offspring as the most fin
ished lady in london or new york the
law of maternal sympathy being equal
ly inscribed inside the sable tabernacle
of ethiopians as within the purest cov
ering of white that any female inhabit
ant of europe may inherit your maid
en slave of south carolina and the
most delicately formed of the daughters
of your northern states are alike fash
ioned by the unerring hand of the great
creator and if these things ore so
the simple question ie appropriate
who hath made thee to differ
most certainly you cannot by tak
ing thought add one cubic to you
stature our impotency in these
things is without doubt men may buy
and sell their brethren for a pece of
silver but to change their raven locks
into the similitude offlaxen fibre is be
yond their power but if after all it
is found that some are less honorable
from no fault of theirs then the divine
law respecting such is the bestowment
of more abundant honor on these mem
bers that are less honorable it is an
exalted christian virtue for the strong
to bear the burdens of the weak and
not seek his own profit in their oppres
sion then again all men are alike
as regards their destiny in the place
of sepulchres invidious distinctions are
unknown our fathers where are
they those of them who fought bled
and died for the liberties we possess in
old caledonia and your fathers who
fought bled and died for that measure
of freedom you claim in the western
world have all gone to rest along with
the sable children of st domingo the
colored descendants of them that did
so valiantly in behalf of independence
in that distant isle have equal cause
with us to cherish the memories of their
heroic ancestors toussaint louver
ture their general in chief was a man
not a whit behind our wallace or your
washington in those qualities that are
requisite for leadership in any great
struggle where truth and freedom are
at stake as it is with all ihese so
sure will it be with us but a few years
hence our hatred and our love will be
alike forgotten in that place where the
slave is free from his master and the
weary are at rest but perhaps you
are ready to say that these relation
ships are too general by far to warrant
our interference witn the internal ar
rangements of any confederacy or na
tion in answer to such an objection
we remark that in the ordinary and le
gitimate legislation of any community
no neutral party has a right to inter
meddle neither would we seek in
any instance of common policy to take
the same course we now feel called up
on to do were it not that millions of
our brethren and sisters are enslaved
in our midst bought and sold in the
market for an earthly consideration
many of whom at this present time are
fleeing from the hand of the spoiler
seeking refuge on the cold and to them
inhospitable soil of the canadas in
preference to the land of perverted and
despotic republicanism another rea
son for our leeling more at liberty to
remonstrate with any people as to their
misdeeds lies in the fact that we have
eo franchise ourselves being thus lit
erally without the pale of the british
nonstitution we hold ourselves to be
more the citizens of the world on
that account the prudential coquetting
of diplomatic agency we care little for
hence our directing with you the law
makers of another country but yet
you may taunt us with being in bond
age to the aristocracy of this nation to
a certain degree we admit that we are
although they have not as yet put any
of us or our children up for sale on the
auction block nay some of them did
a noble work for slave emancipation in
the west indian colonies and without
abating one jot of ourhatred of aristo
cratic misrule we believe that a repeal
of our colonial emancipation act would
be altogether an impossible thing
whereas in the boasted democracy of
the west fugitive slave bills are quite
the order of the day we have pro
tested long and struggled vigorously
for our due share of political power but
ever and anon we have found the spir
it of domination ready to find an ex
cuse for our exclusion from it in the
misdeeds of others rather than our own
the landord and other dominating
classes of this country are quite in the
habit of nailing ua up to the cross be
tween napoleonism in france and the
slaveocracy of america to you
therefore our appeal is made to re
move this latter stumblingblock out of
our way you have the power let the
world and us have the benefit of your
will in the overthrow of a system
which has done more to retard the pro
gress of genuine liberty than any other
cause known to civilized man the
enslavement of three millions of human
beings iu the heart of a boasted democ
racy is a living argument to the up
holders of despotic rule throughout the
world we have heard of your indig
nant protest against the invasion of pa
triotic hungary by russian hordes
be it known to you that such a mani
festation offeeling is ungraceful on your
part russian despotism has consist
ency in its favor whereas republican
ism with you is but a snare to entrap
the simpleminded negro making him a
prey to the most villanous scheme of
oppression on which the sun ever
shone a french army at rome in the
name of a republic to beat down ro
man liberty is a feeble representation
of that spirit which holds in servile
bondage the weak and helpless of our
race the despots of europe have
some credit for fact and ability in their
successful resistance to majorities of
men claiming elective power as their
birthright but to find a majority of any
commonwealth crushing the lesser
number with an iron hand brings out a
state of feeling peculiarly mean and
despicable we can hardly believe
that you have considered fully the rela i
tion you bear to the hideous wrong of
which we complain tha elective con
stituency of this nation have their faults
in abundance to their detestable ex
clusiveness we are at perpetual war
but to be a party to the vile and odious
selfishness which induces a man to
claim proparty in hit brother is to all
termss  per asua invariably kb adraiee
intents and purposes to sum up the en
tire account of injustice and atrocity
then the dissimulation connected with
the distribution of power both in great
britain and america is apparent the
theory of the constitution which profess
es to shield us from all political wrong
is that taxation without representation
is robbery then on the other hand
the theory of the constitution of the
united states as you well know is that
all men are created free ard equal
having a right to life liberty and the
pursuit of happiness what now is
the practice in this nation and in your
commonwealth in the former every
sixth or seventh male inhabitant has or
may have the privilege of being repre
sented while the great mass are pas
sive instruments as far as lawmaking
is concerned with you again there
are millions of veritable slaves to grace
the greatest republic that ever the
sons of men have witnessed hence
the lawmakers of these two vast com
munities stand before the world con
victed as a combination of dissimula
tors forming within themselves an or
ganized hypocrisy wanting faith in
their own professed principles the fruits
of which are misery and woe to all on
whom their baneful influence may op
erate we would here bring under
your special notice the reaction upon
your own interest which the abuse of
political power has excited you stand
as one barrier in the way of cfbr en
franchisement the tendency of this is
to perpetuate the laws of primogeniture
and entail in this country whose ruin
ous operations has the most direct ef
fect in overcrowding the labor market
in all its departments the conse
quence of this state of things must be
seen at a single glance emigration to
america is the most natural outlet to
the overabundance of willing hands on
this side of the atlantic be not then
churlish and rude to the scotch eng
lish or irish artizan although ho finds
a place beside you in the workshops oi
any city or township in the land where
you dwell he is there not so much ot
his own willas according to the law of
supply and demanda law bythe way
which the landlord class of britain and
you the democracy of the far west
have stultified in its legitimate opera
tions bringing want to many a home in
these islands and as a natural result
subjecting yourselves to a pressing
competition which we understand is by
no means taken at its true value in the
various localities where it exists and
farther we had long cherished the
hope that the yoke of bondage had un
dergone a process of decay which at
no distant date would terminate in utter
extinction but in the passing of the
fugitive slave bill our most ardent
expectations have been completely dis
appointed in it we have an indication
that the hearts of your legislators are
fully set in them to do evil would
that we could bring ourselves to the
conviction that they are not the true in
dex to national feeling in america
late exhibitions in the cities of new
york and boston are so much accumu
lative evidence of an unaccountable
perversion of the most common ideas of
justice and fair dealing men who ought
to have the highest honors conferred
upon them that is in the power of any
people to bestow have been thwarted
in their good intentions and bullied
by a lawless mob tlhe noble hearted
garrison with his heroic and coura
geous coadjutors stifled and put to si
lence in one ol the centres of civiliza
tion will stand a spectacle of lasting
disgrace to the place and people where
the infamous deed was perpetuated
and what of douglassthe man on
whose countenance we have looked
and to whose eloquence we have listen
ed to with ineffable delight wondering
all the while whether there was any
place of repentance for the vile miscre
ants that would rob him of himself and
count his person a thing of just so much
value in the market or auctionroom
our indignation has been of the most
intense description on hearing of the in
human treatment his manhood has re
ceived at the hands of an educated and
professedly christian community
there i  within the whole range of
those indignities heaped on the colored
population a brutish and barbarous
heartlessness of which demons them
selves might well be ashamed as a
mere matter of selfinterest we con
ceive that any community within the
union who are unable to discern the
representative powers of frederick
douglass are wholly at fault in all
earnestness our opinion of him is that
he would do honor to the most gifted
legislative assembly in the world and
from such statement you may possibly
draw your own conclusions as to what
interests we would confide to his care
were it in our power to honor such an
one with our suffrages either in matters
municipal or parliamentary perhaps
it is not known to you that your preju
dices have left you much behind na
tions with less pretensions to free gov
ernment in the jamaica house of
assembly there are no less than six
men of color invested with all that dig
nity belonging to representation some
of whom are acknowledged to be more
profound in the abstract sciences than
any of their compeers within or without
the precincts of the legislative assem
blies we call upon you then by
the seconsiderations and by others e an
of higher import to wipe away that
foul stain upon your national character
which unchristian prejudice has en
gendered to the irreparable injury of
those whom god hath chosen to create
according to the inflexible laws of his i
own universe let nothing stand ia
the way of latent aspirations which
whole no 
may exist for crowning all men with
the dignity and privileges of manhood
th polic yor religion which
quire your acquiescence to the impious
and atrocious praet of making man a
marketable commodity is aattkly sen
sual devilish that church him
claims on your reverence which would
parcel out pews to its colored members

those who were my friends in  and to
hsoome acquainted also with those who
sines that eventful period have become the
friends and champions of ihe cause i advo
eated and may therefote be disposed to give
a not unfriendly reception to one who like
yourself was early in the field and did not
shun either the reproach or dauger to which
abolitionists were exposed during the reign ot
mobtuptemacy believe me it will be most
lefreshing to me to mingle with the whole
hearted reformers of your city and of the
old bty state i gave you some reason to
expeet me more than two months ago my
visit st that time however was impractica
ble parliament was not up and when it did
rise some other engagements as well as the
stale of my domestic affairs prevented me
from carrying my wish into fulfilment i now
think i ace the possibility of my being absent
for four months without the disregatd of
any claims upon my time or labors in thin
country
 in addition to my desire to see you and
tha friends of our common cause i have a
project to carry out of which america is the
fold for some years before  entered parlia
ment and at the lime  entered it  had been
and was in the receipt of an income sufficient
to meet all my wants and to support the po
sition to which i aspited in less than three
montha after  became a legislator that income
wholly failed me and for three years i have
boon supporting myself and my family upon
that which  had hoped i should be able tc
isave behind me lam now poor but hope
ful with unimpaired mental energy wiih a
constitution yet sound and strong and a
character unassailable by any imputation ol
selfishness or corruption
in these circumstances my thoughts have
been turned to the way in which  might by
honorable independent and useful exertion
itpair in tome degree my shattered fortunes
and provide things honest in the sight of all
men it has occurred to me that by a visit
to the united states of america at that sea
son of the year when lectures are most in re
qnest i might realize not only enough to pay
my expenses but something also to sustain
mo for a time after my return i have there
fore so far resolved to act upon this idea as
to engage a berth in the canada and shall
try the experiment if encouraged and aided
by m personal friends in boston my visit
than will be of a business character
wore i alone in the world i need not
visit america to find the means to live
could i bring myself to prostitute my talents
to party purposes or base objects i might
live here and sustain those  love could

of enough to carry me over the session of

myself to care for that you will believe it
is only the love of independence and of my

aatifuf itive slav bill meeting at
syracuse
this was not such a meeting as we ex
pected would be held judging from the object
as set forth in the call which convened it
but it uas just such a meeting as the advo
cates of slavecatching alias bloodhoundism
will probably set up a fiendish shout of de
light over not however because there was
anything said or proposed in the convention
with which the latter can unite but simply be
cause there was not that harmony of opinion
exhibited which might have been expected
from a slight perusal of the call in question
and which was so much to have been desired
on such an occasion it must be confessed
that the meeting was very stormy and to
wards the close was very discordant a body
of men and women were brought into a
convention who while hearty and unani
mous in their opposition to the fugitive
slave bill are nevertheless greatly divided in
respect to doctrines and measures touching
the great question of slavery generally and
as ft is almost impossible to talk about slave
catching without talking about slaveholding
for the greater includes the less there
was little unanimity in the action of the con
vention and a portion of the original parties
to the call finally adjourned and separated
while others remained behind and adopted
the resolutions and address out of which the
controversy arose while we lament these
circumstances we do not see how they could
have been avoided and we do not therefore
feel like censuring any of the parties con
cerned men and women spoke out their
honest convictions as to the best mode of
action against the fugitive slave bill and
as far as we could see they were animated
by no factious spirit and although they could
not agree we do not think that the fugitive
slave bill will gain a single friend nor lose
a sirgle opponent in consequenc of that disa
greement in many respects the meeting was
truly gloriousit was so in the numbers
which were in attendanceand in the earnest
eloquence which it called forth against the
whole system of human bondage there
were times when the scene was sublime
the last session of the meeting continueduntil
midnight and the city hall was still crowd

convention next week and shall speak

ence which came up for discussion f d

lecture no yii delivered by fred
erick douglass in corinthian hmll
onjsnnday evening jan th
i tise to give my seventh lecture on amer
ican slavery under feelings of very deep seri
ousness the return of henry long to all
the horrors of a life of endless slavery hss
shrouded my spirit in gloom but a few
days ago he walked abroad in the streets of
new york in the full enjoyment of freedom
his mind occupied with thoughts hopes and
aspirauons becoming the mind of a virtuous
freeman but in a moment he has been
snatched away by a hand moie dreadful than
that of death his hopes snd aspirations
plans and purposes have been cut off and
destroyed from a man he has fallen to a
chattel and instead of breathing the free air
of new york in the pride of his liberty and
in the society of freemen he is now doomed
to the appalling condition of a slave and
must drag out his life in virginia under all
the horrors of the whip and fetter
henry long is the second victim surren
dered by new york under the inhuman and
barbarous provisions of the fugitive slave
bill and there are some circumstances at
tending his surrender which make it even
mote alarming and distressing than the case
of james hamlet the latter was arrested
tried and delivered up in a most seciet and
hasty manner without the legal and friendly
aid which might have been rendered despite
the furious haste required by the fugitive
slave bill the case of u on g  different
between the time of his arrest and the time
of his surrender there was ample opportunity
for rendering him all the assistance of which
the law and the case would allow his
artest was known and his trial open to public
gaze there was time for the vigilance of
his friends to be exercised and that vigi
lance to a certain extent was exercised yet
henry long was surrendered and in broad
day light dragged out of the city of new
york without even an attempt being made
to rescue him
it is stated that there was not a sign of
disturbance when the unfortunate man
was taken to the ferry from which he departed
for the south and that the only thing unusual
in that vicinity at the time waa the appear
ance of captain isaiah rynders parading
about with rifle in hand swearing vengeance
against abolitionists if this be so it is a
shame and a scandal which the colored people
of new york should seize the first oppor
tunity to wash out it is humiliating in the
extreme that in a city with a colored popu
lation of more than twenty thousand such a
highhanded and daring atrocity could be per
petrated without any intervention on the part
of any among them  know not what would
have been the chances of success had any
attempt been made to rescue henry long
it is possible that no chance of success ap
peared in his case for the credit of the
colored people alone  hope that the latter is
true it ought not to be said of a people
like those of new york that they stood
mute spectators of a scene which might well
have roused the courage even of dastards to
deeds of blood some explanation spme
apology for the apparent indifference and
utter inaclivity manifested by the colored
people of new york city is demanded 
say again i do not know what the chance of
success would have been in an effort at the
rescue of henry long but this i do know
that the absence of any attempt to break the
jaws of the oppressor and to rend the victim
from his horrid clutch will form the strongest
possible ground of encouragement to other
slavehunters who may be disposed to prose
cute their infamous business in new york
city i am free to say that nothing abort of
physical resistance will render the colored
people of tho north safe from the horrible
enormities which must result from the execu
tion of the fugitive slave law and i had
rathet have heard that coloted men had been
beaten down by the two hundred police men
employed on that occadbn than that there
should have been no manifestation of physical
resistance to the reenslavement of poor long
my very blood chilled and i felt myself de
graded when  reao that the demand of the
slave catcher for a sufficient force to remove
henry long from new yotk was answered
by judge judson to the effect that he ap
prehended no disturbance no disturbance
doom the innocent to perpetual boodage and
no fear of disturbance why when a
guilty felon ia to be hanged a murderous
assassin who for the love of gold hss
plunged his dagger into the heart of an inno
cent brother such are the sympathies of
human nature and such is the proneness of
man to forget the crime of the criminal in
reflecting on his horrible fate that even in
such a case there is always danger of dis
turbance for his rescue snd provision made
against such an occurrence but here in
the case of an innocent mana man un
stained by any crime and against whom
there is not even the shadow of an allegation
we see him huiried sway to s fate more terri
ble than death itself snd no disturbance
on account of it ia apprehended thia re
veals a popular acquiescence in the execution
of this inhuman ltw which is at once dis
graceful snd heaitsickening an acquies
cence which will not fail to inspire with hope
other twolegged bloodhounds who are medi
ating northern excursions in pursuit of their
prey the contemplation of these things
makes me sad but more saddening atill is
the present aspect of the public mind through
out the north
it is impossible not to see a determination
on the part of men in high places to pot
down if possible all efforts made to promote
sntielsvery sentiment in this country poli
ticians in and out of office are evidently
conspiring agimt the agitation of the qoes
lion of slavsry and are exerting themselves
to the utmost to quiet the public mind on the
subject distinguished individuals both of
the whig and democratic party whose
voices rang through the land last winter pro
claiming manly hostility to the slave power
are now as hushed as though slavery had
ceased to exist and the slave power were no
more meanwhile the pulpit is sending
forth sermons in pamphlet form boldly and
shamelessly advocating obedience to the fugi
tive slave law and in the sacred name of
jeaua christ defending the slave system
the kev dr lord of buffalo in a sermon
enjoining obedience to the fugitive slave bill
says but there is higher authority for
the determination of this question than
anything we have yet suggested the ex
istence of domestic slavery was expressly
allowed sanctioned and regulated by the
supreme lawgiver in that divine economy
which he gave lo the hebrew state ihe
fact is open and undisputed the record
and proof of it are in the hands of every
man who has in his possession a copy of
the bible all the ingenuity of all the
abolitionists in the united states can
never destroy the necessary conclusion of
this admitted divine sanction of slavery
 that it it an institution which may lawfully
exist and concerning which governments
may pass laws and execute penalties for
their evasion or resistance dr lord is
the minister of a presbyterian church in
buffalo and to gratifying waa the sermon
of which the above extract is a fair sample
that nineteen of the respectable gentlemen
and christians of his church sent him a letter
requesting it for publication with this in
quest it seems he cheerfully complied and
his seimon now appears before the public in
a pamphlet of  pages another doctor ol
divinity the rev dr lathrop of auburn
has signalized himself by devoting thanks
giving day to rebuking disobedience to the
fugitive slave law and exhorting his brother
christians to a faithful discharge of their
slavecatching duties on the same day the
rev dr sharie preached a sermon in bos
ton to the same end and we aie informed
that sundry learned doctors of divinity have
come out on this as on tht lords side in
this struggle for human freedom dr la
throp says that the fugitive slave law is the
law of the land enacted by the powers
that be and that are ordained of god
what then he asks is the duty of the
christian and the citizen v and he adds
we answer lhat both patriotism and reli
gion require that the law should be obeyed
suppose says he that we deny the
right of property in a human being and in
sist upon it that one man has no moral
right to hold another as his propeity still
we must admit that for the time being he
has a legal tight according to the consiitu
tion and laws of the state in which he lives
other slates entering into a confederacy
with this one have agreed that it may hold
slaves as property and manage its own in
ternal concerns in its own way the con
federacy is entered into for the security of
other and commanding and common inter
ests which are of paramount importance
if by any act of legislation by this confed
erated required to re
store to ihcm that property to which they
have a legal right however much w may
doubt the morality of lhat claim or the law
upon which it is founded the duty of good
citizenship and the claims of true patriot
ism would demand obedience to the law
the responsibility in regard to the morality
or the wisdom of the law rests not with
us that lies somewhere else butwith
us is the lesponsibiltty of obeying the
laws of the land which have been estab
lished by the powers that be and that are
ordained of god
in a lecture delivered in this hall a few
evenings ago i undertook to show why abo
litionists are often called infidels if  did
not satisfy my hearers on th t occasion with
the causes which first led to that populai
cry the foregoing extracts may succeed in
doing so here we have all that sacred in
heaven and earthgod christ anj the apos
tles the bible christianity and patriotism
all blasphemously paraded in su port of sla
very and in justification of obedience to that
concentration of hellish cruelty the fugitive
slave lava
i believe this audience will agree with me
that tbe true enemy of the christian religion
and of the bible is not he who uniformly
appeals to them in support of justice mercy
and goodness not he who regards them as
on tbe side of the abused and eiislaved but
rather be who though clothed in sacredotal
robes and assuming tv be the chosen minis
ter of god dares to quote the bible in de
fence of robbery and wrong such men do
more in one hour to undermine ibe reverence
of mankind for the bible than the most
skillful infidel could effect in ages
i do not believe that the bible sanctions
american slavery i do not believe that
christ and his apostles approved of slave
holding nor of slavecatching from the
depths of my soul i appeal with confidence
to the pages of holy writ in behalf of my
imbruted and plundered fellowcountrymen
despite the teachings of american divivinea
slave though  have been i will continue
to look to god and to christ for support in
my humble efforts for the emancipation of my
rase but here  will say that should doc
tors of divinity ever convince me that the
bible sanctions american slavery that christ
and his apostles justify returning men to
bondage then will i give the bible to the
flames and n more worship god in the name
of christ for of what value to men would a
religion be which nh only permitted but
enjoined upon men the enslavement of each
other and which would leave them to the
sway of physical force and permit the strong
to enslave tbe weak what better would
such a religion be than blank atheism which
knows no god to defend slavery in the
name oj god is simply to redoes mankind
absolutely to the law of brute force it
places men in relation to each other on a
tooting with tbe wild beasts of the forest
which live and prey upon each other if you
may enslave tbe black man in america of
course the black man may enslave the amer
ican in africa and as the bible is made for
all mankind of course if it sanction slavery
at all it may be quoted by the african priest
in favor of enslaving the white with as
much propriety as it can be quoted by the
white a authority for enslaving the blacks
and the god of the bible would be at once
the god of slavery to all mankind the law
of force would in this case take the place of
the law of lose and tie who could succeed in
manstealing on the moat extensive scale
would best reptesent the attributes of the di
vine mind
but away with this revolting and blasphe
mous theory and away with those hypo
critical doctors of divinity they are
wolves in sheeps clothingthieves and liars
who wrest and torture the pages of the holy
bible to sanctify popular crimes 
the fact that such sentiments as those
which i have quoted from dr lord and dr
lathrop can be taught with impunity from
northern pulpits implies a depth of more
debasement and blindness in the commu
nity beyond the power of human language to
describe
the teaponsibility of politicians for slavery
is great but infinitely greater is the guil l of
the american clergy they frame a tangled
web of arguments in support of slavery of
which politicians would never dream and
urge them with a show of piety which in any
other men would but provoke popular oon
tempt and acorn common men would be
utterly ashamed to shield villany under such
sophistry in discussing the question of
american slavery  would far rather encoun
ter twenty lawyers than one doctor of di
vinity for if  ahould convict the former of
selfcontradiction and falsehood blind as the
public are they would decide according to
the facts it is only the doctor of divinity who
skulking in the shadow of his prieatly office
is able to affright e common people from
forming an intelligent estimate of his char
acter and conduct
the abolitionists of the niled states have
been objected to on the score of using harsh
language but what language is sufficiently
stern and denunciatory to characterize the con
duct of men who while acting as the consti
tuted guardians of the public morality and
claiming the reverence and respect due to
those who hold their commission from the
most high god yet bring the whole scope of
their influence to the side of the oppressor
against the oppressed to propup system in
which aie combined every sin and pollution
that has a name when  speal of such
men  can find no more appropriate language
than the words of our savior to the scribes
and pharisees and if any here deem the lan
guage i have already used harsh oi denun
ciatory  commend to them the burning
words of our savior applied eighteen hundred
years ago to the same class of men as those
who are now standing in the way of the
slaves redemption woe unto you scribes
pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of
mint and anise and commin and have
omitted the weightier matters of the law
judgment mercy and faith ye blind
guides which strain at a knat and swallow
a camel woe unto you scribes and
pharisees for ye are like unto whited sep
ulchures which indeed appear beautiful
outward but are within full of dead mens
bones and all uncleanness ye serpents
ye generation of vipers how can ye escape
the damnation of hell 
it would be easy to preach a sermon from
jthese passages of acriputure and to show
i their literal application to the proslavery
church and clergy of out day but this is i
hope unnecessary as i have already had
much to aay on that subject in a previous
lecture
i turn therefore for the present from the
proslavery church and its clerical defenders
of slavery the slave has nothing to hope from
either they are moved only as they are
moved upon by popular sentiment and when
that becomes antislavery they will become
antislavery and will be among the first to
arrogate to themselves the glory of the
achievement
not many weeks ago a state election took
place in this state and important antislavery
veaults wbre said to be depending upon that
election the whigs and democrats came
before the people with their respective claima
hunt aud seymour were the candidates fot
governor of the state seymour was openly
in favor of measures adopted by congress as
a complete settlement of the slavery question
hunt was represented as a seward whig
and of course as opposed to the fugitive
slave bill but how little there was to choose
between the two may be seen by perusing the
recent message of governor hunt not one
word can be found in it condemning the im
morality the inhumanity and the unconslilu
tionality of the fugitive alave law there is
not one word in it recommending the repeal
or the modification of that atrocious enact
ment there is not one word of dissatisfac
tion with regard to the law not one word of
apprehension for the safety of the colored
citizens of this state but there ia to be
found in it what in all the circumstances
muat be regarded as a cheerful acquiscence in
all ita horrid provisions the governor says
notwithstanding the violent discussions
which have agitated the country and the wide
diversity of opinion which exists in respect to
the questions involved in the recent action of
congress a general disposition ia evincej to
acquiesce in the measures referred to and to
regard them as a final settlement of these tei
ritorial controversies the people of this
state continue to indulge a strong desire that
harmony and mutual good will may prevail
between all portions of our widely extended
republic they are a lawabiding people
they cherish the most friendly sentiment to
ward their brethren of the south and have
always conceded to the slave states the entire
right to maintain and regulate slavery within
their own limjts and to exercise sll those
rights without abridgement or hindrance which
the constitution confers more than this
ought not to be claimed or expected
the fugitive slave law ia not named espe
cially here but it is easy to see when the
governor assures the south that the peo
pie of this state are a lawabiding people
and that there is no disposition to abridge
nor to binder the slaveholding rights which
the constitution ia alleged to confer that the
fugitive slave bill is in hia mind for that is
the only measure to which resistance is likely
to be made and about which there is any
serious dispate between the politicians of the
north and south rightly to appreciate the
tame and submissive character of this part of
the governors message it should becontraai
with the message of southern governors
they are lood and boisterous in their accusa
tions of faithlessness on the part of the north
high and proud in their demands there are no
fawning and sickly expressions of friendship
for the north their love of onion is ever
bold subject to their love of slavery they
ou for the north just is they care for their
sieves miy so for as they sre served by than
this is open snd aboveboard and if not
generous it is at least frank and if we
cannot honor the men of the south in adopt
ing this policy we certainly cannot despise
them their tone is bold and uncompromis
ingwe know where to find them but not so
with northern politicians they are ever
anxious to be understood as a most harmless
set of beings taking the world as they find it
and especially desirious of peace and concord
with them th union is above all earthly
blessings and to save it they are willing to
sacrifice liberty justice and all manly inde
pendence and although they have ever been
repaid for their undue devotion and deference
to their selfimposed taskmakers with the
bitterest contempt and scorn yet they have
not even the spirit of the fugitive slave to
make their escape this readiness to con
cede everything to the south ia not only dis
graceful but is a great political mistake on the
part of the north if there be one political
truth more evident and more frequently illus
trated than another it ia that concessions to
slavery only invite new demands and encroach
ments the more they get the more they
want and the more tamely tine north may
submit the more imperious and arrogant will
be their southern masters nothing is more
ridiculous and absurd than to suppose that the
reatleas ad ambitious spirit ol southern slave
holders will be content with their present
advantages when they know that they can
have more at any time when they shall make
the demand
there is no history axtant in which is fur
nished a more striking illustration of what a
few men can do in the way of getting posses
sion of political power than in the history of
the american government
the actual slaveholders are a mete fraction
of the american people and a very small mi
nority of the people in the southern states
three hundred thousand is the largest esti
mate ever made of them and i have seen cal
culations with great show of accuracy set
ting their number at one hundred and fifty
thousand yet these men rule speak for
and represent the whole fifteen southern
slates as completely as though there was net
a white man in the whole south besides
themselves they are the governors and of
ficers of the state and they enjoy a complete
monopoly of all that pertains to the govern
ment of the state they mould the politics
the morality and the religion of that entire
section of country and the white werking
men are but a step removed rrom the slaves
in their servility to this lordly and imperious
class of men
you who reside in ihe free states can but
poorly understand how absolute is the author
ity of slaveholders and how abject is the
servility of iheir white dependents in the
lave states there is scarcely a shadow of
difference between the cringing obsequiousness
of the slave to the slaveholder and that of the
poor white man who is not so fortunate as to
own a slave but the power of the slave
holder is not confined to the southern states
slavery is the only interest represented by
southein men at the capitol of the nation
and he is a fortunate man that is elected from
the south who is not himself a slaveholder
the purchase of louisiana her immense
south western territory the millions expend
ed upon florida the annexation of texas
the war with mexico were all measures
commenced and carried fotward to their con
summation by that mere jraction of the amer
ican people the southern slaveholders
governor hunt in his recent message thus
confesses the readiness in which new yuik
has ever bowed to the arrogant dictations
and imperious policy of southern slavehold
ers and he assures them of the continued
contentment of new york in her servile con
dition he says
great injustice is done in assuming that
we have intended oi now meditate encroach
ments upon the just rights of any poition of
the confederacy during the entire period of
our tiational history the people of new york
have manifested a spirit of kindly deference to
the feelings and prejudices of our sister slates
and a readiness to sacrifice but
principle and honor for the of union and
concord their course has ben distinguish
ed by a broad spirit of nationality elevated far
above the indulgence of local views or sec
tional partialities the limits of this commu
nication will not permit me to recall ail the
evidences in which our history abounds of the
generous spirit of concession which new york
has uniformly manifested as a prominent mem
ber of the federal union
for more than threefourths of the period
which has elapsed since the adoption of the
constitution southern statesmen elevated by
ihe aid of her voice have filled the presiden
tial office eveiy peaceful extension of our
southern territorial limits was made with her
concurrence until by successive steps all the
slave territory on the north american conti
nent was brought within the boundaries of
the united states although every new ac
quisition diminished the relative weight of
new york to the national councils she
waived all views of slate power or aggran
dizement and yielded to the considerations
urged by other sections in favor of annexing
the contiguous countries
a more true and humiliating statement
never dropped from the lips of any governor
of any sovereign state of this union and 
put it to you citizens of new york how
long will you continue to manifest a spirit of
kindly deference to the feelings and prejudices
of southern slaveholders how long wll
you allow youiselvea to compromise the dig
nity of this the empire state by making
base concessions to the ever hungry slave
power whose cry like that of the voracious
horseleach is give give give
it would be interesting on this occasion if
i had time to enter into the causes and the
means by which this small knot of tyrants
have acquired such indisputable powewjn the
councils of the nation how they have drawn
the reins of government into theii own hands
how completely they have brought both polit
ical parties le do their bidding snd how ut
teily impossible it has been for northern
statesmen to withstand their influence i say
it would be interesting if we could go into a
minute description of the causes of these
things for it is a marvel until now how
readily every great man iom the noith has
been made to bow the knee to this mysterious
power there is one obvious explanation ofalj
this there is but one interest at the south
i mean there is but one that can get repre
sented in the cong ress of the united states
and that is slavery all other interests are
cast into the shade by the colossal greatness of
this one and around this allabsorbing and
all commanding interest both the great politi
cal parties of the south rally and make com
mon cause the south is united as one mao
and nothing divert them from the oae ooa
mon object which is the meiateneeee pros
perity end propagation of slavery they talk
of their pectiftar institute ns and about
southern rights but the only thing meant
by these eupboneous terms is slavery
for this they are ready to sacrifice th un
ion the constitution the fraternal feel
ing between north and sooth and the glory
of this great republic they make n hesi
tation in declaring to the world that opoe that
question there is but one party in the whole
south while the north is divided and sub
divided the south is united and it is hex
unity of action which must account for the
success which has attended her in every
grand controversy which has oocurred in the
politics and legislation of this country
until the north shall be as true to liberty
as the south has been to slavery until she
shall coase to worship the union at the ex
pense of everything good and g reat until she
shall be inspired with a true selfrespect and
shall be represented in congress by independ
ent and highminded tuen men to whom
presidential honois are utterly worthless in
comparison with sn honest and faithful die
charge of their duties ashmen as patriots and
as christians until then the north must con
tinue to be the mere cringing vassal of tbs
south and she must expect to receive the
wages of her servitude in an accumulation of
kicks and disgrace
flax cotton
the london chronicle gives a long no
ticj of m doulana improvement in prepar
ing flax which by a combination of chemical
and mechanical meant avoids all the ex
penses connected with steeping the fibre
may be prepared at a coat considerably be
low that incurred in the present process and
may be made applicable either for fabrics of
the coarseness of mail bags or canvas or of
the fineness of the most beautiful brussels
lace m claussen has by anether invention
adapted the flax fibre to cotton machinery
the patent granted to m claussen for eng
land is lor the preparation of flax in a short
staple so as to produce a substitute for wool
and cotton capable of being spun tfpon cotton
machinery and also for the mixture of the
materials thus obtained which can be carded
together with silk cotton or wool or separate
ly as cotton for spinnning into yarns the
right is also secured for preparing long fibre
as a substitute for silk for bleaching in the
preparation of materials for spinning and felt
ing and also in yarns and felts the chroni
cle jays of its practical resu ila that from one
half cwt of the flax fibre prepared and
cleaned upon the unsteeped process one cwt
of a substance identical with clean cotton
can he produced at a cost for material of lets
than half a crown the cost of manual or
mechanical labor required in its preparation
including the expenses of bleaching an opera
tion performed in a few seconds does net
amount to mure than thof a penny per
pound the mixture of the two substances
viz wool with flax reduced to a short staple
forms a fabric exceedingly durable while its
cost may may be judged by the fact while
wool cost s fid the flax prepared and
ready for spinning may be obtained for six
pence per pound so that with flax and woo
spun together in equal quantities the cost
would be reduced by nearly onehalf the
richmond whig alluding to its improvement
says
if it should turn out upon further trial
that flax prepared in a peculiar way can be
substituted for cotton so as to enable great
britain to dispense with our southern staple
a mighty effect will die produced upon the
value of property in the southern states
the pneu of land and slave property will at
once be diminished and business arrange
ments eiyered into upon the present value of
that species of property will after they
have matured produce a crash that will ba
felt over the entire country a lesson would
thus be read upon the mutability of humao
affairs the political consequences resulting
from the change would be most important
a considerable diminution in th wealth and
power of the southern states would of itself
have a marked effect upon their political re
latioxs with other statesthe impoi lance of
their friendship as well as the dread of their
enmity would thereby be decreaeed
the cotton treaty to be negotiated with
england which not long since we had oc
casion to discuss and through which the
southern states were to cure all the evils of
disunion would vanish into thin air and the
southern states be thrown upon their own
resources should flax be made to supply the
place of cotton then will be exemplified the
impolicy heretofore pursued by the cotton
states of relying on one leading interest to
the exclusion of all others public ledger

amounts were realized although other
causos combined had their effectbeing new

have intended subscribing for the north
btar for some time and have been prevent
ed from doing so earlier by the accumulation
of newspapers that i already receive making
it difficult for me to find time to read them all
without infringing oti time that should be
devoted to my business
i regard however the fact that good news
papers so ably edited by colored men as the
north star and impartial citizenare as
amonj the best vindications of the capacity
of colored man to fill respectable positions in
society creditable to themselves and to the
best interest of the world and shall therefore
be glad to see all such papers have an ex
tended circulation not only among those for
whose advancement they were particularly es
tablished and who therefore are moot
specially bound to bupport them well and
thus increase their influence but also
should  like to hae them read by those who
need information as to the capabilities ol our
colored population lor other pursuits besides
waiting on table blacking boots or wheeling
barrow  heir elfoits for mental improvement
as exhibited by their papers and the talente
they there show themselves to be possessed of
must lead to the successful assertion of their
rights desiring to aid in a small way towards
sptending information of this kind i en
close five dollars for one years subscription
to the north star for myself and the
balance you will please appropriate to sending
copies of the paper occasionally to prominent
southern men members of congress and
others where you think they will do the
most good  forwarded to you a short time
since several of our city newspapers showing
the practical working of the new fugitive
slave law exemplified in the case of adam
gibson arrested as a slave and sent without
s trial and against evidence to a slave state
from whence he was returned as a freeman
this ease had aroused considerable feeling
on the subject here and will no doubt do
much good
 had intended writing to you before this
to thank you for your courtesy in publishing
s letter  addressed to you in the summer on
the subject of colonization knowing as i
well do the very strong prejudice that you
in common with most of youi readers enter
tain against this cause  fully appreciated
your libeiality in presenting it to your readers
while  have no desire to make myself con
spicuous in this way or any other i yet fee
so strong an inteiest in the prosperity of the
young republic of liberia and consider that
the successful establishment of an independ
ent and enlightened government on the
continent of africa conducted entirely by
colored men is so intimately connected with
the best interest of the w hole race over the
woiid that  am glad of every opportunity of
spreading correct information on the subject
among the colored population of the united
slate even should it come from none other
than myself claiming to be well acquainted
with he objects and tendency of measures in
which  have taken an active part and wiih
all the means of infotmalion that any one can
possses  feel well assured that the new
republic even in it infancy is already ex
citing an influence favorable to the entire
race by whom its government is conducted
and that as it increases in population and
extent of territory with ie ntional aug
mentation of both physical and moral power
it must contribute largely lo ih of
antislavery sentiment over ihe civil iae d
warld whether therefore you regard the
indiieot the reflex influence of a powerful
republican government on the continent of
africa condacted on truly enlightened and
christian principles by colored emigrants
from the united states or whether you view
it in its political aspect successfully com
peting with america in the culture of cotton
that one product of our southern states the
large profits of which have in my opinion
been the principal if not the only cause of
the continuance of slavery in the united
states you will have to acknowledge that
liberia isdestined to accomplishyes is now
in the full tide of a most important anti
slavery work and for this reason alone
should be regarded with especial favor by
every true friend of the colored race that
cotton of excellent quality is raised in africa
has been known for a long time and now that
english capitalists and the british govern
ment have turned their attention to it i think
it will be proved that it can be taised in any
quantity and cheaper than in the united
states on this subject allow me to refer
you to president roberts letter to lord pal
merston and the report of the chamber of
commerce and manufactures ofmanchester
in regard to the samples of cotton transmitted
to them should this new discovery of the
process of preparing flax prove successful in
lessening the demand for cotton in both ep
rope and america and if the information on
this subject is eorrect flax must supersede the
use of cotton to a great degree why should
not the markets of great britain and the
united states be supplied with cotton en
tirely from africa slave iabor being then
unprofitable will not slavery be abolished at
ance will not the patriotism and philan
hropy of the whole people be aroused to
ienounce so antirepublic and antichristian
in institution that was forced on us by
jreat britian against our wishes not regard
ng our emphatic protest against it and
nethinks it will be difficult to find many who
ver approved of the system verily we are
in an age of progress and certainly human
slavery will not prove the only exception to
be change that is taking place in the world
liberia is destined soon to become a joyful
hepublcan government the english are lay
ng the foundation of future states south and
jastof liberia and with their colony of siera
leone and the settlement on the gambia at
he north must ere long b united in a pow
erful confederacy that shall command the re
spect of the world and your childron may
see the day if you and i shall not when
he united states of africa shall be con
sidered as one of the most enlightened and
listinguished nation of christendom rivalling
n all that constitutes true glory the united
states of america then may our children
while revering the name of their fathers be
ible to point to his nam who once an ame
rican slate lent the weight of his talent and
the power of his press to aid in consummating
so great a work when you look at the
question in all its aspectsl care not what
you choose to regard as the origin to the colo
nization societywhat motives you may still
insist on attributing to its founders it is im
possible that you should not feel a strong in
terest in the prosperity and rapid progresa of
the young republic that you should not
sympathize with your brethren there identi
fied with yourself in all that pertains to the
suffering of the past and the prosperity of the
future many of them like yourself having
experienced the iron rod of slavery in ame
rica and now with yourself working out the
redemption of your race that you should
in any way oppose the triumph of the ami
shvery cause through the aid of the free
men of liberia because the colonization so
ciety should thereby receive a share of the
glory i am entirely unwilling to believe
it is entirely opposed to true noblenessir
consistent with that sincere devotion to the
welfare of your race which i believe you to
possess and in a word unworthy the name and
fame of frederick douglass  shall there
fore expect you to give your readers such
information as may be interesting to them
and affecting any portion of your people
whether in america or africa and shall take
the liberty of sending to you occasionally
documents from liberia and will be glad if
you will copy into the north star the last
letter from president roberts to myself
which you will find in the colonization
herald i should also be gratified if you
would copy from the pennsylvania free

dear douglass you will have seen that
the press of this country has been unsparing
in its denunciation of the fugitive slave
bill of the many acts of cruelty and in
justice committed by the american legisla
ture against the colored people of the united
states none has done so much to crown them
with infamy and to cause the people of this
country to detest and abhor the american
character as the enactment of this new law
it ia an ancient fable that the eruptions of
etna were produced by the restless move
ments ot the giant enceladus who was im
prisoned beneath as the monster turned on
this side or stretched his limbs or struggled
ihe conscious mountain belched forth dames
fiery cinders and redhot lava carrying de
struction to all who dwelt upon its fertile
sides
the slave power of the united states is
the imprisoned giant of the new world and
its constant struggles for more power have
and will cause eruptions of evil to the people
in comparison wiih which the flames the fiery
cinders and redhot lava of the valcano are
trivial and transitory the fugitive slave
bill and its consequences is the allabsorb
ing topic for conversation in this country
within the last three weeks i have at
tended several meetings upon the subject ol
the fugitive slave bill sir john fife presided
at the meeting in newcastle in shields the
mayor was in the chair the sunderland
meeting was presided over by one of the old
est and most venerated of its citizens at all
of these meetings stringent resolutions were
passed in favor of the antislavery movement
and against the fugitive bill the minds of
the people of england wer never in a better
state to hear the question of american sla
very discussed than at the present time
president fillmores message has come to
hand and his approval of the new law and
i bis seeming datenainatioo to see it enforced
i is to some extent claiming the attention of th
public what words can tell the inhumanity
the atrocity of that doctrine which from ex
ailed office commends such a law to the favo
of christians as the deliberate counsel ant
practical wisdom of a great and enligh tenet
nation what indignation from all the worlt
ia not due to the government that puts forth
its powers and strength to execute such ar
obnoxious law 
but i did not sit down to write a long let
ter my only object was to give you some lit
tle account of the crafts i received letters
from boston some days since informing me
of their flight from that city and their intend
ed visit to this country my connection with
william and ellen on tbeir getting out ot
slavery two years since and their attendance
upon my meetings in massachusetts caused
our newengland friends to suppose that orr
reaching this country they would find me
out a few days ago while in newcastle i
received information in an indirect way that
the crafts had arrived at liverpool and were
at browns temperance hotel where you
and i and many more of the american abo
litionists have made their homes oa reaching
liverpool i immediately wrote to william
crafts telling him that if i could be of any
service to him it would give me the gieatest

have been much more so to have seen you
we will come to you but we cannot leave
liverpool until thursday next aa ellen is
not very well hoping to see you in a few
days  remain yours most truly
wm craft
when i met with william craft two years
ago he scarcely knew one letter from anoth
er and although he has had to labor for
his living since his escape the composition
of his letter does his head more credit than
the one tent to him by the slaveholder
hughes while in pursuit of ths noble fugi
tive in boston i dont know what will be
their plana as i have not yet seen them but
as i have lying before me an invitation to
visit scotland i have but little doubt but that
wm and ellen craft will accompany me
and that edinboro the capital of the land of
burns will be the first to give a welcome to
wm and ellen craft the first fugitive slaves
who have landed in this country chased from
the land of their birth by websters fugitive
slave law
the people generally are deeply interested
in the history of wm and ellen craft and
it is not at all unlikely that the fugitive slave
bill hat added one more mouthpiece to the
antislavery agitation the hearty and en
thusiastic welcome that these two fugitives
will get at the hands of ihe people of great
britain will cause the cheeks of the ameri
cans to mantle with shame if they are not eu
titely lost to everything of the kind
when i left boston in july  for this
country the crafts accompanied me to east
boston to see me off and as the steamer
had left the wharf saw among the last vis
ible objects in the crowd on the wharf the
white handkerchief of craft waving in the
breexe above the heads of those  around
him bidding me farewell i hoped at that
time that  should soon return and find him
at hia own home aa i had left him but the
crafts were too noble specimens of our race
to be permitted to dwell in peace and quiet
ness after the passage of the fugitive slave
law the people of the north should no
longer boast of their independence of the
slave power and instead of the people of
boston pointing to the bunker hill monu
ment and boasting of the heroic deeds of
their fathers they should pull it down and
erect upon its ruins a monument to webster
and engrave upon it in characters not to be
mistaken no protection here for the op
pressed when i heatd of the passage of
the fugitive slave bill i had some faint hope
that the people there would protect those who
had fled to that city for safety but when i
heard ot the flight of the crafts i gave up
all hopes of the fugitives being safe on any
soil over which the stars and stripes float
but  must bring thia hasty letter to a close
and before doinj that i must make a aingle
reference to the reception given to our
friend george thompson by the bostonians
those in this country who understand the
position of the political affairs in americalook
upon the disturbance in faneuil hall aa tbs
last and crowning act of infamy of the defeat
ed whig party of massachusetts but thia
will cause this noble friend of the slave to be
more and more admired in this country i
understand a testimonial ia to be presented to
mr thompson on his return to england

may be considered presumtuous in the esti
mation of you and youi followers for me to
attempt to reply to your soul stirring remarks
in defence of your church delivered in the
city of zanesville on the evening of july th
 i shall now take occasion to descant
upon your literary abilities and the fame
which will naturally result from such as
tonishing powers displayed upon that evet
memorable occasion to encouiage rate
genius to foster true greatness and magna
nimity of soul and more particularly to at
tract the attention of the world to the possessor
of those rich and glorious attainments will
be the grand object i have in addressing or
noticing anything you have said and while i
hold you up as a pattern of excellence to the
rising generation it will not be surprising if a
spice of iiony should be mingled in the picture
i present for the rapturous feelings which
your arguments produce naturally lead to
extravagance of thought and reflections
w ere it not for the identity of language and
sentiments which flow from a heart fired as
yours is with all the sensibilities and polished
attainments of a gentlemen and a scholar
you would be entirely lost to human vision
but as all great men have their eccentricities
and peculiarities which distinguish them so
you have characteristics which toijj forever
identify you in whatever character you may
assume and whatever part you may act in the
groat drama of life in every shape form and
color and under whatever name you may
seek to hide the image of morality which
nature has fixed upon you the prominence of
your genius stand out ia bold raliaf not only
giving tone to all you do or say or write
but marked with unerring certainty the re
splendent destiny of your career wherever
found in whatever attitude you are placed
you exhihit the same great attributes of your
nature love roa tee araiam episcopal
church possessing a certain amount ol
equanimity of temper un mixed and unmfngled
with the follies attendant upon low ambi
tion audthat supercilious arrogance peculiar
to men of depraved hearts and empty brains
the variety of your talents and the versatility
you exhibit in whatever state or condition
you are placed by the guardians of your fame
it truly astonishing at one time we find you
in the retirement of yeur sanctum drawing
pictures of fancy and breathing into them so
much of the living upiritof your own feelings
that one would scarcely distinguish the ori
ginal except in the outward form again
with descriptive efforts of a bulwer or
sven the sublime flights of byron you
mount the sunny side of parnassus drink in
spiration from its pebbled fountains and sound
forth the harmony of your thoughts in poetic
numbers unto an admiring world and still
again should the falling fortunes of the af
rican methodist episcopal church wsnt
a defender you can step forward at their
bidding and with a heart melting with sym
pathy and touched with all the tender and
refined emotions of your nature you can
sstch the echo of their displeasure and send

such sir i  the variety of your task and
slents as were displayed on the memorable
svening of the th of july  in the

holecats catamounts and other wild varmints
i lluded to i had at one time almost believed
rou to be some superior intelligence sent
lown to us from another sphere whose errand
m earth was designed to soften and refine the
lsperities of man and still the troubled
vaters that distract the world and in this
ige of progress and spiritual communica
ions would it be too great a stretch of imagi
lation to suppose you may be one of those
vinged beings somewhat in the resetnbalnce
f a man brought to view some years since

md more particularly as you present some of

worthy man be this as it may your argu
ments tincture with all the sweetness of your
imposition and happy style of thought and
jxpression peculiar to yourself and with a love
of whatever is lofty in sentiment and grand in
diction you have proven beyond cavil i had
almost said the possibility of demonstration
ihe purity and honesty of the leaders of the
african methodist episcopal church
yourself being a sample and how deserving
s your temporal advancement to hand down to
coming generations
again sir you stand like a blazing light
in the midst of thick surrounding darkness
unconsciously drawing aside the curtain and
exposing to our view some small specimens
of the mode and temporal honesty of the af
rican methodist episcopal coherences and
tell us public opinion is manufactured and sent
forth to the world pure and undefiled like
the flow of gushing waters from the fountain
head i hope at some future period you will
lift the curtain atill higher and let the radiant
light of your effulgent genius illuminate the
datk corners of your packed conferences and
explain to the world in your accustomed
courteous and polished manner the machinery
by which certain interests south of mason
and dixons line have been obtained and
certain privileges secured and whether chi
canery corruption or bribery have ever
touched the wires but sir with all the
flourish of your rhetoiic ip nothing have you
been so fortunate in drawing upon the feel
ings and sympathies of your hearers as your
allusion to the brave the eloquent and the ven
erated rt rev r ablen who braved the
tempest of his day in behalf of religious lib
erty to himself and fellowcoadjutors aiming
at the true principles of the elevation of that
class of his fellowcountrymen who were pro
scribed i might say for opinions take and
not like you and many you are classed with
he came out boldly on the side of the op
piesaedwithout any attempt to screen hmi
velf from any for the sake of policy if such
a man with intrepid boldness should dare at
that dark day to mount the battle walls of
freedom and theie and then assert a right to
worship god in freedom and truth and suc
cessfully lay a foundation for a church of
which it seems that you are a member par
ticularly ot its lawmaking department  ask
in god almightys holy name what
apology have you and your twenty thousand
followers in remaining silent respecting the
damning sin of american slavery nothing
that you said in zanesville in my humble
opinion has put to silence that allimportant
question in conclusion all i ask is that
chrisliaus and christian gospel oumstors more
especially they who are particularly identified
with the three and a half million nf bondmen
of the united states should awako awake
isay to this all important subject i have
done wh borsham
the african slave trade
an officer on board one of otn ships on the
african station thus wntes upon this subject
the letter is copied from the boston jour
nal
i very much regret to say that for a
long time ibe greatest facilities for carrying
on the slave trade have been afforded by the
prostitution of our flag i believe full one
half of the negroes shipped h run the congo
southward have been made in vessels under
it cover
the position which the united states oc
cupies upon the right of visitation and searoh
ir such that a bona fide american vessel
cannot be molested by a british cruiser even
with a full cargo of negroes on board eng
land by treaty orcouveution has secured the
right under certain restrictions of visiting
and searching all suspected vessels except
those wearing the american flagsuch are
sacred and thus guarded may embark hun
dreds of slaves under the gups w the british
commodore himself svoid all interruption
from foreign countries and by hoisting the
brazilian flag tnay escape capture by our
own
now i believe  know my duty as an
offiqer too well to find fault with the acts of
my government but ster two years service
f nd experience as an african cruiser and not
wholly without observation i am free to sty
hat could the united states authorities
consistently make an exception to the general
rale no as to allow vessels notoriously en
gager in the slave trade to be detained by
british erttisera and delivered up to own the
disgraceful traffic would be greatly curtailed
r and especially would the vile prostitution of
our flag be prevented
as to the entire suppression of the slave
trade by the present system of blockade i
must confess lam thoroughly sceptical in
spite of the sleepless vigilance and constant
motion of the numerous cruisers hovering
along this coast it is estimated that not less
than thirty thousand were during the pas
year sent into bondage from the southward of
tbo voltse sir charles hothm the late
able commander of her britannia majestys
naval force on lhe african west station
having at his disposal a moat effective force
and after two year  of active arid laborious
service failed to do raortlhan partially inter
rupt it and is clearly of the opinion that other
instrumentalities must be used for its eradica
tion the means he relies most upon is
colonization particularly as exemplified in
the liberian colonies a fact which is no less
interesting than pleasing to americans being 
a just tribute to the sagacity and enlightened
philanthropy of the founders and friends of
our colonization scheme penn freeman
loando the capital of the portuguese pro
vince of angola has a fine harbor and looks
well from the seabut it may well be said
that distance lends enchantment to the
view it is emphatically a whited se
pulchre when then slave trade was at
the zenith loando was a place of great opu
lence ae evidenced in the numerous large
and palace like residences the grand and
magnificent churches convents and nunneries
the latter with few exceptions being in a
state of ruin or decay the jesuits early
turned their attention to angola as a field for
their operations and their fortunes seemed to
wax and wane with the slave trade while
this prospered they flourished and the mon
uments of their zeal and energy are numerous
and striking but their zeal and energy have
outstripped the decadence of the trafficthe
fraternity is now unrepresented by a living
mantheir splendid temples are now the
habitations only for the moles and the bats
or the workshops for convicts guilty of the
foulest crimes
df  ihe charleston mercury has become
convinced of an important thruth speak
ing of the fugitive slave law it says
at to the practicability of putting into
operation any of the feature of the bill we
do not think that northern fellings and pre
judices will admit of it
young men read this
a day or two since we learned from
a gentleman of new york city a few
facts relative to mr bullard who is
now exhibiting his panorama of
broadway in this city which at the
time they were related very much in
terested us and we have no doubt they
will interest all who have struggled
and are now struggling with poverty
mr bullard is a native of the town of
howard steuben co n y his
father was a farmer and young bullard
remained at home and worked on the
farm until he was fourteen years of
age at which time the father declared
that he was too lazy to make a
farmer when he ought as the father
thought to be at work on the farm he
out ot shingles the por
traus of every boy and girl in the
neighborhood the father not being
able to control the bent of the boys
mind put him with augustus a olm
stead esq of his native town to
learn the trade of sign painting he
remained with mr olmstead seven
years till he became  years of age
after completing his trade with mr
olmstead he painted some  portraits
of different individuals living in how
ard for painting these portraits he
received some  with this amount
of money he started for new york
city
he had expected to find the na
tional academy of design open on
exhibition and to see the paintings
and become acquainted with the ar
tists and to find if possiblo some one
to instruct him in his favorite art he
arrived there and found the exhibition
closed which very much disappointed
him he roved round the great city a
day or two and was unable to find an
artist to instruct or encourage him
and his purse becoming very low he
went to hartlord connecticut in the
vicinity ot which place be had friends
he remained in hartford one year re
ceiving instruction in his art from an
artist by the name of hewins after
leaving mr hewins he went into the
country from hartford and painted
portraits and realized money enough
to pay the debts he had contracted in
hartford for board ac during the
year he was in hartford such was his
extreme poverty that he attended
church but six times because he had
not clothes to wear that were suitable
after meeting with various reverses of
fortune he returned to howard in
 and was married to miss ange
line a olmsted a daughter of the
gentleman of whom he had learned the
trade of a sign painter from 
to  he was in various parts of the
union engaged in painting portraits
from  to  he was a resident
of new york city and at work at his
art receiving instruction and continu
ally improving till now ha is at least
a promising artist
in  he conceived the idea of
painting his great painting the pano
rama of broadway and found a noble
hearted englishman george docl
who furnished the means to go on with
the painting mr bullard and from
three to seven men were at work on
this great work four years mr doel
promptly paid the bills as they became
duein all fifteen thousand dollars
the painting was completed on the
first day day of november 
what a lesson here is for every
young man is there a young man in
our city who has felt the tears of pov
erty rolling down his cheeks who
when he has become fatigued with the
labors of the day sat down in his room
by the side of his desk and rested his
head upon his hand and there under
the lid of his desk were his board bills
and others too numerous to mention
unpaid and he has at those times felt
almost discouraged and said to himself
it is no use to try if we say there is
uch an one he will be encouraged by
reading this and glory in the success
of mr bullard is there not a good
deal of difference in mr bullards
feelings now when he is receiving hit
one end two hundred dollars per dayj
from pereons who go to look at his
panorama and when he was at hart
ford and could not attend church be
cause he had not elothes to wear that
were decent so it is in this world
god help those who help them
selves
we say to mr bullard as the con
verted heathen said to one of our mis
sionaries goon go on go on
since writing the above it occurs to
us that we some time since read the
life of mr bullard in the american
biographical sketch book of selfmade

the proper use of this
popes kfndifess
we have welcomed the antipapal
agitation in no narrow spirit and with
no sectarian bitterness but we trust
with the enlightened earnestness ot
thorough liberals of farseeing poli
ticians and progressive protestants
we have joined our humble voice to
this outburst of protestant feeling not
to embitter its expressionnot to in
flame its virulence but to ennoble and
uplift itto purify its current and ele
vate its objects our aversion to rome
is not the petty hatred which sect bears
against sect nor the small jealousy
which priest and prelate cherish
against priest and prelate it is derived
from far broader and deeper sources
than any party rancor or any sectarian
bitterness our warfare with rome is
not waged in behalf of a menaced
episcopacy or an outraged royal
supremacy it is carried on in the
name of sealed scripture and fettered
thought of intellect most grievously
insulted nnd coerced of conscience
most heavily laden of civil and reli
gious freedom most outrageously and
perpetually violatedin the name of
three million italians whom the papacy
grinds down under the lowest and most
debasing form of temporal bondage
and of millions and millions of souls
whome she keeps in the depths of
spiritual degradation we have hailed
i this manifestation of protestant feeling
in no extremity of alarm in no fury of
indignation but in all the fulness of
hope in all the earnestness of glowing
anticipation we have looked upon it
not as a refuge from danger not as a
burst of passion but as an instrument
of progress an opening into a fairer
future we would turn the aggression
on the pope to the detriment of the
papacy we would use this outburst ol
protestant feeling forthe advancement
of protestant principles we would
win from this encroachment of the
spiritual despot strength and nourish
ment for the freedom of the english
people and the freedom of all nations
we would have england the freer for
this display of foreign insolence we
would have her more protestant for
this onslaught upon her protestantism
the warfare that we recommend
that we ourselves would wage is the
only vigorous warfarethe only war
fare that can end in complete victory
it will not do to encounter so formida
ble an antagonist as romanism with
feeble resources it will not be possible
to overcome her with half our strength
the contest must not degenerate into
the conflict of rival episcopaeies and
opposing supremacies to be a suc
cessful war it must be a war of princi
ples we must endeavor to carry out
every principle which rome condemns
and summon into full activity every
power spiritual and temporal which
she struggles to keep down to assert
the queens supremacy in matters ec
clesiastical is not to put down the
popes to maintain the divinely ap
pointed authority of anglican prelates
is not to destroy the credit of romish
bishops to beat romanism back we
must push protestantism forward to
turn the popes aggression against
himself we must become aggressive
ourselves the true answer to this
pontifical presumption is a further de
velopment of the principles of the re
formation the pope in the plenti
tude of his ignorance and assurance
thought to make england wholly papal
in a few years we trust that his foolish
intervention will have the very opposite
effect of rendering her protestantism
still more protestant there lingers
i far too much of popery about english
protestantism english protestants
have been much too fond of dealing in
romish devices they have been afraid
of their own principles and trembled
at their own strength they have re
fused thoroughly to search the scrip
tures fully to employ their intellect to
use their whole freedom and to speak
all their thoughts and yet rome can
be only successfully encountered by this
thorough searching of the scriptures
and this entire exercise of the intellect
this complete assertion of lreedom
this unreserved utterance of the truth
if the church of england would
fairly fight the fight with her adversary
of rome and finally come off con
queror let her renounce the prnciples
and forsake the practices of her rival
there is no practice more thoroughly
and genuinely romish than that of res
training and corrupting the intellect by
religious testsby interposing sub
scriptions to creedis and articles be
tween learning and its rewards we
would earnestly recommend the
church ot england to put away from
herself this papal stainto answer the
popes bull by making this advance in
true and vital protestantism to open
the english universities would indeed
be a new and glorious manifestation
of english protestantism to make
admission to the universities independ
ent on subscriptionto remove the
barriers of articles and creeds from
the path of able aspiring but coa
sciencious youthto make the precious
privilege of a rich and various culture
unconditional on the sacrifice of truth
and the impairing of the soulto leave
off defrauding intellect and learning ol
their proper career and national re
wards because they happen to be
joined with honesty and tenderness of
conscienceto do this would indeed be
magnificently to improve the present
opportunityto turn the popes ag
gression to the vindication and exten
sion of the great principles of protest
antismand greatly to advance the
cause of spiritual freedom
such s a sample of the antipapal
tactics that we would recommend to
the anglican church and to british
protestant in general not to revile j
popery ut to combat itfirst by re
nouncing every lingering vestige ot it
in themselves and then arguing against
it in its great external avowed develop
mentnot to assail it by statutes and
persecute it by penal enactments but
to fight against it by trusting to tbeir
own strength and rally carry out tbeir
own protestantism the opening of
the universities is only one of the
various suggestions which we have to
offer for the improvement of this grand
opportur y and for the purifying en
i nobling extending and strengthening
jof english protestantism burming

the subject is a personification of
american slavery with particular ref
erence to the fugitive slave bill the
size of the wood cut is about  by 
inches slavery ia represented by a
tyrant seated on his throne with a
whip and fetter in his right hand
brandished over his head his head
rests on his left hand the elbow being
placed on a bible which is nearly hid
by a scroll containing the words fu
gitive slave bill underneath is a
circle of human skulls emblematical
of the crushing and direful influence of
slavery
under the throne is the head of an
allegorical wild beast over which are
the words sacred to slavery and
underneath the word law on the
left beneath the skulls are three slave
men one black one mulatto and the
other nearly white with a most abject
and forlorn expression farther to
the left is the figure at full length of a
late senator who is in the attitude of
speaking with a scroll m his left hand
in which is written i propose to sup
port that bill to the fullest
extent to the fullest extent the
skulls are looking him very significant
ly in the face behind the senator
stands a figure representing liberty in
advanced years with a desponding ex
pression bending and holding in his
right hand a crown on which is written
freedom and in his left a staff with
the cap of liberty trailing in the dust
in the background on an eninence
directly opposite the senator a statue
f of the goddess of liberty is repre
sented as falling from a pedestal
on the other side is a minister not
of state but of a religion he dishonors
in sacredotal robes with one hand
puting out a libation to the enthroned
slavemonarch while with the ether he
is pointing to the union flag which
surmounted with the national eagle is
r floating at the head of a staff at the
side of the throne partly obscured
by the rising incense are seen two
pursuers on horseback preceded by
some half a dozen bloodhounps in
hot pursuit of a family of fugitives
the father with herculean strength
is battling with the dogs one of which
lies dead at his feet another being held
at bay while a dagger is plunged into

this picture will be a permanent

ing it must be recollected that the
majority of mankind take much greater
interest in a general question than in a
particular measure but it must also be
acknowledged that as the apostle of
peace and the advocate of arbitration
he took more pains and put forth niore
strength than as the panegyrist of free

ation of the freehold movement was
practical earnest and persuasive but
his rebuke of past aggression and
atrocities on the part of england and
his indignant anticipation of similar
misdeeds on the part of our enlightened
government was still more earnest ap
proached much nearer to eloquence
and made a still more absolute conquest
of the hearts of the audience we will
not at present dwell upon his denounc
ing of a possible war with china for
the purpose of creating a trade we
will for a moment contemplate the
much nearer danger and stronger pro
bability of an immediate intervention
in schleswigholstein against the hoi
tteiners and in behalf of denraarkof
the speedy employment of the naval
strength of england in conjunction
with the armies of the continental
tyrants to pull down german nationali
ty and german freedom in the duchies
a monstrous abuse of the strength of
mighty england a hideous belying of
the feeliogs and trampling on the
sympathies of liberal england which
i mr cobden most powerfully rebuked
i and which professor worms denounced
with all the earnestness and enthusiasm
lof a devoted german patriot and all
the ease fluency and eloquence of an
accomplished english orator
most admirably did the men of bur
mingham express the feelings of the
english people in the enthusiastic re
ception which they bestowed on the
patriotic professor the intense sympa
thy which they manifested for the
righteous cause of schleswigholstein
german rights and european freedom
and the determination which they
evinced that the english name should
not be degraded english sympathies
belied and english power abused to
the detriment ot their german kinsmen
and fellowfreemen the queens
ministers may have signed a protocol
binding them to support the claims of
denmark and crush the liberties of the
schleswigholsteineiv who cordially
received our admirable townsman
mr sturge and his high hearted co
adjutors and consented to abide by
the decision of impartial private arbi
trators the ministers may have
signed such an agreement but we are
strangely mistaken if the english peo

us this shame no english treasure
shall be wasted in the cause of den

for the hours run around with two pair
of hands when you are enjoying your
self and you may have to sleep in a
damp bed in an unsavory village inn
because you did not start five minutes
earlier to catch the last train be de
termined to enjoy yourself anti that
being first half of the enjoyment
gained it is wonderful how quickly
the other half will follow it puncht
holidaya
american hurry
a writer in the age thus discourses
very sensibly and to the point
look at the theatrethe people
come rushing in the middle of a piece
and before the curtain begins to fail
or the tag to be spoken or the moral
explained up start a hundred people
in a tremendous hurry to get out as
if their very lives depended upon be
ing somewhere else within two minutes
and a half how many fine effects in
a playhow many chef d aeuvres in a
concert have we seen utterly destroyed
by this illmannered and indecent haste
cross a ferry and look before the
boat arrives two thirds of the passen
gers are crowded at the head of the
boat ready to jump ashore risking
life and limb to save ten seconds of
timea child is knocked overboard
a boys foot mashed or a young man in
youths first bloom crippled for life
what mailer that man now walking
leisurejy up the street get ashore
nearly half a minute earlier than he
would have done had he not run the
samejrisk and caused perhaps the
accident
ggjnto an omnibus and with one
lbot oft the step and the other inside
the driver pulls the door to whips up
thehorses and you are pitched head
first ipto a stout old gentlemans dia
phragm or settled down by the stern
into a sentimental young ladys lap
ride in a harlaem caryou beckon
to the driver to stop but no he is in a
hurry too and you have to run after
the lumbering vehicle and clamber up
while it goes along you ring the
bell when you wish to get out and if
you are patient the car will stop in
timejbut before you get your foot off
the platform it is in motion and you
are lucky if you are not landed hori
zontally in the mud
now what in the name of wonder
is the cause of all thisdo we gain any
thing no do we onjoy anything
in this everlasting rush no do we
live longer or die more happily no
goon times at the south the
mobile avertiaer says the people of
the south were never more prosperous
since the country was settled tbao
now every kind of property sells
readily and at fair prices while cotton
is selling at  cents and negroc are
