dear sir vou will have heard
before this reaches you of father
mathew decision to be silent while in
tht country on the subject of slavery
the abolitionists have learned it with
deep regret being all of us with
hardly an exception teetotalers
utaly acquainted with and deeply in
terested in father mathews labors
grateful for the noble protest he sent
here against slavery in  and tor
the welcome be has given to american
abolitionists abroadaccustomed our
elves to give a fair proportion of our
efforts to the temperance cause
hoped for a cordial sympathy from the
great teetotaller
we did not expect and you will oh
serve we did not ask father mathew j
to take any prominent part or give
any great amount of time to the anti
lavery enterprise we recognized i
with the rest of the world the peculiar
sphere which providence seems to have
marked out for him and approved as
wll as admired his profound devo
ton to hisone idea
but no one much leas no one upon
whom the eyes of millions are fixed
can be ao exclusively a teetotaller or
anything else that his opinions on oth
er points may not be known and his
influence counted on all ve asked of
father mathew was that he would em
brace every suitable opportunity to
bear a clear and unequivocal testimo
ny both in public and private against
the enslavement of any portion of the
human family and again with noi
wish or design to divert him from his
great mission we trusted that he would
occasionally find an opportunity to ad
monish his countrymen to be true to
liberty
must a traveller do nothing but flat
ter if he may be excused from this
then surely the man who onjanding
had alluded in every speech in glow
ing terms to the free institutions of
the soil on which he trodand pro
mtsed to carry back a faithful picture
of the workings of our admirable
moral social industrial and education
al establishmentswho could dis
cuss with his american admirers his
relations with the british government
is a pensioner su c might we
thought find time in some of bis thou
sand speeches for now and then a
word worthy of a christian man as to
those bloody laws which doom every
sixth person in this land to worse than
deathon that sin against god and
rnan of whose horror degrada
tion oppression and withering
curse had spoken to the irish
here eloquently in 
we ventured it is tiue to ask his
presence if he had tune to spare at a
celebration of the great british act of
emancipation in  deeming that to
be an occasion of such universal in
terest that a foreigner and especially
an irishman might share in it
father mathew replies thut he shall
uol commit himself on this subject
while in america perhaps we ought
to have expected as much from one
who years ago declared that he
would rather the temperance cause
were lost than that the catholic order
should be injured but we hoped
better things ono thing we must
praisethe prudent fathers frank
ness he vu no juamt then he
lairly confesses that m his opinion no
one however worldwide his repute
cao bt of use in america unless he
the north star
i
i consent to be gagged on the subject ot
slavery and be contentedly puts tfu
gag on a poor compliment to be
sure to the land he visits to saj
your freedom is so nominal that no
man however fenced about by good
deeds and the worlds love can be al
i lowed to speak his miod but suejb
is father mathews declaration in
i substance and many of our papers en
dorse and applaud hits
perhaps you will say i judge him
too harshlythat he tees the country
divided into two parties on this ques
tion and chooses to side with neither
remember then that the
iwuuuage worse than murder
according to coleridgethe sum gl
all villanies according to wesley thit
ou its side are many millions against
it a few thousands a christian sword
would leap from its scabbard in such a
cause and lips which god had touch
ed could not forbear speaking on
slavery said father mathew himself
in  no one can be neutral he
who is not against it is for it this
excuse therefore dees not avail
i our opponents have sometimes
charged us you will remember with
j exaggerating the influence of the slave
system and the servile corruption of
public opinion on the subject judge
i now which party is right father
mathew a worlds wonder almost
sainted in the love of his contempora
ries must keep silence on this dreaded
subject if he would retain his influ
ence how heavy then do you judge
j the burden must rest on more coinrnun
men if he cannot be allowed to
speak who can like the maiden in
spenser the philanthropy of his mis
sion had tamed into admiring silence
religious bigotry national antipathy
and the bickerings of party there was
one dragon whom no life of saintlike
devotion could appease and father
mathew vails his crest to the slave
power of america in order to retain
his influence
is is  think a fatal mistake he
who in this way seeks to save his in
fluence shall lose it americans knew
father mathew to be an antislavery
man and expected him to be himself
everywhere they may profit by the
treason but as in ail other cases will
despise the traitor
what has he gained he has lost
the confidence of reformers every
northern doughface sees the great
teetotaller belittled to his own level
is that a gain would a frank ex
pression of his opinion on this subject
occasionally oil wo ttjked liaro
injured him with the irish of course
he could never expect to have much
influence with slaveholders themselves
indeed few native born americans
dream of taking the pledge at his
hands and a slaveholding teetotaller
finds no true description but the trite
one in butlercompounding
f or sins he it inclined to
by damiing ihoae lie lias ro mind to
an antislavery teetotal saint promis
ing silence on slavery that he may
win such how far is he from the king
dom of the same condemnation what
then has he gained a noisy reception
wherever he goes from wine drinkers
civic feasts from the old foes of the
temperance causethe hurras of the
newspapers and thus he sells
the wide scope of his large honors
for so much trash as may be graped thus
true this glitter has its effect upon
the ignorant class he addresses but to
injure the slave with one hand as much
as he helps the irish laborer with the
other is but a poor claim to a worlds
gratitude it was the boast of ocon
nell that he would never set foot on
american soil while it was polluted
with slavery father mathew not only
visits us but consents to go padlock
ed that he may be feted
the reverend gentleman underrates
both his own importance and the ser
vile worship we gladly pay to rank
when lord morpeth was in south
carolina he commented freely on
slavery his tuftloving hearers re
membering the blood of all the how
ards ate their leeks in silence had
father mathew been true to his own
conscience and fame we should have
recognized him as noble by the right of
an earlier creation and submitted still
more respectfully to his rebuke
you will observe also that he has
gone too far in his submission even for
our latitude all the papers which
criticise this matter presume that the
interview must be misrepresented no
attempt however worthy of notice
has been made to impeach the accura
cy of mr larrisons account and the
recent interview of mr rogers with
 father mathew fully confirms it but
you will observe that taking it for ac
curate even our papera cannot defend
it if so why hasten to presume that
he did not say what he is stated to have
said the reverend father has got
so humbly on hts knees before the
slave power that even our editors who
are native here and to the manor
born cannot get low enough to be
level with him
each man chooses according to his
taste nd abilities the particular sphere
to which he will devote himself but
above and beyond that choice we owe
each our countenance the ex
pression ol our opinion and testimony
whenever that expression will relieve
suffering or correct wrong how else
i shall proud majorities be stayd ire
land looks for aid to the public opinion
of christendom given her incidentally
by those immersed in their own cares
and struggles that is the fulcrum on
which she rests her efforts against the
cruel indifference of the british peo
ple slavery is in the same condition
laws and oceans interposed cannot
break the brotherhood of the race
and father mathew owes the eure this
right is of no sextrtth is of no colorod is the father of us all ant all we are brethren

silence from such a visitor is most sig
mficant tuppori and no purpose how
ever holy can justify a visit to ou

yve arc aware that the eyes of th
world are fixed on father mathew am
that whosoever censures his course
has the world fur v

give comfort to the foes of truth
throw discredit on the slaves friend
and lull into false security the half
awaking conscience of the oppressor
a man gathering into his hand more
influence than any other of the age can
boast and cowering before a guilty
people instead of rebuking them in
the majesty of his godgiven power
we deny the right of any man es
pecially one of commanding influence
to be silent on one question that he
may enhance his weight on others
we do not allow a foreign birth to ab
solve any one whose position gives
him influence here from speaking in
behalt of the american slave if there
be anything in the character of the
temperance cause to break down na
tional distinctions and allow interna
tional influence there is tenfold as
much in the antislavery agitation

rudent father would feel at liberty to

made the selling of his own children

apostolic successor of peter and paul
s disarmed and cries out we ought
o obey man rather than god no
aw can sanction slavery said ocon
lell what murder is on the pirate
deck that precisely is slavery on the
american soil every lover of justice
every christian is free and is bound
to denounce it a christian minister
hailing a pirate ship and promising to
say nothing against their occupation if
they would let him offer them the
pledge would be a fit type of a teeto
taller bound to silence on slavery to
advance teetotalism we consider
free speech no favor granted us by
man but a right the gilt of god and
abjure the policy of yielding any por
tion of it to save the rest
we hold the truth which god shows
us as no play thing or counter with
which to traffic but to ne uttered all
of it indue time and especially before
those whom it concerns
we hold it to be the first mark of
goodness and the highest privilege of
greatness to speak what you think
and especially in times when words are
deeds and mighty to work wonders
painful indeed would it he to a sincere
abolitionist if god condemned him to
go up and down this land drying up the
sources of intemperance and forbade
him full of powers as he was to lift
his little finger for the relief of that
hideous bondage he was daily doomed
to witness oil all these points at issue
between ourselves and father mathew
we shall cheerfully abide the verdict
of the world and posterity
according to father mathew while
ireland is starving all the world not
british born must keep silence on tho
cruel mistakes of government which
have ruined her and any great briton
may be innocently still if so doing
he can husband his influence for the
peace or the antistate church cause
was it indeed so when he saw the iron
entering the souls of hs countrymen
did he nut summon the world to her
rescue the american slave a hun
gered with none to give him bread
athirst with none to give him drink
sick and in prison with none to visit
hi n asks of the great irishman the
bread of his testimony asks that he will
not allow his potent name to be added
to the list of those who justify silence
in any circumstances ot such a sin
father mathew thanks us ameri
cans that we have given the world the
doctrine of total abstinence he would
fitly return the favor by holding to oui
lips the biller cup of antislavery
god says to this nation let ny peo
ple go but father mathew is so very
proper a ptiest that gods message
must be countersigned by the national
authorities before he will consent to
deliver itunless indeedit be to a
people like the irish who do not hold
slaves and will not feel offended
father mathew is so enthusiastic a
teetotaler meanwhile that a man may
sell his own children at auction un
earned if ha will but do it aober fa
ther mathew is such a protestant suen
a stickler for the right of private judg
ment on this question that he can see
nothing specific in the scriptures

this article is written in view of tit
sentiments of the extract of a speech ot
that noble champion of liberty j r
giddirgs published in the star no 
referring to the decision o r the sup
preme court on the obligation to de
liver up the fugitive slave he says
these slaveholding judges do not
pretend that the government or the
people of the free states are bound to
encourage or sustain slavery on the
contrary they solemnly declare that
our whole duty is to abstain from se
creting defending or rescuing the
slave these obligations wc observe to
the very letter they may have been
violated by individuals but  have nev
er known an instance of the kind 
have heard and read of cases where
citizens of my own state have been
convicted of violating these stipula
tions and have suffered the legal pen
alties attached to such violation but
no such case has ever come under my
observation nor have  heard of such
an instance in northern ohio in
another place he says we will lend
him the slave all the aid in our pow
er without violating the constitutions or
laws of the land
if these quotations mean anything
and most certainty such a man as
giddiugs does not speak to mean noth
ing they mean that he would not a
sist my midnight petitioner to the extern
i of secreting him for he says the ob
ligatioa to abstain from secreting fee
we keep to the very letter aud s
vre intonates do the people of nortberc
 ohio but he says that these ohic
 northmen regard the slave pursuer as
a moral pestilencea legalized pirate
but pirate though he be they will
not at least giddings will not bless ins
i victims with secrecy from him would
i he secrete a tender harmless crafi
i from an algerine corsairr
he jgivc shelter to th  c t
i irom a thunderstorm of death ould
he have secreted a babe at bethlehem
his own lor instance from the infant
cutthroat herod why then not se
j crete the terror stricken innocent refu
gee against the moral pestilence the
legalized pirate that pursues him
but will giddings not do it does he
mean all that lie says and does he
mean that the thousands who take him
for their antislavery oracle shall
feel themselves under no obligation to
secrete the refugee or at least under
a counter obligation so much sironger
j that they would leave him to perish
rather than to hide him it is well
known that the aid of secrecy often
does more to defend the slaves retreat
than any thing else is this most nrc
i essary atd to be withheld we raise
no constitutional question here we
j know many differ from giddings on its
j obligations but the masses think with
him and must it be believed that
from nil these no mercy shall come
for the refugee when his pursuers are
at hand and he needs a hiding place
o tell it not in gath tell it not in al
giers tell it not in the vatican tell it
not to a turk tell it not where mercy
orhumanity or justice live tell it not
to the enlightened friends of mercy lest
i they weep tell it not to her enemies
lest they rejoice
but no northern ohio will secrete
the slave and j r giddings will but
we fear there arc some who would have
done it before reading giddingss
speech who will not afterward his
theory of the constitution is doubtless a
consistent one hut it is so inconsistent
 with humanity christianity and jus
tice that it will do no more to restrain
the expansion of such a heart as we
think he has than the parchment upon
which it is written if we thought it
wouldue would direct the slave to shun
him as a moral pestilence and land pi
rate because in that case for the
refugee to fall under his auspices when
salvation depends on secrecy would be

abolition of slavery in the
portuguese colonies
we arc gratified to learn that there
is now a fair prospect that a law will
soon he passed in portugal for the abo
j lition of slavery in all the colonies of
that country a hill for that purpose
was read in the chamber of peers ot
lisbon on the of may last and
i the committee on colonial affairs to
whom it was then referred made their
report on the th of june approving
the bill and recommending its adoption
by the chamber the bill provides
i that the children of slaves born
after the date of the law shall he free
from the moment of their birth
j that all slaves who enter any ter
ritory or ship of portugal after the
date of the law from whatever motive
shall he considered free from the mo
ment that they enter such territory or
ship
this clause is thus qualified in
those countries where slavery is sanc
tioned by law if slaves go on board a
portuguese ship while in any port of
 such country that they are of course
amenable to the laws of that country
while the ship is in port but if they be
carried out of the port they shall be
free from the moment the vessel is
clear of the port the persons who
decoy them or tako them away how
ever are to he held responsible for
their value slaves accompanying the
embassies which african potentates
send to the governors of potuguese
colonies may be held as slaves while
the embassy is in the country but will
he set free if they remain after theem
bassy has left the portuguese territory
 the transportation of slaves from
one portuguese port to another oi
from a portuguese port to a foreign
country is strictly prohibited
 all slaves now belonging to the
state are declared to be immediately
free on the publication of the law and
all who may hereafter become its prop
erty are at the moment they become
j so declared free
 every person throughout the
portuguese empire is to be considered
a freeman unless he can be legally
i proved to be a slave
ti in each portuguese ultramarine
colony there shall be kept books for
the registry of the slaves and it shall
be the duty of every slaveholder to see
that the names of his slaves are enter
ed with the descriptions necessary for
their identification no person who is
not registered can be held as a slave
 if a slaveholder shall cause to be
registered as a slave the name of a
person legally entitled to liberty he
shall forfeit ail his slaves who are to
he immediately declared tree and he
himself is to suffer the penalty usually
imposed on the kidnapper
slaveholders are also required to re
port every half year any alterations
which may have occurred in relation
to their registered slaves and if they
omit to make this report for three suc
cessive halfyears their slaves are all
to be forfeited and declared free
 the slave or any of hie friends

from the law of god but the divine law is
not one of warit is peaceapplause
men have commenced in conflict as the cre
ation did in chaosbravo whence do
they proceed from warsthat is evident
but whither do they go  to peacethat is
equally evident when you enunciate those
sublime truths it is quite simple that your as
sertion should be met by the negative
by incredulity it is easy to understand that
faith is encountered by incredulity it is evi
dent that at this period of trouble and dissen
sion the idea of universal peace must surprise
and shock almost like something impossible
and only ideal it is quite clear that all will
talk of utopias but for me who am but an
obscure laborer in this great work of the th
century  accept this resistance without be

that you can turn aside your head and shut
your eyes at if in bewildermeut when in the

great applause
and here gentlemen when i contemplate
this vat amount of efforts and of events all of
them marked by the finger of god when i
regard this sublime object the wellbeing of
mankindpeacewhen i reflect on all that
providence has done in favor of it and human
policy against it a sad and bitter thought
comes to my mind it results from a com
parison of statistical accounts that the nations
of europe expend each year for the mainten
ance of armies a sum amounting to  mil
lions of francs and which by adding the
expense of maintaining establishments of war
amounts to  millions add to this the
lost produce of the days of work for more
than  of menmen the healthiest
the most vigorous the youngest the chosen
of our populationa produce which you will
not estimate at less than  millions and
vuu mm ot convince uuu uie suniuing ar
mies of europe cost annually more than 
millions gentlemen peace has now lasted
thirtytwo years and yet in thirtytwo years
i the enormous sum of  millions has
i been expended during that peace on account
of warapplause suppose that the peo
ple of europe in place of mistrusting each
other entertaining jealousy of each other
hating each other had become last friends
suppose they said that before they were
frenchor german they were men and that
if nations form countries human kind forms a
laraily and that enormous sum of 
millions so madly and so vainly spent in con
sequence of such mistrust let it be spent in
acts of mutual confidencethese 
millions that have been lavished on haired let
them be bestowed on love let them be
given to peace instead of warapplause
give them to labor to intelligence to indus
try to commerce to navigation to agricul
ture to science to art and then draw your
conclusions if lor the last thirtytwo years
j this enormous sum had been expended in this
manner america in the meantime aiding eu
rope know you what would have happened 
the lace of the world would have been
changed isthmuses would be cut through
railroads would cover the two continents
the merchantnavy of the globe would have in
creased a hundredfold there would be no
j where barren plains nor moors nor marshes
j cities would now be found where there are
only deserts ports would be sunk where
j there are now only rocks asia would be
j rescued to civilization africa would be res
i cued to man abundance would gush forth on
every side from every vein of the earth at
the touch of man like the living stieam from
the rock beneath the rod of moses misery
j would be no longer found and with misery
what do you think would disappear  revo
lutionsgreat applause yes the face of
the world would be changed in place of
mutually destroying each other men would
pacifically extend themselves over the earth
in place of conspiring for revolution men
would combine to establish colonies in
place of introducing barbarism into civiliza
 tion civilization would replace barbarism
great applause you see gentlemen in
i what a state of blindness war has placed na
tions and rulers if the  millions giv
en for the last thirtytwo years by europe to
j the war which was not waged had been given
to the peace w hich existed wc positively de
clare that nothing of what is now passing in
europe would have occurred the continent
in place of being a battle field would have
become an universal workshop and in place
l of this sad and terrible spectacle of piedmont
i prostrated of the eternal city givei up to the
miserable oscillations of human policy of
venice and noble hungary struggling heroi
cally france uneasy poor and sombre mis

in place  say of so bad a spectacle we
i should have betore our eyes hope joy be

fact is worthy of meditation that revolutions

imaginary danger misery which was the
only real danger has by these very means

will be submitted to the friends of universa
peace assembled in congress at pari on th
nd d th and th of augut

 as peace alone can secure the mora
j and material interests of nations it is the dut
of all governments to submit to arbitration al
 differences that arise between them and ti
respect the decisions of the arbitrators whon
they may choose
 it is of the highest importance to cal
the attention of governments to the necesai
ty of entering by a general and simuitaneou
i measure upon a system of disarmament fo
i the purpose of reducing tbe national expendi
ture and of removing at the same time a per
manent cause of disquietude and irritatioi
from among the nations
 the congress recommends all th
friends of peace to prepare public opinion ii
their respective countties for the formation o
a congress of nations whose sole object i
should be to frame a code of internationa
laws on just principles and to constitute i
supreme court to which should besubmittei
j all questions relating to the reciprocal right
and duties of nations
 the congress condemns all loans an
taxes intended for the prosecution of ware o
ambition and conquest
 the congress recommends its mem
bers to endeavor to eradicate from the mind
of all in their respective countries both b
means of a better education of youth and b
other practical methods those political preju
dices and hereditary hatreds which have
i often been the cause of disastrous ware
 the congress addresses the same invi
tation to all ministers of religion whose sa
cred mission it is to encourage feelings o
goodwill among men as well as to the vari
ous organs of the press which exercise
powerlul an influence over the progress o
civilisation
 the congress earnestly hope for th
 improvement of the means of internationa
i communication for the extension of posta
reform for the universal adoption of the sam
standard of weights measures and coinage
and for tbe multiplication of peace societies
which shall keep up a correspondence wit
each other
 the congress decides that the com
mittee be instructed to draw up an address ti
all nations embodying the resolutions of thi
congress and that this address shall be pre

leter from the editor
i am now in oswego a handsome young
city on the banks of lake ontario and at
the mouth f the river from which it derives
its name is finely located for trade and
manufacturing purposes the w hole place
wears an ictive business like appearance
there is a plank road all tha w ay from here
to rome a distance of sixty miles and a
railroad aid canal to syracuse these
great thoroughfares give oswego great
and it will doubtless one day be
come a laige and influential city the pop
ulation of the place is now twelve thousand
and from present indication of prosperity it
it will dotble that number in the space of ten
years like most of the young cities of the
west itis largely stocked with newspapers of
which there are fourone daily and three
weeklies churches and ministers abound
here and if the people are not what they
ought to be it results from no lack of these
there appears to be as much competition
among the ministers as among the mill own
ers of the place every one wants to bring
grift to his own mill such is life method
ists baptists presbyteriansand roman catho
lics are all struggling for the mastery in sav
ing souls of men but neither presbyterians
baptists methodists nor roman catholics seem
to have any special care for the bodies of
men the soul is all important with them
they are anxious  save men iroiu nut ii c
after but care nothing about saving men from
hell here on the earth among these soul
loving christians the slave stands no chance
the antislavery advocate is refused admis
sion into the churches and the ministers
elders and deacons like the priests and
levitts of old pass by on the other side and
as in the days of christ it is only the common
people who hear the truth gladly when
my friends in this place heard of my intention
to visit them they made an effort  obtain the
use of one of these houses of worship for me
to lecture in but it was refused on the ground
that i would speak against the churches my
meetings here have been held in the market
hall and despite of the proslavery influence
of the church and the clergy i have had
crowded meetings and have been greatly
cheered by the kind and respectful manner
with which ray addresses have been received
by the public the meeting last evening
was thronged many were cpmpelled to stand
during the evening remaining till the last
although may lecture occupied three hours
at the close of the meeting six subscribers
were btained to the north star and sixteen
copies of ray narrative were sold  am in
formed that many present heard the snbject
of slavery discussed on this occasion for the
first time
soon after my arrival hero on thuisday
henry clay passed through on his return
trip westward i caught a glimpse of him
as he passed he sat in a barouche drawn
by two black horses covered with white nets
and was followed by an admiring crowd
there was no black servant by his side his
attitude in the carriage was erect and proud
disputing the sway of old king time his
face was red but wrinkled and careworn
i did not follow him i found myself facing
the crowd as who were all rushing the
other way all anxious to touch
the hem of the slaveholders garment and to
obtain a smile from the great compromiser
poor man what will ail this applause and
adulation avail him at the bar of god t of
what consequttoce will it be to him when the
tears of sundered families and the scarred
hacks and broken hearts of his plundered
victims shall confront him at the judgment
seat  as i looked upon him i felt differently
from what i expected i should do on seeing a
man who had done so much to injare my poor
despised people my emotions were those of
deep sorrow that one so gifted now on the
verge of another world should have made so
bad use of his talents but the time is past
the hour is gone the sand has nearly run out
lamentation is vain he with all others like
him are in the hands of a power beyond and
above him and eternal justice must and will
be vindicated
there are in this city about one hundred
colored persons
my visit baa afforded me a good opportuni
ty of meeting with my suffering people as
a mark of their esteem and regard they
made a collation at the house of mr gray
where ail were invited to meet me and have a
friendly interview they manifested much
interest in the subject of the proposed ve
tional league and i have do doubt that a
branch of the league will be formed in this

improvement are messrs grsy grant and

the precise object of the sons of temperance
we hate supposed it to be the benevolent ooe
of promoting temperance in the community
without inquiring whether those whom it ben
efitted were white or blacktail or short
we have the small consolation of knowing
now as we did not before know that we have
been considerably mistaken this may be
one object but it certainly is not the only aim
of these secret societies there is another
purpose which they also answer that is
the building up of caste and prejudice here
at least it might have been expected where
the ostensible object is a purely benevolent
i one and no theological mist can possibly be
brought to hear upon it the colored man
would be admitted on equal terms is not
drunkenness as immoral in a colored as it is
in a wmiv t nt disgusting l la
it not to himself fraught with as ruinous con
sequences why then shut him out from
the muchtalked of benefjta said to be afforded
by these societies of mutual counsel en
couragement and countenance  it is a fact
and we are grieved to be compelled to the
conclusion that the assertion is most true that
sons of temperance lodges are the very
spawn of slavery after this we shall not
be surprised to find that the hellish spirit of
american hate towards the colored man
would if possible shut him out from heaven
itself and condemn him to everlasting perdi
tion even the perdition of the orthodox
rather than that he should share an eternity
of happiness in company with white men
organized societies political scientific and
religious in this land do all they decently
can to effect this object the doors of all are
as religiously barred against him as if he bore
about with him an infectious leprosy he
i cannot with few exceptions as an equal
man enter the door of any of our large
churches but must be stowed away like so
much lumber in some fardistant loft in the
ceiling he cannot at all either as equal or
unequal become a member of a literary so
ciety of white persons and there is now pre
sented an illustration of the allpervading
spirit of proscription in temperance lodges
no matter what may be the color of their skin
whether black or white or brownwe main
tain that men who can rise superior to such
degrading and demoralizing treatment have
in their composition a large proportion of the
material of which heroes are made there
are few white men who could go through this
ordeal and come out unscathed the treat
ment of the free colored people in the north
ern states is only equalled in disgraceful and
disgusting atrocity by the odious slave system
of the south the one is the natural off
spring of the other it may be useful to re
mind northern men that they have something
more to do than to shout no more slave
oiatoo owutciliiiig more oven than to nhout
no more slavery after both of these
objects are secured they have a task to ac
complish nearer home they have to take
the spirit of slavery out of their own hearts
and learn to acknowledge really not in
words only but in deed and in practice that
the colored man is a man all the silly ha
berdash that can bo strung together about
mans equality is jnst so much idle wind un
i til they accomplish this it will then mean
something until thennothing
we do not intend from these remarks to
be understood to favor the destruction of all
order in society far from it we know
full well that so long as there are intelligent
and uninformed men in societyso long as
there are educated and illiterate menso long
as there are men of low and men of refined
tastesso long as there are sensuous men and
men of high intellect and morality there must
be orders in society these very differences
of mental progress of themselves without
any of the supeiadded circumstances of
wealth make these orders the sensuous
man though he inay have the wealth of
croesus is not at home in the company of the
refined and intellectual his proper place is
amongst the low loafers whose tastes and
inclinations are similar to his own what we
desire and what all men desire who are
really actuated by the true spirit of democ
racy is that those orders in society should be
abolished not by mixing up uncongenial
elements but by elevating the brutal ignor
ant and sensuous to the level of the re
fined educated and virtuous one means of
doing this is to put within the reach of all
the means ot moral and intellectual improve
ment if the colored man is a little more de
ficient than his white neighbor that seems to
us to ho only an additional reason why lus
requirements should be attended to with more
carefulness and assiduity and he of all others
should be invited and encouraged to constant
and persevering effort after self improvement
the very reverse of this is the case he is as
far a possible shut out of the schools and then
abused for his ignorance he is neglected
and allowed to grow up destitute of all moral
training and taunted with his vice the first
wrong is made the excuse for the second and
both of them clearly lie at the doors of the
respectable and the professedly religious in
this land a change must be effected here
before any great improvement can take place
in the organization of society will our so
cial reformers take this matter into their seri
ous consideration this is oue of the ele
ments in social life which they are too apt to
lose sight of
we have been led to reflect on this subject
by reading in a recent number of the impar
tial citizen the correspondence between rev
s r ward and mr pinkerton of dundee
m reference to the proceedings of the sons
of temperance in mr wards own case
from this correspondence it is abundantly
evident that temperance lodges do not admit
colored men mr ward is well known to be
an intelligent and polished gentleman and
even if admitted his admission might not
have been considered a concluaive argument
in favor of the liberality and absence of pre
judice prevailing amongst tbe sons but as
if to make assurance doubly sure and seal
their disgrace beyond the possibility of mis
take he was first admitted and then expelled
the proceee c will give in hta own words
our division sent oat a committee to in i
quit whether it were contrary to rule to ad
mit black members the committee repotted
that a resolution again t the admission otj
blacks had been passed bv tbe grand division
upon this we dissolved and threw up our
charter for we were most of us believers in
the bible i
note particularly a few facts
 mi deputy land advised my expulsion
 special deputy cadv advised it in behalt
of the grand division
 the district deputy who initiated
me was censured and remojed tor ini
tiating me
 the grand division approved of and
endorsed this removal of the district dej
puty
capt cady paid the highest compliments to j
my character and reported distinctly to the
grand division that niy complexion was the
sole objection against me in reporting to the
grand division against the district deputy 
he uses the following words having actually
initiated a colored man
the grand division i repeat endorsed the
whole of thw report as you will see tn then
proceedings
one tact more the grand division will
not allow black men charfcts to form subor 
dinate divisions under them that was tried
in new york and they refused hie black
divisions are all independent of the g d
having received their charters from the calc
donia division a division of scotchmen
after this who will dare deny to the
loflgcs oi uic uu j xrt tj u ht
to arrogate to themselvea the title of benkvo
lent and philanthropic societies  the
passwoid it seems is not enough to admit a
man to their meetings they also require
that his skin should be of a particular color
w e have heard individual members of socie
ties assert that their lodge would admit
colored men they dare not do it their
charter would be taken from them and their
lodge dissolved if they persisted in treating
their colored brother as a man we pity those
respectable men who have got into the meshes
of such an inquisitorial and tyrannical despot
ism for ourseives we might be well content
to be forever excluded from such societies
jwe do not pietend to have any strong par
tiality for gewgaws ribbons and childs play
there are many however who attach a high
value to these things to such it must be
some deprivation to be shut out from them
the attempt to prove them mischievous or
even useless would perhaps cost more than
it comes to so we will not try to disturb the
complacency of those who have a high opinion
of temperance lodges but let them not pre
tend to be benevolent societies for the reclaim
ing of the drunkard and the debased while
they pass by that class who the sons them
selves being judges stand the most in need of
their aid and encouragement j i

alone the next day when he hears in

it is true but they advance in a body when

praises are forthwith heard in everv mouth
and he becomes the leader the great man ut

is the chief difficulty in the way of the onward
progress of political organization success
is the health of their existence the fear or
the anticipation of failme makes failure cer

his political power and political action very
speedily gets discouraged at the prospect of
using that power and bringing to beat that
action without their producing so far as he

among the free soilers some symptoms of s

it is only a few weeks since john vin

democratic party was jesolved sull later
at the rome convention he said that he
would henceforth hold the democrats as

i where is he now and that party of whom
nc is the leader the following resolution
 passed in the ratification mass meeting it
syracuse the other day supplies the answer
some of our too goodnatured and credulous
friends have been anxious to believe that prince
john and his associates would at least hold
fast by the wilmot proviso they did no
much but even those very limited
hopes have been disappointed
resolved t hat congress baa the constitu

into consideration the one in some measure
throws light upon the other as a matter of fact
it is abundantly evident that colored persona
are not citizens of the united states a chat

a person who is denied the right of citizen
ship in despite of all that massachusetts may
say to the contrary is not a citizen united
stales jaw authorizes slavery else how is it
that slaves are held and the perpetrators of
that wickedness are not brought to justice
t nited states law in one shape or another
either by allowing the separate states to make
unjust laws for themselves or by the direct
contract of confederation allows new york
and other states to deny to the colored man
the rights of citizenship unless he is possesses
of a certain number of dollars worth of real
estate but what we arc particularly inter
ested in is the fact of the matter colored
persons arc not citizens of thc united states
either according to law or against law the
colored man is robbed of this light if against
law of what value is the law  it may as
well have no existence a law is of little
use unless the moral sense of the majority is
on a level with its requirements laws that
are either above or below the moral sense of

checking war at the root by cutting oft its

ways in which moneylenders may dispose

most profitable and secure and they know

a murder committed under unusually atro
cious circumstances has just been discovered
in london the discovery and apprehension
of the murderer who was a woman give a
lemarkable illustration not only of the unani
mity with which all parties in the government
service in that coantry lend their aid in pro
moting the ends of law but also of tho won
derful practical advantages of steam and elec
tricity the chief actor in the horrible tragedy
was the wife of a man named manning the
man himself had also a share in it though
as a secondary actor patrick oconnor
their victim was a guager in the london
custom house and had accumulated about
ooo for which he was murdered he
seems to have been intimate with mrs man
ning and the last time he was seen slive
was in her back parlor on the evening of
thursday august th the next morning
oconnor was absent from his duty at the
docks the same for several days after be
fore his friends expressed any alarm on his
account on the tnesday following in
quiries were made for him at the house of
mrs manning which were answered by her
with coolness and composure suspicions
were thus lulled to sleep two days after
the police paid a second visit to the house
and found it deserted they then com
menced searching the premises and found the
body of the murdered man under the floor of
the back kitchen which was paved with flag
stones previous to her flight mrs man
ning had called at the lodgings of oconnor
and opening his drawers carried off all their
valuable contents there is nothing very re
markable in all this it is simply a new
exhibition of an oft repeated tragedy the
remarkable part of the story is the capture of
the murderer where the guilty parties had
gone no one knew it was at first rumored
that they had sailed for america by a vessel
fiom london a communication was then
made to the admiral of the port and he
immediately ordered out a steam yacht in
pursuit of the victoria the vessel in which
two persons bearing the name of the accused
had taken passage for new york the flay
following the steamyacht came up with the
victoria but the objects of her search were
noion board and she immediately beat back
to southampton where a steamsloop was
getting teady to join in the chase this at
tempt havmg failed an officer was dispatched
to the continent but coukl find no trace of the
fugitives but the driver of the hackney
coach who conveyed mrs manning to the
railway station having been discovered it
was ascertained that she had gone to scotland
a telegraphic message to this effect was in

we have been requested to give publicity
to thc following repudiation through the
columns of our paper we do not at present
understand the merits of the case and cannot
be expected to take sides with either party
but as we are informed by the committee that
the a m e zion church have no organ of
their own through which to defend themselves
we shall be happy to publish such articles as
they may desire if of reasonable length and
of sufficient public interest to warrant their
insertion in the north sar i n
repudiation
mr editor lt is now pretty generally
conceded by those who have impartially inves
tigated the subject that we as a people can
never become elevated in common w ith others
until we like them become united so that
wherever a spirit of disorganization is mani
fested whether in church or state among the
laity or among the clergy it is regarded as
being at war with the common interest of our
race
we hold therefore that wherever a
church is found to be a party with those who
are united against our common good she is
heterodox to the doctrines of the bible and
justly merits the appellation of hypocrite as
the authorized representatives of that portion
of the colored people composing one of the
grand divisions of the church in this country
we shall show that that party which through
public periodicals spoke loud and long on the
advantages of a union of the two connections
was the first to throw obstacles in the way of
its consummation and then to conceal their
gyiilt they falsely charge the innocent
it is a well known fact that the rev m
m clark willis nazarey and dr j j g
bias of the a m e connection and rev
i  moor win jones and edward john
son of the late a m e zion connection
met in convention for the purpose of adopting
some means by which to effect a union of the
two connections and it is our opinion that
if the said contemplated union had been ef
fected it would not only have proved a bless
ing to the two connections but must have en
hanced the interest of the colored people in
the general we cannot but believe that the
motives of the above named gentlemen were
pure but unfortunately for the interest of
the church most unfortunately for the moral
as well as political interest of our race in
america a spirit of a different nature mani
fested itself in an assertion emanating from a
minister occupying no low station in the a m
echurch the purport of which was that the
a m e zions miaisters greatly rejoiced
at the idea of becoming connected with the
a m e church and had expressed their
readiness to comply with and become subser
vient to whatever plan the latter might adopt
that the idea of a union of the two bodies
was to us a subject of rejoicing is a fact the
truth of which we are happy to admit bui
that we have ever manifested a disposition to
unite upon the principle of subserviency or
any other aside from the strictest equality is
to say the least of it a glaring absurdity
an assertion so ungrounded and fallacious
had the unhappy effect of changing the senti
ments of many who had truly and honestly
espoused the cause and struck the fatal blow
to the long wished for union of the two con
nections it may revive and our united
prayer to god is that it may revive speedily
but the more recent transactions of the a m
e connection warrant us in saying that
while their theory on this important question
seems to indicate no small degree of sincerity
they are practically opposed to union upon any
other principle than that which will secure to
them the ruling povocr in thc church
the following preamble and resolution show
the action of the conference with regard to
the above together with the sentiment of
that body in relation to the north star
whereas there exists a paper denominated
the north star edited by the talented frede
rick douglass that staunch and tried friend
of his people and whereas that paper is de
voted to universal liberty equality and fra
ternitybelieving that resistance to tyranny
is obedience to godopposing alike oppres
sion whether found in sacerdotal robes stolen
from heaven to serve the devil in or in the
less crafty but more honest statesman there
foie
resolved that we the members of the
allegheny conference of the a m e zion
connection do highly approve and appreciate
said paper and wish it success and will do
all we can to sustain it by subscribing our
selves and fairly laying its claims before the
people wherever we go

thoughts to paper with your supereeripoon
a few hoars since anns g msbbett was seen
upon one of our beck roads with a horse and
vrtgoo containing besides herself a fugitive
slave and his wife all in womans suite
the slave was a boot to commence attending
school on the reservation with the indiane
when his friends learned that the base min
isters of slaveocncy were on his track and
dose upon him but being pat upon this mate
to canadanot in this instance the right
trackhe is still safe he is a noble speci
men of humanity a mulatto thewn of hie

body servant of a very distinguished citizen
of the southern states the is ap
parently an amiable free woman the daughter
of a wealthy irishman he brought with
him letters of introduction to fredensk doug
lass and gerrit smith the people of this
place and vicinity are giving such indications
of their love of liberty that we may safel y
cenclude the time is near if not already at
hand whea this region of western new
york will be a safe retreat for the poor pant
ing fugitive it is truly a cheering indication
when our young men deem it coirardly to suf
fer a recapture of the oppressed victim of the
slave power those individuals in the em
ploy of the slaveholder will soon receive a
mark by which they will be known as readily
as was the brother of abelnot a mark of
tar and feathers the whip or branding iron
but the printers ink let the names and oc
cupations of all such persons be properly ex

manner as to render their situation rather un
comfortable except to the south among their

meeting appointed next d day eve when it is
likely there will be some spirited resolutions
adopted joseph carter of buffalo is sufficient

an appeal in behalf of the western
new york antislarery fair
earnestly desiring the abolition of slavery
in this land and being deeply convinced that
this result can only be accomplished by renew
ed efforts to change our present corrupt moral
sentiment the undersigned members and
friends of the western new york antislavery
society again make their appeal to the
friends of the slave in behalf of their annual
bazaar which will be held in rochester in
december next
while we have been cheered and gladdened
by the progress already made and the good
already done and while we rejoice to observe
that friends have been raised up to plead the
cause of the bondman among persons and in
quarters where we had least expected them
we still see the harvest to be great and the
laborers to be few and instead of relaxing
our efforts we are impressed with a sense of
the duty of doubling our diligence and ap
plying more closely our energy to the means
of advancing this holy causewe appeal the
more boldly to our friends because those for
whom we plead cannot plead for themselves
while we are surrounded by our domestic
circle with none to molest or make us afraid
there are three millions of men and women in
our own land doomed to abject slavery and
chains robbed of every rightcivilsocial
personaland political remembering those
in bonds as bound with them wc desire to
plead their cause as though they were on our
own limbs and the knotted lash were applied
to our own backs
while to obtain means for enlightening the
public mind is the strong motive for holding
our annual fair it is not the only one a
great amount of good may be traced directly
to such occasions many who are now ac
tive workers in behalf of this holy movement
became first interested in it through the in
strumentality of those annual exhibitions of
antislavery industry tact and skill
the present object of the rochester anti
slavery bazaar is for the general enlighten
ment of the public mind on the subject of sla
very recognizing the north star published
in this city as an efficient antislavery in
strumentality we propose that the funds raised
by the sale of articles at the bazaar on
behalf of which we here appeal ahail be
mainly appropriated to the support of that
important paper
we gatefully acknowledge the prompt as
sistance rendered to oar last fair by our
fnends and coadjutors in various parts of our
own state wisconsin and michigan and ire
earnestly solicit their continued cooperation
with us in the good wotk that no time may
be lost we especially recommend to them the
immediate formation of tewing circles in their
various towns with a view to making articles
for the rochester bazaar w r e would also
in this connection render our heartfelt thanks
to oar british fnends for the valuable aid ex
tended by them to our last years fair ami
we would again warmly solicit their generous
assistance it is due to oui tramatlantic

i happened to be reaiding ml naples
during the reaction and proscriptions
which succeeded the return of ferdi
nand after the revolutionary crisis of
 many of the victims were de
nounced by the priests as much for
their suspected heresy as for their trea j
onable practice father don alvez
was particularly active in this pious
work he was a younger member of
a castilian house aod had been bred
in the strictest discipline of the jesuits
he had spent his life in penances and
intrigues the former i presume to
give him a keener relish for the latter
and the latter to compensate for the
tedium of the former at the time 
knew him he was past the middle age
his features were already wrinkled with
years but were marked by that haughty
and cruel expression so apt to be pro
duced by the indulgence of arbitrary
power he had come to naples with
high recommendations to the court to
assist in purging the city of the disaf
fected his diligence in this pursuit
was truly beyond parallel  am yet
unable to conceive by what process he
became so minutely conversant with
the previous history of such an im
mense number of persons in so short a
time his information was never at
fault and his measures very rarely j
thwarted by miscalculation either in
design or e ecution as soon as he
had made himself masterof a suspected
person he did not at once act upon his
evidence to bring about an instant in
fliction of punishment but used to give
the prisoner the benefit of a dogmatical
exposition of what he called the sal
vation of the holy church if this had
the desired effect after a little longer
confinement the captive was liberated
on his good behavior but if the here
tic persevered in his rejection of the
prescribed process he was forthwith
i handed over to the headsman
the society in which i moved made
me acquainted with father don alvez
i was then young and fond of adven
ture and very naturally conceived a
strong desire of visiting with him some
of the unfortunates wom the police
were constantly arresting by his orders
by practising some courteous assidui
ties as well as a little flattery i ingra
tiated myself with him and obtained
permission to accompany him on his
dismal visits to the prison
after visiting one or two cells in
which we found inmates quite willing
to believe any thing and every thing
which my guide thought proper to pro
pound we entered a narrow dismal
hole surrounded by walls down which
the damp trickled almost ia a stream
and with the floor composed of granite
of uneven surface and sharp edges
the torch carried by our attendant dis
covered a bundle of straw in the corner
farthest from the door aud resting
upon it a young girl don alvez mo
tioned to the jailor to withdraw the
creaking of the hinges disturbed i he
prisoner she started from her recum
bent posture but her eyes had been
too long accustomed to darknes to en
dure the glare of the torchlight she
arranged her disordered hair and cloth
ing as fast and as completely as she
could and when at length she ventured
to scrutinise her visitors  marked the
deep crimson that suffused her face
and bosom
i had been accustomed to behold the
exceeding beauty of the women of
spain aud italy but when i saw this
unfortunate captive i felt at once that
i had never met with any one whose
loveliness was so perfect when i say
that she was a greek and bore in
every lineament the impress of her
clime and nation i need not attempt a
description
don alvez told me previous to en
tering the cell that it contained a
heretic who had been some time under
confinement and appeared resolved to
reject every chance of salvation
this he added is the last oppor
tunity of repentance i shall give her
these words still echoed in my ear 
as i contemplated the stern front of the
jesuit and the pensive innocence of the
greek maiden
perverse child commenced don
alvez i have come once more to
offer thee liberty and the favor of the
virgin if thou wilt embrace the holy
faith
adela so the jailer had whispered
ine she was called had now sat down
on her coarse bed and with her hands
folded on her bosom seemed prepared
for any calamity which might await her
she returned no answer to the priests
observation
what continued he dost thou
treat with contempt the servant of the
church mark me perverse infidel
thy fate is in thy own hands thy
death i swear by all the blessed saints
shall be the penalty if thou persistest
in thy unbelief but if thou wilt listen
to the truth not a hair on thy head
shall be injured how sayest thou
caust thou endure death or wilt thou
liver
i am heedless of my fate replied
adela in a tone of melancholy which
pierced my heart still not heed
less she added with animation so
long as i know not the fate of conrade
tell m piicst i conjure thee is he in
thy power
why is the fate of that young man
so dear to thee replied don alvez
that it is preferred to thine own sal
vation
adela met the look of the jesuit with
a calm and penetrating glance
thou inayest be learned in thy
faith she said but thou art a novice
here laying her hand upon her heart
if thou knowest not that a woman
love in dusting upon its object forgets
all other interests
then it is sinful and deserves per
dition replied the priest
then it is impossible that  can be
saved quietly rejoined the youne
greek
what if i tel thee after a pause
said don alvez that conrade is not
in my power but hast left naplee with
another paramour
adelss blood mounted to her cheeks
with indie nation as she exclaimed
then i till thee thou art a liar as
well ss a barbarian not for a moment
will  believe ao base a calumny
iuevleai bciettt i replied my com
panion i will forthe last time in
quire dost thou refuse the mercy of the
church
do i refuse the mercy of the
church said adela why wretch
dost thou call these bolts and bars thi
dungeon this darkness my long impri
sonment my wasted health my tori
lured mind my almost broken heart
dost thou call these mercy i know
not what is meant by the church and i
care not i despise and reject both it
and thee you dragged me hither be
cause  worshipped according to the i
customs of my fathers and my nation
and you would have dragged hither
also one who was too noble too gene j
rous all too worthy to commit the
smallest wrong but he hss escaped
thank heaven be has escaped o
conrade she exclaimed clasping her
hams who shall love thee when
adela is gone
for a short time sobs convulsed her
beautiful form she soon recovered
and then added with an emphasis i
shall never forget
i do reject thee thy mercy and
thy church  cannot believe that truth j
is allied to cruelty or that heaven has
given you power to destroy its own
creatures i know not who is your
god but i feel that the great and good
intelligence who rules the world will
not punish me for serving him as i have
been taught for believing as my simple
 reason dictates and above all for re
jecting your creed so full of cruelty
bloodshed and oppression leave me
now in an hour i will be ready to do
your bidding
enough said don alvez sternly
and moved towaids the door i took
advantage of his position to whisper to
adela do not hope too much but 
will be your friend her lurge dark
eyes spoke a gratitude which i am
confldent i shall never again receive
from any human being
the jailor fastened the heavy door
and  followed don alvez who was
hastening from the building w hen 
overtook him i inquired his resolution
as to the fate of the young greek
she dies tomorrow at noon was
the laconic reply
it was then near evening he was j
at first very unwilling to answer any j
questions concerning her but by dint
of close application i extracted as
much intelligence as put ine on a track
by which i at length discovered con
rade  have not the abilty to describe
the gallant youth there was the
genuine attic stamp on his character
 and frame he entered eagerly into
my plan of rescue it was sufficiently
perilous but that to him was a recom
mendation rather than otherwise the
design was to bribe the jailer to connive
at our admission to adelas cell and
then to bring her away with us and to
fight a passage through all opposition
a friendly fisherman engaged to await
us in the bay w ith his skiff at a point
trom which fortunately the prison was
not far distant with some difficulty 
obtained an interview with the jailor
and for one hundred piasters received
his promise to admit us
he was as good as his word we
found adela in a calm slumber per
haps she dreamed of conrade for the
instant ne stepped towards the couch
she sprang into his arms without a mo
ments doubt that it was any one but
him she willingly resigned herself to
our direction when we had emerged
from the cell we gained the outer gate
before it was discovered that we had
with us the condemned captive the
first and second assailants were laid at
conrades feet by stabs from his rapier
we were now in the street fleeing for
our livesconrade first with adela on
his left arm i defended the retreat
the fate of the two men had a salutary
effect in checking the temerity of their
companions after some hard blows j
had been given and received we gained
the beach the fisherman placed a
dela in the boat while conrade and
myself stood at bay and repulsed our
pursuers i think another life was
sacrificed in the struggle the case
was now desperate for the number ol
enemies increased every moment
threw ourselves into the boat and the
first stroke shot us into deep water a
volley of musketballs whizzed over our
heads without doing us any damage
the night was daik and we were row
ing with our utmost strength two things
which every moment diminished our
danger i cannot tell why no attempt
at a chase was made but so it happen
ed that all our obstacles were at an
end when we left the shore
before daybreak we reached a con
trabandista in the offing and when the
sun shone in full lustre on the city of
naples we were many leagues distant
down the mediterranean
my part of this adventure of course
exiled me from the neapolitan metrop
lis for a time
as the excitement of the crisis died
away father don alvez found more
difficulties in procuring victims his
zeal could not be satisfied with a soli
tary delinquent or two so he retired to
rome in a pique at the aversion of the
neapolitans to undergo martyrdom
when he was gone i had less difficul
ty in negotiating an indemnity i was
attached to the locality or i should not
have troubled myself to return but
now i regard naples as the scene ol
the action which of all others i have
most occasion to look back upon with
pleasure
adela i heard may years after from
an english captain was the mother of
a numerous family my informant had
visited her home and because he was
my countryman had been treated with
