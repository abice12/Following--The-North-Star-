address of h w johnson
delivered at the first of august celebration
rtt president and fellowcitizens
i da not expect to be heard with
any degree of patience after the able
and eloquent address to which all have
listened with so much admiration and
perhaps it is the highest degree of van
tty in me to claim your attention for one
m upent especially while there are oth
eraupon this platform who can occupy
the tirtie allotted to me to a much better
advantage
however this may be all will admit
thatthe occasion is one that command
the respect and attention of every friend
f human liberty that should call forth
the earnest congratulations of those
who have long been laboring for the
downfall of tyranny not only in this
landbut throughout the entire world
i am happy to say we assemble here
today under auspices more favorable
than those under which wc have assem
bled upon former occasions we not
only commemorate that grand event
properly called freedoms jubilee the
birthday of liberty to  crushed
and bleeding victims of oppression in
the british west india isles but also
rejoice over the progress of liberty
abroadover the fall of thrones and
the destruction of tyrann in other
lands
recent events proclaim that the march
of liberty is onward that the mighty
struggle which for ages has been going
on between freedom and slavery must
result in the ultimate triumph of the
former that however faint the pros
pect however dark and gloomy may
be the clouds that for a while obscure
the golden hues of the rainbow of hope
the friends of liberty need not despair
those dark clouds of apprehension that
now cover with gloom tho fairest pros
pects of freemen shall yet be pierced
by the broad flash and bright sunlight of
truth
such are the hopes with which the
events which we are this day assembled
to commemorate inspire us who i
ask does not rejoice at the prospect
one of the events to which i allude is
more particularly distinguished as a
great moral triumphas a victory
achieved not by the sword and the
bayonet but by the force and power of
truth
after the able and eloquent remarks
made upon this subject by the distin
guished gentleman who preceded me
it may be superfluous for me to say one
word in addition but i ask your in
diligence for one moment while i refer
to one or two important effects it had
upon the cause of liberty in other coun
tries especially in our own in the
first place it swept away that miserable
subterfuge behind which the oppress r
ao long found a safe retreat viz the
danger and impracticability of imme
diate emancipation it proclaimed to
the world what every one ought to
have known before that there is no
danger in ceasing to do wrong and
commencing immediately to do right
that there u no danger in restoring to
right hot
that the peril consul in withholding
those rights from him but there was
a time when with the idea of immediate
emancipation nothing wm associated
but images of the most frightful nature
of fields uncultivated property devas
tatedcities desolated and in rums
inhabitants murdered and the emanci
pated actuated by a spirit of revenge
rnxitmg in the blood of their former
masters but this great experiment if
to restore man to the condition in which
his creator designed he should live can
properly be called to experiment has
the north star
falsified the predictions of the enemies
of emancipation
be it lecollected it was under cir
cumstances thd most disadvantageous
to the whites that slaveiy was abolished
in those islnndscircumstances that
rendered it not only possible but easy
for the emancipated to have dug the
i grave of every white man upon those
islsnds so far did the colored popula
i tion exceed the white that la the lan
guage of wendell phillips one mo
ments rushing recollection of a cen
turys oppression would have swept
every w hite man from the face of those
islands forever
startle not at this declaration but
listen for a moment to a recital of the
facts upon which it is baped jamaica
had  colored thabitants to
i  w rites barbadeesbooo col
 ored to  whites antigua 
 colored to  white and in
one of the islands only  white peo
j pie were to be found in a population of
j  it was under circumstances like
j these in islands far distant from the
 protecting arm of the mother country
surrounded on all sides by the waters of
a blue and boundless ocean that the
chains were severed from the limbs of
 crushed and bleeding victims
of oppression amid the wildest predic
lions of ruin carnage and blood and
yet none of those frightful evilsnone
of those awful scenes of blood and
butchery which we were told would be
the inevitable consequences of this
measure have occurred but experi
ence even under such circumstances
proves the safety and practicability of
immediate emancipation
again this event is illustrative of
that great maxim so cheering to the
heart of the reformer truth is omnipo
tent and must ultimately prevail i
say ultimately prevail for let us not
forget fellowcitizens that this great
victory was not achieved in a single
day it was the result of years of
longcontinued and arduous labors
mighty indeed was the great struggle
that preceded this event the enemies
of emancipation contested every inch
of groundthe subtle foes of liberty
resorted to every plan which human
ingenuity could suggest in order to
prostrate the designs of the friends of
freedom they even had the effront
ery to carry their cause before the peo
ple of britain and there defended sla
very with all the fore  of an overpow
ering eloquence the m st frightful
stories were conjured up of the awful
consequences that would ensue if tsla
yery were abolishedthe most foul
mouthed slanders were ejaculated a
gainst the friends of freedomthe vilest
epithets in the vocabulary of the eng
lish language were applied to the un
daunted friends of liberty and the
blackest designs that ever found a lodg
ment in the human breastwere imputed
to them
but all these were of no avail the
inarch of lib rty was onward the
public mind had begun to be enlighten
ed upon the great and allabsorbing
question of human liberty the gath
ering storm of public opinion finally
overwhelmed all opposition in vain
was every attempt to impede its pro
gress they might as well have attempt
ed to chain old oceans wavesto stop
the resistless torrent of niagaras thun
dering cataract it rolled over thfcm
like the huge waves of the broad at
lantic it moved on its majestic cause
until it had swept slavery from those
islands forevfer
fellowcitizens that was a proud day
for libertyit was a proud day for the
world it was a glorious day for that
noble band of noblehearted philan
thropists who for years had breasted
the storms and tempests of an adverse
public opinion it was a glorious con
summation of their longcontinued and
arduous labors truth had triumphed
the slave was free
fellowcitizens we are not only here
today to commemorate the dawn of
liberty in the british west india la
lands but also to rejoice over the pro
gress oi liberty in other landsif you
please over the birth of a new republic
yes a new republic has sprung into
existence france has demolished her
throne and reared upon its ruins a new
republic libertyequalityfra
ternity are the words emblazoned
upon her proud escutcheon her acts
seem to correspond with her profes
sions she has struck off the fetters
that bound the limbs of her colonial
slaves she could not consent to es
tablish a partial liberty liberty in
france could not be confined within
such narrow limits as to be based upon
he color of the skin
t what cried one of the members
of her late provisional government
slavery in a republic the idea
could not be entertained for a moment
slavery cannot exist on french
ground no not a slave can clank
his chains on that nij of liberty what
friend of impartial liberty does not hail
with joy the rising sun of such a repub
lic france will receive the
warmest aympathies of every true friend
of human liberty he will extend to
her the right hand of fellowship he will
kneel at the same shrine and partake
of the same waters of liberty that spring
from the deepgushing fountain of free
djm
here permit me to remark the
 worlds history furnishes but few if
a nr examples of a revolution of this
nature having been accomplished
against sack fearful odds and within
the same time apparently never was
i tyranny entrenched behind stronger
bulwarks its triumph over liberty
seemed almost complete the liberty
of the press that great safeguard of a
nations freedom was trampled in the
duet and overshadowed by the bloedr
throne of despotism guarded on u
right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and we are brethren
side by batteries bristling with cannon
surrounded by n wall of bayonets
with one hundred thousand of the very
flower of the french army at his com
mand the citixen king imagined be
had triumphed over the liberties of
france but the genius of liberty
looking out from her dark dungeon
sighed for a more extended field of oper
ation frenchmen heard the cry and
rose as one man in defence of expir
ing liberty tbe iron bands of despot
ism withered and snapped asunder like
the cords that bound the limbs of tbe
strong man of old
true france baa been engaged in
other great struggles for politicafrree
dom tbe world knows well tbe result
of those efforts upon former occa
sions the sun of her liberties has risen
with great splendor butws the wheels
of her revolution rolled onward her
iiky became overcast with clouds dark
and lowering too frequently true
and genuine liberty is confounded with
that which has been properly denomi
nated wild and savage ferocity such
unfortunately was once the case in
france persecution and intolerance
prevaileda reign of terror was estab
lishedher noblest sons were cruelly
murdered in the name of liberty and
her sun went down in blood but from
the dust of those murdered patriots rose
that great champion of freedom la
martine yes lamartinea name
not only dear to france but dear in
every land where freedom finds a
friend
as far as the great question of hu
man liberty is concerned france to
day stands on a proud and command
ing eminence the world mut look
with admiration upon the noble stand
she has taken in behalf of liberty
equalityfraternity she mds fair
now to become all that her former rev
olutionary patriots desired an  if the
eyes of such menarc ever turned back
upon their native country thosesof her
former defenders of liberty imjst now
be looking down from the battljfments
of heaven with pleasure and flight
upon the proud pinnacle upoijlwhich
their country this day reposes jjlf the
spirits of great and good men elr re
visit their native land those wf her
former defenders of liberty nitft now
be walking abroad among her ople
infusing into them the same dev ion to
principle undying hatred of oppres
sion and ardent love of liberty that
once animated their own generous bo
som
fellowcitizens while we are rejoic
ing over the triumph of truth and jus
tice and the march uf freedom in atker
landspermit fine for one moment to call
your attention to our own country and
see what progress liberty is making
here for can it be that the despotic
governments of the old world are in
advance of us are they such apt
scholars that they have learned our
lessons of republicanism better than we
know them ourselves
freedom having forages maintained
a noble struggle for existence in the
old world finally sought a home in the
western i emisphere the american
people gave her a welcome reception
they responded to her call for aid and
ran to her relief and can it be that she
only came here to find a grave in the
wilderness
the war of the revolution was called
a fierce struggle in her defence in
that contest they started out with the
broad declaration that all men are
created equal that they are endowed
by their creator with certain inaliena
ble rights that among these are life
liberty and the pursuit of happiness
the american people were called upon
to support the principle contained in
this declaration at the very hazard of
their lives they obeyed tbe solemn
call they were induced to leave their
homes to forego the pleasures of peace
and sacrified their lives upon the great
altar of their country in support of
these heavenborn principles attract
ed by the sublimity of these truths
many brave foreigners in whose bo
soms glowed the fires of liberty crossed
the blue waters of the broad atlantic
and poured out their blood freely upon
the american soil to fertilize a land of
liberty
the struggle of the revolution finally
terminated in a blaze of glory and the
brilliant triumph of american arms
many supposed that the great un
changing principles upon which it was
based were also established upon a
permanent basis but how sadly dis
appointed were they the seeds of
oppression had been scattered broad
cast over this landfrom these seeds
sprang up that great tree of oppres
sion whose broad branches are ex
tended far and wide over our country
shading out the bright sunbeams of lib
erty yes this soil once watered with
tbe lifeblood of the martyrs of free
dom is now saturated with the tears
and stained with tbe blood of the slave
and yet this is called a free republic
and americans call themselves republi
cans oh is not this inconsistency
the most irreconcilableguilt the most
abandoned hypocrisy the most un
blushing but  repeat american
call themselves republicans and firm
believers in the great principles con
tained in their declaration of inde
pendence they profess to love liberty
and glory in the rights of man from
eariiest infancy they have been rocked
in the cradle of liberty and trained in
the great school of republican freedom
almost the first sounds that awaken
emotions in their bosoms and create
gladness in their hearts are the spirit
stirring snogs of liberty and tkn lead
cry a freedom end equal right not
withstanding all these things they dm
fight te deaf in oppressing trampling
in the dust the great principles ouoiam

eaee they countenance and sustain one
of the most grinding and crushing sys
tems of oppression that ever stained
the dark annals of crime or shocked
tbe high majesty of heaven after the
remarks made by my eloquent friend in
regard to the guilty and oppressive acts
of this nation  shall not dwell long
upon this subject i will not open the
black and bloody pages of my countrys
history and look over that dark cata
logue of crime oppression outrage and
wrong of which she has been guilty
from the earliest stages of her existeuce
down to tbe present moment let it suf
fice to say that to so great an extent
does slavery exist in this countryno
far does it extend that in all this land
this broad loadthis wide extent of
country washed on one side bv the
waters of the broad atlantic on the
other by the waves of the pacific
there is not one spot upon which a col
ored man can rest his feet and declare
that he is free even the nominally
free man of color is liable at any mo
ment when away from home and among
strangers to be seized by the tyrants
cold withering grasp and hurried off
to the land of slavery and of blood to
drag out a miserable existence in a
state of unrequited toil if a panting
fugitive through the guidance of the
north star that star of hope to the
flying bonrlmanthat star which like
the pillar of fire that guided the chil
dren of israel through the wilderness
to the promised landleads him safely
from republican slavery ts a land wheie
he can sit down and enjoy liberty be
neath the grateful shadow of a mon
archs thronethat star which slave
holders would gladly see plucked from
heavens bright constellationif thro
the guidance of that star he succeeds in
making his escape to what we some
times call the free hills of the north
there is not one spot on free columbias
soil where he can repose his weary
limbs in safety no matter whether he
be one of the lastborn patriots of 
or one of the sacred veterans of 
he finds no protection upon american
soil through the operation of american
law he may go to every battle
ground of the revolution to every
haunted spot where freedom weeps over
the f ull of her noblest sonshe may go
to new englandproud and glorious
new englanda land consecrated by
the graves of the pilgrim fathers and
watered by the first blood that was shed
in the great struggle of the revolution
he may stop at the greenr of lexing
tonhe may go to faneuil hall that
old cradle of liberty that once rocked
wjh the loud about of freedom aad
equfh rights where once was heard the
voice of adams and hancock and
their compatriots of revolutionary times
that sacred spot from within whose
walls was borne away the mangled form
of that brave black man benjamin at
tucks from whose veins flowed the first
drop of blood that mingled with ameri
can soil in defence of american liber
tyeven there he finds no protection
he may go to bunker hill as he gazes
upon that lofty monument a smile
comes over his countenance and he
thinks beneath its proud shadow he will
find that protection for which he has so
long searched in vain but even here
he is doomed to be disappointed the
tyrants stern voice demands him to be
given up in vain tloes that proud
monument of liberty give a groanin
vain do the shades of the revolutionary
heroes whose blood watered the soil
upon which it stands mingle their
voices with every shriek that comes
forth from that weeping monument in
opposition to this mandateeven then
he finds no protect l
where then must he go ab
whither shall this heartbroken fugitive
fly for refuge as a last resort he
escapes to tbe capital of his country
the capital of the freest nation on the
face of tbe entire globe there he
beholds the broad folds of his countrys
banner waring in triumph our proud
eagle perching high above it his golden
wings dazzling in the sunbeams as he
soars aloft and screams of liberty un
til our broad deep forests ring with his
piercing cry but does he there behold
the graceful form of the fair goddess of
american liberty with her thousand
varied charms beramuing countenance
with outstretched arm welcoming him
to her embrace no but on lie con
trary he there sees enthroned the iron
jawed grimviiaged and bloody demoo
of american slavery with his loaf
black robes dripping with the blood
which ages of grinding and crushing
despotism have wrung from tbe veins
of his bleeding victims this is ame
rican liberty this is the equality that
exists in this land oh this model re
public this boasted land of freedom
upon which the heroes of tbe revolution
are ever looking down from heaves to
bless
but notwithstanding all these things
loud demonstrations are made in tbis
country in favor of freedom the
american people exhaust the great
fountain of national sympathy for tbe
oppressed of other lands but are care
ful t keep nooe in reserve for the
downtrodden and oppressed of their
own country they boost long and
loud of virtuous liberty and we
are told whenever a human being
pines ia chaios these americans drop
their teara
if the oppressed of ether lends en
gage in a noble straggle for liberty if
they be white they receive the warm
est sympathies of the american people
when greece was straggling for lib
erty not only did almost every palnit in
oar land resound with eloquent plead
ings to her behalf hat the whole coun
try was iiled with innmmr tones of
sympathy fee the
thsir aside straggle
when the south american states
endeavored to throw off the yoke of
spanish oppression and from their en
crimsoned fields root the cry for sym
pathy and aid again one spontaneous
burst of sympathy gushed forth from
our great national fountain
when poland attempted to atrike ofl
the fetters of tyranny and the best
blood of her children mingled with bei
freen soilwhen her patriotic aons
issed the statues of their heroes and
swore upon the green graves of their
venerated sirespoland shall be free
and when at last through treachery
he sgaio sank beneath the cold iron
grasp of her despotic masters mark
again how the tear of sympathy flowed
from every american aye
when we received intelligence of the
late revolution in france what great
rejoicing there was in this country
resolutions expressing the earnest
sympathies for france were adopted in
almost every part of the land con
gress joined the nation in this generous
expression of sympathy and some ot
those men who but a short time since
were down upon their southern planta
tions flourishing their whips over the
shrinking form of the bleeding slave
were the most eloquent upon that occa
sion well some of those men who go
along with their heads bowed down to
the earth whose tears have bedewed
and whose sighs have embalmed the
soil of our national capitol having per
haps heard some of those eloquent
speeches upon libertythought they
would revolutionize themselvesthat
they would change their form of gov
ernmentthat they would no longer
submit to that odious oneman power
but that they would stand up with the
dignity of men accordingly one night
dark and dreary to them they went on
board of a sloop lying in the river and
started for a land of liberty but their
guardian angel slept they were
pursued and brought back by those
men who have so much sympathy for
france aud today fellowcitizens
orne of those unfortunate victims of
oppression are dragging out a misera
ble existence among the cotton
fields and riceswamps of the far south
those dark and dismal abodes that have
been the grave of so many of our crush
ed and bleeding countrymen there
they are left to linger and die a most
cruet death while their sighs for free
dom are borne back over the floating
waters of the mississippi upon every
breeze that comes from that slavery
accursed region but this scene does
not end here these men who but a
short time si rce ji ad ao loach sympa
thy for france were roused te the very
highest pitch of fury and madness be
cause these persons endeavored to ob
tain their liberty members of con
gress were threatened with assassina
tiona mob was raised in the capitol
of our country to put down the freedom
of the press and when a noblemind
ed senator who having partaken freely
of those waters of liberty that spring up
among the granitehills of new hamp
shire could consent no longer to be a
slave when that man presented a bill
in the senate of the united states for
the protection of property in the dis
trict of columbia against the violence
of mobs he was very politely told if
he would only come into a neighboring
state in this republic his form would
soon grace the tallest tree in the forest
great god and has it come to this
are now our liberties so far gone that
our representatives dare not stand up
upon the floor of tbe american con
gress and speak out one sentiment in
favor of liberty without being threaten
ed with a felons death oh liberty
is thi all that is left thee here
fellowcitizens freedom exists only
in name in this country its sacred re
ality u gone plough up those hallow
ed mounds beneath which lie buried
the remains of those sainted martyrs of
the revolution who perilled their all in
defence of freedom demolish those
proud monuments reared in the name
of liberty that immortal banner of
freedont that once animated the heart
and nerved up the arm of the patriot
upon whose broad folds were inserted
the eternal truths contained ia our de
claration of independence that banner
which was first unfurled to tbe breeze
upon the green of lexingtonthat
waived in triumphed over the field of
saratoga and was encircled in a bright
hafo of glory upon the plains of york
townis now trampled beneath the foot
of the despotand in its stead upon
the dark ronparta of oppression floats
in triumph the flag of despotism upon
whose black sod bloody folds are in
scribeddown with liberty slavery
for ever
american liberty today lies be
fore us a braised aad mangled corpse
and before me seem to rise up tbe hate
ful forms of her bloody assassins
tbe poet has truly said happy is it
for mankind that

for could the fathers of tbe revolution
hive foreseen an event like this the
great american arm would have been
paralyzed their spirits would have
sunken and hope died within their bo
loms without even a faint struggle on
their part to be free they would never
have toiled so ardooslybleed so free
ly and died so willingly in order to
transmit to posterity the inestimable
blessings of libertyhad they known or
even dreamed that before a century
had rotted awaywhile their oocoflm

heroes of  bad departed from among
mbefore the sound of the great con
flict had died open the amend ear
mid while dm triumphant shoots of
victory mill broke the slumbers of ear
forests and lingered amoag the distant
bills of our country the traitorous arms
of their degenerate sons would be rear
ed up to crush that liberty which bey
endeavored to establish upon a perma
nent basis
fellowcitizens if it be not literacy
true that liberty today lies before us
a mangled corpse i ash if it be not true
that if there be a spark of life lingering
in her bosrmif there be a drop of
kfeablood flowing in thiggreins of ame
rican liberty sheis a tendering fugi
tive in this country has she not been
driven from her last entrenchments
within our borders there is not a
spot in all this land upon which the
genro of american liberty can stand
it as her own she may go
and rest upon the grave of the immor
tal washington but soon your read
eagle with long beak and sharp talous
comes screaming after her she may
go and stand on old plymntns rock
that sacred spot where she first landed
upon these shores under the fostering
care of the pilgrim fathers but soon
your bloody clawed vultures of oppres
sion follow in pursuit where then
must she go she must retrace her
stepsshe must go back over the waves
and find a home among the sunny hills of
italy or among the liilies of france
at the conclusion of my remarks in
reference to france i spoke of the
happy feelings that would animate the
bosoms of her patriots could they come
hack and behold the present position of
their country upon the great question
of human liberty think you fellow
citizens that your fathers would be ani
mated by similar emotions could they
come back among you and behold the
present position of their country upon
this question no if the shades of
your greathearted ancestry could
come back once more to their native
land they would not contaminate their
sacred robes by suffering them even
to touch the soil now stained with the
blood of the slave they might con
sent for one moment to hover over
their country and drop a tear over her
fallen liberties and then bidding her a
long farewell wing their way back to
their eternal homes
fenowcitizens what a spectacle is
this for an american eye to behold
what a theme for an american mind to
contemplate before a century has
rolled away all the great bulwarks of
liberty have been battered down and
that sacred inheritance bequeathed to
us by the fathers of the revolution has
been equally wrested from our grasp
talk no more of american freedom but
cover with sackcloth and ashes the

let him not scream oh no for he
will not scream of liberty but proclaim
a deep and solemn requiem over the
grave of american freedom
the decline of the slave
power
the following article handed to u 
by freeman hunt the editor of hunts
merchants magazine will be read
with interest its statistics seem to be
accurately stated and the inferences
drawn from them by the writer perfect
ly legitimate after the census of
 the number of representatives
from the slave states will be greatly
diminished but the tactics of those in
the slave interest will be displayed in
manufacturing slave states no matter
how much more the free states increase i
in population than the slave states the
power of the slave interest will be per
petuated by the senate so long as slave
states are added as fast as free states
are a few years will throw delaware
maryland kentucky and probably
virginia among tbe free states but the
strong probability is that we may in a
few years have to add the entire ofmex 
ico and should the missouri compro
mise be added and slavery be estab
lished throughout the whole of mexico
there will then be a complete and perj
manent triumph of tbe slave power but
this will never be if the people of the
free states prove true to themselvesto
liberty in the crisis now at hand let
us take a bold and determined stand
and adhere to it and the boundaries of
slavery will never strech beyond their
present limits a y globe
ia respect to the population of the
united states as distiguisbed by the
existence of slavery and by it prohi
bition the whole population of the
united states in  was  f
whom  belonged to the slave
states and territories and  to
the free or only fre in the free
than in the slave division this trifling
excess of only  in  in  years
had increased to  in io and
 calculate that at this time  it
amounts to  and in  will
amount to  the natural in
crease in the free state and besides
fourfifths of the immigrants from for
eign countries go into the free stages
the white population of the untied
states in  was  of whom
 belonged to the slave di
vision and  to the free the
cess of  ia  in tbe free
division had increased in  yearn to
 in  when there were
only  white persona in the
slave divisionwhich is nearly 
 less than this excess the excess
f white persons in tbe free mates over
the number in the lsve mates w st ibis
time nearly  the difference
of population in the two divisions will
wo believe continue to ioereoso here
after even notwkheuodißg any efforts

the number i of whom  or 
 per cent are from the free states
and  or  per cent art from the
slave states during this period the
gain of the free states has been  i
per cent of the whole representation
tnd the loss of tbs slave states the
same and the together constitute a
difference of l   per cent ia the
representation of the two divisions of
the states the number of represent
atives from he free states is now about
threefifths of the whole and it is obvi
ous that the propertion will be constant
ly increasing at each decennial epoch
for the natural increase of tile federal or
representative population in the free
states is greater than in the slave
states and at least fourfifths of the
immigrants from foreign countries all
white persons and now their number
amounts to between three and four
hundred thousand annually go into
the free states to swell their population
there has been almost a constant
decrease of the proportion of the rep
resentatives in congress from the slave
states in each decennial period from
 to  and even to sustain
this decreasing proportion it has so
happened that there have been nearly
 more voters and nearly 
more free persons on an average in
each representative or congressional
district in the free states than in the
slave states for each term during the
 year from  to 
and further the numder of toters in
the united states in  was about
 it now is nearly three and
a half millions fy has been estimated
that the number of slaveholders is
about  or not more than a tenth
part of that of the voters some think
that of these slaveholders only about
 are votersl will suppose the
number to be about  or one to
 or  voters it would seem that
the number of those who have an inter
est in this slave property cannot be
more than four times that of the slave
holders and six times that of the slave

that we may suppose that only about

that those interested in slavery are only
about oneeighth of the whole population
of these states
it may be here stated that in the
choice of presidential electors in

cast in the slave states including the
probable number in south carolina
where the choice was made by the
legislature was only about  per
centof the whole number while in the
free states it was about  per cent
the number of white persons in the
two divisions of the states was in 
  per cent and  per cent
respectivelythe right of suffrage
being more extended among the whites
in the free than in the slave states
let the above fact be duly consid

hardly be postponed many years before
the constitutional potter of the general
government will be exercised by those

friends come up on this occasion from all
parts of the great world the political leaders are marshalling their hosts for a conflict
their followers are rallying by hundreds of

friends of freedom whose faith should be
strong in the power of truth be lukewarm

the events of the past year should encourage
us to renewed e libra for every movement of

bearing upon the question of slavery fore
shadows the destruction of the system and
the oppressors feel that it is so the political
parties will make a desperate effort to save
themselves from the destruction their corrup

of the abolitionists to maintain and enforce
the right should lie proportionably great
arrangements should be made at the coming
meeting to continue the antislavery agitation

vention
this grand movement so long desired and
so long maturing has at last assumed a defi
nite and tangible form and is now fairly
launched forth upon the storm tossed sea of
american polities barnburners conscience
and independent whigs land reformers and
liberty men met deliberated frater
nized and now stand before the world as one
body with one heart one creed and one
leader thesff men holding as they did
widely variant and conflicting opinions in
meeting together as they have now done and
solemnly resolving to lorget old differences
to let bygones be bygone andkfirmly
uniting in a common platform new broad and
strongupon which all may stand and confront
the slave power and slavery extension have
astonished themselves as well as mortified
and disappointed their enemies our own
observation justifies us in saying that every
member of the convention gained more for
his cause and greater concessions to his opin
ions than he had ventured to hope or imagine
on leaving home for that convention for
our part we had vprn little expectation that
the convention could b harmonized and
brought to act together there were three
distinct elements of discorddemocrats and
whigs liberty party men and land re
formersall having the strongest preferences
for candidates and each wishing to shape the
convention and platform according in his own
mouldto harmonize and unite such persons
required no little skill the members of the
convention however were evidently tho
roughly imbued with the spirit of freedom
and in one noble desire to accomplish some
thing immediately for this causeto rebuke
the slave power and break up the old cor
rupt and slaveholdmg parties of the land they
were led willingly to merge old differences in
a common resolve to meet the present crisis
whatever may be said as to the best mode
of meeting this crisis all antislavery men
must agree that the question of extending
slavery is one in which they as friends of
freedom are deeply interested there was a
time when some abolitionists professed to
believe that the extension of slavery could in
no wise injure the cause of freedom or
strengthen the arm of slavery the doc
trine however that no more slaves can be
added to the number already existing by their
diffusion over vast and fertile territories is
now of no weight or in place the fact that
the demand for such extensions comes from
tiie slave holders that they insist upon it as
being their only means of escape from the
advancing steps of human freedom and the
scorching rays of antislavery opinion with
out a knowledge of w hat everybody must by
this time very well knowthat the introduction
of slave labor is necessarily the expulsion of
free labor from the territories ought to sat
isfy all men that that demand should be firmly
resisted
this issue is now upon us and fairly
before us slavery has rallied its frteuds
and is proudly marshaling its forces under
the leadership of cass and taylor the one
is a cringing sycophanta deserter from and
traitor to the very cause which he is now
aiming to destroy the other s swearing
swaggering manstealer and raanslaver whose
only claims to the presidency are based upoa
his hefllh criorraitisjs in mexico
around these infamous leaders the corrupt
and plundering the reckless and profligateof
the old political parties have gathered a
proslavery and tinsustaining church and min
istry itave also rallied in the p rsons of their
most prominent members and miuisters to
uphold the foul and w nhering curse of sla
ry and to discourage the friends of human
lu dom and progress to sustain tbiscryiog

agetbe worst system of bondage by tbe
confessions and delmrattoos of slaveholders
themselves that ever saw the son
it is in this state of facta that the free
soil party has come into being and boldly
arrayed itself against the policy of these old
slavebolding parties the intelligence moral
worth and philanthropy and naineheal
strength and high ground assumed by this
new but powerful party makes it our doty to
inquire what course those who stand forth ss
r the friends of the slave ought to pursue to
rn ards that party are they to give it their
influence and encouragement or ought they
to oppose it ought they to encourage it for
the progress it has already made or condemn
jit for not having made more what is our
duty in the premises is the question tbe
free soil movement has virtually adopted the
leading doctrines and purposes set forth by
the american antislavery society at its
formation as the duty of the government
they declare that congress has no mote
power to make a slave than it has to make a
king they declare their purpose to be the
abolition of slavery w herever they possess the
constitutional power to do so consequently
slavery in the district of columbia and else
where would be abolished they projiose to
i free the federal government from all resonsi
bility for slavery he internal slave trade
with all its attendant horrors must therefore
he abolished they declare that there shall
e no more slave statesno more territories
and they have placed on their broad banner
j free soil free men free labor
j free speech and free stateswhile
i on the black flag of their opponents is slave
states slave tetritory slave labor
and slavery propagandism if success crown
the latter the slave power will be sirenglh
j ened slave slates will he admittedslave
representation will be increased and the
slavetrade with all its heartrending horrors
will be quickened and carried on to an extent
shocking to humanity if the former suc
ceed slavery in the district of columbia and
territories will be forever abolishedthe
slavetrade discontinued the slave power
hurled fr m dominion slavery circumscribed
hemmed in proscribed and detested will per
ish and die under the nations reprobation in
view of the circumstances what course
ought we the colored people and our peculiar
fuends to pursue there are ways open to
us we may stand off and act the part of
faultfinderspick flaws in the free soil plat
formexpose the weakness of some persons
connected with itsuspect and criticise their
leaders and in this way play into the hands of
our enemiesaffording them sticks to break
our own heads or wc may consign our
selves to oblivionconsent to die or live as if
the almighty did wrong in placing us on the
earth at this particular period of the wot ids
historylive in the past or so far into the
future as to be witollv unknown to tbe present
generation remain silent as if we were
speechless and let things take their own
course and thus morally to commit suicide
in neither of these ways can we go we j
feel it our duty to pursue that course which
will make us in some degree a terror to evil
doers aud a piaiee to all that do wellto act
in the living presentto be a worker on the
anvil now before usthat whatever influence 
we may possess it shall be given in the right
direction
while we are as deeply convinced as ever j
of the slaveholding charaster of the ameri j
can constitution aud are satisfied that it is
the duty of the free slates to separate from
the slaveholding states and are disposed in j
no way to abate or modify our testimony on
that point we feel no hesitancy in proclaiming j
our deep and sincere godspeed to this free
soil movement it is a movement springing
legitimately out of the principles which the
i american antislavery society and liberty
party have long been proclaiming and al
though it is not all we could ask or wish it is
nevertheless such a noble step in the right di
rection that we have no doubt that the
i movement will bo a progressive one in view
of this movement we bid the toilworn bond
man to lift up his head with hope slavery
with its many ills shall not much longer
reign the people at the convention wore
evidently in advance of their leaders nd
showed themselves ready to take higjier

cass and taylor parties tbeogh separate in

they belong to slavery their casdidates
are the candidates of slaverys own selection
and they both look to slavery as their present
help in this their time of need one of the
items set down against that convention by tbe
amerkan of this city is that president mahan
told the following irreverent story as illus
trating the feelings of the slaveholding parties
of our land he said that tbe present pre
dicament of the old parties reminded him of
the story of a nun who went borne to his
family after drinking a little too much his
wife said to him john why dont you come
to bed whats the matter with you are
you drunk john after remaining silent
lor some time said no lam not drunk
but  feel almighty discouraged the ex
ception taken to this stony and the solemn
lesson read to tbe president on the subject is
paltry enough as coming from any quarter
hut coming from the american tbe advocate
of the bloodhound candidate a profane mur
derer whose every word is accompanied by
some bloodchilling oath the man who when
on the fields of mexico when surrounded by
thousands of the dead and dying could cry
out with the fury of a demon give em hell
site em hell is entitled to the respect due
to the meanest hypocrisy
it is most too late in the nineteenth century
for slavery to find a secure shelter from at
tack by crawling behind the sacred altar of
religion the time ia at hand when it will
not do to bring piety to the aid of a man
stealer and to the support of manstealing
the fact that general taylor is a wellknown
robber and hired assassin stamps those who
sustain him for the highest office in the gift
of the nation as being anything else than fid
lowers of our meek and everblessed re
deemer we long to see the day when these
slaveholding sycophhnts of the north shall
find their pretended piety regarded as vile in
the eyes of all people we cannot under
stand the nature of that conscience which can
suport a wretch like gen taylor and yet
bs horrified at a word which may be tortured
into irreverence
domestic happiness
happiness is tliat earthly enjoyment which
cheers the spirits and makes good the heart
of man in every position in life there can
not be true happiness where it cannot be
found in the domestic circlearound the fire
side in the mutual affections emanating from
the bosom of man and wife patents and
children
moments ofjoy it is true raay rush for an
instant upon us an imaginary pleasure may
assuage for the time our feelings but ere that
fleet deceiver intrudes itself upon us a transit
of reflection will again depress the spirits and
the gloom of despair hangs heavily around
neither possessions nor w ealth can create
happiness they can facilitate or increase
but cannot create it man and woman to all
intents and purposes are equal and whatever
disparity there may appear is the result of
education and not a defect of nature in this
we mainly refer to the moral and intellectua
bearing of the subject though we might ad
duce an argument to prove it even physically
is man physically superior it may be tbe
result of a longcontinued education of mans
physical system while that of woman is re
strained even in childhood the boy is per
mitted and encouraged in exercises that the
girl ts prohibited and men pursue livelihoods
that woman is denied when the contrary is 
the case a contrary result is the certain effect
for example the indian woman whose
duty it is from childhood to till the soil
grind the corn carry the game and other bur
dens while that of man is tohunt fish and
join in the chass is much abler to withstand j
the fatigues of labor than the indian man
the same may be said of the hindoos and
other savage tribes whose men sre given to
idleness while the women labor we have
digressed and must resume
in all things common to both and in what
can either engage that is not common to both
man and wife should consult each other al
ways endeavoring to counsel to the best ad
vantage to the interests of both a seeming
opposition to the opinions of each should be
carefully avoidedboth endeavoring to harmo
nize withalways observing without mis
trust the most entire reliance in each others
wordtbe roost unshaken confidence in each
others integrity let every word be an ex
pression of kindness and affection between
husband and wife and fbiawih follow as a
water of course with ac children the par i
entsso acting will so instruct their children
to realize happiness first it must begin in
our own household within the bounds of our
own domestic circle every man and woman
should endeavor to make their owa boms a
place of happiness this being accomplished
w baterer may be the scenes with which we
are sammnded we cannot fail to realize hap
piness
equality

the first numbs t ef the above paper hai

the orgm of the african methodist episcopal
church her augustus richardson green
superintendent of the book concern editor
this as its name implies is a religious paper
iaaoed trom the ofiee formerly of the mystery
which establishment has been told out to th
methodist church connexion some may
manifest a disposition to reflect on the forroei
coodactors uf that paper for the course they hart
pursued but none who know the sacrifice
those gentlemen have madethe money from
time to time lakea from their private means
to sustain that paper will so reflect
at no period danng the existence of th
mystery did its subscription come near tti
expenses and nose know this better than the
writer of this article and bad it not been foj
the generosity of the pittsburghers by the
assistance of the ladies in holding the firs
of august levees the paper would long since
have stopped the paper had subscribers
sufficient but they did not payone of the
evils of receiving distant subscribers without
the cash but the proprietors determined to
 sustain an enterprise so well begun as well as
the credit of those concerned made continual
heavy sacrifices which they continued till the
present period although there must be
nearly one thousand dollars due them at a
distance they aie ia all probability in debt to
subscribers for advance payment when we
left the mystery we did it with reluctance
but for the purpose of entering into a more
useful position of labor as in our connection
with that paper it cost us not only our ser
vices which we gave gratuitously but money
besidesa portion of our time only being de
voted to the paper such as we could spare
while in our present position the whole of our
time is devoted to the enterprise either in or
out of the office hence our efforts must be
more available
we heartily commend the gentlemen of the
mystery for the course they have pursued as
an opportunity ensued in which they could
withdraw with credit to themselves and thus
relieve them of a heavy burden
one thing we are certain of we are not in
a condition yet in ihis country to sustain more
than one good efficient newspaperwe mean
secular paper try it who may and our ex
perience and knowledge in these matters are
equal to the best having made an estimate
we find that at least among the colored peo
ple the ratio of subscribers is but twenty
five to one thousand of a population two

in our walk yesterday we fell in company
with two mexican boys accompanied by one
of the returned volunteers we felt a con
cern for the unfortunate lads so far removed
from their naliveiandand desired to converse
but they could speak very little english we
asked the volunteer who accompanied them
how be came by them and who had them in
care he said one of them was his and the
other belonged to one of the officers he said
that hundred small boys were to be found
roving about the country in mexico apparent
ly without patents and that any number
dfiulj be had for the trouble of bringing them
away the pooi little fellows appeared in
fine spirits and seemed proud that they had
protector pittsburgh gazette
this is but one of those monstrous evils
the legitimate fruits of that most heaven 
daring outrage the invasion of the free terrij
tory of mexico by an army of slaveholders or
what is equally bad the subjects of a slave
holding dynasty as the united stales may
now be well termed
not content with the design of establishing
slavery in territory heretofore free untarnished
by the foot of a slave but by the above it
will readily be observed that kidnapping must
have been among the most common outrages
committed upon that defenceless people and
none will doubt but there is at this time many
a hapless youth doomed to drag out a life in
southern bondage and disconsolate mexican
parents mourning their loss to know if
indeed they were nut slain in the bloody
sieges which ensued
common and daring indeed must have been
the infernal custom of kidnapping mexican
children when a pauperized or upstart penn
sylvania private will dare bring to the benevo
lentfree city of pittsburgh a child and claim
him as belonging to him

the mexican girl there has been con
siderable talk in the city about the mexican
young woman brought by the duquesne
grays she was first noticed bv the mem
bers of the company at puebla she attract
ed their attention by her devotion to the sick
soldiers she furnished provisions to the
americans and did every thing her strength
and circumstances enabled her to do her
conduct excited the tnmityof her relatives
and she feared he might not be safe at home
this being known to capt herron and lieut
mann she vas invited to accept the protec
tion of the company and has been in the
ranks evet since in appearance he is en
tirely mexican quite feminine in manners and
conversation and the soldiers say she is pret
ty and intelligent she is eighteen years of
age her name is trinidad pittsburg post
another evidence of the evils of this cruel
and bloody crusade the idea of a company
of volunteer soldiers having ia their charge
thousands of miles from hooie a young wo
man is preposterousand that too one such
as americans are wont to deride and insult
as we are told she is entirely mexican which
is to be understood as yellow or copper color
we are surprised at the indifference with
which these things are noticed by editors gen
