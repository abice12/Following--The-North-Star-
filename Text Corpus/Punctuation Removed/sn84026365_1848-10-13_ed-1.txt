the following correspondence which
is apihmnled to the narrative of the life ol
fiicdkkick dot ciass although published
koui lime since will he new and interesting
to many of the readers of the north star
the writer thus introduces it to his readers
the following comments on my narrative
npieared very lately in the delaware repub
lican a newspaper published iu the most
northern of the slave stales and not very
remote from that part of maryland where niy
early days were spent although put lorth
ns a refutation of tny statements under the
unflattering title of falsehood refuted v
 have great pleasure in presenting it to tny
readers the writers admissions are valu
able as a confirmation of the main facts of my
narrative while the denials are only such as
might be be expected from an apologist ol
slavery
to the pifbeicfalsehood
refuted
it is with considerable regret that 
find myself measurably compelled to ap
pear before the public but my attentioi
lias lately been arrested by a pamphlei
which lias been freely circulated ii
wilmington and elsewhere with tin
following superscription extractsfron
a varraire of frederick douglass ai
american slave written by himself
and although i am aware that in
sensible unprejudiced person will credi
such a ridiculous publication wliici
bears the glaring impress of falsehoot
on every page yet i deem it expedieu
that i should give the public some in
formation respecting the validity of thi
narrative because  was for many year
u citizen of the section of country when
the scenes of the above mentioned nar
rativc are laid and am intimately ac
quainted with most of the gentlemei
whose characters are so shamefully tra
duced and i am also aware that tin
narrative was not written by the pro
fessed author but from statements o
this runaway slave some evil designet
person or persons have composed this
catalogue of lies to excite the indigna
tion of public opinion against the slave
holders of the south and have even at
tempted to plunge their venomous fungi
iu the vitals of the church
 shall therefore briefly notice some
of the most gliring falsehoods contained
in the aforesaid narrative and give i
true representation of the character o
those gentlemen who have been con
mired in such an uncharitable manner
ns murderers hypocrites and every
thing else that is vile
i indulge no animosity against th
fabricators and circulators of the nar
rative neither do i know them but i
positively declare the whole to be i
budget of falsehoods from beginning t
end
i ihe identity of the author
about eight v ears ago i knew this rec
reant slave by the name of fredericl
hailey instead of douglass h
then livd with mr kdward covey ant
was an unlearned and rather an ordi
nary negro and am confident he wai
not capable of writing the narrative ml
ludcd to hr none but an educate
man and one who had some knowledgt
of the rules of grammar could w rite s
correctly although to make the iiu
position at all credible the compose
lias labored to write it in as plain i
style as possible consequently tliede
tection of the first falsehood proves tin
whole production to be notoriously un
true
again it is a common custom ii
the pail of maryland from which  rai
away to separate children from thcii
mothers at a very early age
the north star
this also i know to be false there
is no such custom prevalent in that stx
lion of the country but on the contra
ry the children are raised with their
mothers and generally live with them
in the same house except in some few
instances where the mother is hired out
as a cook or laborer in some other fami
ly
the gentlemen whose names are so
prominently set forth in the said narra
 tive are cl kdward lloyd capt
anthony austin gore thomas lam
din not lanman giles hicks thomj
as auld and kdwin covey most of
these persons i am intimately acquaiut
i cd with and shall give a brief sketch
of their characters as follows
col edward lloyd was one of the
most wealthy and respectable planters
in the state of maryland he was at
one time the gevernor of the state and
for several years a member of the leg
islature he owned several thousand
acres of land and between  and 
slaves he died before i had much
 knowledge of him hut i know that he
was a kind and charitable man and in
every respect an honorable and worthy j
citizen
most of the same slaves are now
owned by his three sons and they man
age their servants in the same manner
as did their father and  know there
 are no such barbarities committed on
their plantations
could it be possible that charitable
feeling men could murder human be
ings with as little remorse of con
science as the narrative of this infa
mous libeller wishes to make us believe
and that the laws of maryland which
operate alike upon black and white
bond or free could permit such foul
murders to pass unnoticed no it is
impossible and every sensible man
knows that these false accusations are 
an ebullition of an unchristian preju
dice
capt anthony and giles hicks i
know but little of the accused mur
derer mr gore is a respectable citi
zen living near st michaels and i be
lieve a worthy mernberofthe methodist
episcopal church lie was formerly
an overseer for col lloyd and at this
time all who know him think him any j
thing but a murderer
thomas lamdin who it is said in
the narrative boasted so frequently
j of his murders is at this time an honest
school teacher iu the district w here i
formerly lived and all the harm that
can be said of him is that be is too
goodnatured and harmless to injure
any person but himself
capt thomas auld whose hypocriti
cal meanness is so strongly depicted iu
the aforesaid narrative was for many
years a respectable merchant in the
town of st michaels and an honorable
i and worthy member of the methodist
i episcopal church and only notable for
bis integrity and irreproachable chris
tian character he is now retired
 from the turmoil of a mercantile life
i and engaged in the worthy occupation
of tilling the soil little dreaming of the
foul accusations that are circulated
against him
edward covey the renowned negro
breaker is also a plain honest farm
er and a tried and faithful member of
the methodist episcopal church mr
covey lived for several years on a farm
adjoining inv fathers at which time this 
runaway negro lived with him and i
am well aware that no such bloody i
tragedy as is recorded in that lying
narrative ever occurred on mr coveys
farm all that can be said of mr coi
vey is that he is a good christian andi
t a hard working man and makes every
one around him work and treats theuij
i well ry his honest industry he has
t purchased a fine farm and is now reap
ing the reward of his labor
j such are the characters of the men
w orn the imposers of this dirty narra
live have so uncharitnbly traduced and
by blending these false accusations with
the methodist religion of the south
hey wish to lacerate her already bleed
ing wounds
 w as raised among slaves and havei
also owned them and am well aware j
that the slaves live better and fare bet
j ter iu many respects than the free
blacks
j yet i am positively opposed to sla
very for  know it is a great evil but
i iht evil falls not upon the slave but on
the owner i
j intrigue and false accusations will
j never liberate the slaves of the south j
i i but on the contrary every such attempt
i will only forge lor them new and strong
er fetters
let the tenderhearted philanthropist
of the north speak truth and love to
wards their southern brethren and
make a liberal application of their gold
for the removing of the blacks from the
country and their chance for success
i j will be more flattering
 have giveu a true representation of
 the persons connected with the afore
said narrative and  respectfully sub
mit the facts to the judgment of an im
partial public
a c c thompson
no  market street
jl wihuington del
 rsriv to mr a c c thompson
to the edilor of the liberator
dear friexd for the sake of our
j righteous cause  was delighted to see
ly an extract copied into the liberator
of lth of dec ihis from the dela
ware republican that mr a c c
thompson no  market street
w ilmington has undertaken to invali
date wy testimony against the slave
holders whose names  have made
prominent in the narrative of my expe
t lienee while in slavery
i slaveholders and slave traders never
rj betray greater indiscretion than when
 they venture to defend themselves or
right is of no sextruth is of no color god is the father of vs all and all we are brethren
their system of plunder in any other
community than a slaveholding one
slavery has its own standard of morali
ty humanity justice and christianity
tried by that standard it is a system
of the greatest kindness to the slave
sanctioned by the purest moralityin
perfect agreement with justiceand ol
course not inconsistent with christiani
ty hut tried by any other it is doom
ed to condemnation the naked rela
xation of master and slave is one ol
those monsters of darkness to whom
the light of truth is death the wise
ones among the slaveholders know this
and they studiously avoid doing any
thing which in their judgment tends
to elicit truth they seem fully to un
derstand that their safety is in their
silence they may have learned this
wisdom from junius who counselled
his opponent sir william draper
when defending lord granby never to
attract attention to a character which
would only pass without condemnation
when it passed without observation
i am now almost too far away to an
swer this attempted refutation by mr
thompson i fear his article will he
forgotten before you get my reply i
however think the whole thing worth
reviving as it is seldom we have so
good a case for dissection in any
country hut the united states i might
hope to get a hearing through the col
umns of the paper in w hich i was at
tacked hut this would bo inconsist
ent with american usage and magna
nimity it would be folly to expect
such a hearing they might possibly
advertise me as a runaway slave and
share the reward of my apprehension
but on no other condition would they
allow iny reply a place in their columns
in this however i may judge the
republicanharshly it may be that
having admitted mr thompsons arti
cle the editor will think it but fair
negro though i amto allow my reply
an insertion
iu reply to mr thompson i shall
proceed as i usually do in preaching
the slaveholders sermon dividing the
subjects under two general heads as
follows
ist the statement of mr thomp
son in continuation of the truth of my
narrative
d his denials of its truthfulness
under the tirst i beg mr thompson
to accept my thanks tor his free and
unsolicited testimony in regard to iny
identity there now need he no doubt
on that point however much there
might have been before your testi
mony mr thompson has settled the
question forever i give you the full
est credit for the deed saying nothing
of the motive but for you sir the
proslavery people in the north might
have persisted with some show of rea
son in representing me as being an im
poster a free negro who had never
been south of mason and dixons line
one whom the abolitionists acting on
the jesuitical principle that the end
justities the means had educated and
sent forth to attract attention to their
altering cause lam greatly indebted
to you sir for silencing those truly
prejudicial insinuatious i w ish i could
make you understand the amount ofser
vice you have done me you have
completely tripped up the heels of your
proslavery friends and laid them flat
at your feet you have done ft piece
of antislavery work which no antisla
very man could do our cautious and
truthloving people in new england
would never have believed this testimo
ny in proof of my identity had it been
i born by an abolitionist capable of bear
i ing false witness intentionally but such
j people are thought fanatical and to
j look at every thing through a distorted
medium they will believe youthey
will believe a slaveholder they have
some how or other imbibed and i con
fess strangely enough the idea that
persons such as yourself are dispassion
ate impartial and disinterested and
therefore capable of gving a fair rep
resentation of things connected with
slavery now under these circurn
j stances your testimony is of the utmost
i importance it will serve to give effect
to my exposures of slavery both at
home and abroad i hope  shall not
administer to your vanity when i tell
you that youseem to have been raised
up for that purpose i came to this
land with the highest testimonials from
some of the most intelligent and distin
j guished abolitionists in the united
states yet some have entertained and
expressed a doubt as to whether i have
ever been a slave you may easily
imagine the perplexing and embarras
ing nature of my situation and how
anxious i must have been to he reliev
ed from it you sir have relieved
me i now stand before the american
and british people endorsed by you as
being just what i have ever represent
ed myself to hean american slate
you say i knew the recreant slave
by the name of frederick hailey in
stead of douglass yes that was my
 name and leaving out the term re ere
ant which savors a little of bitterness
your testimony is direct and perfect
just what i have huig wanted hut yon
i are not yet satisfied you seem deter
mined to bear the most ample testimony
in my favor you say you knew rat
i when i lived with mr covey and
with most of the persons mentioned in
my narrativeyou are intimately ac
i quainted this is excellent then
mr edward covey is not a creature ol
my imagination hut really did and may
yet exist
you thus brush away the miserable
insinuations of my northern proslavery
i enemies that have used fictitious not
real names you say col lloyd
was a wealthy planter mr gore wai
once an overseer for col lloyd but
now living near st michael s is re
spected and you believe be is a mein
rochester n y friday october  
her of the methodist episcopal church j
mr thomas aukj is an honorable and
worthy me tuber of the methodist epis
copal church mr covey too is a
member of the methodist church and
ull that can be said of him is that he is
a good christianac kc do allow
me once more to thank you for this
triumphant vindication of the truth of
my statement and to show you how
highly i value your testimony i will in
form you that i am now publishing a
second edition of my narrative in this
country having already disposed of the
first i w ill insert your article with my
reply as an appendix to the edition now
in progress if you find any fault with
my frequent thanks you inay find some
excuse for me in the fact that i have
serious fears that you will be but poorly
thanked by those vrboae characters you
have felt it your duty to defend i am
almost certain they will regard you as
running before you were sent and as
having spoken when you should have
been silent under these trying cir
cumstances it is evidently the duty ol
those interested in your welfare to ex
tend to you such words of consolation
as may ease if not remove the pain ol
your sad disappointment but enougli
of this
now then to the second partor
your denials you are confident i did
not write the book and the reason of
your confidence is that when you knew
me i was an unlearned and rather an
ordinary negro well i have to admit
i was rather an ordinary negro when
you knew me and i do not claim to be
a very extraordinary one now but
you knew me under very unfavorable
circumstances it was when  lived
with mr covey the negro breaker
and member of the methodist church 
had just been living with master thom
as auld where i had been reduced by
hunger master thomas did not allow
me enough to eat well when i lived
with mr covey i was driven so hard
and whipt so often that my soul was
crushed and my spirits broken i was
a mere wreck the degradation to
which i was then subjected as i now
look back to it seems more like a dream
than a horrible reality i can scarcely
realize how i ever passed through il
without losing all my moral and intel
lectual energies i can easily under
stand that you sincerely doubt ill wrote
the narrative for if any one had told
me seven years ago should ever be
able to write such an one i should
have doubted as strongly us you now
do you must not judge me now by
what i then wasa change of circum
stances has made a surprising change
in me frederick douglass the free
man is a very different person from
frederick bailey the slave i feel
myself almost a new manfreedom has
given me new fife i fancy you would
scarcely know me  think i have al
tered very much in my general appear
ance and know i have in my manners
you remember when i used to meet
you on the road to st michaels or near
mr coveys lane gate i hardly dared
to lift my head and look up at you if
i should meet you now amid the free
hills of old scotland w here the ancient
black douglass once met his foes i
presume i might summon sufficient for
titude to look you full in the luce and
were you to attempt to make a slave of
me it is possible you might find me al
most as disagreeable a subject as was
the douglass to whom i have just re
ferred of one thing i am certain
you would see a great change in me
i i trust  have now explained away
your reason for thinking i did not
write the narrative in question
you next deny the existence of such
cruelty in maryland as i reveal in my
narrative and ask with truly marvell
ous simplicitycould it be possible that
charitable feeling men could murder
humau beings with as litle remorse as
the narrative of this infamous libeller
would make us believe and that the
laws of maryland which operate alike
upon black and white bond and free
could permit such foul murders to pass
unnoticed no you say it is impos
sible i am not to determine what
charitable feeling men can do but to
show what maryland slaveholders act
ually do their charitable feeing is to
be determined by their deeds and not
their deeds by their charitable feeling
the cowskin makes as deep a gash in
my flesh when wielded by a professed
saint as it does when wielded by an
open sinner the deadly musket does
as much execution when its trigger is
pulled by austin gore the christian
as when the same is done by beal
bondly the infidel the best way to
ascertain what those charitable feeling
men can do will be to point you to the
laws made by them aud which you say
operate alike upon the while and black
tbe bond and free by consulting the
statute law s of maryland you w ill find
the following any slave for
rambling in the night or riding horses
tin the day time without leave or run
i ning away may be punished bv whip
ping cropping branding in the check
or otherwise not rendering him unfit for
i laborp  then anotherany
slave convicted of petty treason mur
der or wilful burniug of houses may
be sentenced to have his right hand cut
off to be banged in the usual manner
the head severed from bis bodytbe
body divided into four quarters and
the head and quarters set up in the
most public places where such act
was committed ps c 
now mr thompson when you con
sider with what ease a slave may be
convicted of any one or all of these
i crimes bow bloody and attrocious those
laws appear yet sir they are bat the
breath of those pious aud charitable
j feeling men whom you would defend
lam sure i have recorded in i my nar
mv miwr opt
rative nothing so revoltingly cruel
murderous mod infernal as may be
found in your own statute book
you say that the laws of maryland
operate alike upon the white and black
the bnd and free if you mean by
this that the parties named arc all
equally protected by law you perpe
trate a falsehood as big as that told by
president polk in his inaugural address
it is a notorious fact even on this side
of the atlantic that a black man cannot
testify against a white man in uny
court in maryland nor aßy other slave
state if you do not ku w this you
are rather to be pitied than censured
i will not say that the detection of this
falshood proves all you have said to
be falsefor i wish to avail myself of
your testimony in regard to my ioden
titybut i will say you have made
yourself very liable tv suspicion
i will close theseremark s by saying
your positive opposition to slavery is
explained and will be well understood
by antislavery men when you say the
evil of tbe system does not fall upon
the slave but the slaveholder this
is like saying that the evil of being
burnt is not felt by the person burnt
but by him who kindles up the fire about

sir if the simplicity and man

do i should not have placed your name
at the head of this communication il
your present position as a firm friend ol
freedom equality and brotherhoodwere
less worthy of admiration than it is it
would not have occurred to me submit
toyou the brief statements which i juro
posc to make on this occasion this is
a territory which belongs to the united

the whole people i write in sight of
the national capitol here reside the
sovereignty and responsible power of
the entire people in their oneness the
voice of a great monarch speaks here

course the majority wherever it re

as well as the controlling influence of
an illustrious example will be the com

never enter into partnership with ty
ranny and despotism the idea of such
a compromise is preposterousunpos
 sihle the constituent elements of the
two are natural and inevitable antago
nists the one or the other will tri
i umph in the end and rule in the sphere
i which it occupies without a rival the
very object of acquiring this territory
at the outset was to make sure of a
place for future utterance and untrain
rncled activity in the most liberal sens
of a democratic platform sad to say
the spirit of northern freedom from the
beginning has been suffocated in this
den of tyranny no man from the
north speaks and acts with the ease
and naturalness here which he is ac
customed to do at horde there is a
certain measured tone in his language
a certain caution and stiffness in his
movements of which he would be
heartily ashamed among his neighbors
jor constituents i need not remind you
of this you have resided here and
can readily feel the point of what i say
one is overawed by a ferocious cor
rupt public sentiment dictated by the
 tvrant enste the voice of another is
stifled by the love of place or rather
through the dread of losing it
i a very remarkable scene bat been
witnessed here within a few weeks past
such proceedings have been had in the
united slates criminal court fer tbe
district before judge crawford as k
seems to me will astonish thinking peo
ple i dare say you have noticed the
trial of drayton and sayres as report
led in the papers it is that which i al
lude to these two men were accused
of stealing certain persons who were
found on board the schooner pearl
j they are both of them men of fair and
i respectable standing among their ac
i quaintances in philadelphia to deal
carries in it the design to sell the pro
perty taken to make gain aad profit ol
it so the district attorney gets a
i grand jury to find fortyone indict
ments against each of these men and
also against english a young man who
was with them but was at last after a
fear maths unjustifiable imprison
ment discharged without a trial the
persous claimed belonged to forty one
assumed ownersthat is there were al
leged fortyone distinct acts of deal
big but there were in fact seventy
four persons on tb pearl claimed u
slaves tlie district attorney there
fore got the irand jury to indict each
of the three men drayton sayres
and englishfor the distinct offence ol
aiding away each of these seventyfout
persons claimed as slaves thus forty
one indictments were found against eacli
of them for stealingthat is one hun
dred and twentythree in all grand
total three hundred and fortyfire
the penalty for stealing is  years
imprisonment for each offence and foi
aiding away a fine of two hundred dol
lars in each case of conviction these
indictments are found under two dis
tinct statutes which are among the
laws of maryland of long standinganc
are made applicable to this district il
at all by an act of congress eng
lish is discharged a  i said drayton
is sentenced to twenty years in the pen
itentiary sayres on precisely the
same state of beta and shearing by the
prosecution is acquitted of stealing
and convicted of aiding both now lie
in jail as an appeal is taken to the cir
cuit court which does not hold a term
till october it was not my purpose to
pass a criticism upon the details of this
monstrous and profligate proceeding
within the sacred precincts of a united
states court that will soon he done
and the whole record spread out foi
public inspection by a far abler ham
than mine at least i hope it will am
do iot doubt it i will say however
that the repeated outrages upon the
common sense commou decency ant
the rightful forms of law as they are
conceived and maintained throughout
the bounds of the civilized world com
mitted in the progress of this trial by
both the prosecuting officer and the
judge are a deep disgrace to us all
and will continue to be so till a revers
al of the whole proceedingtill they
are driven from the station which they
occupy hut to disgrace
let me state the casethe whole ol
itsimply as may be a numerous fam
ily supposed bv the best lawyers in
washington and by the community to
he fairly and legally entitled to their
freedom whilst it was yet in controver
sy applied through a colored man to
drayton to take them off without
knowing their names or the circum
stances further he consented to do it
if they could get on hoard his vessel
as was perhaps inevitable other per
sons who were actually sold or were
liable to be every day became ac
quainted with the fact that the mastei
of a vessel not unfriendly to them was
here or would be here at a certain
time in the depths of their distress ai
the idea of on immediate transportation
to the horrors of a new orleans slav
market they rushed on board of a ves
sel which they trusted in god might
land them on friendly free soil dray
ton never saw one of them nor heard
the name of one of them till he was on
his way down the potomac the day af
ter they went on board nothing was
proved against him on the trial except
that these persons were on the vessel
with himthat is the whole of itwith
every conceivable inference and impli
cation on his side that he intended to
bring them to a free state that was
altogether sufficient to clear him from
the imputation of theft or crime in the
rational construction of the law as it is
but i have said enough on this point
your reflections will well supply the in
cidents and drapery
let ine detail to you a few facts con
nected h this affair of the schooner
pearl and a few illustrations of slave
ry in our federal district
the beil familydaniel bell is
a robust worthy industrious man a
native of prince georges county be
low washington he has worked
most of the time for twenty years past
at the navy yard in the smiths shop
where heavy iron work is cost and
moulded many years since tho mas
ter of bell ia a rage because the
owner of his wife had set her free by
deed sold him to the speculators they
came into the shop while at his work
without warning he was knocked flat
to the floor by them ironed and car
ried to the traders pen then kept in
seventh street on the avenue bell
had friends who pitied him and his
distressed wife and children they
induced a colouel somebody of the
marine corps to purchase hirn and
give him a chance to work out his
freedom bell was to pay a thousand
dollars for himself he had actually
paid the amount or near it when his
owner the colonel was ordered to
florida where he died it was then
found that he had mortgaged bell to
his sisterirtlaw for a thousand dollars
before leaving home she demanded
of bell the whole sum but he sunk in
despair and told her he must die a
slave after all for he never could raise
that amouot through the interven
tion of a trusty friend thomas blag
den who had from the first endorsed
bells notes for him he grt the price
finally reduced to five or six hundred
dollars the sum of the matter is
bell has the receipts to show that he
has actually paid for himself
he got his freedom papers complete
only last year some time his wife
some years since when die had six
children was made free by the express
deed of her master which was to take
effect at his death and that took place
a few days after the deed waa execu
ted she was recorded in the clerk s
office as free and remained so for eight
years having had two children in tile
time her children by the deed
were to be free as they suceasivejy
arrived at a certain agesay twenty
five after a lapse of eight years and
when there were eight children sad
two graod children the widow set up a
claim to the ole group eleven in h
poor bu had recourse to lawyers and
john mci f
whole no
kut with little prospect of g
rrarm of grirva nce the widow
w constantly seeking t y hand on
them to obtain the price of tbeir sinew
irora the speculators or she took their
i wages without allowing them the first
red cent for clothes this is the con
duct of the widow greenfield living
near the navy yard f
as his last and only hope poor bell
put his family on the pearl they
were brought back and with the ex
ception ot his wife and two younger
children were all sold and scattered
over the south god knows where
the wife and one child mr rlagdetf
redeemed for bell and the sum is now
making up at the northfour hundred
dollars this is the family that were
referred to with so much effect by mr
slingerland the representative from
our albany district at the tins of thq
flagitious transaction fast spring
the kdmotsox ffhsulv paul
edmonson was born into slavery in
montgomery county maryland eigh
teen miles from this city he wcitl lives
in the same neighbourhood at the
age of fortytwo he obtained hia free

acquired a comfortable little homestead
of forty acres on which he now lives
at the age of seventy years he has
reared a family of fifteen children
fourteen are still alive one a daugh
ter having died at the nge of sixteen
his wife milly was also born to tho
sad inheritance of bondage and is still
a slave at an early period in tho
distribution of an estate she fell to the
lot of one rebecca culver the two
have grown up together from childhood
the mistress was not reckoned quito
comos and has always had a guardian
of her person and trustee of her pro
perty he person now her guardian
and trustee is francis yaledenur
whose wife is a neice of his ward and
an heir apparent of her estate mr
valdenur is a inan of some standing in
the neighbourhood and is a state
tobacco inspector at baltimore
these kdmonsons arc not an ordinary
family as you will perceive in tho
sequel they have the impulses of
manhood and freedom gushing through
their veins some fifteen years since
when the second son whose name is
hamilton arrived at full manhood he
attempted to snap his ignoble chains
and reach the north to be his own
man and guide under god he was
caught taken back and sold for oo
to new orleans in june last his
brothers and sisters who were on tho
pearl met him there and found he
had just obtained his freedom for siouu
which he had earned and saved over
and above his tasks as a slave five
of the sisters now reside in washing
tonthey are masrted there and are
all of them in comfortable circum
stances fine in their personal appear
ancemodest wellbehaved estimable
women all of them one of them paid
oo only for herself she was an in
valid the doctor told her she would
soon die and she had better not make
the attempt her reply was  do
it and be free if i die the next hour
another paid  for he freedom
whose constitution was delicate the
oldest a noblelooking nobleminded
woman purchased her rights at 
some years ago before prices were as
high as at present the two younger
of these five married sisters paid oo
apiece for themselves four brothers
and two younger sisters emily and
maria were on the pearl they vert
brought back with the rest and sold co
the speculators for the new orleans
market for  apiece all round now
cast up and it will appear that tho
trustee of the demented old maid has
actually realized from the sale of this
one family the offspring of a sing fa
slave mother the sum of  the
two youngest childrena very likely
boy and girlarc still left they are
so much capital in hand to be traded
upon at the first convenient time but
this family was entirely nurtured and
brought up by the father and each aa
soon as arrived at the working age
has been put out at wages for the ex
clusive benefit of the old rnaid without
sense or rather for that of those who
choose to be her heirs it would be
fact worthy of ones curiosity to know
how much peeciscly they have earned
and paid over i said four of the
brothers and two sisters were sold to
new orleans one brother richard
has been bought brought back and
made free hu sisters have also been
brought back and are now in the trad

an appeal will soon be made the
other three brothers have been sold ia

of all parties throughout the union to the
following statement in regard to the guberna
torial election in this stale
the cleveland llcrald the leading taylor
paper in northern ohio has w ith becoming

new york print that the election of search

ample has been followed by some other tav
or papers
it is not improbable however that out of
ohio and not impossible that by some reck
less presses even in ohio this groundless
brim may be asserted after our election on
the second tuesday of october
it is iinoriaul that this matter be rightly
understood ibr nothing can he more certain
than that if such a claim could lie justly
made general ford would be defeated by aii
unprecedented majority
gen ford was nominated indeed by a
whig state convention hut it was months
liefore the dissolution of the whig party by i
the philadelphia nomination and he was 
nominated as a declared and resolute support
r of the wiimot proviso and of kindred
antislavery measures
since the nomination of taylor gen ford
has maintained the positions which he previ
onslv occupied he is still a firm friend of
the proviso known and acknowledged to lx
mich by all whether friends or opponents i
he has not indeed declared for whom he
shall vote m the presidential election but he
has given no countenance to any claim that
he will votf for gen taylor
on the other hand we are not advised that
goo ford has expressed any intention to
vote fir the candidates of the free democra j
ry it is certain however that the candidate i
iir congress iu gen fords district noraij
listed by a whig convention assembled since
the taylor nomination is one of the most
earnest and able supporters of mr van hur
on in our state it is also certain that mr
riddle the nominee of the whig county
convention of geauga gen fords own
eouniy is also a warm and decided advocate
i mr an liurvub election and we are
assured by intelligent and reliable men that

a large proportion of the free soil votes will
be given to gen ford
the election of gen ford will therefore
indicate the weaknen rather than the strength
of gun taylor in ohio he is not a tajdor
candidate his election will bo no teat of

j it is ocr dcliftekaft ofikio that thu
state or onto cam j mo cf est bk cam
j mini for okm taylor we are confident
of a heavy majority over cass and taylor
both in the counties of the western reserve
if our friends in the other parts of the state
do their whole duty we believe that the vote
of the state can be given to van burcn
the real contest in ohio is between van bnr

visit to philadelphia
wc have seldom spent two weeks more
agreeably or usefully than those which we
have just passed in the city of brotherly
love at the urgent request of several de
voted friends oi the cause in that place we
were reluctantly induced to leave our editorial
post for the purpose of holding a scries of
meetings in that city among the colored peo
ple and thereby extend the circulation of the
north star in the pleasure which the visit
afforded the numerous friends and acquaint
ances made the increased knowledge of the
social condition of our people acquired sub
scriptions to the north star obtained and
ihe general and we trust praiseworthy good
lone we feel abundantly compensated for the
toil and inconvenience to which absence from
our editorial duties invariably subjects us of
the meetings of the first week our
delany has already informed you they
were such as would have cheered the hearts
of freedoms friends and chilled the blood of
tyrants to have witnessed they were large
generous enthusiastic and unanimous there
was never so general an interest excited
among the colored people of that city be
fore the whole population seemed moved
by a general impulse from lombard street to
west philadelphia and from thence to the
northern liberties the cause of freedom
rolled sweeping all befure it for much of
the interest excited the cause is largely in
debted to the welldirected cltorts of charles
lenox rcinond he had in company with
hr bias george w goines liev messrs
galbrath and catto and other devoted friends
of frerkloin kept up a constant fire upon the
proslavery churches and ministry of phila
delphia when nearly exhausted the ap
pearance of m if delany refreshed and in
vigorated them for a renewal of the contest
and they were in full blast when we arrived
many of the colored churches had been closed
against the discussion little wesley pre
sided over by rev mr catto was fur a time
almost the only house where the cause of the
ilave could ire freely pleaded brick wesley
i large and commodious building presided

shiloh baptist church presided over by rev
s serrington threw open its doors next
bethel church in west philadelphia threw
its doors open next and last though not
least the union and zoar churches in the
northern liberties were opened to the cause
next the churches most hostile to the anti
slavery movement and bitterly opposed to
rpeuing their doors are stephen gloucesters
st thomass and large bethel these
lirec arc closed against discussion and for
rnrious reasons the first of this proslavery
rio is presided over by one of the vilest
raitors to ins race that ever lived when

him to denounce publidy the antislavery

guilty position of the free church such a
man might well be expected to close his

a wretch that has recently signalized himself
by wilting and speaking to prove slavery a
divine aod not an infernal institution one
almost feels a wish in view of the baseness
and treachery of this same gloucester lhat
hemight be subject to slavery and the lash
at least long enough to have his eyes opened
on the subject this evangelical defender of
slaveholding was invited to preach in glou
centers pulpit while we were there and if
he had chosen he might have vindicated sla
i very from the bible in that pulpu and iu the
i presence of a number of fugitive slaves the
course of this recreant black man would make
us ashamed of our race if we did not know
him to be an exception to it we turn from
him as from a viper for morally speaking he
is such
in point of hostility to the antislavery
movement st thomass church stands next
its doors are barred against the cause of the
slave and to its pulpit are welcomed kpiaco
 palian slaveholders and slavery defenders it
is truly astonishing that colored men those
who have endured many of the horrors of
slavery can stand in religious fellowship with
men who are the every day robbers of their
i fellowmen of all their rights these men
witness the sorrows of the bondman see his
back scarred with the tyrants lash and then
hug to their communion aud fellowship the
guilty wretch who perpetrates the fiendish
outrage we know that colored episco
palians as well as white ones excuse them
selves for not opening their churches to anti
slavery meetings on the grouud that those
churches are dedicated to the worship of god
and that it would there r ore be using the
house of god impropeily misappropriating it
to throw it open for such purposes we are
willing to give this doctrine all the weight it
deserves it may be conscientiously believed
and so far deserves some respect but the
fact that such a superstitious doctrine is held
by any colored man in this country shows the
necessity for a more radical reform than we
have hitherto attempted the jewish reli
gion sanctified times and places and set them
apart for certain forms and ceremonies christ
found them all in existence and left them de
stroyed after him lie placed mercy above
sacrifice man above thedfabbathand worship
above lime or place we claim to be com
plete in him regarding the old law as a
schoolmaster we approach the ffue prophet
whom we are to hear in all things now
i what does christ say on the subject of wor
j ship and places of worship but the hour
 comclhand now is when the true worshippers
 shall worship the father in spirit and in
truth for the father scckelh such to worship
him god is a spirit and they that worship
j him must worship him in spirit and in truth
the idea of temple worship here is clearly
disclaimed to build a house to god and
i regard it as being too holy in which to plead
the cause f injured man is like tithing
mint amiise and cummin and omitting the
weightier matters of the law it is to make
clean the outside of the cups and the platter
whilst disregarding the uncleanness within
it is not holiness of limber but holiness of
heart that god enjoins it is not churches of
bricks and mortar of wood and paint of
brass and iron the house which god re
quires is a spiritual one ye also as lively
stones are built up a spiritual house a holy
priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices unto
god by jesus christ now the notion
for such wc must call itof regarding houses
w ith peculiar reverence aud thinking that the
almighty regards them with any sjecial fa
vor is diametrically opposed to the very gen
ius of c hristianity and has no sanction in
the new testament scriptures houses are
for men they need themgod does not
he fills immensity of space with his presence
and may well ask where is the bouse ye
build unto me wc need housesmeeting
houses if you please but we need tliera for
manfor his improvement elevation and
freedom and any worship which does not
contemplate this in the most enlarged and
comprehensive sense is blind superstitious
and antichristian yet we are bound to
say that this worship is almost the only visible
worship that the world presents our wor
ship abounds w ith honor for god and con
tempt for man away with all such worship
the skiiier the world is rid of it the belter
it is unmeaning and may he per
formed by the bad as well as the gmlslave
holders slaetraders thieves and bars may
engage in it with all the outward solemnity of
saints and it leaves them as wicked as ever
as much devoted to hair sms as ever to
worship god is to worship goodness to be
wholly devoted to good m imitate christ
who went about doing good to love and
adore god for his goodness and to strive to
be like god in doing good is the true wor
ship let us ask our friends of st thomass
church philadelphia if they think slav
very contrary to goodness aud if so bow
they ran close their doors agamst those who
are limiting to mourn it they will answer
us that they have s rmion against allowing
any person who has not urn ordained oreo
pying their church here again they exah
the form ngardless of the power of godli
ness the devil in holy orders would be
received while christ utmrdained would be
rejected such a religion will do very well
foi ihe oppressors but aby intuits mi hod
to the oppressed we call upon william
douglass the minister of that church to
break his chains and those of his church

dosed at this time is a mystery we wen
informed that the minister and people wen
wilting to base the boose opened bat that th
trustees were divided and that the chord
was in great difienby about matters of ibei
own onneeru this however is noexetai
for them at the very mention of the bond
mans name and the slightest chance o
striking a blow for the overthrow of opprea
fuon they ought to have forgotten minor dif
terences and rallied as ooe man to the rescue
but such vras far from being the case the 
saw the people eager to hear the truth block
ing up the street in front of little wesley
unable to gain admission within its narrow
walls and ourselves begging the use of thcii
bouse and they closed it against us wi
say to these churches one and all you art
standmg in yottr own lightyou are playtnj
into the bands of your enemies and sealing
your own degradation
we have given the foregoing notice of th
churches named with no desire to reflect un
justly upon the antislavery members o
them of whom we are glad to say there art
many but to record instructive facts u
which qur children and coming generation
may turn and ascertain some of the difficul
ties with which those who labored for theii
righto and liberties had to grapple ever
among our own brethren it will be a pain
ful and deeply mortifying fact for those wht
come after us to look back upon that in tb
year one thousand eight hundred and forty
eight when the whole world seemed movet
on the question of human rights and our owt
land was agitated by movements designed u
promote our happiness as a people the veri
churches and ministers of our owm complex
ion and suffering many of the hardships and
grievances sought to be removed stood side
by side with the oppressors and instead ol
aiding the cause of their own redemption
opposed the elforts to gain it with all the
means in their power we call upon those
churches to throw open their doors to the dis
cussion of slavery and the means necessary
to our improvement and elevation this they
must do or be execrated by coming genera
tions as the worst enemies of their own va
riety of the human family it is plain that
whatever improvement has taken place in
our condition during the last fifteen years has
been chiefly the result of the antislavery
sentiments given to the public by abolition
ists now to shut the doors of the churches
against those emancipating truths and senti
ments is thus far to shut the public ear and
darken the public heart on the subject it is
to do our best to silence free discussion to
smoother freedom of speech and to allow all
things to remain as they we have ne
hesitancy in saying that if those colored church
es which shut their doors against the cause oi
the slave had the power they would shut ev
ery chuich in the land against the discussion
of slavery they would silence every lecturer
and banish every press favorable to the dis
cussion of human rights they would play
the tyrant as readily and as bitterly as do our
white oppressors we leave these churches
to their intelligent members whom we are
sure will give them no peace while they re
main iu tbcii present slaveholding position
we now turn to the signs of encourage
ment and cheer which greeted us among the
colored people of philadelphia ami not the
least among these was the interest taken in
the cause by some of the most influential la
dies in that city at the first meeting which
we attended a desire was expressed that some
ladies volunteer to obtain subscribers to the
north star and in a very few moments wc
had nearly a dozen ladies volunteering to do
their best in this department among these
we may mention the name af mrs james
foster mrs bias mrs joseph cassey mrs
stephen smith miss bustel and some young
ladies who might shrink from having their
names made thus public to these ladies we
arc indebted for a considerable accession to our
subscription list for which they have our sin
cere thanks if these lend their aid we defy
opposition mainly through the help of these
ladies a society called the philadelphia north
star association intended especially to akl
the north star and to promote the circulation
of truth by assisting antslavery agents was
formed and put in operation from he forma
tion of this society we anticipate much good
to our cause through the country at large
another encouraging fact is that a conven
tion was held during three days in brick
wesley crowded to overflowing with a deep
iv interested audience before whom the sub
ject of our duties to the slave and ourselves
was thoroughly canvassed the convention
was mainly addressed by dr bias mivlin
gibbs robert purvis of byberry charles
lienox remond henry highland garnet
stephen smith george goines william
whipper rev mr galbrath rev mr
catto and many others who displayed a zeal
and devotion to the cause not less worthy than
those whose names we have just mentioned
the convention was such as was never held
hi that city before and long rili it be remem
bered as the commencement of letter days in
that place it was a free conventionas free
to our foes as to om friends and there were
not wanting men to oppose us some of them
had evidently learned their lesson well it
sounded rather strange however to have col
ored men preferring the old maddog charge
of infidthy antisabbath antickurch anti
ministry ac against the abolitionists
these stale charges caught from the lips of
their evangelical oppressors were blown into
our cars by a mr wean and bowers with
all the enthusiasm of newly discovered truth
poor fellows they were wordy echoing the
stale slang of slaveholder put krth tn pro
long their infernal reign over their heartbro
ken bondmen they dule know that it is the
religion of our enslavers which must be repu
diated before the colored mao can be five in
accepting the white mans christianity for our
souls we accept hts chains for out limbo
u spurn both oqr god is opposed t sla
very the slaveholders god samiiou sla

our christ loves the slave the while mans
christ has no sympathy with the slave but as

somewhat lengthy though eery imperfect let
ter respecting our visit to philadelphiabe
cause we attach great importance to that point
as a place which more than almost any other
in our land holds the destiny of our people
the colored population there is largecum
bering from twentyfire to thirty thousand
 soulsand these are ranously conditioned
among them we are proud to say there are
many who are well informedmany who take
a warm and intelligent interest in the subject
of our eferation from degradation to respecta
bility some of these are not only educated
but persons of wealth and standing in commu
nity commanding the respect of all who know
them candor however compels us to cou
fess that this description of persons form a
minority of the people of that citv uufortu
nately for us as with allr oppressed people
oppression not only begets a character ia the
oppressor favorable to the continuance of his

we are to arouse this class of persons to a
 sense of their manhood to instil into their
minds higher ideas of truth and duty to
awaken them to their social degradation and
to inspire them with higher aims than those
which have hitherto distinguished them is a
work of great practical importance their

just commenced in the city of philadelphia
it is under the editorial charge of dr wil

by oliver johnson esq formerly of the

say that the paper will be ably conducted oi
that the cause of human freedom will be pro
moted by its existence such a paper as tht
republic promises to be is greatly needed in
philadelphia and we doubt not it will meel
with a liberal support we learned while
in philadelphia that not fewer than five
thousand copies of the daily ledger were
taken by the colored people alone we trust
they will see lhat the daily republic will
answer their business purposes as well as the
ledger and we are sure that they will find in
ils columns much more that is elevating to
them as a class than they now do in that
paper we should support those papers

authority of the patent office the effect of
slavery upon the inventive and productive
genius in this table there ate twentytwo
classes of inventions enumerated embracing
all kinds of scientific mechanical and agricul
tural instruments in each case of compari
son the result is largely in favor of the free
states the w hole is summed up as fol

the seven free states from

toial number of patents for inven
tions and discoveries issued to
the six slave state from  to
 
total excess in favor of free states lh
it thus apj ears adds the writer u that the
aggregate number of patents issued in the rex
slave states is ntt quite oneseventh of the
entire number taken out by the whole thirteen
states there is reason also for the belief
lhat southern inventions are as much inferior

to erect a house of industry frr colored per

fearful atrocity these commissioners mot on
the evening of monday oct ad a day arr
ow hereafter to ho hold sowed to the see ah
of hunkcnstn and passed the following
preamble and resolutions
whereas a petition has been presented to
this hoard which seta forth that a building io
about to be erected on catharine near seventh
street within this distrirt which is to be oc
cupied as a house of industry for poor and
degraded negroes t
and whereas it is represented hy the pe
titioners that the erection of a boilding to ho
occupied for such a purpose in a thrifty and
improving neighborhood w hich ts densely set
tled by white people will create a disturb
ance or will drive away the white populalisn
and thereby depreciate the value of property
therefore
resolved that io the opiuien of this board
the black population of our city and county
ia already sufficiently cared for and the
chanties that now exist are ample to supply
the w ants wf ail of them that are worthy aad
deserving
resolved hist the erection of a building
for such a purpose in such a neighborhood
as that within which it is intended that thin
shall be erected manifests a wanton and reck
less disregard of public sentiment and a con
tempt for the feelings of the neighboring in
habitants
resolved that if those who have contri
buted to the fund for the erection of this
building are determined to waste their
means in visionary schemes of philanthropy
justice dictates that they should concentrate
the objects of their charily m their ow n neigh
borhood near their ow n doors where if
they create a nuisance they may suffer the
consequences of it or if it is a public benefit
they may be eyewitnesses of its great ad
vantages
resolved that all buildings to be used for
purposes to which public sentiment isopposed
and which are thereby likely to create a dis
turbance or commotion should be erected
within the limits of the city of philadelphia
whose great resources enable it to keep a
powerful police and thereby extend at all
times ample protection to both persona and
property
oh the hardness of heart that can be
guilty of the wickedness of driving away tho
respectable and liberalminded w hite popu
lation of that district none but a nero
or a caligula could he guilty of such an atro
cious wickedness besides the black pop 
ulalion of oui city and county and they might
have added of our country is already suffi

says he will veto the wilmot proviso or any
other proposed act of legislation which would
so grossly violate all the claims of justice as
to exclude the colored population while
under the protection of their kind and benev
olent guardians from any portion of the terri
tory of these united stales and in penn
sylvania and other northern stales the col

no doubt as an act of charity towards them
from engaging in any but the most menial
and dependent employments and in phila

olence when it is proposed io erect a house

the board aad slavery
the lamentably proslavery character of
the board may be gathered from the fol
lowing exiraets from the report of proceed
ings at a recent meeting to what puiposo
is it for men to preach piety and make pre
tensions of zeal for the cause of god when
they are thus dead to every sense of doty to
wards man their phylactariea like those
of the pharisees of old may be brood enough
and their prayers long enough but it may bo
said of them as of their jewish prototypes

to the cherokee and choctaw missions
treatmentas a general thing slaves
among the indians are believed not to be over
tasked often they have too little to do in

hardly possible that slaves in the hands of
indians should fare as well as in the hamls of

the legislation of the choctaws had been
less enlightened than that of the cbcrokees
seysre laws were enacted against tbs promul

groes to enter the nation ott u 
lt was enacted that no negro stave should be

her i hlanchard of illinois rose ami its
marked that he had hoped to agree with the
report though it was only the second owe
in of the board he had ever attended and
was probably the bet he should attend fur
many years if not forever he felt it bis duty
very briefly to state the reasons why he could
not eoneur in the report he would frankly
say he was opposed to potting off the discus
won of this subject and he would beg the
indulgence of the hoard for a short time to a
statement of his reasons
the report says not a word about the very
significantletters from the choctaw mission
to the hoard and advises the postponement of
the discussion till the correspondence is fin
ished hare we not all the material facu
and does the discussion require anything more
than the material fact it i not pretended
that we have not all the facts on which a de
cision is to rest when then if not now
will the discussion be proper
he would call the attention of the brd to
some of these facts in the correspondent
with the cherokee mission he would ac
knowledge that though there was no strong
sentiment of hostility to slavery expressed by
the ifeskioniric there was a faint anticipation
that slavery would be finally overcome by
christianity but the choctaw mission was
hy its own showing incorrigibly proslavery
it receives slaveholders into the communion
of the mission church and makes then slave
holding no more an objection than it makes
the slavery of the slave in receiving them
and it not only does this but in the pulpil
d m the private conversation of liie mission
aries all reference to slavery as an evil or a
ain is avoided more than that in spite of
the remonstrances of the secretaries ofthe
hoard for  vears the choctaw mission
school is served hy slaves t aii the work of
the institution was done hy slaves
ho would propose two resolutions as an
amendtnsnt to the report
first that this board distinctly admits
and affirms the principle that shveholding
is a practice not to he allowed in the christian
church
s cond that it is in the judgment of this
b md the duty of the missions  the chero
kee and choctaw nations to abolish the prac
tice of hiring slaves to do the work ol th ir
schools and to conform to the recommenda
tion of the secretary mr treat that slavo
holding should lie pritna facie evidence against
an applicant for admission to the church
for  years the choctaws had been vio
lating the reeomin midationsof the sicretaries
and in the meantime the world had not been
asleep on this snliject gentlemen who only
claimed to be governed hy expediency were
arising and taking strong ground on this sub
ject should we allow the politicians to be
eomc better saints than we on this question  i
the resolutions offered by mr blanchard
amending the report were rejected after a
motion to reconsider had prevailed mr
blanchard stated his willingness to withdraw
his resolutions if they with a minute of ins
course could he entered upon the records of
the board he ashed this in behalf id
those whom he represented bcfoie the board
mr blanchards request was then complied
with and his resolutions are to he recorded
with the other proceedings
these proceedings need no comment
they tell of ihenriselves with sufficient clear i
ness the disgraceful fact that the jloard of
commissioners of foreign missions sanction
and encourage the sum of all villanies

curitch action on votingthe n y
ivangolist gives the following as the vote of
a majority of the members of a congrega
tional church in north marshfield mas
when will all the churches throughout the
country prove their right to the title chris
tian by acting out the spirit of this resolu
tion the ktangelist says
it is rather a novel sphere fot church ac
tion but as it respects one of the gravest
duties which belong to a man and one which
lias an intimate connection with morality and
religion perhaps it is not to he considered as
an improper sphere w ithout reference to
tins particular case it seems to us that a
little more of the conscientiousness which
christians are wont to observe in their purely
ecclesiastical transactions might lie profitably
carrie  into their political doings and decisions
the action of the marshfield church is this
resolved that confiding in the help of
almighty god we will not knowingly employ
our right of suffrage or our influence at the
approaching election to elevate to any civil
office a slaveholder or any abettor of slave
holding for any consideration or in any cir
cumstances whatever
and though few an i humble hut con
scious that every man has influence and is
accountable fer its right use we publish this
resolve wishing to contribute our mite

plunder them under the direction of sain

would have come before the common pleas

of some interest

 jxcept  cents in advance on signing his
papers he had not received a cent of his vra
ges and having lost by the same captain
many months wages before he bought an
action to recover the sum of  due him by
the last contract
for want of bail the captain placed in the
bauds of the officer who served the wntsloo
and took legal advice according to which he
preferred offnog to youngs lawyer o to
settle the money was accepted and there
was an end of the matter thus far one sees
nothing to wonder at except that young mr
young should have been so very lenient as to
take o for a good claim to sto for servi
ces performed or that he could have found a
lawyer so modest in lehalf of his client as to
allow him to accept of it
but circumstances alter cases and in this
case some of the most superficial sort of circum
stances may serve to explain uur mystery
leaven young was black and was claimed
as his slave by apt steward the captain
had executed the shipping papers merely to
save trouble at the custom house and perhaps
in a free state arriving here last week with
j a cargo of sweet potato young left the
schooner and taking refuge among the colored
people was directed to robert morris ksq

that young had sailed with hiui for two
years without wages and that he had always
been his slave was very angry at being oblig
ed to pay the wages due according to his writ

guevt taylor movement our colored
friends have organized a free soil club in

cambridgest last week some of the
friends of general taylor were smitten with
the chivalrous idea of climbing up to the
chimnpy of the opposite building to which
the cord was fastened and cutting it down
i this gallant exploit was actually achieved
under the full view of mr citywatchman
bullard we understand and that vigilant
functionary made no effort to arrest the per
petrator but seemed rather to rejoice in his
isuccess
i this cutting down flags and not letting
them be put up is really the strongest argu

at about nundown last evening n man wan
earned over the falla who he was not
knows from has maoageao at of the sail
boat ia which he came down the river l think
he was not well acquainted with the current
or the rapids his dress and appearance in
dicated respectability and after he got into
the rapids his seifpomessaon was most extra
ordinary his boat was a very good one
decked over on the bow and  should think
would carry three or four tons from what
i team of a sailbunt having been seen below
black rook coating down i think it is from
there or buililiu no other than a person
unacquainted with the current above the
rapids would venture so sear them
i was on the head of gust islam when i
first disrovem the boatthen nearly half a
mile below the foot of navy island and nearly
two miles above the falla there seemed to
be two in the boat it wan directed towards
the american shorethe wind blowing from
the shore and still the sad was standing
being well acquainted with the river i re
garded the position o the boat as extraordi
nary and hazardous and watched it with
intense anxiety soon i discovered the mo
tion of an oar and from the changing direc
tion of the boat concluded it had foil one
while constantly approaching nearer and
nearer the rapids  could discover it was
gaining the american shore and by tlie time
it had got near the first fall in the rapids
about half a mile above gout island it was
directly above the island there it was
turned up the river and for aooee time the
wind kept it nearly stationary
the only hope seemed to be to come direct
ly to goat island and whether i should run
half a mile to give alarm eg remain to assist
in the event the boat attempted to make the
island was a question of painful doubt but
soon the boat was again tamed toward the
american shorethen it was certain it
must go down the american rapids i ran
for the bridgesaw and informed a gentle
man and lady just leaving the island but they
seemed unable to reply or move i rallied a
man at the tollgatewe ran to the main
bridge in time to see the boat just before it
got to the first large fall in the rapids then
i saw but one manhe standing at the stern
i with his oar changing the course of the boat
j down the current and as it plunged over he
sat down i was astonished to see the boat
rise with the mast and sail standing and the
man again erect directing ihe boat towards
shore as he came to the next and to each
succeeding fall he sat down and then would
rise and apply his oar in the intermediate
current
still there was hope that he would come
near enough to the pier to jump but in a
moment it was gone another that he might
jump upon the rock near the bridge but the
current dashed him from it under the bridge
breaking the mast again he rose on the
opposite side taking his oar and pointing
his boat towards the main shore he cried
had i better jump from the boat we
could not answer for e ther seemed certain
destruction within a few rods of the fails
the boat struck a rockturned over and lodg
ed he appeared to crawl from under it and
swam with the oar in his hand till he went
over the precipice
without the power to render any assistance
for half an hour watching a strong man
struggling with every nerve for life yet
doomed with almost the certainty of destiny
to an immediate anti awful death still hoping
with every effort for his deliverancecaused
an intensity of excitement i pray god never
again to experience
i write too hurriedly for publication but i
have stated all we have seen or know resect
ing the man or boat and from which i hope
you will be able to glean so much for publica

the hero of this adventure is ai
amateur poet living on his pat riot isn
more than by his talents and known b
some works in good taste and the on
ginaiity of his character the distinctive
sign of which is an habitual absence o
mind which sometimes gets him inti
great difficulty though his name be
longs to the literary public he may bt
designated as raymond
on the loth of july towards noon
his porter entered his room the receip
for the reut in his hand after the man
ner of porters who are four times t
year advanced to the dignity of receiv
ers of rents our poet did not shan
the opinion of the more advanced so
i cialists who pique themselves on tramp
ling under foot the privileges of prop
erty neither was he one of those who
on accourtf of the general embarrass
inent of affairs dispense with paying
their debts on account of the deft
j ciency of their means the roonej
was in his drawer and he settled the
bill without the least hesitation aftei
having counted and pocketed the sum
the porter instead of retiring remainct
standing and cast about him an aston
ished look
what do you want asked ray
mond
your pardon sir replied the por
ter but it seems to me that you hav
not begun your moving and the persoi
who takes your place is just coming ir
with his furniture he has a right t
take possession at  you know and i
is now halfpast 
at these words the poet gave a groan
struck his forehead seized his hat auc
went out in all haste he had simplj
forgotten the notice he had given of hi
intention to move and the necessity o
seeking a new lodging so thathcfounc
himself entirely unprovided and will
only half an hours delay
after having taken a few steps dowr
the street he reflected that half an houi
was not sufficient for all he had to do
and that it was necessary for him tc
take energetic measures so he cote
eluded to take away his furniture in the
first place and then seek somewhere tc
put it just then by one of those hap
py chances which almost always come
in aid of the careless he saw an empty
movingwagon pass this saved him
the trouble of seeking one the drivei
placed himself at his orders went up
to his room and in order to settle the
price of the transport according to the
distance asked in what quarter in
what street the furniture should be car
ried
i do not know replied raymond
i pay you by the hour and for the
rest of the day
this was entirely a new system of
moving hut had nothing impracticable
in it the driver fixed his price which
was accepted without disputing and the
work went on bravely the furniture
which was not in great abundance was
soon loaded and the procession moved
off the wagon took the direction of
the horses head the poet marched a
few step  in front his nose in the air
examining the houses and spying out
the notices of to let at the end
of ten minutes he made his first visit to
an apartment which did not suit him
the procession resumed its march at a
slow pace to slop again soon without
any more success the journey con
tinued in the same way interrupted by
frequent halts the poet was difficult
in the choice of his a atment they
were too large or too small too low in
the story or too high up stairs too high
priced or not well arranged nothing
suited him and he kept looking for a
better home
after a whole day spent in this labo
rious investigation the horse was get
ting exhausted and raymond who had
travelled several leagues in the streets
of paris and mounted several miles of
staircase in his examination of rooms
worn down by fatigue overcome with
ennui and discouragement resolved to
make an end and at his last halt fixed
his choice on a lodging which suited him
still less than the others and which
united all the inconveniencies to which
he would not accommodate himself se
parately the hour of hesitation had
however passed and he was like the
young lady in the fable who while
young and flattered refused all offers
under the slightest pretences and for
the smallest defects and finished when
i age arrived by marrying a poor fellow
the bargain was soon concluded
and after agreeing upon the price the
i poet made haste to unload his furniture
and then refresh himself and recover
from the fatigues and labors of the day
he mounted his cabriolet and drove to
flic palais royal where he went to dine
at the best restorators and thencewish
ing to spend his evening gaily he went
to the ball mabille where the polkers
of the night before continued their ex
ercises and where the queens of the
inst summer still wore proudly their ti
tles in spite of revolutions
ou leaving the ball champetrc about
eleven in the evening raymond took
the road to his old dwelling habit is
an oirstinate guide and many persons
fall into a similar mistake on first going
home after a change of lodging the
pmt recollected himself just as he raised
the knocker of the outside door
how thoughtless said ho to him
self t  had forgotten that i do not
live here hut continued he chang
ing coountcnaucc where do i lodge
now
 his question addressed to his mcm
ory remained unausvtcrd he iu vain
turned round and called up recollec
tions iha poor fellow did not know
where he lived it was the consequence
of his singular style of moving he
had driven all over paris so many times
he hud so often changed his course had
visited so many apartments that he had
no means to bring back those he had
taken to it is mind kvery thing was j
contusion m fits head and after vain
efforts he went and claimed the hospi 
tality ol a friend the next day he
renewed his attempts he walked
about paris several hours seeking in
vain to find his last nights route but it
was useless
how should he get out of his embar
rnssment and recover bis lost homer
the poet had not the resource of ad
dressing liunsetf to the driver of the
wagon because he had employed one
he had met on hit tray nothing cairn
to the assistance of bis defective mem
ory bat poets have resource and tb
following it the expedient suggested b
his knaginatioa
he went to the police office and ad
dressing himself to one of the clerks
said sir  have come to you to de
now nee a man who i am certain was o
stranger to the last insurrection hu
name is raymond he has written soon
verses here ia bis card on which ii
his last address but he moved on tbt
th of this month and did not tel
where he was going to live not even t
his porter not even to himself addet
he silently
this is a very suspicions affair
said the clerk
 thought yon might penetrate it
said raymond
j undoubtedly we can we are in tbi
habit of finding people who hide them
selves we shall soon know the abode
of this mr raymond two days from
now the thing will be done
look about then quickly and you
will not have lost your trouble
the clerk wanted to know the name
of the denunciator but the poet evaded
giving this information alleging some
good reason two days after two day
passed at a furnished hotel the poet re
turned to the police office
ah well asked he ah well
we have found him and the clerk
showed his record on which was in
scribed the new address of the poet
that is it said he where was mj
head but said the clerk noth
ing suspicious was found on the prem
ises i believe you i am a most
orderly person you ah yes
me  am raymond and the poet ex
plained his motive and his stratagem
excuse my falsehood added he
hut if i had tedd you i did not know
where i lived you wouid have sent me
to an insane asylum
the clerk for a moment rubbed his
brow hut the singularity of the adven
ture disarmed his anger and the poel
was let off with the slight inconven
ience of having for two days passed foi
an insurgent in the eye of the police
but he was reinstated in his new
hired home he asked for nothing

singular discovery
a correspondent of the buffalo ex
press writing under date of june th
from ontonagon lake superior says
mr knapp of the vulcan mining
company has lately made very singu
lar discoveries here in working one ol
the veins which he has found he
worked into an old cave which had been
excavated centuries ago this led them
to look for other works of the same
sort and they have found a number ol
sinks in the earth which they have
traced a long distance by digging into
these sinks they find them to have been
made by the hand of man these cuts
have been filled nearly to a level by
the accumulation of soil and we find
trees of the largest growth standing in
this gutter last week they dug down
into a new place and about  feet be
low the surface found a mass of copper
that will weigh from eight to ten tons
this piece ot copper is as clear and
pure as a new cent the upper surface
lias been pounded clear and smooth
it appears that this mass of copper was
taken from the bottom of a shall at the
depth of about  feet in sinking this
i shaft from where the mass now lies
they followed the course of the vein
which pitches consid rahly this ena
bles them to raise it as far as the hole
came up with a slant at the bottom
of the shaft they found sticks of black
oak from eight to twelve inches in di
ameter these sticks were charred
through as if burnt they found large
wooded wedges in the same situation
in this shaft they found a miners gad
and a narrow chisel made of copper
i do not know whether those copper
tools are tempered or not but their
make displays good workmanship
they have taken out more than a ton
of cobblestones which have been used
as mallets these stones were nearly
round with a score cut around the cen
tre and look as if this score was cut
for the purpose of putting a withe round
a handle the chippewa indians all
say this work was never done by in
dians i suppose they will keep finding
nfew wonders for some time yet as it
is hut a short time since they found the
old mine mr knapp has found
considerable silver during the past
winter j

kentucky examiner remarking upon
the efforts of the despots in the old
world to wrest some of our peculiar
institutions to their own purposes says
travellers tell us that the despots
of europe w ith the view of frightening
their people at the very name of re
publicanism have their schoolbooks
decorated with pictures in which the
men of the united states are represented
us standing whip in hand over the
laborers and driving them as slaves to
their work
 
the new york tribune thinks that
one or both of the old political parties
will be cither shamed or driven by the
free soil movement into the true po
sition on the slave question there
can be no chance for auy such thing so
long as they both have men pledged to
the slave power for tbeir candidates
for the presidency or defiend on that
power lor success in sustaining their
party schemes individuals from both
the old parties will continue to come
right on this question and will swell
the ranks of the free democracy till
finally there will be but two parties

gentlemen i have the honor to ae
knowledge the receipt of your politi
communication of the th mat catling
my attention to certain statement ja
lating to ay position before the cosntfi
as a candidate for the presidency whirl
are represented to have been made it
the whig national convention held a
philadelphia pending the action ofthai
body by judge saunders oflouiaiaim
in the name of the delegation from tha
state and requesting to be informed
whether such statements were made b
my authority  inform you in reply
that on their way to that convention
judge winchester and saunders of the
louisiana delegation who have beer
for many years my personal friends and
neighbors wrote requesting my views
before the meeting of the convention
as to the course  desired my friends tc
pursue in that body in two communi
cations addressed to them in reply 
informed them in substance that at my
distance from the scene it would be
impossibleefor me to give any instruc
tions upon the subject that many ques
tions or contingencies might arise dur
ing the action of the convention the
character of which i could not foretell
and that they must therefore assume the
responsibility of acting for me that i
felt my honor and interests safe in theii
hands that whatever they should sec
fit lo do i would most cordially ap
prove
i substantially informad them further
that unless they should discover an ev
ident disposition to treat me uufairly
which i had no reason for supposing
would be the case i thought my friends
should go into convention as they had
not been selected by their fellowciti
zens for this purpose but that having
once entered they were of course
bouud if i were not nominated to sus
tain and support the nominee whoevei
he might be and  hoped they would
do so heart and soul that i was a can
didate for the presidency only as far as
my friends had chosen to make me
but having been placed in iny preseul
attitude toward that subject without any
agency or act of my own directly or
indirectly i did not feel myself at lib
erty by any such act to withdraw my
self that iny friends in whose hands 
had ever been could do so whenever
they should see fit and finally if they
could succeed in electing to that office
any one better qualified for its duty than
i was and who at the same time was
honest truthful and patriotic it was
their duty to go for him and so far
from being disappointed or mortified i
should hail the result with joy
under the general authority thus
given to these gentlemen i shall deem
whatever statements they may have
made to be riht and proper and con
fident of their integrity and in the
sincerity of their friendship i shall sus
tain them without qualification i there
fore take upon my own shoulders the re
sponsibility of the louisiana delegation
in the convention and am prepared to
stand by the consequences in their
length and breadth
i regret exceedingly that my friends
in baltimore whom you represent should
thus misunderstand the course pursued
by the louisiana delegation in con
vention and should have imagined i
had almndoned the position i held in
my published letter on this subject
i feel bound to respect the opinions
of those who honestly differ from me
and while i feel conscious of no change
of feeling or inconsistency on my part
i cannot expect or desire that any of my
friends whom you represent should do
violence to their owu sense of right and
wrong by supporting my election while
they believe l have changed iny politi
cal views
i ask no man be he whig or dem
ocrat or native american for his vote
take every american citizens interest
in the welfare of his country to be as
pure and deep as my own and i have
therefore no right and certainly no de
sire to influence his action in the exer
cise of the important duty of voting for
officers of his government
