new england antislavery
convention
the following resolutions were sub
mitted by the business committee
resolved that the antislavery
movement has been is and is yet more
to be the means under providence
for the regeneration of the united
states and that its vital power is in
uncompromising assertion of the prin
ciple
that every human being has a god
given right to manhood and the condi
tions of a manly life and that it is the
duty of mankind collectively and indi
vidually to insure the unimpaired en
joyment of this right to every member
of society
resolved that confirmed in this
principle by the sanction ot the ljivine
will as made known in all ages by the
common instincts and matured judg
ments of the human race by the hie
and words of jesus christ and the
confessions of the christian church
and finally by the declaration of inde
pendence the supreme law ol ibis re
publicthe american antislavery so
ciety has but to discharge its plain duty
in calling upon the people of the united
states throughout their religious and
political organizations and every pow
er of their social anu personal action
to unite in putting away immediately
and forever the inhuman unchristian
antirepublican destructive and dis
graceful usage of domestic slavery
resolved that the accumulating
experiences of every year and week art
proving that in declaring the rond ol
union between the states broken anc
annulled by the annexation of texas
and the mexican war and in summon
ing the people of the united states ii
their sovereign capacity to form s
new union ot freemen the antisla
very society proposed a course ot con
duct in the highest degree consistent
with obedience to god christian integ
rity loyalty to this nation and practi
cal wisdom and that if this course
had been followed war would have
been stopped texas made free slave
ry paralyzed and the nation redeefued
by the adoption of a policy worthy ol
christian freemen
whereas this nation through the
action of its national and state legisla
tures the intrigues of its political par
ties the pussivencss of its religious
communities the tameness of its press
the supine connivance of its people has
yielded itself up to the guidance of the
slaveijilding oligarchy which bus
Ã¼bur t  control over the congress the
ex cittvc and the judiciary of the
united states and
wnereas notwithstanding all these
discouraging proofs of national degen
eracy there are manifest signs in the
south iu well as north the west and
east t the revival of a more humane
just tree spirit among our religious and
political bodies and m th s heart of ouf
communities therefore
resulted i hut it our urgent du
ty to seek out and propose some practi
cal plan whereby good men and wo
men in all the stales may cordially co
operate in removing root and branch
the fatal institution of slavery which
blasts our nations prosperitypeace
nod growth
resolved that we commend to the
instant earnest and thorough consid
eration of all antislavery men and
women throughout the united states
the promotion of a
national redemption societv
whose object shall be
i the total abolition of slavery
tbrougout the united states
the north star
 indemnity to our brethren and
sisters held as slaves for their wrongs
sufferings and degradation
 such aid to slaveholders in es
caping from their present false rela
tions as justice collective responsibili
ty for the national sin of slaveholding
and a true feeling of brotherly kind
ness may warrant
resolved that the people of the
united states will never redeem them
selves from the shame of past hypo
crisies inconsistencies and crimes re
claim a rightful position of honor among
civilized and christian states until by
some act signal public unanimous
they cancel the slaveholding conces
sions of the con titution the missouri
compromise and all similar compromi
ses whether in the spirit letter or exe
cution of national laws make atone
ment to mexico for the outrages inflict
ee upon her in our war of slaveholding
aggressionand form a new bond ol
union under a new constitution wor
thy of a nation of united freemen
and that we look forward with confident
hope for the coming of the day of na
tional reform truly the day of nation
al atonement when our prophetic motto
ofepluribus ununi will manifest
indeed a glorious reality
resolved that in the upward pro
gress of public sentiment on the subject
of emancipation we see in the spirit
and conduct of the great body of the
american clergy nothing but persever
ing impenitence and palpable impiety
the professed ambassadors of christ
are emphatically the bulwarks of slave
ry and we therefore again call upon
all who love liberty and revere the
principles ofchristianity to guard them
as men who will be the last to come to
the rescue of the slave and the vindica
tion of human rights universally
resolved that we recommend to
the abolitionists a more active support
of the periodicals devoted to the cause
especially the standaid and the lib
erator not only by subscribing them
selves and circulating copies at their
own expense but by devoting theii
time to soliciting subscriptions from
others
resolved that the decree of the
french provisional government abol
ishing slavery in all the colonies ol
france as essential to the honor integ
rity equality and humanity of the new
republic ought to cover the people ol
this country with confusion of face
w ho have made slavery instead of lib
erty the cornerstone of their republi
can edifice and thus perfidiously ob
struct the progress of freedom through
the world
resolved that we will never throw
any obstacle however slightn the way
of the slaves obtaining their lrccdom in
the most direct and summary rfivn
ner in their power that so tar from
counselling them to be content in their
condition wc will spare no effort to
make them the contrary that so far
from advising them to bear in patience
the evils of their condition wc will en
courage them by every righteous
means in our power to escape from
that condition at their earliest opportu
nity
resolved that whether wc consult
the religious or political aspects of the
country in regard to the antislavery
movement we find occasion for contin
ual rejoicing and are mightily strength
ened to go onward until the last link of
slavery is broken
resolved that in the late national
democratic nomination of lewis cass
for the presidency ot the united states
the man who bus not only got dowm
on his knees to the slave power but
like a certain reptile crawled on his
belly in the dust accursed and veno
mous wc see again how profligate and
spurious is the boasted democracy of
the countryhow submissive is the
democratic party to the mandates of
the southern overseersand how uni
versal and frightful is the apostacy to
the cause of liberty and equal rights
resolved that whether the presi
dential candidate offered us as worthy
to receive our suffrages be lewis cass
zachary taylor winfield scott henry
clay daniel webster johu p hale
or gerrit smith we have but one an
swer to make to them allno union
with slaveholders
resolved that such a fact as the
seizure and rendition to slavery in the
capital of this nation of seventy per
sons escaping from it with the barbar
ous imprisonment as criminals of the
men who nobly attempted their deliver
ance all under the sanction and at the
instigation of the general government
when considered in its proper place
in the succession of such events as the
adoption of tne federal constitution in
guarantee of slaverythe purchase
and admission to the uion of louisi
ana the admission of slaveholding
missouri arkansas and floridathe
annexation and admission of slavehold
ing texasthe war with free mexico
the unnoticed and continual outrages
imprisonments and murders of the
northern citizens the ignominious ex
pulsion from the south of their legally
appointed advocates fills up the mea
sure of damniug proof that slavery is
indeed the cornerstone of this republic
and hence in view of this iniquitous
union of free with slave states which
gives to the conscience of the slavehold
er the comfort of northern participa
tionto his character the sustentatioo
of northern companionshipto his
arm the strength of the northern bayo
netto his dungeons and instruments

right is of no sextruth is of no color god  the father of us all and all we are brethren
sible means to agitate the land with
hitherto unparalleled energy for its ini
i mediate and utter dissolation
resolved that anxious to make the
i best possible use of every opportunity
which providence affords of gaining
the ear and rousing the heart of the
nation we recommend to the massachu
setts antislavery society to hold as
i soon as convenient and profitable a
series of one hundred conventions to
i press on public notice tbe guilty posi
tion of the state in renpect to national
i slaveryand to urg a dissolution of
that union which there is no hope of
changingw hich links us to such re
sponsibility and shuts up in our jails in
the keeping of our agents the noblest
friends of humanity and best lovers of
their kind
resolved that we pledge to that so
ciety the funds raised at this conven
tion and declare that asking for money
shall never be out of order at any of
our sessions
resolved that the thanks of the
slave and the slaves friends are pre
eminently due to joshua r giddings
 lor his fearless and unsparing rebuke
of the slave power on the floor of con
gress os well as for his frank coopera
tion with the most unpopular measures
ofthe ant slavery movement in ohio
that to no political man is the coun
try so much indebted for the recent
wonderful change in the tone of con
gressional debate as to him and the
only regret that we feel in regard to
his case is that in swearing to uphold
a proslavery constitution he greatly
impairs the force of his moral testimony
against slavery which can be rendered
consistent and effectual only by his
openly ab uring that constitution as
involving all who support it in the guilt
and condemnation ot the slave system
from the cincinnati herald
libertymenleaguersgar
risonj ansabulitionists
there are comparatively few western
men or southern men who have a cor
rect idea of the differences of opinion
which prevail among the opponents of
slavery they confound the garri
sonians with the liberty men and both
with the leaguers and all with the
abolitionists who yet act with the two
great politcal parties it is desirable
that this misapprehension should be
rectified and we ask the attention ol
our readers and especially ot our ex
changes to a brief statement intended

to remove it
the liberty men are those slavery
opponents who are organized as a po
ljycl party in or thaq hall
the states of this union making the
question of slavery or freedom paramj
ount to every other question and
i aiming to abolish slavery under nation 
al and state jurisdiction through the
constitutional action of the federal and
state governments this party is re
presented by the national era at
washington the emancipator at
boston the herald at philadelphia j
our own paper here and many other
papers in different parts ot the country
the members of this party differ among
themselves as to the extent ot the
powers of the national government on
the subject of slavery tout they all
agree iu thinking that government can
and should abolish it in all places where
it has exclusive jurisdiction and dis
courage it elsewhere by example
recommendation aud every legitmate
means they all agree also in re
garding this as the primary duty of the
governmentnot to be postponed to
any otherthough no other should be
neglected this agreement in regard
ing the question of slavery as of para
mount importance and in determining
their political action by this considera
tion is the bond of union among liber
men and constitutes them a poli
tical party
the garrisonians are the members
of the old american antislavery
society as it existed prior to  and
those who concur in sentiment with
them they are called garrisonians
simply because mr garrison is their
most distinguished leader these anti
slavery men admit ad that the slave
holders claim in regard to the guar
anties of slavery in tue national con
stitution aud believing these guar
anties to be miquitous and dishonorable
denounce the constitution as a cov
enant with death and an agreement
with hell and demand the immediate
dissolution of the union of the states
they perform however no practical
measuies to effect their object they
refuse to vote or to aim and confine
themselves to denunciations of slavery
and its abettors this constitutes a
sect rather than a party and are rep
resented by the liberator at boston
the antislavery standard at new
york and three or four other papers
the leaguers are a body of citizens
who formerly acted with tbe liberty
party but becoming dissatisfied with
the determination of that party to adopt
no other political issue than the single
one of slavery or freedom held a
convention last year in the state of
new york and adopted a new political
creed of niocteeu articles and nonv
 inated national candidates supposed to
represent their ideasthe members
i o f this party hold themselves bound to
 in vestigate all political questions and to
carry forward at the same time and
with equal steps all political reforms
they generally u uot universally
j adopt constitutional opinions precisely
i the reverse of those of the garri
aoniana they hold that the consti
tution of the united states of its own
force abolished slavery in the states
as well as in the national territories
and jurisdictions and that all slave
holding is at this moment prohibited
thy that instrument they hold that
rochester n y friday june  
congress has constitutional power to
enforce this constrgetion and to se
cure freedom to every person by law
they denounce tbe liberty men be
cause they do not generally adopt their
extreme views just as the garrisonians
denounce them because they do not
adopt their opposite extreme views
they denounce them also because
they not seeing the practicability ot
pressing successfully or advantage
ousiy a dozen or twenty distinct issues
at once prefer to make tbe one regar
ded by them as mom important para
mount to every other the albany
patriot at albany and two or three
other papers represent these eftizens
the abolitionists and slavery op
ponents who yet act with their old
parties are those who regard the aboli
tion of slavery in uuited states as
a desirable thing but are indisposed to
make the slavery question the para
mount issue these citizens differ
w idely from each other in their views of
slaverysome regard it as a political
evil only others as criminal seine
believe that congress has power to
abolish it throughout the country
others that the jurisdiction of congress
over the subject is confined to terri
tories where the jurisdiction of the
genera government is exclusive some
would limit their efforts to the exclusion
of slavery from new territories others
demaud its abolition in the district and
wherever it can be reached they
agree in thinking that the practical
work of legislative antislavery will be
done by one or the other of the exist
ing parties and they rather choose to
stay where they are than to take inde
pendent positions whig and demo
cratic antislavery papers generally
express the views of these citizens
these are the leading distinctions be
tween the different classes of antislav
ery men in this country we purposely
abstain from comment we endeavor
to give tacts and leave our readers to
judge

washington jan  
sir yours of the first of novem
ber notilying me that die convention
holden at buffalo on the th and st
of october last had presented my
name to the people of the united
states as a candidate for the office of
president of the united states is be
fore me
it is due to candor to say that while
i appreciate in its fullest extent the
favorable estimation of myself by the
members of juiatponjjpntipq indicated
by the nomination wcre i to consult my
own wishes i should peremptorily de
cline it deference however to the
opinion of those friends who have sus
tained me by their counsel and support
under circumstances aud at times well
calculated to test the ardor of their
zeal and sincerity of their professions
has induced a different determination
and i therefore accept the offer and
consent that my name may be thus used
in connection with that office
in announcing to you sir as the
official organ of that body this result
to which  have come allow me to add
that as that convention before its ad
journment made provision for the as
sembling of another of a similar char
acter should unforeseen contingencies
and emergencies render such a step
proper nothing would be more grateful
to my own feelings than to find the
good and true of every party forgetful
of the petty differences which have
heretofore divided them uniting togeth
er in one strenuous and euergetic etfort
to redeem the government ol the
united states from the reproach to
which it is now justly subject lor its
support of human slavery and the pres
eut unjust and aggressive war it hss so
wantonly commenced and is so relent j
lessly prosecuting for its extension and
perpetuity
whenever such a movement shall be
made in good faith and earnest purpose
i shall be most glad with the consent of
those friends wbo have placed my name l
before the people to enroll inysell among
the humblest privates in tne hosts who
wil rally under such a banner  am
not without hope that such a movement
may yet be made
it is sometimes expected of an indi
vidual when accepting a nomination for
an important matter how re j
mote the chance of his election
that he give some exposition of the
principles he entertains and the views
of public policy by which he proposes
to act
in accordance with such a supposed
expectation i will cheerfully say to you
sir that  coincide with the principle
of the resolution adopted by the
convention which made the nomina
tion
it has been suggested to me and
indeed i have private letters to the
same effect that doubts have been ex
i pressed to some extent and perhaps
much more generally entertained than
expressed whether i ready and truly
am a liberty party man and belong
to the liberty party and that a is ex
pected of me that in this communica
tion i should clear up aud solve these
doubts to do this it is necessary de
finitely to understand wbat is meant by
tbe question if by t it be intended
to ask whether i am ready to cooper
ate with those who by independent
organized and individual action are
aiming to carry out certain principles
isuch as tkase embodied in the resolu
tions of the buffalo convsotion who
desire to withdraw from the insu
ution of slavery that countenance and
 support which it unconstitutionally re
ceives from the general government
and seek it termination hy federal ao
tion where it exists under federal juris
diction and state action where it ex
ists under state authority ao that our
declaration of independence shall he
something more than a rhetorical flour
ish and the preamble of the united
states constitution which declares
among other things that it was ordained
to secure the blessings of liberty to
ourselves and to our posterity no
longer be a cruel mockery then do i
belrng to such a party but if it be
supposed or intended that there is to be
any magical influence in the name of
party ao that by joining it  thereby
subject my public conduct to the super
vision or direction of its officers or
committees then i nay most em
phatically i do not belong to any such
party
i have been once formally and sol
emnly read out of the democratic party
who make such high professions of re
gard for human rights by a state con
vention in new hampshire and regu
larly excommunicated for no reason
except a refusal to vote for a measure
calculated and designed by the
open declaration of its friends to up
hold the interests of slavery extend its
influence and secure its permanent as
cendancy and i am not anxious to
place myself speedily in a situation in
reference to any other party when
any of its members may fancy they
have the moral right to repeat the ex
periment upon me for any cause real
or fancied
besides to my mind the great evil
of the present day and of our own
country eminently is this universal dis
position to merge the responsibilities of
individual character in the irresponsi
bility of a party were it not for this
we could have a permanent and honor
able peace with mexico iu less than
three months but in their blind and
partisan devotion men forget that
there is a god higher than party or a
rule of morals other that political expe
diency
it is unnecessary for me further to
enlarge on this subject
the present session of congress
with the developments which are con
stantly in progresswill afford abundant
opportunity for those who feel any in
terest on the subject in addition to what
i have already spoken and written to
be informed of my sentiments on the
great practical questions of the day
with much respect i am your
friend and fellowcitizen

a northern traveller the south in
a commuication to the editor of the new
york tribune says
while in petersburg i had occa
sion to rise from a hasty plateof green
peas on account of a rush to the win
dows of our dining hall i looked and
saw a drove of more than fifty men and
women marching at a quick pace two
by two going to the depot there to
take the southern train of cars it was
a brief delegation of the peculiar insti
tutiontravelling to new orleans for
an investment at the depot the
whole drove were closely packed into
one car a large number of the chat
tels showed a sort of brut indifference i
and some a worse than brute delight i
at the thought of a railroad ride while j
others looked very sorrowful and wept
bitterly there was among them one
very pretty white girl with clear com
plexion long dark hair and hazel
eyes she held a white cotton hand
kerchief to her face and wept despair
ingly an intelligent looking colored
manher lover her cousin her
brotherit may be a strangerwent j
to her and poured from his purse into
his hand a few small pieces of silver
and a bit of yellow coin probably not
more than a quartereagle but i
learned afterward that it was a urge
majority ol his property and just as
the train was about stalling he called
her attention and quietly slipped the
gold into her band ske looked regret
and thanks she tried to return it but
the ears were off and  felt more than
ever the cruelty aererity and cold 
heartlessness of slavery i had seen it
stated in our northern papers that
slaves were carried in droves like
sheep to market but i never apprei
ciated or felt the fact until then
from the loadoa tiare
sugar duties v britain
were clarkson and wilberforee
right or wrong in the steps they took
in the cause of negro emancipation j
sentimentalism apart are they to be
numbered amidst the enlightened bene
factors of humanity the practical
result of all the efforts great britain
has made during the last half cent wry
for the abolition of slavery is merely
thistbe gross amount of negro sla
very throughout the world has been
progressing fully in the ratio of tbe
increased consumption of sugar coffee
and other west indian produce and
vngtrui is losing all power of soften
i ing or ameliorating tbe condition of tbe
lave let us suppose for a moment
that all the legislative acta fer the abo
lition of slavery which tbe humanity of
philanthropists ever devised or the
votes of parliament ever passed into
law bsd never been thought or spoken
of and what would have been the re
sult it is well to look tbe plain truth
boldly in tbe lace and ascertain whe
ther the condition of tbs alricaa has
i been at all bettered by our exert is an
have paper compensatory
aums ef twenty millions at a tints never
i to have been plevied from tbe english
taxpayer and that tbe estuaries of tbe
african rivers bad never witpemrd tbe
evolutions of an eanlish squadron
amidst their awasumta and
deadly fogs we may fairly presume
that in this case the slate trade bet n
the african coast and the british wesi
indies would have been regularized
the oscillations of demand and supph
would have kept their even pace
philanthropy instead of doing what it
has done would have taken another
form philanthropy would have de
claimed as of old about the horrors ot
tbe middlepassage and to the soften
ing of the horrors of the middlepas
sage tbe remedy would have been con
fined commodious vessels adapted to
the traffic would have been provided
it would have been desirable as a
mercantile speculation that the human
merchandize should have arrived sound
in wind and limb and fit for delivery
this would have come to pass or else
the purveyor of slaves would have reg
ulated his business by other condition
than the importer of oranges from mal
ta or the dealer of cotton from the
united states factories or entrepot
would have been established here and
there along the african coast and by
all analogy we may presume that even
in the interior even in the spots where
human beings are seized and sored for
sale some improvement on the horror
of the trade might in the course of hall
a century have been devised be thi
however as it may it is on the condition
of the slave when once under the pro
tection of the british laws that we mighi
have reflected with satisfaction tht
original the damning taint of the traflii
we could not have washed out wt
could not have restored the african
who had been torn from his deserts ant
his home to the society and the fellow
ship of earlier daysas dearly cherishec
by him as are the more refined regret
for the days of his childhood by civil
ized man this we could not havt
done but we could have taken tht
slave in jamaica or st vincent as n
slave and have rendered his condition
more tolerable than that of any unhappy
being placed under similar circum
stances by this time a humane code
of slave laws would have been enacted
the arbitrary power of corporal pun
ishment have been taken away from the
master the separation of husband and
wife of parent and child forbidden
regulations of the hours and conditions
of labor have obtained ou the whole
such a system might have been de
vised that setting aside the original
sin inherent in a traffic where man is
the merchant and man the merchan
dize philanthropists might have doubt
ed and sterner wisdom denied that the
african had been the loser by a bar
gain which removed him from the fran
tic licenseund constant ptysical isuffer
ing of barbarism and placed him ever
in the lowest degree within the pale o
civilization it is conceivable it is
probable considering the interval be
tween the posting of a letter at king
ston and its delivery in london in may
 that the system would have sha
ken itself into some such form as this
let us now turn to what we actually
have done
we have emancipated the negro
we have caused such a deficiency in
the supply of labor and so raised its
price in the antilles that th cost ot
producing a ton of sugar in the british
colonies is considerably higher than in
foreign sugargrowing countries con
currently with this measure we have
said to the british west indian colonist
you shall at once or within a short
period lose any discriminating duty
which would place you on a footing ot
equality with the foreign sugargrower
your feet shall be tied and his feet
shall be loose and yet you shall have
no start in the race by which you arc ru
ined if you lose we are not however
considering the question with reference
to the british planterslet them perish
by all means and let the west indian
colonies be destroyedbut purely as it
may affect slavery throughout the
world sugar must be had somehow
and from somewhere if not from the
british w est indies then from the bra
zils from the united states from coun
tries where it will he grown by slaves
whose compulsory labor we cannot reg
ulate whose condition we cannot bet
ter and whose transportation from
africa to the various slavcmarkets we
cannot prevent that is at present the
gross results of the labors of clarkson
wilberforee and the abolitionists
they have not succeeded in checking
the seizure of dfcves in the interior of
africa they have aggravated the hor
ror ofthe middlepassage they have
driven the slave from tbe protection of
the british flag to the tender mercies ot
tbe brazilian or united states planter
whose proceedings murf influenced
by any such publwqfpuu a
have softened tfkeir dealings with
those slaves in a british colony it l
well ere it be too late to ponder upon
these things
here are a few facts from the speech
delivered by mr samuel gurner to the
meeting held at the london tavern on
saturday
since  a great change had
taken place on tbe subject of the slave
trade up to that time the lavctrade
had been checked by the british and
other governments and the brazils
and spain not by treaty but by acta
would have abandoned the traffic ii
their sugar had been ad muted to ihu
country at that time the govern
ment of this cowntry had thrown away
then a golden opportunity but not he
i hoped ao completely as not to be a bit
to get r back he would read them a
few statistic of the slaverode in reewari
ears in  the number of
that crossed the atlantic was erthnatei
at  in  the number w
 by official reports but by p n

john dick pssmsasa

as he iud iikiitoa oncer
tltes w i etuudauou owe t
our admirals witbin tfei promt ucbth
had written to his government that he
lad a slaver in tow of co tors limit n
with  individuals onboard  he
system of packing those individuals
was such as to make them almost a sal id
mass ot corruption some tew remain
ed alive he knew cases in which mac
out ot ten ot the persons composing
cargoes oi slaves died on the voyage
it such vessels of co tons here em
ployed to transport the  slaves in
the meeting might form some
calculation as to the amount of deaths
he only told half the evils of the slave
trade when he mentioned the horrors
and deaths during the atlantic voyage
hat it he told them of the wars and
cruelties exercised in africa of the
ruin committed in that country to get
possession of those unfortunate individ
ualsif he told them all they would see
that lor every seventy thousand exported
from africa an equal number had been
destroyed he believed that the con
sequence of the african slavetrade ns
now carried on was at least ium
deaths a day
this meeting in itself is do inconsid
erable symptom of the change of pub
lic opinion on this matter or rather of
the strange manner in which parties
have been brought together who were
formerly in diametrical antagonism
the est indian interest and the abo
litionists are now making common
cause the one to preserve their estates
the other to prevent tc abolition of
slavery becoming a mere delusion
the means to be adopted for the at
tainment of those two ends are iden
tical
tomorrow the committee an the
sugar duties are to come to their reso
lution upon what shall be their recom
mendation to the house with reference
to the degree of protection to be af
forded to the west indian planters for
some years to conic three several
plans have been proposed to the com
mitteea very elaborate one by lord
george bentuick too lengthy and ex
acting to be of practical service this
was rejected there was a second
scheme of mr wilsons with which
tho planters were tolerably satisfied
this also was discarded there was
a third attributed to mr goulburn and
mr cardwell which would we be
lieve have been still mere agreeable to
the west indian interest but of which
a vital clause was thrown out by the
influence of lord george bentinck
thus the committee have come to a
standstill and the report stands a good
chance of going upto the with
out any recommendation in favor of
protection at all unless the proposition
ol sir thomas birch be accepted
this is to the effect that the duties on
foreign sugars shall for the next six
years be s per cwt and on british
sugars s per cwt and then gradu

a beautifix legend
the following is from a sermon of
theodore parker on the subject of
rest
they tell a story that one day
rabbi judah ami his brethren the
seven pillars of wisdom rat in tho
temple on a feast day disputing
about rest one said that it was to
have attained sufficient wealth yet
without sin the second that it was
fame and praise of all men the third
that it was the possession of power to
rule the state the fourth that it con
sisted only in a happy home the
fifth that it must be in the old age of
one who is rich powerful famous sur
rounded by childrens children the
sixth said that all that were vain un
less a man keep all the ritual law of
moses ami rabbi judah the venera
ble the tallest of the brothers said ye
have all spoken wisely but one thing
more is necessary he can only find
rest who to all these things addelbthui
that he keepetfi the tradition of the
elders
there sat in the court a fairhaired
boy playing with his lilhes in his lap
and bearing the talk dropped them
w ith astonishment from his hands and
looked upthat hoy of twelveaud
said nay nay fathers he only br
eth rest who loves his brother as him
self and god with his whole heart and
soul he is greater than wealth and
fame and power happier than a happy
home happy without it better uia

general taylorwho was not ouly unpledged
to the principles measures policy and or
gamzation of the whig party but who had
distinctly declared that in no case can j
permit mvseif to be the candidate of any ar
ty or yield myself to party schemes wat
to be forced upon the convention no candi
date from the free states no whigs well
known as the arne exponests ot the declared
principles of the party seemed likely to havt
the slightest chance to receive the nomination
of the convention the question of choice
was narrowed from the commencement to
mr clav and general taylor r io be a
whig from the free states was a decided
disadvantage while the adoption ol the prin
ciples of the wihnol proviso so lar from
being a rccommendatiou was a perfect barrier
to success
gen taylor was the favorite candidate of
the slave holders especially to the slaveex
tensionists and from the very first had been
brought forwerd as the only southern man
that coud be elected he was never iden
tified with the whig party ha had never
given a vole he had frankly said that he
hail never made up his mind upon the leading
questions at issue between the parties for the
right decision of which we had fought in
many a sternlycontested battlefield not
only had he refused to be the exponent ot
whig principles but he had accepted the
nominations of bodies of men not known or
received as whigs while they scouted the
very idea of being in any way bound by the
acts of any national convention so late as
the th of april he had declared he would
not withdraw his name if henry clay or any
other whig should have the nomination his
bupjorters are mostly from the have holding
states which had generally given democratic
majorities indeed on the final ballot of the
whole number of votes received by general
taylor ninetyseven were from states that
voted for mr polk in  those most vi
olent in their opposition to the wilmot pro
viso and most distinguished for their want
jf sympathy with the liberal principles of the
ige were most forward and uncompromising
n their advocacy of his claims the dele
fates fvoni the whig fiee states were nearly
rnanimous in their opposition to him on the
first ballot he received but four of the ninety j
four votes they had in convention he was
emphatically the candidate of the slaveexten
siou whigs and a class of trimming politi
cians from states hopelessly democratic who j
expected by support and votes given him in j
the convention to secure for themselves and
friends executive appointments and executive
patronage
being neither the exponent or embodiment
of whig principles nothing could done to
pledge or commit him or his friends to whig
measures before proceeding to ballot a
l resolution was offered by a delegate from
ohio declaring in substance that the cardi
dates presented by the convention should be j
whigs fully committed to the support of
whig principles and measures and that they
should be bound bv the decision of the con i
vention and support the nominee of the con
vention on w homsoever the choice should i
fall this resolution was offered in the spiri
of compromise and w ith an anxious desire to
secure harmony of action and at the same
time save the party from the utter abandon
ment of everything that has distinguished its
past history and character it was however j
received with scorn and derision by the
friends of general taylor ruled out of order j
and thrown out of the convention a simi j
lar proposition from the new york delegation
shared the same fate the friends of gen
taylorconfident arrogant and boldspurn
ed with contempt at every effort at compro i
misc or conciliation and we were forced j
into the unequal struggle for the preservation j
of the principles and organization of the
whig party the balloting commenced and j
although gen taylor on the first ballot
wanted twentynine voles to secure his nomi 
nation it was well known that certain gentle
men intended to give him their adhesion as 
soon as they could do so in such a manner as
to appear to yield to the force of circurnstan j
ces and thus partially satisfy their betrayed
constituents ou the th ballot gen taylor
received the nomination
another effort w as then made on the part
of the ohio delegation for union and harmony
and at the same time to save the party from
complete disorganization a resolution to the
etlect that the whigs in conventiou would
agree to abide by the uomiuatiou of general
taylor on condition of his acceptance of the
nomination as the candidate of the whig
party and his adherence to its fundamental
principlesviz no extension of slavery over i
territory now free no acquisition of territory i
by conquest protection to american mdua
try and opposition to executive usurpation
and power the fair proposition was also j
received by the friends of gen taylor with
the same arrogant opposition ana by them
defeated
events like these following each other in
quick succession convinced me that if  con i
sented to the nomination of gen taylor it j
must be done at the sacrifice of my own opin
inns and the betnyal i yours this liould
not do tt was repeating tie experiment of
john tyler w ithout even any decency or show
of nect sity for such an experiment  had
no relish nor did i feel like trusting one 
whose principles were unknown i went to
philadelphia a whig and  can truly bay j
that i catne home a w lug the majority of
the convention however adopied a different
course casting to the winds all the profes
sions of years and demolishing at a single
blow the old and longtried platform on w hich
they had always stood tfiey surrendered
at discretion to general taylor and became
the willing serfs under him of the contempt
ible oligarchy ot the south
they voted for a man to be the standard
bearer of the great whip partv that party
which has boasted of embracing within its
ranks the great body of the intelligence the t
decency the morality and the religion of the 
nationprofeasing to represent the higher
and more reducd scuubh nta of the american
people a man whose chief recommendation
to those who urge his claim is that he is a
slaveholderthe reputed owner of two hun
dred human biopsand the only reason far i
whose nomination is that he has been a suo j
ceasful general to a war which i believe to be
most intamous and wickedwhich every
whig legislature in the free state has de
neuÃcedwhich the preseut house of repce
senutives at washington have voted to be
uncocatitcycÃs and unnecessary apd which i

was not only uncommitted to any principle

cy which have divided the two leading parties
of the nation for the last twenty years fan
tho whig party how lower i can dgrdstina
and abandwmenl go farther is not the
i piesent cundiuoo ai the party a must humili

i forced upon ns by the arrogant demand of the
slave power to which we hare basely sub
mitted
for yearn we have denounced the demo
cratic party for its servility to the south we
j bare held it up as her natural ally we
hat e characterized its conduct in sol knitting
to the sacrifice of mr van buren and sup
 porting mr polk at the dictation of the slave
power as being in the highest degree pusi
j lanhnous and degrading but that was inag
inaainuty compared with the course of the
whig party for they have not only sacrificed
i all their old and longtried leaders and emi
j nent statesmen and taken a candidate at the j
slaveholders biddinghe an outeiderand j
never identified with usbut for the boon
thus voudisafed from their masters they have
thrown away r the principles for which they
i have everconteoded
what now fellowciiisens was i your
delegatewho have been known fur years
to be opposed to karery in all its forms and
elected by you knowing ve bat my principles

coutse give the lie to my own professions and
your unanimously recorded vole i would
not do it i could nut be false to mv own
 convictions of duty and your deliberatelyre
corded opinions to gainthe applause or es
cape the censure af any man or body of men
would you have so ditected would yon
have done so had you been there yourselves
painful as was the trialknowing as i did
that  should probably sacrifice the friendship
of those whose good opinion i highly prized
 announced to the convention that  should
not be bound by its nomination but should
fo home and do all i could to oppose it and
ventured the assertion in your behalf that
the six thousand whigs of the district
who had sustained john quincy adams
through his long and glorious career
would spurn with scorn and contempt a
nomination forced upon them by the arrogance
of the south aided by the servility of the
north
and if anylbing was wanting to justify ray
conduct at the time of making this announce
ment the subsequent course of events in the
convention filled up the deficiency and the
measure of its degradation the wilmot
pioviso was presented to the convention by
the ohio delegation and received with the
same spiritof defiance and denunciation which
all previous dibits of the friends of northern
rights had excited its friends were de
nounced ae factionists who came there to dis
turb the harmony of the convention yes
he great principle of free territory which
had received in congress the support of the
party and been supported by all the whig
legislatures of the free states was de
naunced in that national convention and in j
dignaotly laid upon the table while its sup
porters were browbeaten insulted and de
nounced and anolher ciicumstance equally
significant and in character was the fact
that the convention broke up without adopting
a single resolution or recording a single opin
ion upon the great questions of the day
nothing was said about the warabout the
acquisition of territorynothing about ihe
events in europe or any other stirring themes
of this most wonderful period in the history
of the world for what then are you to
to labor in the support you are invited to give
to the ticket thus nominated a whig vic
tory but of what advantage can a whig
victory gained undersuch auspices be to you 
the yeomanry the rank and file of the party
of w hat possible benefit to the country such j
a victory will be barren of all good at least
to the free north
a barern sceptic in their gie
thence to be wrenc bed by sn utilineal hand j
no son of theirs succeeding
for such a victory i had no desire i w ill
have nothing to do with such an utter aban
donment of principles i wash my bands
now and forever of all possible agency in j
such an ignoble work as this to which we
have been invited by the trading politicians or
the party  will not trade away the rights
of freemen nor ignore tlte whole question ofi
american slavery merely for the election of
a few officeseekers to places of trust and
powerespecially those who have shown
themselves thus unfaithful to the true interests
of the party the country to a common human
ity and to god
i know that the idea is held out that al
though geaifol taylor may not have much
experience as a statesman and may not be
exactly our first choice yet being honest he
will suiround himself by a whig cabinet by
w hich the present reign of misrule will be
broken and there shall be a return of the
government to the principles of the party
let not the honest treemen of the north lay
this flattering uncuon to their souls the
reckless adveutuiers the fiery spirits of the
southwest who have brought forward gen
tavlor from the obscurity of a frontier camp
and of whose principles he is the exponent
and champion have not done it all without a
consideration hot only i  he to be the
leader under w bora the last act of the mexi
can war u to be consummated its appropri
ation of the ceded temtoiy now free to sla
very which can only be done by executive
permission but we cannot suppose that hav
ing made all these personal exertions and ex
penditures they will step quietly aside and
let a sober whig administration made up of
our leading statesmen enjoy the fruits of
their toils it is expecting too much that
men who in the coeveuuoa wuh power but
in expectancy and when conciliation would
seem necessary to secure the accomplishment
ol tfieir bold schemes should when firmly
seated in the administration become modest
and forbearing no general lay lor will
come in if he comes in at all unpledged to
any man or measures except such as in se
cret cabal he lias counselled with and who
have chosen httn as their leader his elec
tion will be but another southern victory
a heady have the leading politicians ol de
mocratic south carolina expressed them
selves as better satisfies with him than with

at this moment that the policy of his admin

the press sad the presidency
there are few things more disagreeable
to the ingenuous and conscientious man than
to be placed in a position in which he is
forced or thinks hirrself under the necessity
of speaking or acting in direct contradiction to
his own opinions one has a feeling of hu
miliation and selfdegradation in such circum
stances that almost forces him to blush fbi
very shame and indignation at bis own pol
troonery and meanness and confess to him
self whether others form the same estimate
of lus character or not that his conduct is
rile and despicable and that he has forfeited
all claim to respect and confidence the re
cent display of pertinaxm icsycophantism by
many at least of the whig journals has by
no means had the effect of raising to a higher
level the standard of human character some
there are that from being the decided oppo
nents of general taylor have become his
wannest and most determined supporters
true they generally give a reason for their
change of sentiment they may as well
however for any attention that is paid to
their asseverations and protestations have
saved themselves the trouble no one cares
anything about their reasons every one
knows full well what they amount to and
tint they are in fact only sound and fury
signifyingnothing that a man may
have good grounds lor a change of sentiment
is selfavident indeed there is nothing more
natural for the conscientious and inquiring
mind than to undergo a changenay many
changes strange indeed were it not so
new truths and new views of old truths
cannot fail to be elucidatod by such minds
these are the natural and legitimate results
of inquirythey art the avowed and proper
object of inquirerswithout which all their
efforts are fruitless aimless and their labor
unproductive such genuine changes of opin
ion however are easily distinguishable from
all those of spurious origin the genuine
changes more frequently than otherwisework
injuriously to the interests of the person who
avows them while the mere pretences have
of course a tendency or at least a supposed
tendency directly the reverse for a man
to avow the adoption of views directly op
posed to the prevailing spirit of the day or
contrary to lrs ow n interests he must be pos
sessed of moral courage and conscientious ad
herence to truth such mea are the reform
ersthe discoverers of the times it is their
place and they are by nature fitted for it
none else need undertake that officethey
are sure to fail and show to the wmild the
shallow foundation on which their pretences
rest the opposite coursethat of gliding
smoothly along the stream and joining in
with the popular voice is the easiest and the
most profiiable hence we find those whig
and other journals which if they performed
their duty aright would be the pioneers of
public sentiment and would lead the way to
reform and improvement in our social condi
tion instead of fulfilling this their proper
duty basely pander to what they suppose the
prevailing opinion and instead oi being the
heralds of progress are the mere echoes of
ignorance the fountain must purify itself
ere it can send forth pure waters
while such has been the effect on some
papers of the recent nomination of general
taylor others and this by no means a small
proportion are vying with each oiher in their
efforts to show that they have long held and
advocated the aame opinion ard glory in the
shame of having iongotnee asserted the fit
ness of this manstealing manslaying mis
creant to be president of the united states
very possibly be is fit a few months will
decide whether these journals have formed a
correct estimate of american morality like
president like people if the americans as
a people approve or have the spirit of war
and manstealing prevailing among them
what more appropriate than that they should
have a manstealing warrior for president
if the americans as a people form a mean
estimate of intelligence and have an obtuse
perception of right and wrongwhat more
reasonable than that they should have a man
w ho confesses himself to be ignorant of poli
hucal affaire and has been long schooled
amid the immoral and corrupt mg influences of
a camp for president if the americans as
a people entertain the idea that they have al
foady attained ihe acme of perfection and
that they cannot advance one step further
w hai more in accordance with such antiquated
and conceited notions than that they should
elect a man who is behind the ago far their
president none other would he a proper
exponent of thetr views none other reaid

one of this species qf singular productions
though there are various other specimens
particularly a very remarkable one at wash
ington is to be found in kentucky in the
neighborhood of louisville those who are
interested in such inquiries should not fail to
make themselves acquainted with it not
long since this polypus was accused of being
more alive than it thought just and by cer
tain very unmistakable wriggles manifested
its displeasure it is certainly very unfair
and by no means agreeable to be called worse
than one is and it is far from being desirable
tor various reasons at certain times to be
called better some excuse themselves with
great vehemence from the honor of being
called fanatics others would consider them
selves gieatly injured if they were suspected
of being religious some kentucky friend
of the louisville examiner the specimen of
polypus above referred to foully asperses that
paper as follows
the misrepresentation
lie cares not what becomes of the mani
fold interests of kcntdeky of the citizens of
kentucky so that he can succeed in
grafting abolitionism into the fundamental law
of the state
now this is a very fearful charge to make
against such a sensible sober popevholy
watcr sort of a paper as the louisville exam
iner lie accordingly repels the base calumny
in language sufficiently expressive of his in
i dignation and of the estimation in which he
holds all those who thus belie him
the reply
favorite scheme of abolitionism
why leading whigs leading democrats
now and m timeapast are for emancipation
are they to be thus denounced i are their
views to be thus fafc died leading ministers
of thegospd nativeborn their all here and
devoting their all to the state are for emanci
pation are they to be spit upon traduced
because this writer chooses to indulge in un
just suspicion and false charges  if so we
suffer in good company
what language can we use in reply 
how shall we meet such an opponent we
can only let him rave on but let him pass
we trust that he will grew wiser as he grew
older we cannot at least notice him again
unless he docs so
this writer it would seem considers him
self traduced spit upon in the good com
pany of leading whigs leading democrats
and leading ministers of the gospel because
he is classed with abolitionists what a
grievous defamation of character could
r
anything be inure unjust or unreasonable
he an abolitionist he be considered in any
way a party to the violent language and vio
lent measures of abolitionists nay verily
leading whigs leading democrats and
leading ministers of the gosjel are the
company of his choice and whose friendship
he is anxious to achieve doubtless he will
have his reward but only at the expense of
that independence of jarty which he makes
bis boast that it ta impossible to do other
wise in the part of the country where this
paper is pubhsbad is the ready reply of the
timid friends of such exponents of amisla
very sentiment there may be some truth in
this excuse but bolder men would certainly
use bolder language at all events they
would call things by their right names and
cot be guilty of the gross absurdity not to
say positive profanity which this paper com
mits m another article of the same number

from the absorbing interest which attracts
large numbers to the may coirrentioa and
other gatherings of abohtionists very many
others are induced to yield attendance because
of the meritorious variety both in manner and
matter of the aperehea there generated of
tboee who thus venture to indulge a rorioa

usually convicted of their proslsvery sins
and in due process of time acknowledge

these meetings present a strong contrast
to most othersin the fset that abolitionists
really have something to talk about and
faithfully perform their duty slavery ia the
monster enl iu the united states which when
eradicated the leaner evils can be more readily
disposed of
the abolitionists too are the most consist
ent friends of fra speech and if opponents pro
sent themselves with ever so great s quantity
of indignation bottled up only let the fact be
known and they are invited to the platform
and listened to with an attention almost sag
gestive of a doubt as to whether or not garri

forces the omnipresent need ef remembering
the chums of the bondman as being indeed
bound with him or adin ballou that we
must be faithful to duty w hether governments
or individuals interposeit will be found upon
observation that abolitionists generally blend
the details of every day life in accordance
with sentiments advocated on the platform
the antislavery mission is regarded by
them as far transcending the piere ecclesias
tical or political organizations of the land in
asmuch as humanity is more sacred than
sectarian dogmas or party subserviencyand
abolitionists who have been such for any num
ber of years arc often beard to acknowledge
that the cause bad been to them a school
w herein to form a character to flow out ia
blessings on all around and especially upon
the oppressed portion of community it could
hardly be otherwise for ibe purest and best
minds of the country are to be found in tho
ranks of abolitionists association with each
other must tend to elevate and refine the heart
in advocacy of the hundred conventions
mr phillips remarkedin substance that
thrre is a tids in the affairs of men
w liich taken at the flood leads on to fortune
and that the present was one which if improv
ed by abolitionists would tend tu the success
of their causethe incident at washington
in which sayres and dray tonthe william
tell and william wallace of the day had at
tempted deliverance for the slaves on board
the pearl and their imprisonment for the no
ble deed bad enlisted public attention all
eyes were directed to the national prison at
w ashington and we should exert our influ

revolution was abroad the enthusiasm of na
hons acted upon nationsthere could not be a
better ruoraout if poetry had chooeo it tho
idea should be constantly presented to the
mases until such an indignalian is enkindled
that were the jail in boston or even in new

appealed to it would be torn down as tho
french did ihe basilic
ay e ask you then to give us your money
give us die power of talking and submitting
the principles and facts of antislavery to the
peoplelead tlie cause the backgiound of
your influence in the social circle and various
relations ol life the slave is toiling in tho
carolina and we are bound by every consid
eration of humanity to stir him up to such an
uneasiness in his chains that he will not be
satisfied aliort of the liberty which bdoogs
alike to all men the state should erect it
banner of encouragement to the bondman and
terror to his master
the object of these meetings ia to regener
ate public sentiment and create such a detes
tation of slavery that all will hasten in their
chosen way its annihilation no one can tell
how it will be effected whether w ith or with
out the dissolution of the constuutou but
let all act according to their judgment only
let them act earnestly for this is no holiday
work words unaccompanied with deeds
have shipwrecked the church we invoke the
deeds that will redeem a uuliou troio its
fatal compromises and mistakes create w re
ality a model republic and rescue the bible
from being claimed as the corner atone of
slavery
there is already some anti slavery senti
ment at the north which is an offshoot from
the disunion doctrinesthis must be used
the people would oon be ready if they bad
leaders and abolitionists should lake advan
tage of the harvest and not trust it to poli
ticians for the parties have bved out their vi
taity and they know it a battle is hall fought
when the forces are properly marshalled
y e must persevere battery by battery
trench by trench not dealing in
but speaking the plain truth to the slavehold
er and his apologist not using words merely
to exasperate but omit none for the sake of it
we must gain the ultra point tkus in the pin
kmopliy of reform we w ant she self denial of
early abolitioniststhe devotion and seal of
the party that our every exertion may be
forth to rid tho land of its sin
in reply to some remarks on densnetatwo
the speaker observed that abolitionists dapro
rated m as much as any ooe bat thoegfct that
thuw who remembered tbe giant evil with
which they contended the opposition too of

awnthe apsthy of the peoplewould have de

erence was made to tho sayings and dtooca of
those who had hceo piqseeisthe tegeaerw

out in comparison with many of whcaa tho
antislavery denunciations were but uasoaod
weak and woaid bo so regarded vrhea wo
who now otter them are m oar graves tho
eaose and the time alike that the
troth should be toldit was doe to the toiling
tsifltoos that wo should not waste time la
hunt op choice and delicate kngyfs m which
to speak of their wrongs it ts as hard to exaggerate
the proslavery tendencies of the church and the political parties as to gild gold or paint the lily 
an allusion was made to the tame and cautious language used by edward everett in the eulogy of john quincy adams with
with hated breath and honied words he sake
pardon for referring to the subject which ha
surred the latest effort of mr adams an
spoke as though he was addressing a bosto
sudienec of fifteen years ago saying
think no one will take offence when i sat
that the subject to which mr adams devote
these noble efforts was that of slavery
the eulogist did not seem to know that ever
heart there ached fwr the bold word of af
proval that ought to have been uttered b
him in portraying what the popular mind h
so appreciated as the glory of the departs
statesman all there hungered fr the won
which the orator lacked courage to pro
nounce
mr phillips made one of hs best apeevhe
on the disunion question the mam feature
of which hate been reported in other pajers
and may probably yet find a place in the star
his efforts on the antislavery platform wil
sver be treasured a a most valuable legae
to the cause a most valuable eflering 
freedom s aiur it a distinguishing char
aetensuc of mr phillips that he is alwayi
at home on the subject of antislaverv a
indeed on any subject claiming his attention
his speeches are therefore always well strer
wiih historical illustrations and classical anc
pertinent imagery always aeeming to have
disciplined his mind as by the following sug
gestion once imparted by him to a young man
and which may prove of benefit toothers
when you lecture speak or advise anothei
on any subject try to make yourself firs
perfect master of it read all you can find or
the point think and digest vosr thoughts
clearly beforehand stock your mind so wdi
with facts and ideas that you shall never bn
at a loss what to say but rather which of the
many ideas you have gained you will endea
vor to impress upon the audience only
think how manifestly unjust it is when two
or three hundred persons have collected toge
ther to hear us to give them only our super
ficial thoughts or what we have gathered in
one or two hours reading
an audience never tires when mr phillips
has the platform aside from his unrivalled
eloquence it may he safely asserted as a
reason that his speech instead of being one
long prosy argument is more like a brilliant
chain of arguments each link of which car
ries conviction home to the heart and con
science of his hearers and this is the
way that the masses have been moved in
the moment of emergency the work has
always been effected by the short appeal 
firm resolve each have produced their magic
results far transcending the lengthy har
angue which the major part of an audience
never try to retain on their memories
it was remarked of benjamin franklin and
general y ashington that they never spoke
more than teu minutes at a time nor to any
but the main point deciding the question
at issue they laid their shoulders to the
great potato knowing that live little ones
would follo wof course brevity is as much
the soul of argument as of wit long talks
may be at times essential but such instances
are among the exceptions the general rule
hu proved the superiority of a more con
densed method of appeal aphorisms and
maxims of philosophers from socrates down
to poor richard as also the fables of resop
phadrus or la fontaine when embodying
the speakers idea have always been words
fitly spoken like applies ol gold in pictures
of silver
a meeting was held at the belknap street

against slavery and why will it not do

the hearers reforms have always been the
means of disturbing the harmony of the

they look further to the christian church
expecting to hear from its members as from
the founder of the system the most scorch

and they find the men who are faithful to the

it would ins well for professedly christian
i churches to look into this matter a little nore
seriously than they have yet done and bestow
a little more thought on the hypocritical in
consistency of professing hostility to slavery
and symjathy for its victims and at the same

i i observe a communication written by emm
steer put porting to be a memorial concerning
her brother israel french deceased ii
i which the writer takes occasion to introduci
the subject of the difficulties and ultimati
i separation of the society of friends ii
which elias hicks was the first mover an
in which through its whole course he bor
so prominent a part and which eventualh
i ended in his disownment together w ith i
large number of his followers by that part o
the society since called orthodox the wri
ter assumes that his first offncc given to
society or at least to his principal accusers
was his testimony against slavery i was
acquainted with elias hicks from very early
life and from the time i w as capable of ob
serving or understanding such things i al
ways considered him to be a firm persevering
 and eousbtem advocate of the slave and fot
the colored people generally and the writei
might have said much njoro  eomraendatior
of his zeal and iabors in that cause than she
hasiajdj and it would have met in iny mind
a cordial response but he was very fai
 from standing alone in society in his anti
slavery principles or feelings there have
been many hundreds to that society for per
i haps a century or more that have beer a
i honest and as faithful friends to the slave as
ejias iltcks though it may be but few have
j bad tha opportunity or ability to labor as
j much and as efficiently in the cause as he
jdid at least at the time he lived and was at
the most active stage of life but as to his
antislavery principles or any measures which
he pursued under their influence being his
first offence to society or any offence at all
i feel warranted in saying that that reproach
jeast upon the society of friends by the writei
of the article under review is entirely ground
less and incorrect
when i first became dissatisfied with some
ol the dvtruie promulgated by e ias ilicks
and for several thereto i
did not knew that another individual in society
was so and when the controversy which
i gradually arose became general much was
said and much was written on the occasion
during which i was a close observer of wbal
passed and in all i ever saw in print or in
manuscript or ever heard in conversation
muhing of the kind ever met my eye or my
ear but as the writer of the article appears
to have lived several hundred miles from the
place where elias hicks was treated with and
disowned and as a lapse of near twenty
years has passed since that time it seems
to form sonic excuse for her mistake for such
i charitably believe it to be

three thousand mere boys were paralyzing the

nay it was absolutely three days before our
government was able to assemble sufficient
force to put an end to this absurd exhibition

unheard of began to make bona fide physical

all over the country their orators addressed

some joined the faction the soidisant na

forth and every detail of the ridiculous scenes
enacted in it was duly reported in the pa

exceptions were utterly devoid at length

the subversion of the government president
cuffey who by tbe bye is a mulatto was
to be installed before night fall when the
day dawned scarcely any one in loudon knew
how it would end it did end however
the chartists by a spasmodic effort had
managed to assemble from all parts of the
country at the very utmost fifteen thousand
men on the other hand ten t mes that num

its vicinity alone come forward and sworn to
uphold the government their great leader

appended to it but onethird were found
really to exist of these immense num

compilation of facts drawn from various

is an extract from the prefocc
few americans are aware of the support
the despotisms of the old world iferive frumj
the system of slavery existing m this country
i a few years ago the chartists of england
and scotland were shaking the united ring
i dnm with their agitations in behalf of an ex
tension of the political franchise they de
clared that the people were capable of self
j government and demanded that they should
have the same rights in the choice of their
own legislators as are enjoyed in the united
j states and with the constitution of these
j states and their declaration of independence
in their hands as exponents of their views i
they were doing much for the advaaceineutol
their great cause but they wre met by the
friends of monarchy and the people were told
to beware of them that in the united
states whosa institutions wore so much
lauded three millions of the people were
slaves that their wives were torn from
them and sold at publie auction and their
children by the pound and that bad as their
condition was the tallest peer in the realm
dare not rob them of either wife or child
th it though poor they were not slaves
but the design of these agitators was to make
them slaves as their reference to the amen 
can government clearly proved
an american gentleman james n buft

great britain in the summer of  visited
the tower of london and by the payment of
a fee was shown the queens jewels and j
among other tilings her crown while look
ing at the costly bauble he was told by the
lad who had it in charge that the jewels
with which it was studded cost three millions
of pounds sterling feeling his republican
i spirit stir within him ho said he thanked
god he did not live in a country where one
woman wore three millions of pounds 
 dollars on her head while others
i were starving for want of potatoes well
said an old sailor who was standing near
j  you may thank god for what you pleasebut
i thank him that i do not live in a land where i
a h men are born free and equal and three
millions are stoves

were the people of this nation and their j
institutions really what they profess to be j
they would challenge the respect and udmira

hypocrisy only excites its disgust and the
kingridden and priestridden subjects of eu
rope are made to bear their burdens in com
parative silence through fear of increasing i
their miseries in any eliuru to better their j
condition by attempting to throw oil the desj
potism under which they are groaning they
are not now bought and sold like dumb beasts i
in the market but they are told that millions

free soil meeting ia cincinnati
a great public meeting wan held in cin
cinnati on the evening of the th inst  to
vindicate the great principle of free soil and
free labor lot e brewster presided
the nominations of the baltimore and phila
delphia netioual convention were both repu
diated and the following resolutions among
others adopted
resolved that wc cannot support the nom
inations for the presidency and vieepresi
denev made by the baltimore convention of
the democratic party or the philadelphia
convention of the whig party and will not
support them
resolved that in miking this declaration
we do not propose to sunder permanent v our
political party connections exist
ing but believing that the will of the peo
ple of the free states deman ling the exclu
sion of slavery from national territories has
not h en at all expressed by the baltimore
and philadelphia conventions we do propose
to act together as the party of the people
until that will shall find expression and obe
dience in the national executive and the
natonal legislature
resolved that we earnestly hope that the
convention of the democracy of new york
about to assemble at utica m that state and
the peoples convention of ohio about tq
assemble at columbus in this state will corn
a national convention to assemble at some 
convenient place july in next to nominate j
candidates for the presidency and vieepresi
dency worthy of the support of the friends
of freedom and free territory
resolved that we recognize as valid that
interpretation of the doctrine of free soil
which not only excludes slavery from
national territories but assures to every
actual settler a reasonable portion of thej
national domain in free and without price
as a permanent home for himself and child
rei and we fully believe that an intelligent
and industrious yeomanry such as would be
created by the adopting this liberal policy 
would prove in every emergency the surest
safeguard and defence of free institutions
resolved that while france ireland
germany and italy and other nations of euj
rope are moving for freedom amid the hopesi
and prayers of a sympathizing would it illy
becomes the country of washington jeffer
son and franklin to assume the part of tjjrj
propagandist of slavery and so far as our i

at utica on the

do not the scenes now enacting in martin
ique and guadaloupe convey a warning to us
as a people  the two racc of whites and
blacks are set in at ray and direful and mur
derous ihus far has been the conflict arc
our own slaves perfectly patient under their
bonds are there not hotheaded men who
preach whenever and however they can
reach them the doctrines of resistance to the i
authority of the master and the duty of mur 
dering him that ne the slave may be free
can these things go on for years and not
bring about a state of things similar to that
which now prevails inmartinque and guada 
loupe it appears to us that titey cannot and 
that it would be wisdom on our part to take
such measures as arc feasible to mitigate the
evils or do away with slavery altogether all
over the continent of europe as well as inj
the west indies a i car of races  going on
and we cannot expect that the negro race of
this countty will torever remain quiet the
spirit of rebellion freedom or whatever anv
one chooses  call it will sooner or later
arouse them to action and the evil hour is
unquestionably hastened on bv the mad fanal
ticism of those who are crying out ibr iroj

the horrid murders and butcheries which i
have taken place in martinique are in

men who still remain tolling unrequited in the

is their labor wrested from them unremunma
ted not only do they sutler from intense hun
ger and cold not only arc the females out
sisters subjected to the cruel and passionate
i outrages of their tyrannical masters and over
seers but there are daily instances of sun
dering the dearest ties in nature thus sepa
rating them forever and can we expect any
thing bettercan we look for benevolence or
fine feelings from a system so foul and fiend
ish as slavery it would lie unreasonable
because a corrupt tree cannot bring forth
good fruit therefore knowing that with
out associative action we cannot render effi
cient aid to this holy cause we affectionately
invite the cooperation of the citizens of roch
ester and the public generally wc ask them
to bear in mind the injunctions of jesus all
things whatsoever ye would men should do to
you do ye even so to them remember
also the beautiful parable in which he calls
our attention to the sick and to those w ho are
in prison and concludes by the forcible asser

unto me we feci assured all that have
hearts to feel and are careful to attend to the
monitions of conscienceall who are deter
mined to live fur the good of our race instead
of devoting all their time to their own per
sonal easeall who feel bound to improve the
precious time allotted to them here bv puv
moting as much as possible the cause of truth
and righteousness in the earth will come for
ward in the work of laboring to banish forever
the demon of slavery from our land arid in
so doing instead of an example of corruption
and wickedness we should be a light to the
world
we hope no one will feel too poor nor any
too rich to enlist in this holy causa the
christians influence in whatever situation is
always salutary and will certainly produce its
good effects we ask for the aid of men and
of women we call on the old and the
young the farmer the mechanic and the
merchant we ask all and every ond to give
us their help to devote what they can spare
either of money or of the fruits of their la
bor to the work of restoring men and women
to themselves to their manhood to the rights
and blessings with which they ware endowed
by our creator
for this abject we propore holding a faft
in december next we ask the females in
the adjoining towns and country around us to
get up sewing circles and prepare such arti
cles as will be most saleable and to come  fur
nish tables give us their company and help
us not only in selling those things thus pre
pared but in convincing the public mind of
the necessity of our perseverance and fidelity
i and thus be helpers in hastening the day of

a lesson on life and death
the trial of william freeman for
the murder of john g van neat in
cluding the evidence and the argu
ment of counselÂ 
y benj
f hall counsellor at law has just
been issued in a fair octavo lawbook
fashion of  pages by derby mil
ler sl co auburn although the
leading facts in this case are tolerably
well known wa carl attention once
again to them because of tbeir great
intrinsic interest and the salutary moral
they inculcate
william freeman was a poor youth
of mingled african and indian blood
j who was horn in auburn and had gen
erally lived in that place or its vicinity
subsisting by his labor in various ser
i vile capacities but more usually idle
he had next to no education and being
i without the means of paying even u
 pewrent very little religious instrue
lion we doubt whether this lost
sheep was ever looked after by a pro
fessional shepherd until the wolves oi
the law got hold of him when 
j years old he was arrested for a horse
theft he had uo sort of hand in con
i victed on the testimony of the actual
thief and sent for five years to the
state prison consciousness of the in
i justice of his imprisonment combined
with a natural passion for wayward
roving made him an unruly prisoner
and he was consequently beaten over
the head till his hearing was impaired
and his intellect also he had two in
sane sisters in prison he brooded on
the injustice of his sentence and in
sisted on redress he came out in
sept  still harping on his wrongs
and insisted on having payment for the
time that the state had robbed him of
but asking nothing for the brutalities to
which he had been subjected never
was there a more righteous demand
than this yet the law proffered him no
redress and the magistrates to whom
he soccessively applied scouted his
appeal thus refused he wandered
about doing a little work occasionally
and living in the hut of a poor black
washerwoman saying little and seem
ing generally sullen and stupified save
when aroused to insist that somebody
ought to pay him for five years hard
labor in the state prison thus he
brooded his head fractured by one of
the blows he had received in prison
until he became a savage maniac and
starting otf three miles south on the
evening of the pith of march 
he entered the house of a worthy far
mer named john g y r an nest just as
the family were retiring to rest and
with a knife he carried stabbed five per
sons mr and mrs van nest and
their son george so that they died in
stantly mrs phebe wycoff mortally
and a mr van arsedale severely
leaving them all weltering in their gore
v an arsdale overpowered and drove
him from the house when he stole a
horse from the stable hard by mounted
and fled w hen that horse failed he
stole another and continued his flight
until arrested next day by pursures
at a place in oswego county  miles
off
of course so awful a tragedy created
intense excitement horror and the
thirst for vengeance were aroused
large numbers hastened to the scene
of butchery especially on the occasion
of the funeral of the victims when
the reverend officiator held forth as
follows
if ever there w as a just rebuke
upon the falsely socalled sympathy of
tne day here it is let any man in
his senses look at this horrible sight
and thenthink of the spirit with which
it was perpetrated and unless he loves
the murderer more than his murdered
victims he will he must confess that
the law of god which requires that
he that sheddeth mans blood by man
shall his blood be shedis right is just
is reasonable is this the way to pre
vent murder by sympathy it encour
ages it it steels the heart and nerves
the arm of the assassin
but capital punishment is said to be
barbarous cruel savage what does
it amount to why that god com
mands that which is barbarous cruel
savage most daring blasphemy
all punishment is for the good of the
culprij or else it is tyrannical the
wretch who committed this horrid deed
has been in the school of a state prison
for five years and yet comes out a
murderer beside it is an undeniable
fact that murder has increased with the
increase of anticapital punishment
spirit it awakens a hope in the wretch
that by adroit counsel law may be per
verted and jurors bewildered or melted j
j by sympathy that by judges infected j
with it their whole charge may be in
favor of the accused that by the lav
ishment of money appeals might bej
multiplied and by putting off the trial j
witnesses may die why none of usj
are safe under such a false system as
this for the murderer is almost cerj
tain of being acquitted if i shoot a
man to prevent him breaking into my j
house and killing ray family these
gentlemen will say i did right but it
he succeeds and murders my whole
family then it would be barbarous to
put him to death oh shame shame
i appeal to this vast assembly to main
tain the laws of their country inviolate
and cause the murderer to be pun
ished
such appeals were hardly needed
to produce the state of feeling desired
vengeance vengeancespeedy cer
tain terriblewas the general cry a
highly moral and religious mob were i
barely prevented by stratagem from
seizing the poor wretch on his way to
jail and tearing him to pieces if there
had been the least doubt entertained
of his being surely and quietly put to
death nothing would have prevented
their tearing him limb from limb
his trial commenced on the th of
june following nobody supposed it
could have any other than the one re
sult in hundreds of such cases the
perpetrator has been sent to the gal
lows with as little ceremony as is em
ployed in killing an ox but gov sew

accused was truly insane freemen
himself desired no counsel suggested
no defence tbe whole county was
bent on banging him and a lea potent
reason has sent many a man to tbe gal
towa who bad never killed anybody a
jury waa first empanneied to try tbe
question of insanity after a trial of
intense interest covering the whole
 ground of the nature of crime and in

i jury at midnight on the th of july
and at  p m of the following day
the jury returned a verdict of we
find tbe prisoner snfficiently sane in
mind and memory to distinguish be
tween right and wrong this the
judge declared a verdict of smnit and
j ordered tbe prisoner to be put upon
trial for his life gov seward ex
cepted but was overruled and the trial
j proceeded attorney general john v an

i every step was contested on each side
with consummate ability and desperate
i resolution and on the d the trial
resulted in a verdict of guilty followed
on the th by a sentence of death
but this was not final the defend
ants counsel took exception and car
j ried the case up to the supreme cotltt
where the judgment below was reversed
and a new trial granted
the trial never took place the
circuit judge in the interim visit
ed the prisoner in his cell tested
his mental condition and refused to
try him again he remained in jail
evincing unmistakable and increasing
evidences of mingled insanity and idio
cy down to his death which occurred
on the st of august 
such are the leading facts exhibited
in the volume before us which not only
as a book of reference in trials where
insanity is pleaded but to every one
who takes an interest in the nature of
crime of insanity and of their con

my soul is younger than my body fif
teen years i existed for i did not live
it was not life in the selfsame dungeon
ten feet square during six years  had
a companion during nine i was alone
i never could rightly distinguish the
face of him who shared my captivity in
the eternal twilight of our cell the
first year we talked incessantly together
we related our past lives our joys for
ever gone over and over again the
next year we communicated to each
other our thoughts and ideas on all sub
jects the third year we had no ideas
to communicate wc were beginning to
lose the power of reflection the fourth
at the interval of a month or so we
would often openour lips to ask each
other if it were indeed possible that the
world went on as gay and bustling as
when we formed a portion of mankind
j the fifth we were silent the sixth
he was taken away i never knew
wheie to execution or liberty but i
was glad when he was gone even sol
itude was better than the dim vision of
that pale vacant face after i
was alone only one event broke in upon
my nine years vacancy one day it
must have been a year or two after my
companion left me the dungeon door
opened and a voicewhence proceed
ing i know notuttered these words
by order of his imperial majesty i in

advantages of hardship
great men are the natural growth
of a strong soil they never spring
up of themselves like the flowers and
grasses from the richest and warmest
earth rockrooted like the giants of
the vegetable kingdom they are of
slow growth and their duration mav
always be measured by their growth
reputations that are suddenly acquired
are never worth having
great men are the natural growth of
hardship and trial and suffering the
human heart is made all the steadier
j and the stronger by that of which it most j
complainshardship the soul itself
is strengthened by opposing influences
by countervailing duties even as the
mainmast of a mighty ship is stayed by
ropes pulling difterent ways with 
draw but the least of those many ropes
tear away but a small portion of that
which causes the whole fabric to
groan and creak and what becomes of
the tottering spar and the unsteady
ship
so too are great men the natural
growth of opposition they are up
liftedas the kite is or the thunder
cloudnot by favoring but by adverse

of greatness opposition is that solid
platform which archimedes asked for
when he threatened to upheave the
earth where pyramids are to be
tumbled from their base or cities over

ye who go about doing good with
out opposition you would have nothing
to hope for  here would be no place
for your fulcrumno field for the play
of your levers
but you complain of the great pres
sure upon you of a pressure within
and without of a pressure above and
about you as well might you com
plain of the pressure of the atmos
phere it is that which upholds you in
your place as well might the diver
complain of the pressure of the sea
when he goes dowu into its depths after
pearls but for the very greatness and
uniformity of that pressure he could
not steady himself let it be taken off
as upon the top of a high mountain
and he falters and tremblesa little

very pressure which be so bewails and
his buoyancy is gone and with it his
uprightnesshis lungs are ruptured

have borne a prenare of so tone to the

the timbers of wreck in deep water
will not rise
thus are men strengthened by their
multiplied obligations by the very
weight of the vast and solemn duties
piled upon them upon every side and
upon every side alike they feel the
pressureand therefore it is that they
are not ovewhelmed w ithdraw but
a small portion from either sidefrom

its power courage then courage

be thankful that barriers are piled up in

the quarterly review in discussing
i an objection to the copyright bill ol
mr sergeant tallourd which was ta
ken by sir edward sugden gives some
j very curious particulars about the pro
geny of literary men we are not
says the writer going to speculate
about the causes of the tact but a fact
it is that men distinguished for extra
ordinary intellectual power of any sort
rarely leave more than a brief line ol
progeny behind them men of genius
have scarcely ever done so men of
imaginative genius we might say al
most never with the one exception
of the noble surrey we cannot at this
moment point out a representative m
the male line even so far down as the
third generation of any english poet
and we believe the case is the same in
france the blood of beings of that
order can seldom be traced far dow n
even in the female line with the ex
ception of surry and spencer we are
not aware of any great english author
of at all remote date from whose body
any living person claims to be descend
ed there is no other real english
poet prior to the middle of the eigh
teenth century and we believe no great
author of any sort except clarendon
and shaftesbury of whose blood we
have any inheritance amongst us
chaucers only son died childless
shakspeares line expired in his daugh
ters only daughter none of the oth
er dramatists of that age left any pro
geny nor raleigh nor bacon nor
cowley norÃutler the granddaugh

ards last argument against a perpetui
i ty in literary property is that it would
i be founding another n iblesse neither
jealous aristocracy nor envious jacobin
ism need be under much alarm
when a human race has produced
its bright consummate flower in
this kind it seems commonly to be near
its end
poor goldsmith might have been
mentioned in the above list the theo
ry is illustrated in our own day the
two greatest names in science and in
literature of our day were davy and
walter scott the first died child
less sir walter scott left four chil
dren of whom three are dead only
one of whom mr lockhart leaving
issue and the fourth his eldest son
though living and long married has
no issue these are curious facts
educators cherish hope i
of all moving sights of woe the
most mournful is that of a hopeless
child a single glance at its listless
limbs its dull eye its languid move
ments shows the mischief that has been
done the child is utterly unreliable
a mere burden upon the world
he has no truth no love no industry
no intellectual power in him and if he
i has any conscience it is the mere re
mainsenough to trouble him without
i doing him any good this is an ex
treme case and i trust a rare one
but cases of repressed hope are much
more common than they should be
there are too many children who are
baulked of their mothers spmpathy be
cause she is busy or fretful or of their
fathers because he is stern too many
little hearts are made to swell in silence
because they cannot get justice or to
burn under the suspicion that their as
pirations are despised alter this
what can they do at bestthey carry
their confidence elsewhere and make
their chief interests away from home
and it is too probable that they will
give up their plans and aspirations and
sink down to lower hopes
in the case of every human being
hope is to be cherished from first to
last not the hope of the particular
thing that the child has set its mind
on unless the thing itself be gone
but the hopeful mood of mind the
busiest mother can have nothing to do
so important as satisfying her childs
heart by a word or look of sympathy
and the most auxious father can have
nothing so grave to occupy him as the
peril he puts his child into by plunging
him into undeserved fear and disap
pointmentanon
exfoslre to the sc a there are
few points which seem less generally
understood or more clearly proved than
the fact that exposure to the sun with
out exercise sufficient to create a pers
piration will prodfice illness and that
the same exposure to the sun with suffi
cient exercise will not produce illness
let any man sleep in the sun he will t
wake perspiring and very ill perhaps
he will die let the same man dig in the
sun for the same length of time and he
will perspire ten times as much and be
quite well the fact is that not only
the direct rays of the sun but the beat
of the atmosphere produce abundance
of bileand powerful srcise alone will
carry off that bile
the press
the importance mod responsibility oi
the press is mighty and overwhelming
its beoeficial effects ia society can
only be calculated by the relative posi
tion it occupies to the wants of the peo
ple in establishing those principles and
spreading those truths broadcast in the
world which tend lo enlighten the in
tellect arouse the faculties and se
cure the happiness of the whole but
when the press consents to stoop from
its proud position to become the mouth
piece for a party of corrupt politicians
and will employ all its influences and
exhaust all its energies in corrupting
and misleading the public mind upon
the great questions of national policy
for no other purpose than securing the
spoils of office and the aggrandisement
of the few then will principle and true
patriotism award to her the condemna
tion she has hstly merited in sacrificing
principle for party and write the in
scription for her monument for the
gaze of the whole world in characters
