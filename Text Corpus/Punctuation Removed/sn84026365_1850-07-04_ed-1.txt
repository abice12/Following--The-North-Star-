abolition of slavery in new
england
by henry ward beecher
the slavery in new england never
was the slavery of the south the
slavery of the south in our day adopts
the roman civil law as the basis of its
code this law is briefly explained
and the fact of its adoption with some
modifications toward severity rather
than lenity in the southern states is
stated by the court of south caroli
na
a master made a devise to trus
tees for the benefit of his slave bet
sey and her children devise held to
be yoid per cun the condition of
slaves in this country is analogous to
that of the ancient greeks and ro
mans and not that of the feudal times
they are considered not as persons
but as things they can be sold or
transferred as goods or persona estate
they are held to be pro nullis pro inor
tuis by the civil law slaves could not
take property by decent or purchase
and i apprehend this to be the law of
this countrydess rep iv 
south carolina as quoted by judge
jay to whose writings and to strouds
sketches of the laws relating to sla
very i am chiefly indebted for the le
gal references of this article
now new england never held a
slave on the basis of the roman civil
law but under a law which was ex
pressly enacted for the benefit of the
slave and for the ultimate destruction
of slavery viz the hebrew law of sla
very
as early as  the following law
was passed by the general court of
massachusetts
it is ordered by this court and
the authority thereof that there shall
never be any bond slavery villenage
or captivity among us unless it be
lawful captives taken in just war
such as willingly sell themselves or
or are sold to us and such shall have
the liberties and christian usage
which the law of god established in
israel concerning such persons mor
tally require
the roman civil code and the he
brew code are not only different but
the difference is such that the one will
make slavery utter and fatal and the
other will alleviate it make it less and
less valuable to the master and cer
tainly abolish it under the appearance
of regulating it
connecticut seems to have had the
largest number of slaves of any new
england stateln  when maine
and massachusetts had none new
hampshire  vermont  rhode
island  connecticut  what
was slavery then in connecticut
judge tapping reeve says
the law as heretofore practiced in
this state respecting slaves must
now be uninteresting i will however
lest the slavery which prevailed in this
state should be forgotton mention some
things that show that slavery here was
very far from being of the absolute
rigid kind the master had no con
trol over the life of his slave if he
killed him he was liable to the same
punishment as if he killed a freeman
the master as was liable to be sued by
the slave in an action for beating or
wounding or for immoderate chastise
ment as he would be if he had thus
treated an apprentice a slave was
capable of holding property in char
acter of devise or legatee if the mas
ter should take away such property
his slave would be entitled to an action
against him by his prochein ami next
friend from the whole we see that
slaves had the same right of life and
property as apprentices and that the
difference betwixt them was this an
apprentice is a servant for time and
the slave is a servant for life
how utterly different this slavery
was from that of the south judge buf
fin of north carolina shows when
speaking on this very point
this viz slavery has indeed
been assimilated at the bar to the other
domestic relations and arguments
drawn from the well established prin
ciples which confer and restrain au
thority of the parent over the child the
tutor even the pupil the master over
th apprentice have been pressed on
vol  no 
us the court does not recognize the
application there is no likeness be
tween the cases they are in oppo
sition to each other and there is an
impassable gulf between them the
difference is that which exists be
tween freedom and slavery and a
greater could not be imagined
the very effect of the hebrew law
of slavery was so to direct the masters
attention to his fives comfort and re
ligious education that ere he was
aware of it the slave stood in his view
so surrounded with the rights of man
and sanctious of religion tha he could
not regard him as much less than an
equal fellow and it is historically
true that the brief trial of the hebrew
law of slavery in new england produ
ced the same effect there judge par
sons of mass saysthe treatmeni
of slaves was in general mild and hu
mane and they suffered hardships nol
greater than hired servants and in
the same case he says that a discon
tented slave was worth little to his
master insomuch that he sometimes
colluded with the slave and allowed
him to sue for his liberty that he might
get rid of him and the burden of his
support the winchendon vs hat
field  mass rep  and if the
south that perpetually refers to the
old testament to justify her system of
slavery will consent to take that he
brew law of slavery in exchange for
her roman civil law for one i should
regard the work of liberty as begun
and calmly wait for time to complete
what god through moses designed
the utter extirpation of slavery
 but the worst feature of this
slanderous charge of the journal ol
commerce against the whole north is
that they kept their slaves until they
were found to be unprofitable and
then sold them to the south there
cannot be an untruth more utter than
this nor more insulting to new eng
land
slavery was abolished in vermont
july   after the revolution
some attempts were made to transport
out of the state negroes and mulattoes
and sell them in open violation of the
laws but in  the general as
sembly passed an act making it penal
to ioo to sell a colored man the
same to be paid to a person sought to
be sold together with the cost of
suit c
slavery was formally abolished in
massachusetts by the adoption of the
constitution in  the first article
of which declares that all men are
born free and equal after that date
this clause was by the courts re
garded as settling the question of sla
very the unexpected decision of the
courts made it impossible for slaves to
be sold in anticipation of it
new hampshire abolished slavery
by the adoption of its constitution in
 and connecticut in the same
manner at a later date
but it is principally to new york a
state with which the editor of the jour
nal of commerce surely ought to be
well acquainted that we wish to direct
attention
in  there were  slaves in
the state of new york ten years
after  the number was 
diminishing in ten years but  in
 the act of gradual emancipation
was passed declaring all children born
thereafter to be free males when com
ing tq the age of  and females at
 it is hardly possible to conceive
more humane and vigilant enactments
to preventany of these slaves being
sold to the south a fine of  was
the penalty and the freedom of the
slave was the result of an attempt to
sell him out of the state although
masters were allowed to travel with
their slaves yet under severe fanes
they were obliged to return them or
under oath to make proof that una
voidable accident prevented the return
ing that some might have been smug
gled off we do not deny though we
have no evidence of it
in  we believe another act was
passed declaring all slaves to be free
in  and on july th of that year
the act took effect and every slave
nearly ten thousand was manumitted
without compensation to their owners
it is high time for men to be held to
responsibility who defile history by de
claring that the north got rid of slavery
at a profit and for a profit and we re
ply to southern demands for northern
help in this matter we demand no
losses of you which we did not encoun
ter ourselves
let it be shown by whoever can
that the increasing intelligence of the
people in respect to a practice which
the then civilized world tolerated and
the growing perception that slavery
could not be enforced without a viola
tion of religion and humanity were
not the true causes of its disconinu
ance in new england and new york
no system of slavery in this land can
be profitable which does not put the
slave under a regimen which denies
him the rights of manhood the north
on the basis of the hebrew slavery
law lound it out it refused to go fur
ther and sacrifice its religious scru
ples the south on the basis of the
roman civil law imbibed its inhuman
spirit put on the screws and forced
the system into its present legal atti
tude with a written code more infa
mous than the unwritten law of any
pirates deck this is the very histori
cal difference between the north and
the south her religion made the
north unwilling to grow richer by hold
ing on to a system with all its growing
requisitions and so she turned to her
granite and to the frozen seas where
fish swarm and to the loom and the
right  of no sex truth is of no cr
anvil the south generous upon im
pulse but impatient of the restraints
of longcontinued rigid principle chose
the other alternative drove the slaves
into the field and grew rich on their
toil and debasemement emancipator

richmond va may 
as i was conversing with some
southerners in washington upon free
soil they expressed a desire that i
shoulj go south and see slavey as
it exists there and i would come back
freed of ail free soil notions one
from florida was particularly anxious
that i should go home with him and he
would show me a tame alligator nine
feet long that he fed on terrapins and
deaa niggers never costs me any
thing to bury a dead nigger said he
i resolved to go as far south as this
place to see if there existed so much
difference between the practice and
heory of slavery as i sailed forth
his morning to see the place almost
he first thing that met my view was a
arge house surrounded by a very high
brick wall upon asking the first pas
ser by what it was he informed me it
was a nigger jail where traders con
fined their slaves preparatory to tak
ing them south he very politely
offered to conduct me through it which
i gladly accepted i have here here
tofore supposed that the term slaves
in chains as used in the newspapers
vyas a figure of speech used compara
tively but here they were chained
together sitting round on benches in
the most filthy and loathsome place i
ever saw i questioned one too why
he was chained he said he had been
sold to go south and he wanted to see
his wife again before we went and had
ran away to go back to his old mas
ters for that purpose my heart was
too full to question any of the others
in the female department there was
a very pretty white woman with two
cnildren by close inspection it might
be seen that she had a little african
blood in her veins apparently not over
one tenth but the children did not
show the least trace of it i expressed
my surprise at this to my conductor as
i had supposed slavery to be eon ed
to the african race when i was in
formed there was no limit of blood in
this state so long as the mother is a
slave the offspring is also no rnattei
of what color i have learned that
there are numerous slaves in this city
as white as their masters
my next move was to attend a slave
auction
the slaves of all colors from sooty
black to perfect white were brought
in and seated on benches here they
were subjected to the most particular
examination it was curious to see
the manner of the speculators in ex
amining their teeth they would or
der them to open their mouth then
press back their lips with their two
thumbs just as a jockey would a horse
on a window sill lay a large pile of
manacles some were constructed of a
large rod of iron with handcuffs on
each side so as to form a row the
first lot soid was the white woman and
her children that i before spoke of
the auctioneer extolled her qualities
by representing her to be a first rate
seamstress stc she was struck down
at 
the lackey of the place himself a
slave then lead up a man about 
unharness yourself old boy says
he the man trembling like a leaf all
the while strips himself with the assis
tance of the lackey in full view of the
street and of female slaves the
lackey asks him what he is shaking
for as he is not going to be hurt the
auctioneer announces no scars on his
back of any consequence and the sale
proceeds sold at  next conies
a little girl of  about half white
then two twin brothers of  sold to
different masters one i was told was a
southern trader so on to the end of the
sale when the gentlemen were thanked
for their attention and attendance re
quested tomorrow when they would
be shown something nice during the
sale my attention was call to the door
by a string of slaves going past chained
together probably on their way to
some southern plantation
altogether this was the most heart
sickening sight i ever saw i invol
untarily exclaimed is it possible that
this is permitted in our own native
country the country i loved so well
and whose institutions i have exulting
ly pointed to as an example for the
world
i am confident that the most effective
way for abolitionists to gain converts
to their cause is to send northerners
as far south as this place and let them
attend one of these slave auctions
hard indeed must be the heart of one
who could look upon such a scene and
not blush for his countrys shame i
remonstrated with some of the inhabi
tants for permitting such a thing among
them they all have their bible and
christianity at their tongues end and
arc ready to point out passages to jus
tify and show that it is a god ordained
institution if this is christianity i
replied dont call me a christian

to the public our friend says i
think there were more in attendance
than there were last year and the
greatest good feeling prevailed many
confessed that heir expectations were
more than realized and their feelings
enlisted in the objects of the meeting
far beyond any thing they had formed
an idea of before attending thus i
conceive there is nothing but encour
agement in prospect if we all adhere to
the great principles of right so clearly
impressed on the minds of many able
advocates it appears to me none could
have attended through that meeting
whose spirits were not rewarded anc
hearts enlarged towards the whole hu
man family while all sectarian distinc

significance for the tide of sympathetic
feeling for the good of mankind rose
far above them all and covered every
rising mound of opposition

ihe tribune of monday says its last
advices from vv ashington are adverse
to the passage of the omnibus bill it
was the intention of the friends of the
measure to have got through with al
the amendments on tuesday last  bu
this was found to be impossible auc
nearly the whole of this week will be
used up in the accustomed way near
ly all the amendments have come from
southern senators and although they
have suceeeded with several they still
want morewhether they can getthem
remains to be seen
opinions are as contradictory as ever
in regard to the prospect of the fina
passage of the bill it is evident how
ever that its chances have not improvei
for a few days past and that its more
ardent mends feel an unexpressed fear
that it must fail even in the senate
it is suspended by a hair its fate rests
with those who are counted as doubt
ful the tribune learns that messrs
berrien underwood morton and
pearce are not certain for the bill
while the loss of any two of them
would inevitably defeat it
in the house if the bill ever gets
there its oponents feel sure of nailing
it to the table as soon as a vote can
be obtained intelligent southern
men frankly confess that they cannot
claim with the least confidence the
vote of a single northern whig but
in the lace of this fact we see the
journal of commerce and its loco
foco allies constantly predicting that it
will pas  the housewe feel entire
confidence that they are mistaken
meantime the patience of the public
is well nigh exhausted and it is not
surprising that it should be congress
convened nearly seven months ago
and yet scarcely work enough has been
done to justify the expense of a
months session this difficulty arises
from no doubt in regard to the wish
and determination of a large majority
of the people upon the subject of slave
ry there is not a man in congress
who can or will deny that a vast majori
ty of the people are opposed to its ex
tension and the struggle to pass a bill
that comes far short of this and which
allows slaveholders to experiment
bfor a number of yearsupon the prac
icability of planting it in new mexico
has impeded all legislation upon other
great and suffering interests and ac
tually threatens to block the wheels of
governmenthow much more con
sistent with the ordinary mode of legis
lation how much more economical and
just would have been the prompt ad
mission of california when her appli
cation was presented however pure
may be the motives of some of those
who advocate the settlement of incon
gruous questions in one bill the fact is
not and cannot be disguised that a
majority of those who are responsible
for this great waste of time and treas
ure are hostile to freedom california
has repudiated slavery and that is the
secret of their opposition to her ad
mission it is time that such expensive
folly should be abandoned even
should this bill pass tomorrow does
not this long delay and the endless
number of amendments offered show
that nothing like a majority are really
in favor of its passage far better
then to abandon il at once and begin
the transaction of business in the ac
customed manner try every issue
upon its own merits and the verdict
will be much more likely to receive the
sanction of the tribunal before which
all the acts of our public servants are
reviewed
rynders and prof stuart
rynders the renowned apostle of the
new york mob defender of the faith
sic is in trouble having been accused
of the vulgar offence ofgambling mere
ly because he won a few paltry dollars
from a man less skilful than himself
and left his family to suffer the conse
quences by being turned penniless into
the street we suggest that this is a
case which appeals strongly to the sym
pathy and sense of justice of prof stu
art we cannot helieve that he will
permit his associate in the work of de
molishing the abolitionists to sink
under the denunciations of the fanatics
for an act nowhere expressly condemn
ed in the new testament and which
was virtually approved by the saints of
the old dispensation who often settled
important questions by casting lots
which we take it was a practice as
indentrcal with modern gambling as pa
triarchal and jewish sorvitude were like
the slavery of the south the learned
professor we are sure would find it as
easy a task to frame a scriptural de
fence of rynders as he did to accom
plish the same thing for webster and
since moses has begun the good work
of defending our modern prophets
profits he should show no partiality
surely isaiah is as worthy of a seat on

against the compromise or omnibus

some respects his arguments seem to
us conclusive we should like to see

the personal in the speech is ben
tonian no sarcasm is more biting
no irony more terrible we regretted
in reading it that it should be marred
by a spirit so narrow and a purpose so
unbecoming the occasion good
haters of a certain class will find food
enough for their hatred in bentons
speech
the effect of the speech was bad
mr clay embraced an occasion to
a letterhis good taste in doing it we
must condemn while we question the
morality of the actof a prive citizen
seeking to convict mr benton of incon
sistency this led to the angry pas
sage which is thus reported
mr benton followed inreply to mr
clay reading as his text several pas
sages from the speech made by the
senator from kentucky on the th of
february last in which he declared
the admission of california to be a
measure standing by itself and de
manding immediate action he mr
benton hoped the senator when ac
cusing the minority with having all
aiong delayed the settlement of that
question would deduct at least the
time during which he himself acted
with those who still contended for a dis
tinct consideration for california mr
b proceeded then to retort brck the
lecture which he conceived so gratui
tously given by mr clay as to the
waste of time
mr clay denied that he had attemp
ted to lecture the senate the office
of lecturer to be successful required
two qualifications the ability on the
part of the lecturer to impart instruc
tion and the capacity of the lectured
to receive instructionln this case
both the qualifications were wanting
he was in favor of the admission of
california and if it had depended on
him alone she would have been admit
ted long agohe professed to be a
practical man and it was well known
that he had yielded his own predilec
tic and wishes because tie became
satisfied that the speediest way of bring
ing california in would be in combina i
tiou with other measures
mr houston submitted some re
marks in defence of the title of texas
declaring that she knew her rights
and was prepared to assert defend and
maintain them at any cost
mr benton made some observations
denying as had been suggested by
mr clay that during last summer in
missouri he had expressed himself
against the admission of california
mr in apology for having
made the suggestion read a letter from
a gentleman named reed at indepen
dence missouri evidently to mr
foote in which the writer says that
mr benton in conversation with him
on the subject said she was not fit to
be admitted and that the executive
looking to that end was a coward poli
cy and that california should be
treated as other new states had been
in times past he only read this letter
in vindication of himself he did not
know the writer or vouch ifor his ac
curacy the senator would know
however whether it was true or not
mr benton denied the right of the
senator to arraign him thus in the
senate by reading a letter and calling
upon him to say whether it was true or
not but the senator would not get off
in that way he had nothing to do
with the senators informant but as
he has produced the letter here and
published it and thus made it a part of
the parliamentary history of the coun
try he held him responsible as its
author he pronounced it his clays
letter and as his letter he branded it
as an infamous calumny from beginning
to end loud calls to order
mr clayas to the senators im
putations l hurl them back with un
utterable scorn and indignation and
suggest to him to put in his casket of
other calumnies which herecries of
order and the rapping of the vice
presidents gavil interrupted the re
marks
mr webster expressed his regret
at such occurrences in the senate and
administered a well worded rebuke to
both for himself he would not sit in
the senate and witness such scenes
mr hale said if the rebtrke just
given was to be considered as just and
its suggestions to be followed in the
practise of the future he must beg
that some rule be established by which
it might be understood how old a sena
tor must be to entitle him to ememp
tion from having letters read against
him laughter the other daya letter
of such a character was read against

amendment to the compromise bill

as intended to commit senators

on monday the question again came
up mr webster whose slimy track
must be attentively watched made a
speech which is thus reported in the
exclusive despatch of the boston
times
mr webster addressed the senate
he observed that on the th of march
last he declared that there was not a
toot of territory belonging to the united
states the character of which as free
or slave territory was not already
fixed by some irrepealable jaw he
bad not seen or heard anything since
that time to charge his views upon the
subjectthat being his view of the
question he had very cheerfully voted
against the wilmot proviso for the
purpose of excluding slavery from the
territories he had now no more ap
prehension of the introduction of slave
ry into the territories under considera
tion than he had of its introduction
into massachusetts he was now cal
led upon to vote for an amendment
providing that when those territories
shall come here as states they shall
be admitted either with or without
slavery if he voted against that
amendment it would leave him open
to the suspicion of desiring to do that
by another process which he refused
to do by the wilmot proviso he de
signed then to vote for the amend
ment for the same reason as he voted
against the proviso he voted against
that because he thought all such reso
lutions wholly uselessbecause they
gave offence and dissatisfaction and
as he desfred to avoid all dissatisfac
tion therefore he would not vote for
the amendment pending which would
have no effect one way or the other
and yet give satisfaction he also
submitted some remarks in favor of
the general features of the pending
bill expressing his conviction of the
importance of securing its passage
when he looked around him and saw
the course of gentlemen from his own
section of the country acting as he
well knew they did conscientiously
and honestly he was well aware of
the extent of the responsibility which
he assumed in differing from them so
widely this had naturally led him to
reconsider and reexamine his own
position rejudge his own judgment
and aferhaving performed that work
he was quite unable to change his first
wellsettled hle referred to
the satisfaction which his course had
given rise to in some quarters and to
the charges of inconsistency which had
been made declaring his readiness if

of his newburyport letter or his speech
of the th of march with his record

he declared his object to be peace
and reconciliation he did not desire
to make a case for the north or for

useless and distracting controversy
he was against agitators of both north

was an american and knew no coun
try but americano locality in ameri

sentiment and judgment demanded that
he should pursue such a course as
shall promote the good harmony and
union of the whole country and he
would do so god willing to the end of
the chapter great applause in the
gallery immediately checked by the
chair
mr norris said he should vote for
the amendment though he thought it
useless and unnecessary mr seward

vote against it because he had paired

fugitive slaveletter of daniel
webster
the latin poet tells us that the descent to
the wicked place is easy we are more
pained than surprised therefore to find the
great massachusetts senator taking another
step downward
it seems that certain obsolete politicians
and clergymen in the town of newburyport
have seen fit in imitation of a similar class in
boston and andover to address him a letter
of congratulation to this letter he has pub
lished a very appropriate and we doubt not
very satisfactory reply consisting merely of
a grave argument in support of the legal
moral and religious obligation of slavecatch
ing on the part of lawabiding citizens and
bibleloving christians of the free states
it is a literary monstrosity which will make
the fortune of the antiquarian who shall here
after bring it to light when christian slave
holding shall have become as difficult of com
prehension as christian cannibalism
if there is as we may well question any
considerable amount of state pride manly
independence or bonest patroitism in those
citizens of massachusetts whom daniel web
ster addresses they will rise from the per
usul of this letter sslfreproached and cover
ed wiih shame at the consideration that they
volunteered their approbation of the course of
its author the man upon whom massachu
gus has bestowed her highest honors and
richest gifts is seen in this letter vilifying her
character contemptuously denouncing her
laws ridiculing her cherished principles and
making her love of freedom and her in
terest in the welfare of humanity a cause of
reproach and derision the old common
wealth is betrayed by our own trusted and
favorite representative he who should have
been the first to defend he deliberately takes
sides with her enemies we know not how
far forbearance may be carried in this case by
his insulted constituency but of one thing we
are quite certain not even john c calhoun
aim si idolized as he was by south carolina
could have called in question the legislation
of his state on the subject of colored seamen
as webster has that of massachusetts in re
lation to fugitives and retained his plglce as
one of her senators
we can now only call attention to a single
paragraph in this letter which we have read
withindignant astonishment after what he
seems to regard as a very unfavorable con
trast of his own state with pennsylvania re
presenting the former as a snivelling hypoc
ritical symathiser with the reclaimed fugitive
slaves which the latter very willingly sends
back to bondage he says
masachuseits tears fa l abundantly for
pennsylvania sufferings but which sufferings
pennsylvania herself knows little or nothing
of no people are more opposed to slavery
than the people ef pennsylvania we knpw
especially that that great and respectable
part of her population the friends have
borne their testimony against it from the
first yet they create no excitement they
seek not to overthrow or undermine the
constitution of their country they know
that firmness steadiness of principle a just
moderation and unconquerable perseverance
are the virtues the practice of which is most
likely to correct whatever is wrong in the
constitution of the social system no doubt
there are sometimes to be found friends sub
ject to the frailty of desiring to become con
spicuous or to the influence of a false senti
mentality or borne away into an atmosphere
flickering between light and darkness by the
puffs of the transcendental philosophy but
that is not a malady of the great body
they remain of sound and disposing minds
and memories i am misled by authority
which ought not to mislead if it be not tiue
that great body approves the sentiments to
which i have given utterance on thefioor of the
senate
whai were those entimeoto which the
society of friends are said to approve let
us look at them
my friend mr butler says the massa
chusetts senator has a bill on the subject
of delivering up fugitive slaves now before
the senate with some amendments to it
which i propose to suppoit with all its pro
visions to the fullest extent
this bill provides that the judges of the
courts some seventeen thousand postmasters
and all government officers collectors c
shall be tribunals for the delivery without ap
peal of anybody who is sworn by anybody
anywhere to be a fugitive from slavery
whether the said officials of government re
side in the state where the fugitive is found
or in that from which he has said to have es
caped it is sufficient that they are anywhere
officers of government thus as horace
mann has well said
mr butler or mr mason therefore may
send the postmaster of his own city or village
into massachusetts with an agent or attor
ney who brings his affidavit from south car
olina or virgina in his pocket the agent or
attorney may arrest anybody at any time
carrying him before his accomplice go
through with the judicial forms and hujry
him to the south the officer after his judical
functions are discharged turned bailiff pro
tecting the prey and speeding the flight
the bill denies the right of trial by jury to
the person suspected of being a fugitive
the amendments of which daniel web
ster speaks and which he avows himself
ready to support provide
ist that all who knowingly obstructed or
hinder the claimant or litigant or any person
assisting him in securing fugitive slaves or
shall aid or assist in their escape after arrest
or shall harbor such fugitives after notice that
thev are claimed as slaves shall be fined one
thousand dollars one half whereof shall be to
the use of the informer and shall also be im
prisoned for the term of twelvemonths and
d that in no trial or bearing shall the
testimony of the alleged fugitive be admitted
in evidence
these are the sentiments embodied in
legal forms which we are told that great
body the society of friends approves
now we undertake to say that thee is
not a member of the society of friends in
free or slave states who whether acting as
a magistrate or a citizen could carry out the
provisions of the most atrocious bill without
rendering himself liable to immediate expul
sion fiom a society whoso si slacker would bo
disgraced and whose discipline would be vio
lated by snch action it has been in times
past the misfortune of the society of friends
to be vilified caricatured and misrepresented
but we remember nothing even in the old
days of persecution so hard to bear a  the
compliments of the massachusetts senator
whatever his authority may have been
we do not hesitate to pronounce it unqualifi
edly false to the last degree j g w

british opinion of the american an
tipathy against people of color
the brutal and cowardly outrage committed
upon us by a band of ruffians on the battery
a month since has called forth an exipndpd
notice from the london times the whole
of which we copy in another column of this
weeks paper it is not a matter of slight en
couragement to the oppressed and persecuted
black man in this country to be able to quote
against his oppressors and persecutors au
thority as influential and respectable as that
of the london times that paper is perhaps
the most wealthy and popular journal in the
world and it may be said to represent fully
the national feeling of england it is thor
oughly english even in its faults and its
lemarks on the subject of american prejudice
against colored people may therefore be con
sidered a fair embodiment of the national
sentiment of course there is a class oi
american people who are too ignorant and
inflated to receive much profit or instruction
from anything emanating from an english
source this class is composed of the dupes
of political demagogues whose patriotism is
only manifested in bitter invectives against
the mother country and yet there is not a
scamp among them all who is not proud of
being able to trace his ancestry to england
and who does not boast of his english and
saxon blood while he is engaged in villifving
the land of his fathers
but setting aside this class of persons
there are those in our land whose breadth of
intellect and common sense make them open
to the reception of right views and feelings
although they may come from a source as
humble as the london times to these
persons we commend the article to which we
have referred it will show them that the
malevolent feelings entertained by the ameri
cans towards the colored people are unknown
and unsvmpathized with by the entire
british nation and that the americans as
a people stand infamously alone in the main

this request we are receiving sometimes

preliminary of paying their postage at the

to those of our correspondents who are in the
habit of sending long letters exhorting us to
amiableness of temper gentleness of spirit
and a variety of other excellent virtues that
their advice would be fai more likely to prove
efficacious if they would take the precaution

palmers artificial leg
for thebdtaefit of all such as may have been
so unfortunate as to lose a limb we beg to
direct attention to palmers patent limb which
is generally believed to be the bes substitute
for the natural leg now extant as the fol
lowing report sets forth the peculiar merits
of this invention we copy it entiie f d
report on prof palmers artificia
legthe committee on science and the
arts constituted by the franklin institute of
the state of pennsylvania for the promotion
of the mechanic arts to whom was referred
for examination an artificial leg invented by
benjamin franklin palmer report
that the peculiarities of this invention con
sist in first an ingenious arrangement of
springs and cords in the inside of the limb by
which when the wearer is in the erect posi
tion the limb is extended and the foot flexed
so as to present a natural appearance
second by a second arrangement of cords
and springs in the inside of the limb the foot
and toes are gradually and easily extended
when the heel is placed in contact with the
ground
inconsequene of this arrangement a limp
ing gait and the unpleaseit noise made by the
sudden stroke of the call of the foot upon the
ground in walking which is so obvious in the
ordinary leg is avoided
third by a peculiar arrangement of the
knee joint it is rendered little liable to wear
and all lateral or rotary motion is prevented
it is hardly necessary to remark that any
such motion is undesirable in an artificial leg
as it renders its support unstable
the pressure of the artificial leg is made
uniformly upon the surface of the sides of the
stump and not upon the end by which ar
rangement the danger of ulceration and infla
mation ot the flaps covering the end of the
bone is in a great measure avoided the
committee have seen the artificial leg worn
by the inventor himself it is light well
shaped easily adjusted ard of a surface
readily kept clean the shape of the leg is
such as to represent exactly when clothed
its natural fellow he is enabled by means
of his invention to walk without a cane
in such a manner as readily to deceive one
not acquainted with the facts of the case
all the natural movements of the limb
except motion laterally which is undesira
ble are beatifully executed he can throw
either leg over the other and can mount a
height of five inches with either leg indiffer
ently without assistance in conclusion the
committee would remark hat lire artificial leg
of mr palmer is superior to any that has yet
come under their notice it is light strong
beautifully shaped apparently very durable
selfacting in a greater degree than any ihing
they have ever met with easy and natural in
its motion and possessing apparently all the
qualities desirable or attainable in such an in
invention
thej committee would recommend the
award to the inventor of scotts legacy
medal and premium to the most deserving
accompanied with  and also to the
committee on exhibitions to award him the
first premium for his model exhibited in the
late exhibition

frederick douglass since i last saw
you i have visited and spoken in many of
the eastern towns and villages in your state
and through the cooperation of many warm
hearted friends of whom i shall speak more
at length hereafter i trust not altogether
without the desired effect
western new york like other sections of
the country is still suffering from the devas
tating effects of die free soil movement
very many of the hitherto staunch friends of
our cause mistaking that buffalo jackolan
tern for the lighthouse nr haven of immediate
en ancipation embarked on the frail craft of
availability aid being polluted by soulless
politicians they were soon wrecked upon the
rocks of expediency and now disappointed
expectations together with false pride does
much towards rendering them indifferent to
the cause
yet the dissenination of the truths of anti
slavery in times past has been instrumental
in securing an agitation which has settled
down and is sf  settling down upon many
honest hearts iito an implacable hatred of
slavery and a item determination to resist
the innovations the slave power
i was much pleased wttli vhe articles in
your two last numbers on colonization and
your triumphant refutation of the deliverance

very the tribune is evidently aping the
blackhearted daniel webster who while he
has no plan to offer for the emancipation of
the slave no word of sympathy for the
millions who sigh night and day for deliver
ance is willing to second a proposition that
any of his southern masters may offer and
vote for the appropriation of millions of the
public money for the purpose of expatriating
free colored people whose inalienable right
to remain and be the recipient of justice even

which the tribune demands should be want

patible with centuries of degradation and op

most hoaryheaded rumdrinking licentious
palefaced villains who clamor for their ex
patriation tf he colored people of this
country have one foe more to be feared than
another and against which a ceaseless war
fare should be waged it may be seen in the
hellish features of the colonization movement
professing to be based on the principle of
philanthropy it insinuates itself into the
hearts of the unsuspecting that it may bias
their judgment and poison their minds by
the mountain lie that thelawsof nature are in
opposition to the existence of the two classes
in harmony and concord in a common country
but in fact the essence of their movement
the moving spring of their organization can
be found in their deadly hate to the free col
ored people and the desire to render slave
property more secure by removing the free
colored people from the couutry that their
unjust policy may be carried out they refuse
the colored people justice in the land of their
birth tiey have no sympathy for the cru
elties jperpetrajed against the slave nor for
the outrage inflicted upoff the free colored
people they are willing to have them mob
bed disfranchised and prosecuted that they

frienh douglass there appears to me
to be a palpable inconsistency in our moral
percepticns as well as in our legal distinc
tions o the different phases and circum
stances under which the hellish abomination
human slavery presents itself at this time
all civilized governments ours with the rest
confess to consider the african slave trade as
one of the blackest of crimes and punish it
with the heaviest penalties when perpetrated
upon the benighted african on his own
shores in a state of perfect barbarism where
the ties of kindred affection can have but a
feeble existence and whose physical circum
stances could hardly be considered worse
when torn from kindred and home and
doomed to servitude even among the half
civilized
but we have a government capable of per
ceiving a broad difference between the slave
trade upon the two sides of theatlantic
cn the one side we cannot purchase a
captiveeven of a captive in whose hands
death might be his certain doom but for our
buying himand put him aboard a ship as a
slave without violating one of the most sa
cred laws of christendom and incurring a
heavy penalty
but we may go to our capitol and under
eye and within the hearing of our rulers and
legislators buy even of our own rulers a
human being not in a state of barbarian ig
norance and savage customs but a young
man or young woman of istelligeree and re
fined sensibilities who may have a companion
and beloved children to whom they may be
as much endeared as the purchaser to his wife
and childrentear him or her from an affec
tionate companion and loving children who
perhaps are also to be separated from each
other drag them away to a pen or a ship
hold for a florida or louisiana marker
perhaps never more to behold his heartbroken
companion and bereaved children or to know
their destination i say all this can be and
often is done under the sanction of our benign
laws which secure equal rights to all

the true democratic organ of the state talks
in the folowing strain
and for what purpose is this sacrifice to
be made alas we blush with shame to
say it that the institution of slavery shall be
more firmly established that is to say
some  traffickers in human flesh and
blood threaten the perpetuity of this union
except they are permitted to have their own

it is impracticable
the great increase of the english race i n
america living undr the influence of insti
tutions which though republican still bear
the impress of the english laws from which
they have derived their spirit and much of
their form has by all our liberal jurists
statesmen and philosophers been deemed an
event fraught with beneficial consequences to
the whole great anglosaxon family it has
been thought that we should derive advan
tage from the varied experience to which our
race and their peculiar institutions would be
thus subjectedthat from america we might
receive useful lessons while we on the other
hand might perhaps be able to reply this ob
ligation by beneficial suggestions to our
brethren both with respect to their institu
tions and their political and social relations
and conduct these suggestions mutually
imparted it has been thought would be useful
lessons which could not otherwise be learnt
now there are two peculiarities in ameri
can institutions as compared with those of
england which are daily producing effects
upon the general mind of americawhich
to the people of america generally are evi
dently unknown but which painfully affect
the mind of every class of englishmenand
we believe that by openly but in a kind and
friendly spirit expressing our opinions and
describing our feelings upon these subjects
we are really rendering great and neighborly
service not only to our transatlantic breth
ren but to the whole commnnity of civilized
nations the twopeculiarities gf which we
speak are slavery and the great and growing
weakness of the generalfederal government
of the united states both these causes
are at this moment producing startling effects
upon the social and national character of the
american peopleessentially deteriorating
it in fact and lowering it also in the estima
tion not only of all thoughtful and right
minded men but also of that general public
which is composed of the several nations
making together the civilized community of
mankind
the effects produced by these apparently
unconnected causes have a remarkable and
combined affinity and similitude the social
influence of the institution of slavery pro
duces a state of feeling among the various
classes of american citizens which induces
them to seize upon the opportunity afforded
them by the weakness of their national gov
ernment to make aggressive inroads upon
neighboring nations he who becomes ac
customed to brave the displeasure of mankind
upon one subject soon learns to be careless of
public opinion on others he who forgets
the great dictates of humanity because of a
difference of color will not long pay deference
to the rules of justice and light in his deal
ing with others who speak a different lan
guage and form part of aforeign thouugh
friendly people it behooves the statesmen
and philosophers of ameiica to look well to
these consequences if the evil continue
the people of america will soon be like the
ishmaelites of oldtheir hands will be against
every man and the hands of every man will
be against them and great though they be
powerful wealthy acute and bravethe
right will prevail the united civilized world
battling for justice and humanity will be in
vincibleand we may live to see the great
federal republic falling to pieces under the
combined influence of hostile aggression in
ternal weakness resulting irom internal dis
cord and the sense of injustice in the cause
they are sustaining
on the present occasion however we de
sire in confine our attention and remarks to
the existing state of mind among the citizens
of the united states with respect to people
of color our general estimate of the ameri
can national character and morality must be
formed upon a consideration of many differ
ent particulars but we cannot avoid be
lieving that the circumstances to which we
are about to allude must form a most impor
tant item in the account little incidents
courriig injprivate life otten afford evidence
respecting national habits and feeling far
more important and convincing than legisla
tive enactments a paragraph extracted
from a new york newspaper into our
columns yesterday contains evidence which
is in our own opinion of this description
for although some of the southern states
have in their legislation respecting negroes
outraged every feeling of common sense
common justice and benevolence the state
of new york has made laws on the subject
dictated as well by right feeling as by pru
dence and justice these wise laws do not
howeyer really represent the sentiments of
the people of new york with respect to the
negroesif the story told by the newspaper
and the comments of the writer on it fairly
m w gibbs
represent the popular creed and feeling we
are convinced from the tone of this story as
told by the indignant relator that the public
to whom that story is addressed can have no

mr douglass a negro gentleman some
time since complained of the treatment he
had experienced from citizens of the united
states because of his color this proceed
ing on his part is thus described by an ameri
can writer in the new york globefred
erick douglass the impudent negro who
has of late taken on himself the privilege of
abusing our country its patriots and consti
tution without having that chastisement he
so richly merited at the hands of our repub
licans who would not condescend to notiee
his blasphemy and negroism had the audacity
yesterday morning to walk down broadway
the principal promenade of our city with
two white women resting on his arms it
however appears that spite of the dreadful
and blashpemous conduct thus imputed to
mr douglrss the mildness and wonderful
selfcontrol of the whole american popula
tion produced the marvellous effect above
described the citizens though deeply
moved took no notice of the blasphemy and
negroism but there are limits to human
patience bad as may be the making a just
complaint by a negro against a white man
black atrocity can go lurther although white
imagination oan hardly in american phrase
realize the atrocity what is this abomina
ble offence walking with two white wo
men down broadway the patience of the
citizens their almost superhuman forbearance
i at length gave way and the mode of pro
ceeding consequent upon this venial succumb
ing of white virtue is eminently character
istic and is indeed a touching evidence of
the delicacy and refinement of the highmind
ed white man even in the very fury and
paroxysm of his passion several citizens
who noticed this disgraceful scene viz
of the quiet unoffending negro walking with
two white women who willingly walked with
him followed the impudent scamp to the
battery the negro was supposed to com
mit the additional offence of laughing there
upon a white gentleman stepped up to the
white ladies and politely requested them to
retire and leave their ebony companion and
place themselves under the protection of a
white gentleman standing near by the
women obeyed and the indignant and insulted
white gentleman to us the person really
insulted was the black gentleman adminis
tered a dessing to the negro so severe it
appears that he will not readily forget it
maddened justice exclaims the white
editor forgets the dictates of law in a case
of this kind andpersonally we see no rea
son why it should not
a few days since we published a letter in
which an englishman described a case of still
more atrocious wrong done to a poor respect
able negro who was forcibly seized by a
band of armed men in the streets of cincin
nati during bioad day and carried off to a
slave state this violence though produc
ing to the individual more frightful evil than
from the london times of june 
that of the insulted citizen of new york is
less significant of the popular feeling we
may suppose that the negro seized and carried
to kentucky was a runaway and the proper
ty of the person who pursued him and that
the desire to obtain his property may have
incited the owner to this deed of violence
but the feeling which led to the assault on
mr douglass was a geneial ungovernable
sense of insult pervading a whole population
at the sight of a negro man walking upon
equal and familiar terms with white women
that the women were consenting to this in
timacy is clear that their being so was in
the opinion of the white gentlemen of new
york no justification for mr douglass is
also evident that such familiarity and equali
ty could lead to no dangerous or mischievous
consequences in the city or state of new
york eveiy one must admit who knows the
relative numbers of the white and black popu
lation of the state in fact blind unreason
ing antipathy was the cause of the outrage
and deemed by americans a sufficient excuse
for it we in england who happily have
never been subjected to influences which
could lend us to a state of mind so unjust or
likely to lead to acts thus flagrantly opposed
to the dictates of justice and benevolence can
hardly find words that sufficiently expresss
our astonishment as well as sorrow on wit
nessing so strange a distortion of the moral
vision among a people justly celebrated for
their sagacity and for the fervor of their
piety we marvel indeed to see the dictates
of a religion which ihey as well as ourselves
belieye and obey utterly forgotten when this
wild and senseless antipathy into play
and we arejrresistibly impelled to ask what
command of morality or religon can be deem
ed sacred by these people when those which
result from the first principles of their faith
which are among the most imperative of
those enforced by their laws and sanctioned
by the first precepts of their morality are
thus scouted and contemptuously neglected
and opposed the extraordinary increase of
the wealth population and territory of the
united slates has raised her to the condition
of a firstrate power among the nations of
the world she has also suddenly become
smitten with a loveof conquest and we have
now to learn whether she will allow this
passion to domineer over all sense of right
whether a lust of dominionshe will
forget the dictates of justice law and rea
son or whether in obedience to the advice of
the greatest of her sons she will return to
the wise precepts of his peaceful policy and
seek to be renowned for truth wisdom
honesty and benevolence

the black law of south carolina
the subject of the imprisonment of colored
seamen in the port of charleston has been
brought before the attention of the english
government by a recent suit in the thameg
police court on the gart of the steward of a
british bark for his wages paymert of
which the master of the bark refused on the
ground that he had paid the expenses of the
steward for two months in the common jail at
charleston the master stated that the
steward a respectable british subject was
taken out of his vessel by the constables of
charleston and dragged to the jail from
whence he would have been sold as a slave
had not he the master paid sioo expenses
lord palmerston on being questioned in
respeci to the matter in parliament stated
that in  her majestys government had
directed the british minister at washington
to remonstrate against the imprisonment of
british seamen and the violation of the
rritish flag but that mr buchanan had
verbally replied that the federal government
could not induce the legislature of souih
catolina to repeal the law and if pressed on
the ground of the treaty of  under which
all subjects and citizens of the two countries
were to be permitted freely to enter freely
reside in and freely quit the territories of
each would be compelled to put an end to
that treaty by giving the twelve months
notice required for that purpose his lord
ship said that it had then been deemed unad
visable to press the matter to such an ex
tremity the outrage was spoken of by the
member who called lord ps attention to it
as a scandalous violation of the principles
which regulated the intercourse of civilized
nations lord palmerston said that the law
grew out of the unfortunate institution of
slavery and it was quite unnecessary for him
to express the opinion which all who heard
him must entertain with respect to it
the matter will not we think end here
a case similar to the one under consideration
was brought to the attentionof lotd aber
deen when foreign minister and from the
correspondence which followed it was under
stood that in future the personal freedom of
british subjects secured by the treaty of 
would be respected in american ports in
the case of two colored british subjects from
the bahamas who were thus seized and im
prisoned some years ago their jail fees not
being paid they were sold as slaves a
formal demand for them was made by the
british government one of them was found
and restored the other could not be discov
ered
the london antislavery reporter of the
ist ultimate calls upon the british press and
puhlic to demand from government immediate
measures to prevent future outrages of this
kind we do not say the editors intend
that this case shall pass over lightly it is too
important to be shuffled out o sight to suit
the convenience of any parties and the ques
tion must receive a definitiveanswer whether
the colored population belonging to this coun
try and its various dependencies are to be
treated as felons and slaves in any ports of
the united states and whether the british
government is unable or unwilling to protect
them when going thither on their lawful
business
as massachusetts and the free states
generally have a stake in this controversy in
common with great britain we shall look

letter from gerrit smith
who can help loving gerrit smith in an
important sense it matters nothing whether
we agree with him in mere modes or meas
utes we are free to acknowledge that here
in we differ and we confess to an occasional
momentary alienation by reason of the un
due severity of his language touching these
points of difference but just reading the
letter which follows all else is forgotten
the spirit which dictated this belongs only to
a good manbut it needs not this to estab
lish that fact a personal acquaintance had
long since settled it beyond allhuman contro
versy his very looksnot a safe guide in
casesare a sure index of the character both
of his mind and his heart
we should want no better argument with
which to disarm his foes than to present the
man not perhaps in public on a subject of
allabsorbing interest in which the deepest
prejudices of men are stirred though his
tone and temper even here are admirably but
we would present him in private in the so
cial circle and every foe would at once be
converted to a friend
now when we hear professors of religion
as occasionally we do call mr smith an in
fidel and a because forsooth
he has troubled some churches of the devil
and because failing to induce ministers of the
gospel to follow their divine master and
preach deliverance to the captive he has
essayed to do so himself on the sabbath day
we are strongly tempted to say to them what
now we will just whisper in their ears gen
tlemen god never gave you capacity to com
prehend the great subject which fills the
heart of geriit smith we therefore place
your hostibility and your neglect to the account

gerrit smith
gerrit smith has withdrawn from the
in i state lemperance society below
is his letter to the treasurer thereof announ
cing the tactthe cause of his doing so is
briefly this he was chairman of the busi
ness committee and reported the resolutions
c ihe following resolution was the sec
ond of the series
j resolved that it is a gross inconsisten
cy for the friends of temperance to belong to
political parties which do not commit them
selves fully openly and heartily in their
newspapers and meetings and nominations
to the doctrine that civil government is bound
to prohibit the sale of intoxicating drinks and
resolved further that so jong as they dobe
long to such parties there is little probability
that civil government will permanently pro
urohibit such sale
this resolution was smartly debated and
very eloquently advocated by mr smith it
passed on the evening of the first day of the
session and mr smith returned to peterboro
ihe majority was decisive on the next morn
ing after mr smith and others of his friends
had left a motion was made by abner bates
lreasurer of the society to revise and re
scind the above resolution after a very
long debate the resolution was rescinded
and a substitute adoptedthe reasons given
for the rescisions of the resolutionwere lhat
would implicate the society with the liber
ty party for this reason mr smith the
next day sends to mr bates the following
letter announcing his divorce fromv

dear sir l learn this afternoon that
the society reconsidered and rescinded yes
terday the d in the series of resolutions
which it had passed i have no doubt that it
will be the gamer thereby on the score of
popularity numbers and friends neverthe
less is not the favor of heaven at the ex
pense at which it purchases these gains i
cannot avoid the conclusion that the society
has made a bad bargain an unprofitable ex
change
when you asked for contributions day be
fere yesterday i gave my name for a hun
dred dollars enclosed is my draft for it
this ends my connection with the society
i say not this with the least idea that the so

the illinois conference
the illinois annual conference closed its
session on monday may the th having
convened according to adjournment on the
wednesday previous
the conference passed among others the
following resolutions
on slavery
resolved ist that we are more than
ever convinced of the great evils of american
slavery and are more than ever determined
to oppose i in all its forms by the use of all
lawful means within our reach and in ali
places where it does now or where it may
hereafter exist
resolved d that it is our deliberate
opinion that all professed ministers of the
gospel who refuse or neglect to plead the
cause of gods suffering poor are not the
ministers of jesus chiist and those churches
that allow their members to hold or buy or
sell men women or children without re
buke are not the churches of jesus christ
and without information cannot inherit the
kingdom of god
resolved d that should the bill of mr
mason in the house of representatives vir
tually constituting ali united states officers
in the free states the aids abettors and
bloodhounds of southern slaveholders and
kidnappers in seizing their human prey or
should any other bill of similar import re
ceive the sanction of our national legisla
tute requiring northern freemen to become
the allies of the slave power in enslaving
those who have quietly departed from the
southern prisonhouse we will consider such
enactment a highhanded usurpation of
power and a daring effort to nullify the stat
ute of the most high and consequently null
and void from the beginningtrue wesleyan
mr websterthe friends
it will be remembeied that mr webster
asserted in his letter to his newburyport
retainers that the friends concurred with
him in his course concerning fugitive slaves
and other matters touching the slavery ques
tiou every man of common intelligence
knew that the statement was false in every
sense of the word the friends weekly
intelligencer of philadelphia empathaticallv
denies the statement and disavows for the
friends of pennsylvania any support of that
denomination of the views and opinions of
mr webster mr whittier also denies mr
websters assertion he says
now we undertake to say that there is
not a member of the society of friends in
free or slave states who whether acting as
a magistrate or a citizen could carry out the
provisions of this most atrocious bill without
renderinghimself liable to immediate expul
sion from a society whose character would
be disgraced and whose discipline would be
violated by such action it has been in
times past the misfortune of the society of
friends to be vilified caricatured and mis
represented but we remember nothing even
in the old days of persecution so hand to bear
as the compliments of the massachusetts
senator whatever his authority may
have been we do not hesitate to pronounce
it unqualifiedly false to the last degree

october last we published a review of w
a smiths proslavery address by s m

ment not being sustained by the court an
other was made in november charging him
with maintaining the doctrine that masters

announcing it with a triumphant declaration
of the constitution and laws vindicated
the decision it will be seen was based
upon that in the prigg case which establish
ed the monstrous doctrine that slave law is
the paramount law all over the united states
that the slaveholder has under the constitu
tion the right to seize his fugitive slave
wherevei he can find him and that he need
not unless he choose give any evidence that
the man so seized is a slave and if he does
choose to give such evidence his own oath to
the fact is sufficient this is law in this re

protectedso far as the law is concerned
the personal liberty of the citizen and the
unknown and the humble may at any time
no matter what the hue of their complexion
be claimed as slaves and reduced without the

striving and for which mr vebster retain

aiding to produce
important decisionthe suit of john
norris of broome county kentucky vs
leander b newton e b crocker and
seven others for the recovery of damages
for aiding and abetting the escape of slaves
after more than a weeks investigation before
the circuit court of the united states was
determined on wednesday last in favor of
the plaintiff a verdict of two thousand eight
hundred and fiftysix dollars was given by the
jury against the defendants as the value of
the slaves and other damages
the suit has elicited considerable interest
and was decided mainly under a decision of
the supreme court of the united states in
the case of prigg where the court takes the
ground that the owner of a slave has the right
under the constitution and act of congress
to capture his property in a free state and
take it thence without going before a state
court and obtaining a certificate
on this trial it was proved that four ne
groes claimed by norris were captured in
the state of michigan they had absconded
from their master in boone countykentucky
in octobet  that he immediately
on the next morning after their escape
went in pursuit of them he proved by two
or three witnesses that he was their owner
and had been for a number of years after
searching for his negroes between one and
two months he abandoned the pursuit he
traced them as far as laurel in franklin
county but could then obtain no further in
formation as to the rout they had taken last
fall he received information that they had fled
to michigan and settled in a neighborhood in
cass county where it is estimated by wit
nesses that about one thousand negroes re
side he took some five or six persons with
him and in the night captured his negroes
in michigan and immediately proceded on
his journey homeward to kentucky after i
passing through south bend and at a dis
tance of axnile and a half from the town
norris and his party stoped on the roadside
for refreshments while there a party came
from south bend accompanied by the dep ity
sheriff of the county and make an arrest
under a writ of habeas corpus norris and
his party returned with the negroes to south
bend and trial was had before the judge of
the probate court of st joseph county nor
ris made a return on the writ of habeas cor
pus under oath stating that the negroes
were his property and that he was taking
them to tiia residence in boone county
whence they had escaped the truth of
theis return was admitted by crocker who
appeared in behalf of the negres but who
fiiad a demurrer claiming the liberation of the
on the ground that they had been
captured in michigan and there was no cer
tificate of the sight ofownership having been
proved in that state the judge deciding
that this was necessaryliberated the negroes
norris anticipating thisdecisionhad procured
a writ to take the negroes from the clerk of
the circuit court and as soon as the decision
was pronounced attempted to take them
when a scene of great confusion ensued
the kentucky party were armed with pistols
and bowieknives and the crowd wiih canes
and clubs after considerable excitement
the negroes were taken to the jail of the
county by the sheriff for safe keeping
several criminal suits were then instituted
against the kentucky party which it was
alledged by the plaintiffs counsel were for
the purpose of aiding in the ultimate rescue
of the negroes the negroes were demand
ed of the sheriff by norris but he was re
fused possession as in the mean time a
second writ of habeas corpus had been issued
on which the negroes were in the end dis
charged norris not appearing on the second
trial the first trial was had on friday after
noon and the negroes were finally liberated
on the next monday morning during the
time intervening it was in evidence that from
seventyfive to two hundred negroes from
michigan were present in south bend armed
with guns and clubs and a number of them
finally escorted the negroes out of town when
they were discharged
judge mclean in giving his charge to the
jury said that the decision ofthe judge on
the first trial on the writ of corpus
was incorrect under a decisidff of the su
preme court of the united states in the case
above referred to that the writ of habeas
corpus was proper and was at all times allow
able but the question under it in this case
was the right of ownership that being ad
mitted the slaves should have been remand
ed into the custody of norris the judge
said he had dissented from this decision of the
supreme court of the united states when it
was given but he was now bound to carry
it out on the part of the defence a plea
was set up that norris had given his negroes
liberty to come across the river at the time of
their escape but this was not proven to the
satisfaction of the jury had this been the
case norrie could not have the advantage of
the act of congress and the decision of the
supreme court in their capture
messrs liston and smith acquitted them
selves with much credit on the part of the
plaintiff and messrs jernegan and marshall
made a most able defence mr smith spoke
between six and seven hours in the closing
speech
under this decison we can see no reasons
why the citizens of the south should com
plain of injustice being done them while in
pursuit of their fugitive slaves at least so
far as indiana is concerned the law as it
exists will soon be understood under a few
more decisions liki the present and all future
difficulty will he avoided we have no boubt
that much of the excitement was occasioned
on the part of many of the citizens ol south
bend in consequence of either misapprehend
ing the true nature of the case or the law
under which they weie acting all citizens
occording to the decision of the judge are
bound to know rhe law and great pains will
hereafter no doubt be taken not to become
involved in difficulties like the present the
cost of the present suit in addition to the
damages awarded will be very great

terance to the opinion of the people in favor
of the unconditional admission of california
and against any extension ofslavery james
robb presided the meeting was eloquent
ly addressed by george mason and dr f
j le moyne the committee through
their chairman john a wills reported a
series of very spirited resolutions which
were adopted we subjoin a few of them
resolved that when we see the wheels
of the general government arrested by the
proslavery propagandists of the south
california refused admission into the union
dissolution of the union threatened on the floor
of congressthen we see traitors in the
ranks of both the great political parties of
the country hatching delusive projects of
compromise whieh while they give nothtng
substantial to the cause ot freedom surren
der everything to slaveryand when we
know that slavery is bounded by no lines of
physical geography and that it has been and
is now profitably employed in mining asin
other branches of industry we are not to be
deluded by the deceptive suggestion that the
wilmot proviso is unnecessarythat slavery
will never enter the new territoriesthat
the south is merely contending for an abstract
right which it has no disposition to exercise
and that therefore in the spirit of compro
mise we should forbear the exercise of a
wellestablished constitutional right
resolved that a crisis in the fate of the
whig and democrat parties at the north
has at length arrived when they must either
dissolve their alliance with the slave power
or the laboring men of the country as sensi
ble men seeking to piomote their own inter
ests not less than to advance the great cause
of humanity will be obliged to withdraw

surroundedjby a large agricultural population
remote from all influences of interest or pas
sion which might pervert soberjudgement on
this subject may be taken as a fair type and
representative of the best portion of the peo
ple of the northern states they demand
that legislation shall return to its accustomed
channels and that demagogues shall cease to
obstruct it they demand the admission of
california and reject the idea of coupling its
destiny with other questions they declare
that in view of the aggressions and menaces
of the slave power they feel called upon to
declare their uncompromising hostility to the
passage of any laws which shall not contain a
provision forever forbidding the extension of
slavery therein

information which distinguish the speeches
of the missouri senator abovfl his cotempora
ries it will long live among the ablest spi
ciest and most unswearable oratorical efforts
of the present age its blows fall upon clay
and ilia committee of thirteen with a pon
derous power that is absolutely annihilating
it shows the scheme to be a violation of all
parliamentary practice illegal and unconsti
tutional
the most valuable part of the speech
however is the part we publish relating to
the texas boundary and slavery mr ben
ton shows conclusively that the compromise
bill actually surrenders  square miles
of the free territory of new mexico to slave
ry that is if gives up a territory larger
than all ihe new england states to texas
and at the same time pays our sable sister of
the lone star ten or twelve millions for
condescending to accept the gift this is a
direct and positive extension ofslavery
this then is the compromisethe di
rect surrender to slavery to free territory lar
ger than new englandthe payment often
or twelve millions to speculators in texas
bondsthe virtual abolition of freedom in the
rest of new mexico and utahthe making
ot all the free states hunting grounds for the

of the union till all these schemes are per
fected and this is the grand panacea
which is to still forever the tempest of agita
tion and settle the great question of the
age so it  concoctors tell ns and the coun
try so apparently they believe
no messrs compromisers we tell you
the thing can never be done by any such
means the spirit of freedom and inquiry
that is envoked can be laid by no such bas
tard specific the eyes of of the people are
upon you their words have gone to you
and will go again in tones that shall rever
berate from the atlantic to the pacific the
vast question which now shakes this repub
lic cannot be settled by any action of any
men in congress or out unless it be in a way
which secures the free territory of the na
tion against the curse of human bondage
your compromise may pass but insteadof
settling it will excite the sea of agitation
to a tempest whose fury shall bury you
and your agreement with hell together
but on this point of the tendency of this
bill now before ihe senate and now sought
to be endorsed by the freemen of new
hampshire we ask every honest man to read
carefully the remarks of the missouri senator
they ate the words of a man who knows
wkereof he speakswho has lived his whole
life long in the midst of slaveryhe is him
self a slaveholder but still a haier of the
system whose evils no one better understands
we ask the people of new hampshire to
mark the men from the free states who de

sons of temperance the national divi

seventeenth annual session at cochituate

it was a grand temperance jubilee which is
represented to have been a great affair pro
cessions were formed of subordinate divi

flags bearing various devices mottos c
emblematical of the cause and the occasion
addresses were made by gen cary rev
john pierpont philip s white charles
jewett and others whose illustrations inci

ful character
we regret to add that the national divi
sion on thursday before adjourning passed
a vote that the future admission of colored
persons to the order is improper and illegal
such a vote is a disgrace to the order and to
the age if the object of that organization
is as it claims to be purely reformatory
what justification can we offered for such a
vote are not colored persons men andit
men are they not proper subjects of refor
mation we repeat the vote is disgraceful
to the order and an insult to every principle

some information relative to a regularly or
ganized band of robbers on the overland route
to california through mexico it says
there are many indians on the road be
tween saltillo and this place they have
commmitted a great many depredations lately
on small parties of californians and also on
the mexicans living on the road but we were
unmolested by them although we saw
several strong band but a short distance from
us all mounted and ready to attack us there
is a large party of robbers between this place
end mazatlanthe same one that the gov
ernor of durango hiied some six weeks ago
to go out tn fight the indians and furnished
them with fine horses arms ammunition
c the first thing they did was to rob the
government of a large cahallado of mules
loaded with different kinds of produce and
some specie which was intended to pay off
the mexican army
after this robbery they took to the moun
tains where they have been murdering and
robbing the travelers passing between mazal
lan and this place about six days ago they
murdered two americans and took from
them over  is gold some of the
party who were robbed escaped and arrived
at this place three days since two of the
robbers were arrested in this place and are
now in prison awaiting their trial this band
of robbers i learn are texans and were
originally  strong buthave since recruited
to the number of  or more the governor
says they are better mounted and equipped
than any who have passed through mexico
he has  soldiers at his command
and is afraid to send them in the mountsins
after the robbers for he says that from the
position they occupy they could kill every one
of his soldiers without their effecting any

boston a walk and talk
about itelihu burritt
our country is the world our countrymen are
all mankind anon
a short time ago the friends of peace
called a meeting at the park street
church for the purpose of appoint
ing delegates to attend the worlds
convention on the banks of the rhyne
in consequence of the inclemency of
the weather and the unbusiness like
manner in which the meeting was ad
vertised there were but few persons
present but the distinguished gentle
men who were called upon to address
that audience might have consoled
themselves with the reflection that
what their assembly lucked in num
ber it made up in talent learning in
fluence and moral worth gov briggs
occupied the chair the venerable dr
sharp invoked the divine blessing
rev a estone delivered an able and
interesting address and was followed
by the hon amasa walker and oth
ers
the chief object of attraction at this
meeting was elihu burritt the learn
ed blacksmith he sat on the first
seat opposite the pulpit witn his hack
towards the audience his head rest
ing on his hand and his eyes clos
most of the time during the delivery of
the speeches thomas drewjr
immortalized as burritts blower and
striker at the forge hot anvil of re
form was busy with pensil and paper
in one of the side pews the hearers
waited peaceably but impatiently for
mr burritt to take the rostrum and
when it was announced that he would
speak every countenanpe became ra
diant with joyful anticipation mr
burritt arose in a quiet unpretending
manner and modestly responded to
the invitation to speak he stood on
the topstair of the pulpit and at first
seemed to shirink hack bashfully from
the gaze of the upturned faces be
fore him although he is no coward i
have no doubt his heart beat as though
it would batter a breach through its
tenement when he first unsealed his
lips in the presence of that assembly
in fact the contour of his face and the
tones of his voice are the telltales
which publish lack of self conceit
mr burritt is now in the meridian of
his manhood but his premature bald
ness is his apology for wearing a wig
he has a towering forehead but
owing to the large development of the
perceptive faculties it appears to re
treat in the region of causality whilst
in reality it does not i think his eyes
are blue when they do not blaze his
face indicates perseverance that will
not falter and integrity that will not
disappoint he speaks slowly dis
tinctly and forcibly without ever ut
tering a foolish thing he has a pe
culiarity of tone which is unreportable
but which tells with thrilling effect on
the hearts of his hearers when he en
ters earnestly into the subject he dis
cusses all who have heard him
must acknowledge that his matter is
fill of thought as an egg is of meat
he employs facts and statistics in his
speeches and editorials but they have
the varied beauty of the rainbow and
the golden glow of sunlight when view
ed through the prism of his rich imag
ination
the following extract from the lon
don edition of the little volume entitled
sparks from the anvil will give the
reader an idea of mr burritts style of
writing in an article on temperance
he alludes to the history of a distin
guished statesman who had been
snatched as a brand from the liquid
burningand he was found with
all the resuscitated vigor of his talents
exhuming as it were his fellow beings
who like him had been buried before
they were dead massachusetts wel
comed him back to her embrace with
emotions of maternal joy and invited
the returning pleiad to resume his
rank among the stars of her crown
the doors of her halls and churches
were thrown open to the newlyreturn
ing prodigal and many were touched
to life and salvation at the burning el
oquence which fell from his lips sis
ter states heard of this new luther in
temperance and he obeyed their call
he stood up in their cities like paul in
the midst of mars hill and with an
eloquence approaching inspiration set
forth the strange doctrine of total ab
stinence that man unfortunately
was led astray by friends in human
form but a band of washingtonians
persuaded him to sign the pledge once
more and this time it was an unviola
ted policy of ipsurance against the fires
of destruction he concluded that
graphic sketch in the following words
that man is again a giant and he is
broad look out for him like sam
son he is feeling for the pillars of the
temple of bacchus and he will ere
long revenge the loss ofhis locks by a
mighty overthrow of that doomed edi
fice
it affords the writer no small degree
of pleasure to lift up the curtain which
hangs between the past and present
and look back to the time when the
now eminent champion of peace first
put on his paper cap and leather apron
and made the forge blaze and the ham
mer ring he did not dream then
that he one day would beat swords into
ploughshares and spears into pruning
hooks his friends did not at that time
give him credit for any striking mani
festations of genius to use his own
words he was a plodding patient
persevering lad gathering by the
process ot accretion which builds the
antheap particle by particle thought
by thought fact by fact in this
way he worked and studied night by
night for years with blistered hands
and brightening hope at lessons
which have made him shine a star of
the first magnitude in the firmament of
fame
in the summer of  governor
everett of massachusetts in an ad
dress to an association of mechanics in
boston took occasion to mention that a
blacksmith of that state had by his
unaided industry made himself ac
quainted with fifty lajiguagesl prior to
this announcement mr burritt had
lived in obscurity and the fame of his
acquirements did not extend beyond
the smoke of his workshop when
mr nelson called on mr b at wor
cester he found him at his anvil
when told what the governor had re
ported respecting him he modestly
replied that the governor had done him
more than justice it wa truehe said
that he could read about fifty lan
guages but he had not studied them
all critically yankee curiosity had
induced him to look at the latin gram
mar became interested in it and per
severed and finally acquired a thor
ough knowledge of that language he
then studied the greek with equal care
an acquaintance with these languages
had enabled him to read with equal
facility the italian the french the
spanish the portuguese the rus
sian to which he was then devoting
his odd moments he said was the
most difficult of any he had underta
ken he went to worcester to se
cure the advantages of an antiquarian
library to which the trustees allowed
him free access he spent eight
hours at the forge eight hours in the
library and the remaining eight hours
of each day in recreation and rest
after he had studied hebrew and
made himself acquainted with its cog
nate languages the syraic chaldaic
arabic samaritan ethiopic c he
turned his attention to the languagespr
europe and studied french spanish
italian and german under native
teachers he then pursued the por
tuguese flemish danish swedish
norwegian icelandic welsh gselic
celtic c
it is somewhat remarkable that a
man who has devoted so much of his
time to the acqujsition of languages
that he is a living portable polyglott
should have such mightv mathematical
powers figures tumble from his pen
like seeds from a sack when the string
is untwined from its throat there are
but few men of past or present times
that can excel him in description
take the following graphic sketch of
the iron horse as a specimen of his
skill in that department of literature
i love to see one ofthese creatures
with sinews of brass and muscles of
iron strut forth from his smoky table
and saluting the long train of cars
with a dozen sonorous puffs from his
iron nostrils fall back gently into his
harness there he stands champing
and foaming upon the iron track his
great heart a furnace of glowing coals
his lymphatic blood is boiling in his
veins the strength of a thousand
horses is nerving his sinewshe pants
to be gone he would snake st
peters across the desert of sahara if
he could be fairly hitched to it but
there is a little sobereyed tobacco
chewing man in the saddle who holds
him in with one finger and can fake
away his breath in a moment should
he grow restive or vicious lam al
ways deeply interested in this man for
begrimed as he may be with coal di
luted in oil and steam i regard him as
the genius of the whole machinery as
the physical mind of that huge steam
horse
mr burritt believes that god has
made of one blood all the nations of
the earth and he aims to unite them
by the frateiual chain of
he looks upon war as an inexcusable
evil and labors manfully for its extir
pation he would dismantle the ar
senal disband the army spike the can
non and reforge the cutlass he
would take our ships of war and lade
them down to the waters edge with
food and covering for human beings
the ballast should be round clams
or the real quahaugs heavy as cast
iron and capital for roasting then
he would build along up filling every
square inch with wellcured provisions
he would have a hogshead of bacon
mounted in every porthole each of
which should discharge fifty hams a
minute when the ship was brought in
to action and the staterooms should
be filled with well made garments and
the taut cordage and the long tapering
spars should be festooned with boys
jackets and trowsers then when
there should be no more room for
another codfish or herring or sprig of
catnip he would run up the white
flag of peace he would throw as
many hams into the city in twentyfour
hours as there were bomshelis and
cannon balls thrown intokeil by the
besieging armies he would barri
cade the low narrow streets with
loaves of bread would throw up a
breastwork clear round the market
place of barrels of flour pork and
beef and in the middle raise a stack
of salmon and codfish as large as a
small methodist meetinghouse with a
steeple to it and a bell in the steeple
and the bell shall ring to all the city
bells and the city bells should ring to
all the people to come to market and
buy provisions without money and
without price and white flags should
everywhere wave m the breeze on the
vanes of steeples on mastheads on
flagtones along the embattled walls
on the ends of willow sticks borne by
the romping laughing trooping chil
dren all the bloodcolored drapery
of war should bow and blush before
the stainless standard of peace and
generations of anglosaxons should
remember with mutual felicitations
the conquest of the white flag or the
storming of quebec
mr burritt has made his mark upon
this agea mark which ime will not
erase his society is coirted by the
great men of europe aid america
he quietly suggests a worlds conven
tion and senators members of par
liament baronets and crowned heads
hearken to his counsels he is the
same great and good man whether in
the smithy talking with fhe hardhand
ed nailers or in the magnificent forum
pleading for peace in tie presence of
the dignitaries of the land he has no
idea that he is a great man and would
not believe it if competent judges were
to give him a printed certificate to
prove the fact he is a bachelor not
a fussy squeamish nervouslyfastidi
ous bachelor but a generous social
freeandeasy unostentatious bachelor
who ought to have been married long
ago although he is just the right age
to become a married man now his
paper needs no notice from my hum
ble pen it is widely circulated and
speaks for itself the press in his
hand is like the hammer in the hand of
thor the thundergod he strives to
smite off the clanking manacles from
the uplifted hands of the bleeding
slave and to strike down the monster
that wades in blood and to build up
the temple of universal peace and to
weld the world in an unbroken band
of eternal brotherhood he sees a
spirit of selfishness abroad that would
rob earth of its flowers and heaven of
its lights disinherit the angels un
crown the almighty and sit upon the
throne of the universe so he has un
furled the white banner and is now
leading the crusaders of a good cause
to a battle where no blood will be shed
but where that evil selfish spirit will
be subdued and peace shall triumph

last mail that he had a pleasent voyage
across the ocean and arrived in lon

unique feature was a table of beautiful

about one thousand dollars worth of
articles disposed ofwe hope to pre
sent our readers with a full report next

able to greet the citizen circle weeldy
in propria persona christian citizen
texas and new mexico by the
congressional journal it will be seen
that the president sent a message to
the senate on monday in reply to the
cal of that body for information whe
ther any orders had been issued to any
military officers at santa fe to hold
possession against the authority of tex
as or in any way to embarrass the ex
ercise of her jurisdiction over that
country the president says that no
such orders have been given he also
states that information has been receiv
ed that the commissioner of texas has
proceeded to santa fe with a view of
organizing counties in that district
under the authority of texas this
territory he sayswas actually acquired
by the united states from mexico
and has since been actually held by the
united states and in his opinion
ought so to remain until the boundary
of texas is settled by some competent
authority meanwhile he thinks there
is no reason for seriously apprehending
that texas will practically interfere
with the possession of the u s
this latter conclusion of the message
may be founded on good cabinet logic
for aught we know but we confess it is
beyond our comprehension we do
not see how that texas can exer
cise jurisdiction organize counties
and do other sovereign acts within the
territory without any hindrance or mo
lestation from the authorities and not
thereby practically interfere with the
possession of the united states we
fear that there is a settled purpose to
let texas consummate her usurpation
over new mexico and thus afford an
other triumph to slavery by extending
that atrocious system over a large ter
ritory now free mass spy

the island
if our people be suffered to take any
part in the conflict it will be on the side
of the european race and against the
black government there is every
reason to believe that something is go
ing on in reference to this matter and

states will at no distant day strength

under the subjection either of spain or
of american adventurers will become
a serious question

but if by resources which may bjifcur
citizens be furnished to the domini

their dominion and perhaps to domes
tic slavery and if the american and
spanish masters of the island ask for
annexation to the union and for a
territorial or colonial government or
for protection against spainor france
or englandor all threeit will create
a new and darklooking questionand
it will arise in time to take the place of
the present slavery conflict in con
gress should it be fortunately settled
