convention of colored
citizens
a convention of colored citizens
has been in session for several even
ings during the past week in this city
no report of their proceedings that we
know of has been published though
they have been travestied in the her
ald at considerable length the fol
lowing reports from committees how
ever which appear in that paper are
we pesume genuine and will be found
important and interestingantisla
very standard
mr george t downing read the
report on emigration as follows
report of committee on emigration
many considerations arise in the re
view of the question of the immigration
of the colored american from the place
of his abode the land of hia nativity to
any foreign place among the most
prominent and important arethat this
is our native land that here we live
and have lived that here we hope and
have hoped and that no amount of per
secution has driven or will drive us to
any inhospitable regionto any region
whatsoever save that to which death
hall convey us
our fellowcountrymen have selected
africa as the place for our future
abode and give as a reason why we
should leave this our native land that
in this our native land we can never
hope to be elevated socially and politi
cally further declaring that africa is
the land of our forefathers and that
she needs to be regeneratedcivilized
what a libel upon our country our
countrymen the colored american
can never hope to be elevated so
cially and politically in this country
it is false we do hope predicating
that hope upon a basis everlasting and
which the signs of the times indicate
truth crushed to earth will rise again
tlie eternal years of god are hers
as to tie practical ability of colored
men going to africa to better their con
dition it is fallacious the means by
which we or any class can better their
conditionis the acquiring of wealth and
education the facilities to possess ei
ther are far more abundantly afforded
the colored man at home than they are
in africa it needs but the exercise of
the disposition to acquire which dis
position is the same in the same per
son whether he be in africa or amer
ica there are large tracts of land in
this country fertile and beautiful
which the colored man can occupy
live an independent life where he can
command respect and consideration
thousands of acres of which are already
owned by colored men in this state
there are many trades and professions
of respectability and influence open to
him he needs but the cultivation of
the above disposition as fcr the ac
quiring of education the facilities are
growing more and more abundant
dailv the first seminaries of the land
are being open for the reception of
colored students in the eastern
states there are exceptions where a
colored student cannot be admitted in
our own slate two young men of rare
talent have been elevated to profess
orships in one of her colleges as an
illustration of the superior advantages
offered us here to those enjoyed in af
rica we would state that the dignita
ries of liberia send their children and
relatives to this country to be educated
instance rushworms sons roberts
relatives
but we claim no affinity with africa
this is our home we have beheld no
other sun save that piercing the clouds
that tip our noble alleghanieswhich
glistens on our own rolling hudson and
gives vegetation and life to the green
fields where our fathers lie the
land of our forefathers
what more this to us than to all
other americans go ye home to
the places your fathers voluntarily left
our forefathers were forced there their
sons will not be forced away fur
ther we do not trace our ancestry to
africa alone we trace it to english
men irishmen scotchmen to french
men to the german to the astatic as
well as to africa the best blood
of virginia courses through our veins
we sympathize deeply with poor be
nighted africa we wish her disen
thralment from the deep superstition
sad idolatry in which she is sunk we
yrould see her regeneratedcivilised

despite of itdespite of all that has

still we would defend her honor
while we mourn our shame a fair

our glorious declaration of independ

fighting in vindication of the fact of the
equality of man and in defence of the
rights of mau in favor of the idea of

this persecution to be the persecu

the worldfuture generations will
have evidence of the truthfulness of the
idea of universal brotherhood pre
vious to the declaration of this grand
idea by the fathers of  all england
had faith in the idea of inequality in
man and it is left unto our country to
give form and expression to its oppo
site look upon the man reforms
which engage the general attention
and behold how all of them go to make
up a sentiment which must annihilate
slavery and cast it from our otherwise
fair country its happy influence will
operate upon the world in general
this consideration causes us to be more
deeply fixed and inflexible if possible
in our determination to abide here
our home countrymen americans
why will ye strive to alienate us from
our home why will ye continue to op
press usgod wills us to be with you
we will as he wills
we are linked with millions who are
here held in bonds nothing should or
can separate our interests they are
mutual and inseparable it would be
cowardice on our part to disconnect our
interests from theirs cowardice as
those who are linked with them in op
pression cowardice as americans at
tempting to avoid the responsibility of
battling against the shame and degra
tion that arises at the mention of amer
ica because of her holding men and
brethren in bonds it would break
down the sustaining prop the hope
which bouys and sustains the shame it
would give security to the slave mas
ter it would have the effect to lessen
the happy sympathy the beating heart
which is beginning to throb in the
american breast aye this sympa
thy this beating heart is observed in
no manner more forcible than in its op
position to the fugitive slave law inter
ested parties attempt to conceal the
fact as they may and do castle gar
den meetings may be held union
committees formed websters become
the paid subjects of wall and state
streets footes invited to desecrate the
name of washington fillmores may
issue their proclamations to make
themselves ridiculousall is may be
done and more but there is no con
cealing the fact that northern hearts
with a few exceptions have no sympa
thy with the fugitive slave law and will
whenenever they can nullify its pro
visions
we are not to be forced or enticed
from our native land nay if they fin
ish their steamships with even more
splendor and make their tables groan
with viands more rare than those lound
in our steam palaces yet they will
lay rotting on the was
ere they will be regarded as an induce
ment for us to leave our homes the
ebony line is an idea to lull to satisfy
to cover over to smother the sympathy
for us and against the fugitive slave
law but it will signally fail aye
even the magic influence of henry
i clay cannot effect it we could sup
pose that he would be one of the first
passengers in the line sooner than
 we for in liberia he might become
president were he not impressed with
the fact that in a shortvery short
time he will wing his flight to heaven
i or somewhere else
 we have not as yet secured for our
selves a characterreputation we
are but the immediate descendants of
those who have been reared under all
manner of depressing influences in ig
norance in an ignorant section of the
country and southern plantations we
have not had a fair trial our position
has been a stooping one we are be
ginning to feel the necessity of standing
erect we have too generally occu
pied menial positions which has been
urged against us this must be
changed this is being changed our
childrenthe children of those who oc
cupy menial positionsare being edu
cated to a more refined taste not
however to discard honorable labor
they will possess all the requisites to
success and advancement they in
herit a spirit of endurance a virtue
necessary to success ihey ate sen
sitive which creates perception they
have strength being the descendants
of muscular frames they are being
educated let their children be op
pressed as they are keep them op
pressed cast down as we have and our
fathers hare been and you have ac
complished that which to us seems phy
right is of no sex truth is of no color god isthe father of us all and all men are brethren
sically and morally impossible they
will be respected here socially andty
litically believing this and admiring
the principles of our government be
lieving that the country is by nature
blest with advantages far byisnd those
afforded in africa or anywhere else
how can any one expect even horace
greeley himself that the colored man
will leave this country no horace
greeley will go first for he seems of
latetohav a y erv lively interest in af
rica tvot but that there will be cases or
individual emigration this may be ex
pected it betakes efa spirit of enter
prise in keeping with the progress of
our people but no such emigration
should extend to a committal of our
people to an alienation of our people
from their country to a disconnec
tion of interests responsibilities and
hopes with other americans
your committee read with sorrow
and regret the communication in the
new york tribune of the th instant
relative to the liberia agricultural
association it being evident from the
reading of the same that it is an aux
iliary and ally to the colonization
movement that its members its de
fender and recommenders are bedfel
lows with the leading colonizationists
of our city and that it must necessarily
receive our censure and condemnation
the british government is consider
ing the feasibility and profitableness of
our people emigrating to the british
west indian islands we regard the
spirit dictating the plan as selfish be
sides it would not afford a pecuniary
inducement to the mass at the same
time all the objections urged in this
report against emigrating to africa ap
ply to it with the following differences
the colonization society of this coun
try is dictated by hate these encoura
ging emigration to the west indies are
not that the african climate is more
enervating than that of jamaica
that in the case of liberia it is a pro
scriptive government excluding men
because of their complexion whilst the
other knows of no such distinctions
your committee would recommend our
people to remain firm in the face of all
threats and inducements to their oft
repeated resolve to live die and be
buried in the graves of their fathers
to remove to the country to become
tillers of the soil that if anyone be
determined upon emigrating from the
country that they emigrate to ja
maica and not to liberia that per
sons emigrating to jamaica or other
places to engage wherever they can in
commercial trade with those they leave
behind
all of which is most respectfully sub
mitted

this document was received with
the mo√üt enthusiasticapplause
dr james mccune smith read the
following document as chairman of the
committee of three on the condition of
the people of color
report on the social condition of the peo
ple of color around new york city and an
the best means of ameliorating the same
the subject social condition embra
ces domestic economy social inter
course standard of morals habits of
thought and general aim or tendency
these are too great a variety ol mat
ters to be well discussed in a single
paper and some of them are hardly
pertinent to this convention the
most immediately practical among them
is domestic economythe most im
portant the general aim
on these two subjects a few remarks
will be made and one or two sugges
tions offered
that we aim to advance in common
with the rest of the american people is
true because we are constantly be
seeching them not to bar our progress
by unequal laws
that we do advance in the teeth
of the most tremendous opposition ever
encountered by men is a point on
which i must for the present waive
the expression of any decision we
are so mixed up in the heat and the
smoke of the battle that we can see
too little of our absolute or relative po
sition three or four facts however
are noteworthy
 accident has on two recent occa
sions enabled a few colored men to
save the state to the whigs and the
whigs have courteously thanked us by
frowns and curses and by introducing
a bill into the state legislature to ap
propriate  per annum for our
removal to the coast of guinea
 it has become more current than
ever to talk of our removal from this
country as if we were wild indians or
tares growing among the wheat
 balls and feasts in which we have
expended some ten thousand a year
are losing caste among us and have not
paid this winter
 from some causes not well de
fined there is a very general restless
ness among us a determination to do
something more than we have been
doing
can we do anything more
hitherto we have acted with little
concert and less organization yet we
have done fair fight we have now a
reputation for endurance and plasticity
from our worst foes if we organize
thoroughly we can do much more
shall we organize in the city
the advantages about city life with
us are ist that a larger number of us
can be within short distance of each
other and thereby may easily organize
without such disadvantage as would
grow from the same number being
banded io a single county
we get forge amount of friction
without being so condensed as to be
rochester n y thursday april  
reached by a law for removing us from
any rural localitysuch laws as expa
triated indians and mormons we car
be if we will much better provided foi
in the matter of education j n the city
than we could in the country we
can if we choose throw vastly more
trade of our own and of other people in
the way of each other in the city than
we cnuld in the country
the disadvantages of our city life i
mean those peculiar tuies for all city
me is alter all a kind of hothouae for
cing of human beings a q the follow
ingour lives are much ehoriened
look at the preponderance of widows
and children among us they so far
exceed the calamities of mere sickness
that our benevolent societies have been
obliged to cut off the widows and or
phans in order to heal the sick
next the seductions of the city
policy gambling porterhouses with
their billiards and cards create a gang
oflazaroni of both sexes women has
tening through the streets with their
bonnets untied men shirtless and
shoeless hanging round the corners
or standing walking guttertumbling
signs which our foes call the type of
our condition
 ciy life shuts us from general
mechanical employment white jour
neymen in the cities refuse to work
with us and colored bosses have either
too little capita or too little enterprize
to bring up and employ apprentices and
journeymen
th from the necessity of seeking
employment in the city as servants
porters c our manhood is in a
measure demeaned lowered kept
down and i doubt much whether man
hood flourishes very much among citi
zens of any class
sth the enormous combination of
capital which is slowly iavading every
calling in the city from washing and
ironing to palace steamers must tend
more and more to grind the face of the
poor in the cities and render them
more and more the slaves of lower wa
ges and higher rents
no sane man can doubt from this or
any comparison of the kind that coun
try life is the better choice for our peo
ple not consolidated isolated country
life but a well mixed country and vil
lage life the matter of education
the great disadvantage of country life
might be remedied by concert of ac
tion
i seriously hope therefore that this
convention will among its first acts ap
point a committee and place funds at
its disposal by which it may be enabled
to concoct some efficient plan of remo
val of a large proportion of our people
into the rural districtspartly as far
mers partly as business men partly as
mechanics
in the meantime let us not forget
that while there is a certain and posi
tive limit to our advancement in the
city there can be no such daily in
creasing barrier in the country
in the meantime also while prepa
ring to leave the city let us look a lit
tle practically into the social economies
in practice here in the city an econ
omy which of itself would save enough
to send into the country and snugly set
up one out of every ten city families
per year and first about
house rent
in the rear of no  laurens street
is a back lot which cost  on it
are erected two buildings which cost
oooo total  interest on
which at  per cent is  and add
for taxes insurance and wear loo
making full cost as  per year
these two buildings arc occupied by
twenty colored families who pay an
average of  each per month that is
 per year here is a clear
profit to the landlord of  per year
above interest and expense
here then in the single item of rent
twenty families are paying enough to
fit out two families a year most amply
and abundantly for the country
again if those buildings were owned
by a colored saving institution whose
surplus funds should be devoted to set
ting up colored young men on farms
such institution after paying deposit
ors six per cent would have a splendid
surplus for starting farmers or men in
other business if we take a larger
view of this matter of house rent the
results are amazing according to tho
above estimate each one of the twenty
families in the rear of  laurens
street is paying thirtyfive per year
too much for house rent
there are some  colored fami
lies in new york and its vicinity say
that each family pays only ten dollars a
year too much for house rent and that
these families could by organization
retrench and accumulate that sum per
year and we would save in thia one
item  per year
fuel
is next in importance our  fam
ines consume at least two and a half
tons of coal per year making 
tons at least twothirds of these
 families buy their coal by the
bushel or peck thereby paying two
dollars per ton more than the market
price which is a sacrifice of 
per year then if theae two thousand
families combined to buy their own coal
at the wharf they could aave by pur
chasing cargoes one dollar on each
ton at least which is  al
lowing the nire of a coal yard at boo
each there would be a clear gain of
bloo in the single matter of ctal if
we would thorougly organize thia shat
ter
by similar calculations it can be
shown that we could easily aave 
 on groceries and food and loooo
on wearing apparel besides setting up
in successful and commanding business
such men as are capable intelligent
and trustworthy
hence the entire saving that would
be effected in those domestic econo
mies would be  per year
how can this saving be effected
it may be effected by a thoroughly
organized mutual savings bank not
a common five or six per cent savings
bank which is according to proudhon
a sign of misery but an efficiently or
ganised hank wkii ii th deposit
ors should at the time be shareholders
and full participants in all the profits
such an institution jo be practica
ble would require the exercise of a
large amount of mutual faith and mu
tual confidence faith enough in col
ored men to entrust them with large
sums confidence enough in their bu
siness tact for the successful manipula
tion of their money
the bank will require a structure
somewhat different from our ordinary
banks ist it should have power to
buy and sell real estate d it should
have power to discount good paper
d it should have power to loan mon
eys on bond and mortgage on real and
personal estate th it should have
power to buy and sell merchandize
i am prepared to go into further de
tails about this bank other gentlemen
members of this convention have paid
sufficient attention to the matter to
make an immediate report i would
respectfully suggest that a committee
be appointed to report on this matter
vveare in condition to adopt and
carry out such report immediately
we have sufficient capital already
stored in the savings banks to start one
of our own of the kind we need
what end should we aim at in this
economy by a savings bank
we must not regard this bank nor
its economies as an end it is only a
means to help out the more desirable
ends of our advancement in the com
munity or state to which we belong
and the larger end of advancing the in
terests of the community at the same
time
to do this we must leave the city
its seductions its oppressions and bale
ful atmosphere and seek to expand our
elbows our lungs and our energies in
the free air of the rural districts we
arc already provided with land in a
rapidly growing section of the state
let us economize enough to go and
settle that land by five or six families
at a time and by and by our economies
can extend to the exchange of the
country products timber cattle pota
toes for goods bought by our banks in
the city and forwarded at low rates
another suggestion there is enough
in our condition to cause us to meet
frequently and discuss it calmly search
ingly this american people is after
all like a large and energetic stomach
its powers of assimilation are tremen
dous it can knead together dutch
irish brickbats mountains of stone or
gold arctic regions and torrid heats
a very capable stomach that you
will say so it is but then it has a
lefthanded trick which like all things
coming from that direction is sudden
and fearfully energetic it has the
trick of casting out disintegrated and
ground to powder whatever it cannot
assimilate we must either go in and
assimilate or wake up on some fine
morning and find ourselves spewed over
the broad atlantic
we had better look to it we
should meet twice better three times a
year and talk over what we have at
stake and what we bad better do
domestic economy as i said is but
part of our social relations it is the
foundation of social contentment
when we have settled and consolidated
this we may go into our social sins and
short comings and amend them
the doctor after concluding the
reading ef the report said that there
wero  or  of the colored
people invested in savings banks in
wall street and he then presented the
following resolution
resolved that a committee of three
be appointed with power to present the
form of a mutual saving institution em
bracing the matters of house rent fuel
and other domestic wants and that one
of the conditions of membership of said
institution shall be a pledge to abstain

mr louis h putnam read the report
of the committee on political relai
lions as follows
report on political relations
mr president and fellowcitizens
as a committee on the political rela
tions of the colored people we beg
leave to submit the following report as
the result of our deliberation
it is no ordinary task to prepare a
document sufficiently comprehensive to
convey a correct idea of the necessity
and the intention of this report and wc
can only console ourselves with the
pleasing reflections that in discharging
the duty which has devolved upon us
we were governed by the strongest
inclination to serve the interest of our
people
on a careful examination of our po
litical history we have arrived at the
conclusion that since  there has
existed in this country a disposition to
extinguish the rights and privileges
which were enjoyed by all freemen pre
vious to that date the spirit by which
the american people were governed
during the revolutionary war was man
ifested in the first constitution of this
and other states of the union by ex
tending to all freemen above twenty
one years the right of franchise irre
spective of complexional considerations
the fact that wa exercise the privi
termss  per iiiu invariably ii urticc
lege under a proscriptive provision in
the constitution and that in new jer
sey pennsylvania delaware and in
the southern and western states our
people are deprived of it entirely is a
sufficient proof that a less liberal feel
ing exists towards us the baneful
effect which has resulted from proscrip
tive legislation has developed itself in
all the ramifications of our existence in
this country the principle which has
prompted these proceedings against the
colored people is based upon the false
xtia an j n f er i or
race and are incapable of exercising
sufficient judgment in the political af
fairs of the country if this slander
could be sustained by a single fact it
would afford us some satisfaction to
know that white men are not free from
this weakness the report of the com
mittee of the common council of this
city in reference to the use of convicts
to vote for respectable candidatesought
to be sufficient to destroy the objections
against extending the franchise to the
colored people but the same principle
has developed itself in caucus meetings
composed of persons who consider
themselves far superior to us in point
of morals and although the tendency
is to destroy the purity of the ballot
box yet there is no remedy for this
evil we do not allude to these trans
actions with hopes of receiving any
consolation forthe treatment we have
received but to state the fact that there
are colored men who are deprived of
their right if they were in possession
of it they would not debase their man
hood by bartering away their votes
the line which has so distinctly di
vided the colored and the white people
in this state has placed us in a position
so anomalous that even in cases where
the preponderance in favor of the suc
cessful party was the result of our
votes yet it has never yet been ac
knowledged by those whose political
interests were subserved by it
the conclusion arrived at from these
facts will show that our efforts to pro
mote the interests of either of the poli
cal parlies are gratuitous on our part
and for the future we ought to be gov
erned by such means as will enable us
to subserve any design which may be
deemed necessary to defeat either of
the two if their principles should be
considered at war with our interest to
carry out this idea we must abandon
our individual connection with the old
parties and establish an organization
throughout the state to enable us to
support such candidates as are known
to be men who will defend the rights of
the oppressed we have five thousand
colored voters in this state which are
sufficient to enable us to control the
state or presidential elections except
ing under extraordinary circumstances
such as governed the political element
during the campaign which resulted in
elevating to the presidency the late
gen taylor
to view this subject superficially
and in connection with the fact that
there are more than four hundred thou
sand voters in the state it would ap
pear not only egotistical in us to as
sume so much in favor of our ability
but it would be considered by many as
an absurdity but as these assumptions
should be sustained by some facts we
will present such as will be sufficient to
bear out our premises the political
parlies in this state are so nearly equal
that less than two hundred votes were
sufficient to carry the election last no
vember which does not exceed the
number of colored freeholders in wil
iiamsburgh and brooklyn in 
the majority for the electoral colleges
was  which will show that under
the most favorable circumstances no
party could succeed if opposed by five
thousand voters unless there should be
a great change in the relative strength
of the whig or democratic party in this
state there are times when the state
may be parried by a very large vote
as in the election of the late governor
wright and also his successor but it
occurs from want of harmony in the
ranks of either of the cortfending par
ties but in this review no inference
could be drawn which can in anywise
change the main features of the prem
ises upon which we have based our cal
culation
but the most important question that
presents itself in this connection is
whether the antislavery party will
assume a position which will harmonize
with the ideas embodied in this report
the answer to this question cannot
emanate from us but from those to
whom it refers
the necessity of identifying our
selves with the liberty party has been
before us for the last twelve years but
as we could not see how our interest
could be promoted by that organization
we have acted on a different basis
the important questions to be de
cided in this state by the next election
makes it imperative that the colored
people ano the liberty party should
unite upon a plan that wilt enable us to
act in an effective manner in all the
counties in the state against any com
bination which may have for its aim the
suppression of any measures which may
be deemed as involving the interest of
freedom
the propriety of acting on the prop
osition of your committee may be ques
tioned by some but every man in this
country who appreciates the motives by
svhich we are governed will commend
and not censure it on former occa
sions we have pursued the course
which would harmonise with the views
of the party we designed to support
hut as our organizations were not suffi
ciently extensive to command any re
spect many who owed their iloetio√ü to
whole no 
our votes were the most active in op
posing our interests
from this cause the liberty party
as slo d out from other organizations
but as the time has come for ns to oc
cupy a position in defence of our rights
let no man shrink from the responsibil
ity which may devolve upon him
the objection which has been urged
against the old political parties for their
want of honesty is not sufficient to jus
tify us in leaving them in possession of
the field unless we had the means to
promote our iuterest without their aid
r our committee believe that the banner
that waved over  freemen in this
state in  will again float to the
breeze and in spite of all proscriptive
organization against it its cause will
triumph
w e approved of the principle of the
party upon the ground of its national
feature and as it involved the ques
tion of freedom in the territory it was
sufficient to command our support
the position we occupied in ihe con
test may be reviewed at the present
time to illustrate the idea in reference
to the future and as our actions were
in harmony with the liberty party it
will be a sufficient justification on all
occasions when we may be called upon
toact from the same motives
in  and o we supported a dif
ferent ticket and the result of the elec
tion in november last will give a better
idea of our strength than anything we
can say in this report but unless the
wa a position that will enable
them to command the conndtme of tk
people it is clear that they cannot
maintain their anomalous organization
we wage no war against the whig or
the democratic party but against the
servile principle that prompts men to
act in opposition tc their honest convic
tions
mr chairman and fellowcitizens
in contemplating upon the futuie his
tory of the state of new york we
strive in vain to suppress the deep emo
tion of our feelings and in spite of her
oppressive treatment we are not un
faithful to her interest we havesuf
ficient confidence in the people of the
empire state to believe that we have
their sympathy and although time
serving men may deceive them and in
terpose between us and our rights yet
justice will execute her will in behalf
of our oppressed race

for me either to hide or palliatethat
of slavery again and again was the
question put to me in sorrow and not
in anger but how is it possible for a
people so moral religious enlightened
free to defend and practice slavery
what could i answer the contradic
tion between every principle which
lies at the foundation of the american
institution and of the christian re
ligion and slavery was so complete
that an angel from heaven must have
stood ashamed and dumb before every
virtuous man who asked him for an
answer to this question i explained to
my inquiring friends that the odious
system was begun under the british
government long before america was
free but why does it continue
was the instant rejoinder to this state
ment if there is a living being in the
united states who does not lament
and shudder at this scourge of humani
ty he is dead not only to the voice of
conscience and of patriotism but to
the sense of shame and the honor of
his country the grand moral lesson
which the united states is reading to
the world is neutralized nay converted
into a bitter mockery of reason by
slavery and in every part of europe
where i have travelled is this deplora
ble truth known and lamented by the
good but hailed with pleasure and
pointed to with triumph by the op
pressor and his tool

speech of mr george thompson
the following is a sketch of the speech of
george thompson delivered at the rochester
amislavery convention as reported for the
antislavery standard
mr thompson spoke of the condition of
the coored people of this country and of
the hatred and prejudice which meet them
both bond and free in every direction you
said mr thompson who profesa to believe
that all men are created free and equal have
in the face of heaven and earth given the
lie in your professions you have proscribed
and set span as unclean the entire colored
population of the land three millions of them
you have doomed to a hopeless bondage and
thoae who by birth or oiher circumstances
tre not slaves you deride scoff at hate and
oppress because the same god who made
gave them a color unlike your
own i can sympathize with my colored
brother who sees but darkness around and be
fore him but  do not share his feelings of
despondency  agree with the views of my
excellent ftiend mrs foster who yesterday
gave us words of cheering and of hope i
believe that his redemption is not far off for
all the elements of tyrannv in the land are
now in full operation to rivet the chains of the
slave and to make complete the work of op
pression this is very encouraging for twenty
years we have been trying to get the people
of this nation round upon the subject of sla
very the siupor and indifference which
marked the early days of the antislavery
cause have disappeared and now the whole
land is awakened to the subject now the
sirength of tyranny is to be tested in an open
war with freedom now the phiunitrti
the humanity and the true christian principle
of this land is brough to bear upon this dark
system of robbery and pollution and who
can doubt that the issue will be glorious for
freedom
 see sitting in solitary grandeur the friend
of my youth the man who by his gigantic
efforts and matchless courage brought this
question of slavery before the american
people thru man is win lloyd garrison
i with him look back upon the career of the
antislavery cause during the twenty years
past and  looked at that cause as it stands
now before the world it is not now the ques
tion between a few silly women and some
pert upstart clergyman in his pulpit it is
not now a matter for the sport and laughter
of the heartless and the shallow brained it is
a tiling of reality now the press the pulpit
and the legislative bodies of the land are
engaged in its discussion now the contest is
between the united states government and
the justice and humanity of the people now
has the proclamation of the president gone
forth now is the battle set in array the
ground is measured the orders given and
the trumpet sounded for the onset now the
contest is between god and moloch and we
rejoice that ihe battle is at hand for we know
that he w ho is the god of the oppressed is
with us and that certain victoiy awaits us
but  w as speaking of the proscription of
the colored man it is true that in this land
you make ihe cruelties you practice upon a
portion of the colored race in making ihem
slaves a reason for hating and persecuting
those who are not slaves you conspire to
prevent ihe colored freeman from obtaining
respectable employment you drive him to
the necessity of taking up with the most
menial employments to obtain bread for him
self and his family you conspire to prevent
his obtaining the education he needs you
with few exceptions shut to him the doors
of the colleges and academies of the land
because the chain of the christian is on his
brethren at the south you at the north
scorn and spit upon the free colored man
because ins race ate imbiuted at the south
you deny the free colored man at the north
the respect and honor doe him as a man et
it was your god and judge who made him
he it was who gave to him the form and
color for which you hate and despise him it
was his lamb who died tor him it is
your g id and his who will call you to ac
count for this peisecution and haired of your
colored brother by daring do do this you
place yourselves in array against god you
seek by indulging this feeling of prejudice
to arraign his wisdom and by trampling
upon the rights of the coloied man you vir
tually seek to dethrone the god of heaven
think of it three millions of gods child
ren equal to yourselves by birth invested by
their creator w ith all the sacred rights of
men equal in all things pertaining to the
dignity of the human race with the proudest
of the earth equal to the president of these
united siaies or any of the proud statesmen
or oppressorsof the landthree millions
held by their fellowmen in fee simple goods
and chattels to he made to toil unpaid to
be spit upon laceiated by the whip the
wife to be torn from the arms of the husband
and the child irom the embraces of the parent
and all this in a land professedly republican
in a land of bibles of churches and ol
sabbaths the mother in travail wails noi
till she lias brought forth her offspring snd
rejoices at the birih of her child but before
it sees the light she cuises her own existence
and curses the day when her offspring are
born into slavery for the christians of a
land like this the republicans of a land like
this have connived together for evil and they
bettay the negro from the womb aye more
horrible stillthey doom to slavery millions
yet in the loins of iheir parents they have
built up a system of w rong which shall seize
and enslave millions of gods creatures
through ages to come and in enslaving
the body you crush the soil the soul
who can the vast capabilities of the
soul who weigh the hopes and fears of
only one soul and you have placed beneath
your feet three millions l three millions oj
slaves you cannot giasp the number you
think of it but do not comprehend it go to
the eea side and pick up the pebbles on the
beach till you have accumulated the vast
number of three millions and let each peb
ble stand for one slave and think of the
stupendous nature of that one slaves soul
think of the grandeur of its powers thiuk of
its linmotlal destiny and remember that to
enslave it  to put out the light which god
himself has kindled within it that to enslave
it is io make it dark to crush its powers to
covet it with moral pollution and then multi
ply this guilt w hich tongue cannot speak by
the guilt of enslaving three millions and
grasp if vou can the fearful aggregate ol
crime
we look over the wateis of the atlantic to
see the exemplification of chtistian principle
in this land at the south we see without a
parallel lust incest cruelty and murder in
the free slates even in new england we
pass by the proud churches and the prouder
priesthood ol the land and we find the exhibi
tion of that christian principle we seek among
compaiatively a few men and women un
known to fame gathered out from every sect
party and condition of life closely and peri
odically leagued together by one oommon
bond ot deep and constant sympathy for the
slave and these men and women are by
ihe legislatures of the land set without the
pale ot the law for no other crime than their
halted ol wiong and oppression denied for
twenty years the protection which even the
criminal receives viz the defence of the
police from the violence of lawless men
they are and have been outlawed by their
own legislators simply because they have
loved truth and humanity and by these legis
lators and officers of the law have been
deliberately given over to tbe meicies of the
mob i saw tnyself in faneuil hall two
hundred ruffians in the presence of the
mayor the chief of the police and the
police force of boston mock at and trample
under foot the dearest rights of  of the
purest and best of the laxpaying citizens of
that city to this hour the ruins of pennsyl
vania hall tell of the power of slavery in
this land to crush the ngbi of ftee speech and
utterly destroy the freedom of the citizen
and all this because of the prejudice which
you have fostered and kept ahve toward the
piloted race thai hatred of tbo blaok man
has poisoned your hearts and you ex
hibit it in every relation of life  i have
a citizen here in rochester whose residence
in any city of the unioo would be an honor
to that citya man of rare intellect a man
from whose writings the first newspaper in

that man is frederick dougiasa and here
at rochester and in america he in the esti

working mechanic is but a nigger to
what depths of degradation does the prejudice
against color sink those who cherish it to
what meanness and wickedness will not men
stoop who giving themselves up to the in
fluence of a shameful prejudice teach them
selves to hate without cause their brother
whom god hath made but courage poot
scorned and insulted man of color the day
is coming when in your case the parable of
lazarus and dives will be realized let the
proud and rich and the mighty scorn and
hate you the bosom of an impartial god is
wailing for you and foi your oppressors is
waiting that wrath which the god of the op
pressed has reserved for the tyrant who
tramples his image in the dust
when my friends do you expect this
hatted of the colored man this crushing on
pression in u wl i cease
you cannot tell i will tell you it will
be when you yourselves repudiate it do you
expect the press of the land will become
pure and just it will become so when you
have become so and not till then the
press is a mirror it reflects the mind of the
public the mass of the people of this coun
try are indifferent to or directly favorable to
ward the cause of oppression the greater
portion of the press of the land reflects that
indifference or openly advocates oppression
let the people of the land put on the form of
humanity and see if the press does not reflect
back that humanity against the outrage which
slavery commits upon the race
how is it with the pulpit any better than
the press no w ashed and more decent
but no better for when at all risks the fuig
tivo has escaped from his shackles as he
passes through free new england the
hunter seizes him and the priest from the
altar lends him his aid to send him back to
slavery and seeks to make the bible sano
tionthe crime he has committed in thus sus
taining oppression look now at the pulpits
of the land hear from the voices of the
sharpes the deweys the rogerses and a
host of others advocating the claims of the
manthief and robber as paramount to the
higher law of god when will the pulpit
of the land be cleansed when you the people
shall be pure and shall teach the recreant
timeserving ministers to respect the claims
of humanity and the law of the blessed god
the work then is to be done with you and
through you the people all reforms have
been begun and been carried on by the people
and to them we look in this dark day of
tyranny
and new take the question home to your
own bosoms feel for the slave for he needs
your pity do your duty to him and the re
ward of the righteous shall be yoursa peace
of mind which the selfish and the tyrannical
know not the happiness of knowing that in
the day when tyranny was strong and the
wrath of the oppressor was hot against the
friends of truth and of human freedom you
defended the poor slave and did what you
could for his emancipation choose you this
day whom ye will serve if the lord be god

 have given above nothing but a sketch of
the speeches of mr thompson to convey

quate idea of his power as an orator is im

acceptable as they serve to bring to mind the
look and manner of the splendid orator il

then the leader who has never heard george
thompson could feel something of his power
and feel the blood start through his veins

of an awakening sense of the vastness of the
subject of which mr thompson speaks and
the great responsibility of each one of us in
relation to it
news from the old world
the canadas mails arrived irom boston
on saturday morning
rights or british subjects in america
lt may be in the recollection of our readers
that we drew attention some month ago to the
case of isaac bowers a british subject who
on iho ground of his color was taken out of a
vessel at charleston and locked up in the
town jail during the ships stay in that port
this public notice of the subject was followed
up by inquiries in the house of commons
and eventually by an application on the part
of our government to that of the united
stales the case has now assumed a com
plexion of the most extraordinary kind in
deed it is hard to say what confusion may
not be generated by the action of this un
lucky incident on the internal politics of the
union and the commercial relations between
that country and this it should be under
stood that two distinct authorities were found
to be interested in the question and a corres
ponding division of responsibility was of
course involved
the treaties regulating the intercourse be
tween great britain and the united states
and contracted between hex majestys gov
ernment on one hand and the supteme gov
ernment of the union on the other secure to
the citizens of each of the contracting powers
the free right of entering departing and re
siding unmolested within each others bound
aries and it was on the strength of this stip
ulation that our government remonstrated
against the gratuitous incarceration of one oi
its subject the independence however ot
the several states composing the american
union has only been partially surrendered to
the federal government and it was in the
exercise of a right assumed to be legally re
served that the local legislature ol south
carolina enacted the ordinsncmsmier which
isaac boweis was imprisoned
the carolinas as the reader is aware are
slaveholding states and with such jealousy
do they guard their institutions that the ap
pearance of a free black in their towns is ab
solutely forbidden and hence the law provid
ing for the incarceration of all such during
the stay of ihe vessel which shall have
brought them to the country on ihe one
hand therefore by plain treaty engagements
between the two countries isaac bowers was
free to enter reside and depart at any point
of the american territory without molestation
or annoyance on the other by known local
laws he was amenable to imprisonment at
charleston in respect of his skin
the first application of the british govern
ment was made of course to the cabinet ol
washington as the representative of the
american union in its relations with foreign
state mr clayton in reply acknowledged
the violation of the treaty in the act com
plained of but charged the consequence upon
the peculiar character of tbe federation
which remitted to each constituent state a
certain private sovereignty in virtue whereoi
the law in question had been passed
whether this reply was made entirely in
good faith or with the wish io elude a trou
blesome controversy we shall not attempt to
determine but the results hive been singuiai
in ihe extreme on the receipt of mr clay
tons answer by which we were virtually re
ferred for satisfaction to tbt government ot
south carolina mr matthew the british
consul at that port vai instructed to make
his appeal accordingly and he forthwith ad
dressed a communication on the subject to
governor meant who acknowleded his note
with eqoal courtesy and laid the matter at
once before the legislature of the state
there teems little calculated to create dis
turbance in the proceedings we have here de
scribed the british government made its
appeal in the proper quartets and transferred
it upon proper recommendations to others
the government of south carolina accepted
the remonstrance in good spirit nor is there
any teaaon to doubt that some adjustment
will be attempted between the assumed inter
ests of the state and the plain rights of brit
ish subjects the consequences however
have been most remarkable the circum
stances of a correspondence between a for
eign consul and a local government has been
seized upon and denounced is a precedent ot
the most dangerous kind tending to nothing
less than the establishment of provincial sov
ereignties in derogation of the federal
power
in ordinaty seasons the effect of such asser
tions perhaps would not be serious but it hap
pens at this moment as the reader will re
member that the southern stales have been
agitating for a dissolution of the union snd
the incident in question is clamorously quoted
as an overt step in the direction of independ
ent sovereignty inasmuch as negotiation with
foreign powers is one of the privileges ex
pressly reserved by the constitution to the
federal government alone such there
fore in this view has been the excitem
ocra j tenement call nave been
made upon the executive to revoke the exe
quatur of our consul in consideration of his
proceeding and to withdraw from him that
warrant of recognition under which he acts
a measure which would be equivalent to the
abrupt dismissal of an ambassador from a
friendly court failing in this immediate step
the cabinet is menaced with impeachment
as loaning itself to secession disunion and
treason
this declamation indeed might perhaps
have few results but more remains behind
in remitting lord palmerstons application to
the legislature of south carolina the amer
ican government is understood to have added
that in default of redress from that state it
would be optional with the british govern
ment to leceive notice tor the abrogation of
the treaty thus infringed this treaty is
nothing less than the instrument under ihe
provisions of which our commercial inter
course with the ststes is now conducted aod
its abrogation would reopen an infinite ques
tion of duties and tariffs in this way the
mere political question is complicated not
only by the interminable topic of slavery but
by considerations ot local interests and advan
tages
the northern states are not only abolition
ists but manufacturers and moreover are
protectionists withal they have lately been
agitating for a protective tariff especially in
respect of iron and they seek in this instance
for a favorable development of those chances
which they conceive themselves to have gained
in the fortuitous accession of the present ex
ecutive to power they are not unwilling
therefore to push our government to the al
ternative of either silently draping its com
plaints or annulling a treaty which they would
fain see superseded by a different understand
ing
the southern slates on the contrary are
both anxious for the recognition of local sov
ereignty in the settlement of the imprisonment
question and desirous in the extreme to pre
serve those advantages which they are well
aware of enjoying under the present treaties
we may mention indeed as one of the re
markable points brought out by the pending
discussion that the carolinas confess some
thing very like an obligation to great britain
for the condition under which their produce
is imported into this countiy a letter on the
subject attributed to a wellknown dignitary
plainly indicates that our supplies are only
drawn so exclusively from american ports in
consequence of our own indifference and mis
conceptions and that if his countrymen per
sist in hugging the conviction that rice and
cotton equally good and of sufficient quanlitv
cannot be produced elsewhere than from the
united states they would live to see and re
gret their error we recommend this ob
servation which we have literally transcribed
to the notice of those who think it hopeless
to look for cotton markets in india or aus
tralia
those acquainted with the dashing style ol
american journalism will not be surprised to
hear that the whole embroilment has been
traced to the insidious perfidy of our foreign
office as an intregal portion of a scheme for
disseverng the union in point of fact our
interests are nut immediately involved ex
cept in so far as it is impossible to contem
withont concern the breaking up relations
like those which subsist between the two
countries we should no doubt extend ev
ety consideration to a government so situated
as that of south carolina but the question is
beset with difficulties it is doubtful in the
first place whether any satisfactory adjust
ment may be found practicable between the
broad claims of the british government on be
half of its subjects and the inveterate tenacity
of the southern states on the point of their
institutions
in the next place it is uncertain whether
this independent action of a local government
will be permitted while it may be taken as in
contestable that the state in question will nut
submit to the intervention of the federal
power in respect of a law regarding the
management or control of slaves the mat
ter therefore is now dubiously resting with
two distinct authoritiesthat of the legisla
ture of south carolina before which the
question has been laid and that of the su
pteme government which will probably be
driven to cancel its decision great britain in
the meantime being absolutely committed to
a peremptory demand such are some of the
evils ol slavery and eveiy years experience
tends to prove that there is scarcely any affair
ot government or slate which is not liable to
be complicated and embarrassed by the influ
ence of thiseverpreaent institution london

confession under torturethere are
we havo no doubt a great many good people
who believe that the torturing of criminals for
the purpose of extorting contession is a bar
barism quite unknown except as a historical
fact in this ago of light and law but we
lead nevertheless in the city papers this
week of a confession of some trifling in
fringement of prison rules having been made
under the torture of the showerbath by a
prisoner al sing sing a few days since this
method of torture which is ot quite modern
invention is said not uufrequenlly to produce
madness on those subjected to it it is capa
ble of producing very exquisite as one
may well conceive from this description of it
to a morning paper
by the way we may as well give a de
scription of the prison bathing apparatus as
it is in some points essentially different from
those in general use the person who is to
undergo the operation is seated and his legs
arms and head ire firmly fastened with wooden
clasps so that hs cannot get sway from tbe
water nor use bis hands to bteak as force
the water falls about six feet and at the tale
of about a barrel a minute through a piece
of iron pierced with quarter inch holes the
one inflicting punishment leu on snd shuts off
the water by means of a cord attached to a
valve since the lash was abolished this
mode of punishment has been found very
efficacious
efficacious no doubt of it waa not tbe
thumbscrew and the ironbeet and why
should not the showerbath be so also as
standard
rowland hill made s good remark upon
hearing the power of the letter h discussed
whether it were a lettef or not if it were
not he said it would be a very serious affair
for him for it would make him ill all tbe days

letter from the editor
toronto c w
he who can act in the capacity of his own
chronicler without at the same time appearing
egotistical and ridiculous to others possesses
a talent for letter writing of which i find my
self greatly deficient if not wholly destitute
it is true that minute accounts of my own
public movements have appeared in the col
umns of the north star and it is also true
that i have pretty nearly abandoned the
practice of inserting thembut certainly not
before it had become thoroughly distasteful to
me and perhaps equally so to my readers
in again sending a letter to the star infotm
ing my readers of my doings i can plead as
stoutly as gen cass the apology of circum
stances it is now my fortune to be the
travelling companion or george thompson
and of samuel j ly champions of free
dom and friends of my enslaved people in
whose every movement i feel the most grate
ful and lively interest and if in recording
their good works my own are inferred let
my own gratitude to tkera plead my apology
for what must be unavoidably complimentary
to myself
on monday morning march st mr
thompson and i started from lockport
where he had been delivering addresses to
highly delighted audiences during several days
previous for toronto via lewiston the
ride from lockport to lewiston was performed
partly by steam power and partly by horse
power the road between these points is
one of the oldest in the united states and
perhaps the most dilapidated snake
heads are abundant and the traveller feels
tar more apprehension on account of these
than from any liability of being thrown off the
track for the highest speed attained on this
road does not exceed ten miles an hour in
passing through tbe indian reservation we
saw a number of indian cottages or huts in
which mr thompson seemed to take much
interest now and then there would appear
at the doors sons and daughters of the forest
whose aspect seemed to halt between the
rudeness of the past and the civilization of
the present i never look at an indian with
out having my feelings depressed  regard
him as a brother in afflictionas smitten by
the same hand which has prostrated my own
people
we leached lewiston from lockport in
about two hours where we were met by the
rev s j may and hiram wilson who
were waiting to join mr thompson in hn
canadian tour lewiston is situated on the
american side of the niagara river and is
seven miles from the falls on one hand
the lake ou the other there is nothing very
interesting in the appearance of the village
but its environs are beautiful a range oi
lofty hills on the northa broad and fertile
plain airetching off to the esai dotted with
good farms interspeted with grand old
woods with the picturesque banka of niagara
river on the canadian aidethe suspension
bridge on the south connecting two peace
ful nations over the contending waves of the
river below make the location of lewiston
exceedingly beautiful
from lewiston we took the canadian
steamer chief justice for toronto i
was very soon made to feel on board of this
steamer that i was leaving the united slates
the captain officers and passengers main
tained a deportment and bearing towards me
altogether unamerican on being intro
duced to the captain he touched his hat
made a graceful bow and advance to take
me by the hand indicating that though an
englishman he did not despise manhood in a
sable hue there was a total absence in tbe
countenances of the passengers of that ma
lignant aversion with which colored persons
are usually regarded by white people when
they travel by steamers in the united states
the trip from lewiston to the lake is very
beautiful the deep gorge through which
niagara river passes as viewed from the
deck of our steamer cannot fail to tivet the
attention of the lover of nature the beauty
of the scene is equally divided between the
united states and canada the whole distance
at the mouth of the river it was easy to see
that we had been passing between the domain
of two nations fort george on the
canadian aide and fort niagara on the
american presented their menacing fronts
and unfolded their rival banners all smiling
that day to be sure but at the same time in
dicating the power to do something else not
quite so pleasant or agreeable fsur hours
on the placid lake ontario and we were
hrowing out our lines to the wharf at
toronto
we had scarcely reached the shore when
our steamer was boarded by the rev dr
willis president of the toronto antislaveiy
society accompanied by mr hamilton mr
brown and mr henning the secretary
we were very cordially received by these
gentlemen and escorted to the north
american hotela hotel conducted in real
british style
toronto preserves surprisingly its distinctive
character though within three or four hours
of the states and in daily communication it
is in its general appearance and in the man
ners of its inhabitants a british town we
had not been in toronto but a few hours be
fore we were invited to breakfast in several
directions this is a custom almost unknown
in the united states but quite common in
england and scotland on the evening of
our arrival wc attended the committee of the
a s society the rev dr willis in the
chair during the evening a very enga
ging discussion took place respecting the
different antislavery organizations of this
country and the occasion was rendered there
by somewhat exciting as well as interesting
it was evident that some of the members of
the committee pethaps ail of them had
had their minds abused by misrepresentations
of the character and opinions of william l
garrison the spirits of detraction from one
of the noblest advocates of emancipation has
not been confined to our own shores and the
american antislavery society with its be
neficent desigi and catholic platform had
shared in the fate of its leader the old
charges of ulterior objects sifting in
extraneous topics infidelity socialism
and what not were here to be met upon the
threshhold
to thia work messrs may and thompson
earnestly applied themselvesvindicated the
american society from responsibility for the
opinions of its individual membets on subjects
aside from slavery mr thompson showed
himself to be a true friend of the absent by
nobly standing up for mr garrison the
conversation was brisk on both sides and at
times warm yet good tempered rev dr
willis displayed much magnanimity and
catholicity of sentiment he would work
he said for the overthrow of slavery with
anybody so long as he was not required
thereby to endorse opinions which he consid
ered false and injurious
it seems that the committee had been in
communication with the american and foreign
antislavery society and they had been
advised by the secretary to subscribe for the
national era as the best antislavery
paper nothing it seems had been said of
the national antislavery standard the
liberator the pennsylvania freeman
the antislavery bugle a d the liberty
party paper and we found the commiiteein
need of much light as to the leading instru
mentalities in the united states
mr may gave a history of the separation
of the american antislavery society in
 which was listened to with attention by
the committee and doubtless he did much to
remove the unfavorable impressions enter
tained by the members of the committee
towards that society
the meeting of the committee was closed
by prayer as is usual in meetings for philan
thropic purposes among the british people
the voice of earnest prayer for the freedom
of the enslaved is ever grateful to the feel
ings of the true abolitionist
on tuesday evening a crowded assembly
met in st lawrence hail a splendid build
ing to listen to an address by george thomp
son  was curious to know bow the eloqaent
man would sustain himself before an audience
so different and whose relations to slavery
are so diverse to those of the people of the
united states to whom he bad so recently
addressed his thoughts on this great subject
the result was mote than gratifying with
an aptitude almost marvellous he readily
adapted himself to his hearers and delivered
a speech which seemed to thrill every heait in
the vast auditory he enchained hia audience
for more than two hours and a half if i had
not so often said of his last speech that it
surpassed all its predecessors i should tay of
this that in beauty of diction compactness of
logic analytical acuteness splendor of rhe
toric depth of pathos and in burning rebuke
it far transcended his best efforts in corinthian
hall i have heard mr thompson often
even day after day for weeks togetherand
can say that  have never heard eloquence so
varied aa hia the fertility of his imagina
tion and his command of language seem il
limitable great powers devoted to a great
and glorious ciuse and i thanked god while
he spoke that the anguishstricken bondman
had auch an advocafe
on wednesday evening a meeting was
called especially for the colored people of to
ronto who were to be addressed by messra
may thompson sod myself in oooaequeoce
of imperfect notice and some offence received
st its form there were very few preaent of the
class for whom the meeting was primarily
intended yet the occasion was in many re
spects a serviceable one mr may addressed
tbe meeting at considerable length and gave
many valuable hints to our people sa to how
they might improve their condition and pro
mote their wellbeing mr thompson and i
followed him on topics suggested by his
speech and st s late hour the meeting ter
minated with many expressions of satisfac
tion the object of mr mays mission to
canana at this time is to obtain information
respecting the present condition and future
prospects of the fugitives who have been
driven by the inhuman legislation of thia re
public for freedom aud safety into canada
hundreds of these unfortunate and terroi
atricken people have been thrown by barba
rous republicans penniless upon the charity
of the generous subjects of a monarchy
on thursday evening a meeting was con
vened in st lawrence hall for me which
was well attended the object of my address
was to make my canadian friends acquainted
with the appalling facts of slavety and to
show them how they might bring their moral
and religious influence to bear upon the great
iniquity
a licit ib rn vaitoua am tax xxiigrantl a gv
eral antislavery sentiment but there is also
as i think a too sedulous regard among them
for the feelings of americans they think
it in good taste to let the americans manage
the question for themselves without the aid ol
what they term the injudicious interference ol
foreignets it is a little surprising that this
feeling should prevail among a people who
deem it meritorious for men to go as mission
aries to china to hindostan to the feegee
islands and to the ends of the earth for the
avowed purpose of turning men to righteous
ness
why should america with her three mill
ions of chained scourged and benighted
victims be regarded as an exception 
pronounce this nation a barbarous nation and
one in far greater need of the gospel of lib
erty than any other nation on the globe and
if for no other reason because no nation on
the globe is more really adverse to the spirit
of that gospel
on friday morning i bade adieu to tbe
hospitable shores of canada leaving mes
sieurs thompson may and g w putnam
in toronto further to prosecute their mis
sion the latter gentlemen had joined us
on the previous day
i take great pleasure in expiessing my
gratitude to the members of the toronto an
tislavery committee and also to the mes
sieurs carey to whom i am indebted for
many offices of kindness during my stay and
likewise for their efforts to exteud the circu
lation of the north star
on friday evening i again lectured in
lockport at the lutheran church on the
fugitive slave law
i had intended to give a somewhat length
ened account of the a s convention and of
the subsequent meetings held in that town
but other pens have called attention to this
subject and have removed all necessity for
my doing so  will however say that my
visit to lockport brought me in contact with
many whose friendship for me and whose
devotion to the cause did much to cheer ray
spirit at this trying crisisf d

i hear of a fugitive taken here and there
on all sides of me and i hear people say

at the smith settlement on the oswego
commonly known as oswego there is quite
a number of families living in a respectable

other industrious people live there was
not and there is not at this lime any danger
to any ot them for i think that if a miscre

in his eats would get one warming before he
left
bui then people felt unsafe honest
christian men who when they worship un

and learned that they were on their way to
visit their friends on the oswego
they were mi hough and a part of hia
family i invited hem in they accepted
the invitation dinner waa prepared and
we partook several of the neighbors sent
over to know if these people were fleeing
from slavery mr h is a comfortable far
mer just as too many colored people are not
they went to take their last visit with those
unfortunate fugitives who after clearing off
little farms and establish log themselves other

i bade adieu to the city of rochester on
monday evening accompanied by mr hallo
well one of the truest of the true among the
abolitionists i slept at buffalo and yester
day came here spending on the way one
hour at the falls no more of the falls i
felt them their image is before me their
solemn anthem is ringing in my ears i can
never forget them
i spoke seven times in rochester four of
my addtesses were on slavery two were on
india and one on british reform my last
was on sunday evening when corinthian
hall was crowded to its utmost capacity by
one of the most intelligent audiences i have
ever addressed the north star of this
week will contain some report of my speech
though i need not tell you that my notes do
not when printed give a full representation
of my speeches i am much more indebted
to the inspiration of the moment for anything
that moves my heart rs that to prepared
notes or subsequent preparation for the press
i have reason to speak well of rochester
the citizens have nobly rebuked the papers
which sought to mislead and petvert the pub
lic sentiment or worse to create disturbance
riot and violence publicly they have acted
towards a stranger and a foreigner with a
courtesy and a magnanimity worthy of any
city in the world i estimate the treatment
 have received in rochester the more highly
because it has been at the hands of persona
who did not belong to the ranks of the aboli
tionists i asked to be heard and i was
heard in no town or city of england was i
ever listened to with more attention it was
mv desire to be heard by audiences comprised
of politicians and religionists of varying hues
and sections my desire was gratified to the
uinoost i sought the opportunity of saying
freely all i felt thought feared hoped de
sired and puiposed on ihequuslion of ameri
can slavery  enjoyed that opportunity to
the extent of my lime and strength i did
not expect to be heard approvinglysuit less
to be cheered by overwhelming plaudits
and least of all to be surrounded by hun
dreds at the close of my lectures anxious to
grasp my hand and to utter the fervent god
bless you in my ear yet such has been
the case as thousands in rochester would
testify in private the hospitality of the
city litas been extended to me without mea
sure night after night parties of fitly sixty
and seventy have met me each one emulat
ing the rest in showing me tokens of confi
dence and affection what can  say to each
arid all of these friends but god bless you 
o i will believe in the triumph of the anti
slavery cause while one who like me shuns
not to declare the whole counsel of god is
thus cherished by the citizens of america f
will politicians and clergymen henceforth
have no faith in the truth will they see
its triumphs when preached by a reviled and
hated englishman and still remain unbeliev

but i am called away and can add no
more at present
god bless you also my beloved brother
i have met with many who know you not

another antislavery meeting
last night
the third of the series of antislavery
meetings was held last evening in the st
lawrence hall rev dr willis in the
chair
in his prefatory remarks the chairman or
the part of the toronto society disclaimed
all animosity towaids the united states in
the efforts which are now being made to
strengthen the cause of the abolitionists in
that couniiy
mr f douglass commenced his address
by a forcible description of the antislavery
question in the ameiican union in the first
instance he touched upon the various circum
stances and causes legal and social which
impart strength to the proslavery interest
grappling with the allegation that the north
ern states are not responsible for the per
stuation of this peculiar southern institution
e maintained that it is not a local or state
institution but a national one for while the
free states are pievented from interfering
with it with a view to its abolition they are
under the present constitution of the country
solemnly hound to render theit civil and mili
tary power to keep the slaves in subjection to
their masters he traced the character of
slaveiy the boisterous passions to which it
gives rise the constant struggle between
master and slavethe cruelty and tyranny
which it begets on one hand and the silent
resistance and mental and spititual darkness
which it necessitates on the other cruelty
he maintained is indispensable to the pro
longation of the relational pof master and
slave and cases or uai 
murderwere cited to sustain the assertion
those then who vindicate slavery as a bible
institution ought to be prepared to show that
the bible sanctions the perpetual use of whij s
and whipping posts ol gags and branding
irons of bowieknives and bloodhounds as
means of keeping millions in bondage the
ministers of the south bring all the influence
and organization of this mis called chris
tianity to prop the system they preach and
kidnap mengive thanks and rob cod s
own afflicted poortalk of christian liberty
and then boll hard the captive s door so
competply is this carried out that revivals
of religion and revivals of the slave trade go
handinhand together that slaveholders
and the clergymen by whom they are sup
ported are not honest in thier opinions may
be in lei red from the fact that they will not
tolerate argument and from the precautions
which their unquiet consciences lead them to
take for their bodily safety to avoid the
misapprehension which some expressions used
last night and reported in yesteidays patriot
were calculated to produce he aveired that
he is really a friend of the slaveholders who
may be considered more unhappy than their
slaves he yet repeated that the slaveholder
who ventures to hunt down a slave would
receive nothing but what he richly deserved
if he should meet his death at the hands of
the man whose liberty he attempts to take
away the speaker then portrayed the ex
tent to which both the great political parties
of the unionwhigs and democratsare
subject to the institution of slavery express
ing a conviction that the political parties were
never more completely under this influence
to the question why slavery exists in the
south i he answered because it is reputable
why reputsbe  because slaveholders are
reputable and they are so simply because
they are church members lor on that account
alone are they everywhere considered ha
therefore called on the people of canac to
use their moral influence to make the ameri
cans feel that we in canada regard slavery as
a highhanded foul damning crime against
man and god admitting that as a general
rule it is unwise and unseemly for the citizens
of one country to parade their grievances
before the people of another he nevertheless
contended that inasmuch as the church the
press and the political parties of america are
identified with slavery it is politic and propei
to bring the moral power of the world to bea
upon this wrong with a view to its destruc
tion herein then lay ihe justification ofi
his visit to toronto and of the agitation in
which he and his coabolitionists are engaged
he then entered into an exposition of the
fugitive slave law its unconstitutionally its
inhumanity and the startling anomalies that
are manifest in its procsedure and closed
with a highly flattering tribute to the oratory
and services of mr thompson
the address occupied nearly two hours and
a half in us delivery and was concluded
amidsi loud and prolonged applause
mr george thompson said a few words
jocular pathetic and practical the practi
cal portion being confined to an appeal on
behalf of the north star an abolitionist jour

rev dr pennington nn exile from

we learn from the hartford conn reli
gious herald an able and influential organ of
the congregational church that the reason ol
the protracted absence of this eloquent and
distinguished clergymen in europe is that he
fears that should he return he would be
seized and carried into slavery under the op
eration of the fugitive slave law says the
herald penn freeman
he has written to a legal gentleman in
th city to know whether it will be safe for
him to leiurn he is a fugitive slave having
escaped from maryland some twenty years
and fears that if he resumes his ministerial
labors in new york he will be seized parted
lrom his wifean estimable woman whom he
mimed in this ciiydragged from bis church
and sent to a southern plantation we had
supposed that he had purchased himself and
was tn possession of free papers but it ap
pears that we were mistaken
think of this professors of the religion
of jesus christ members of the church
which he purchased with his blood your
biother christian a minister of the blessed
savior is driven from his pastoral labors and
forced to shelter himself in a foreign land
last under the operation of our laws which
both the political parties are pledging them
telves to maintain he should be doomed to a
life of slavery what must the savior think
of a law or of an article in the constitution
as generally interpreted which delivers up
one of his ministers as a ptey to the op
pressor would the iniquity be gieater it
for rev dr pennington we should substitute
rev dr smng of the same city not at
ail yet what an exclamation of honor would
go forth if dr spring should be forced to flee
the country lor no crime but merely because
the la allowed the editor of the n y ob
server to claim and hold him as property
we read of the barbaious customs of former
ages and thank god that we do not live in
such limes of darkness while there are deeds
transacted under our eyes which are worthy
of the darkest days of rome pagan or papal
we receive persecuted christians from ma
deira and send our own refugees to canada
and great britain we put it to the con
science of every christian do you believe it
would be tight to drag dr pennington back
to slavery  could all the sophistry of youi
political papers or of the n y observer or
ol such divines as drs spencer lord spring
adams and wheaton satisfy your conscience
on that point or make you aid in the deed
but if it would be wrong for you is it not
wrong for any one else f ll it would be an
outrage to use dr pennington thus is it not
equally an outrage to treat any man in the
same way is not the whole fugitive law
wrong then if so will you for any con
nderaion give it your support we trust
not a law that would send our brother
pennington into slavery never proceeded from
god and comes clothed with no divine au
thority will our readers remember this
when they go to the ballot box and will they
be careful to elect only those who are pre
pared so repeal such an iniquitous act
the new york independent adds to ike
above
dr pennington is at present connected
with the thiid presbytery of this city if he
has read the sermons of some of his copres
bytert and brother doctors and the union
safety letters of his former pastor and takes
these as the exponent of christian sen
timent with regard to the fugitive law we
do not wonder that he is afraid to return to
hie church or to pul himself within reach ol
his titled ecclesiastical associates

mr editorl am one of those quiet and
contented individuals that do not trouble
themselves muchbout new projects unless
 am satisfied beyond all doubt that the
proposed change is really a good and neces
sary one consequently  have never up to
the present lime taken a deep and absorbing
interest in the removal of the seat of govern
iment from boston i have often answered
the zealous advocates of a change from boston
to worcester or some other interior town
with the old adage let well alone
but i have passed over to the other side
of the line now boston is not what it used
to be a foul and pestilential atmosphere
has settled down upon the trimeuntain city
the breezes which have blown for eo many
tbsi htiii laws ilv lflfvi v ivw
with the air of freedom but are tainted with
the miasma of slavery she too has bent the
knee to the lords of cotton degenerate sons
bear the names that history and revolution
and liberty have immortalized her princely
merchants of the last century that were
ready to sacrifice their last drop of blood and
their last faithing for the sublime purpose of
resisting oppression and wrong are today a
band of servile slavecatchers ready to obey
the first nod of their southern masters and
they have finally published their infamuus
treason to the great principles of freedom and
the rights of man by one public act that over
shadows ail others and heralds to the world
their incomparable infamy the municipal
officers of boston have refused to open
faneuil hall for the free dlcussion of the
fugitive slave bill  shall not blame any
man for his incredulity that indignantly pro
nounces the statement an impossibilitya
malicious lie i own that i did not belive it
when  first read the news in the public
journals and it was only after i had seen ac
cumulated evidence of the fact that  reluc
intly admitted its truth freedom throttled
at the very threshold ot her holiest sanctuary
the right of free discussion strangled upon a
spot more memorable than the tenniscourt
of versailles where the undaunted french
deputies assembled in  after the doors
of their hall had been closed against them by
royal authority and swore never to separate
till they had given a constitution to france
a spot more celebrated than the tellsplatto
in switzerland where the heroic tell landed
and ahoved the tyrant gessler off into the
raging lake more renowned than the
heights of rutti where the swiss con
federates swore to deliver their country
second in the hearts ot every true lover of
freedom not even to the consecrated edifice
from which the declaration of american in
dependence was promulgated to the world
faneui hall closed against what not
against any set of men who may wish to dis
cuss the tarff and inquire whether iron and
broadcloth silk and wines shall pay a higher
or a lower duty not against any who
propose another united stales bank ot who
oppose such a measure not against any
who are the advocates of a railroad to halifax
or san francisco or another line of steam
ers or a shorter cut by water to china not
against the toadies of any leading politician
who may wish to assemble within the holy
edifice to feast make speeches and get drunk
for his honor and their own gratification not
even against those who sustain the fugitive
slave bill but simply against the people
ot massachusetts who claim the right of
peaceably assembling there to discuss and
take measures to repeal the most infamous j
law that has disgraced the statute books of
the federal government since the formation ol
the constitution
how the nicholases and hapsburgs and
bourbons the haynaus and metterniches
and hadetzkeys and the whole spawn of
tyrants big and little upon the other side of
the water will chuckle with delight and
hug the comfort and consolation to their
breasts as they read in the public journals
that the authorities of boston have sealed up
the doors of their temple of liberty against
the right of the people to discuss any law i
and especially the very one that most of them j
would never dare to incur the odium of en
acting and promulgating
the atmosphere of boston has become too
foul for wholesome and salutary legislation
 am persuaded that those who have become
so callous to all decency as to defend an act
of legislation so immural and outrageous as
the fugi ive slave bill and shut up faneuil
hall against free speech would npt hesitate
to cajole and bribe those who are set to frame
laws and cairy out the wishes of a majority
of the people we are no longer safe with
such a den of iniquity for our seat of govern
ment it is time to be up and moving in this
mailer before our code of laws bears evidence
of the coiruftion in the midst of winch our
legislators exercised their functions circulate
the petitions fora changel care not to what
spot that is removed from the baneful in
fluences of commerce and every honest citi
zen in the interior will speedily comprehend
its necessity and second the effort

convention at chicago
at the christian antislavery convention
held at cincinnati may  the under
signed were appointed a committee to hold
under consideiauon the general subject of
christian action against slavery and other
palpable wrongs tolerated in and by the
church and were empowered to call another
convention at such time and place as shall be
deemed proper since the time ot our meet
ing in cincinnati we have watched with
great interest the influence which the pro
ceedings of that assembly have been exerting
upon the public mind and we feel great plea
sure in being able to state as the opinion of
the committee that the hopes of the friends
of that convention have been more than real
ized in the salutary and wide spread impres
sions which have been made from that
mee inp and various other movements which
have followed as its consequences truth has
gone forth to reach and arouse thousands of
minds and the result is a preparation far and
wide for a more extensive union of the friends
of our cause and for more important action
the new combination of parties in which
interests the most diverse are allied against
freedom the melancholy subserviency of a
large portion of the church to secular dicta
tion the attempt in church and state to
strike down the great principle of protestant
ismthe rght of private judgment the at
tempt which the slave power is making to
seize upon our territories and even to subvert
the constitution of california efforts which
if successful will exclude freedom and a free
gospel from all these vast regions of our com
mon epunirv these thinps constrain us to be
lieve that the time nas couie lor renewed and
more strenuous effort
we believe that a reform in the sentiments
and policy of the church is indispensable to
the preservation even of the liberties of the
country and that protestantism itself is en
dangered by its alliance with slavery and its
teachings in defence of its position teachings
which allow the sanctions of the religion ol
jesus to manifest and acknowled wrong
feeling that in and through christ alone
any effort for church reform can be success
ful hoping and praying that the guidance ol
the holy spirit may be granted unto all who
may engage in the work we invie our lel
lowchristians of all denominations to meet at
chicago on the d day of july next for the
piyposeof carrying forwaid what has been
so auspiciously begun by deliberating upon
the most suitable methods fur uniting and

webster at annapolis
the telegraphic speech of daniel webster
at annapolis was bad enough but the fuller
report which comes by mail in the new york
papers completes the treachery of the bribed
secretary with a contemptible whine
characteristic of the hyjocrite he spurns the
state which warmed him into lifeand for
what for throwing the shield of law be
tween the personal liberty of the citizen and
the avarice of the slaveholderfoi refusing to
participate in a crime this is the very man
who as senator drew up a fugitive slave
bill preserving the right of trial by jury
we put his infamy on record by an extract
from his speech as most fully reported
gentlemen  concur in the sentiments
expressed by you alland i thank god they
were expressed by you allin the resolutions
passed heie on the th of december you
say that the constitution of the united slates
has accomplished all the objects civil and po
litical which the most sanguine of its fra
mers and fiiends anticipated and that the af
fections of the people of maryland are justly
rivetted to its principles by the memory of the
characters of the wise and good men who
frmed it as well as by the blessings they lib
erally bestow throughout the world that is
my sentiment my heart is in it ap
plause
i live and breathe i walk and sleepl had
almost said i pray to god daily in the verv
sentiment of that relation now you go on to
assert a sentiment equally just you say that
a proper appreciation of these blessings would
lead every slate in the union to adopt all
such measures as may from time to time be
necessary to give complete and full effect to
any provision of the constitution or the laws
pursuant thereto intended for the protection
of any part of this great common country
true every word true and allow me to
say that any state north or south which
departs one iota from the sentiment of that
 resolution is disloyal to the union great
applause
further so far as any act of that sort has
been committed such a stale has no portion
of my regard ido not sympathize with it
 rebuke it wherever i speak and on all occa
sions where it is proper for me toexpress my
sentiments if there are statesand lam
afraid there arewhich have sought by inge
nious contrivances of state legislators to
thwart the fair exercise and fulfilment of the
laws of congress passed to carry into effect
the compacts of the constitution that state
so far is entitled to no regard from me
we have here placed in italics the most
deliberate and shameful insult to the free
states which was ever ventured by one of
their too numerous recreants it needs no
comment it is an insult founded on a lie

their report it consists of thiileen sections
and is too long perhaps for you to print en

on the fugitive slave law should at least

sonal liberty applicable to the fugitive
law of  the second section forbids any
officer or other member of the volunteer mili

of the united slates in the arrest and detec

offender in this matter is made liable to the
penalty provided for in the act of  by
section third any corps of volunteer milita
acting at the call of a marshal for the arrest
ol an alleged slave is to be disbanded and
any officer so acting is to be upon conviction

it the duty of district attorneys to act

sixth maintain an action before any compe

right of habeas corpus and trial by jury and
make the decision of such jury conclusive and
final there are other points designed chiefly
in guard and fortify those already named
such is the reported act in addition to an

i a meeting was held yesterday afternoon in
this place by the locofocos of essex county
for the purpose of giving hon robert ran
toul jr an opportunity to define his position
since his return from the u s senate he
rpoke an hour and fortyfive minutes and he
bead the following resolutions as containing
his views on the slavery question at the
close of the meeting he was unanimously
nominated as the locofoco candidate for the
representation of essex county in congress
the following are the resolutions read by
the honorable gentleman after having ad
dressed the meeting
resolved that the constitution of the
united states has not conferred upon con
gress the pow er to enact any law authorizing
officers of the united states to determine the
slavery or freedom of persons found within
the territory of any state and to carry them
out of the state wherein they are found to be
held as slaves in another state
resolved that no person in any state of
this union can be lawfully deprived of his
liberty without due process of law which
process in the case of an alleged fugitive from
service is a suit at common law wherein the
fact whether said fugitive was lawfully held
to service in the slate ftom which he is
alleged to have escaped shall be determined
by a trial by jury
resolved that such trial by jury should
precede the delivery into the hand of the parly i
claiming him of such alleged fugitive and
should be had in the vicinity where thealleged i
fugitive is round
resolved that in the determination of the
question of liberty all presumptionof law and
fact are and ought to be in favor of liberty
resolved that the fugitive slave law
enacted by the congress late expiied contra
vening these principles is unjust unconstitu i
lional and in derogation of the fundamental i
maxims of the government and ought to be
speedily and forever repaled i

to her home amid the shouts and songs and
rejoicing of hundreds who surrounded the

slaveholders are an ostentatious professsur of
religion the master said in his examination
that he knew the prisoner by her general ap

off because he was converted to religion the
year before and had placed the date in his

miraculously rapid as the creation ol
thought itself and as our material
knowledge is growing our ideas expand
unc  our comprehension of the great
truths of liberty equality and tolera
tion becomes more clear and compre
hensive such is the character and
such is the tendency of our times and
yet even nowprominent amidst the
institutions of the freest of modern free
statesis there existing an anomaly
of such an inconceivable intensity and
grossness as the world never before
beheld
the great confederated republic ol
north america claims to be the most
thoroughly free nation on the face ol
the globe and surely it is there
that the great principle of equality ii
most completely realized the peo
ple are the sovereign powerby grace
of god the rulers and the masterrf
and the poorest man and the richest
have equal share in the control and
government of the commonwealth
there alone amongst all the nations
does the white man appear to possess
the fullest enjoyment of jivil freedom
that has yet been found attainable in a
civilized community there all arbi
trary distinctions of class are trampled
under foot and no marks are known
but those of personal merit and fortune
by which one man may raise himsell
above the other all are equally free
all equally enjoy the privileged ol
citizensall are fellows all are
brothers amongst whom no one pos
sesses the special privileges of political
primogeniture
yet in this very nation it is that the
eye of the christian and the philanthro
pist is offended by the unconcealed
existence of a press and offensive mon
strosity in this free state flourishes
in unreproved boldness a system that
has deeph polluted and corrupted the
social morality of the people a loath
some sore on the fair bosom of the
commonwealth a dark stain on the
proud banner of the nation a desperate
disgrace a loudtongued reproach on
the selfeulogistic enlightenment of the
community yes it is a humiliating
truth to be handed down to future ages
that in the very heart ol the united
states of north america which noisily
boast of their power their progress
and their unparalleled freedom still
flourishes in all its disgusting gross
ness the disgraceful and damning in
stitution of human slavery
how terribly humiliating to human
pride is this sad fact just think of it
svheu in another and a still more ad
vanced stage of the worlds progress
the student of history reads that in a
day gone by when men loudly vaunted
of the blessing of freedom human
beings still trafficked in the lives and
labor of their fellows and beings with
the likeness of their creator stamped
upon them no matter in how dark a
mouldwere bought and sold in the
public markets like horses cows or
sheep where shall he turn for the
illustration of so marvellous a story
is it amongst the wild steppe of bar
baric russia where the will of an indi
vidual is the irrevocable law for mil
lions or is it beneath the dark
degrading anu oppressive despotism of
the mottled empire of the austrian
kaiser nohe must sweep across
the waters of tho wide atlantic and in
that western clime which has before
an assenting world styled itself tbe
refuge of libertythe home of the
freemust he search lor tbe reali
zation of a story so incredible
it is now gome twenty years since
england inspired with a noble real
destroyed at one blow the slavery
system in her possessions and lavished
a vast amount of treasure in its extinc
tion and it is now tbe glorious boast
of englishmen thatno matter what
be his color or bis climeas soon as
the slave plants his foot upon the sacred
oil of britain the fetters of servitude
drop from his emancipated limbs but
america the child of british liberty
who boasts that she has far surpassed
her parent in the development of free
dom still retains the loathsome burden
that the healthier mind of england had
flung away for ever and at this hour
flowing through every channel of the
social system tainting and corrupting
the whole body the effects of that
moral cowardice which shrunk from the
generosity of raising the black man to
a level with his white brethren work
with undiminished force we need
not point to the facts which will be
found detailed elsewhere as proof
more telling evidence is found in the
degradation even in those states where
slavery is banned of the free colored
citizen he is the pariah of american
lifeshunned as the leper scoffed at
beaten degraded and the tinge of his
blood coloring the whitest skin is
more fatal in that free land than the
plague spot on the victim s cheek the
gentleness and loveliness of women are
no safeguards against insult where
the faintest trace of negro blood is ever
suspectededucation intellect the
might of genius itself cannot atone for
it in the eyes of the free and enlight
ened citizens of george washingtons
free republic
an example of the intensity with
which this base and demoralizing spirit
has become leavened in american
society was exhibited in a very remark
able manner in boston some time ago
a negroa man of talent and educa
tion and a man of true gentlemanly
refinement too that might put to the
blush even the impudence of an ame
rican free citizenwas walking in
the open day down a public street
with a white lady leaning on cither
r arm two individuals in the garb ol
gentlemen who happened to pass at
the time were filled with indignation
and astonishmant at so insolent a dis
play on the part of a damned nigger
they stalked up and requesting the
f ladies to quit the society of their
il black companion proceeded to beat
t with their sticks the unarmed and un
e offending man this display of ame
i rican independence was loudly ap
i plauded by the public press and the
e two fellows instead of being denounced
i as scoundrels worthy of the pillory or
c the stocks received a high eulogium
o for their behaviour this in a chris
e tian country this in a land claiming
a to possess the highest degree of civil
o freedom for all its children surely
i we must grieve for the society that
o nourishes so fearfully degrading a spirit
if but in defence of america it it
s said that human slavery is one of the
if evils she has inherited from her euro
d pean colonizers and that it is one
i whose removal in her present condi
lt tion she finds it especially difficult tc
t accomplish the excuse is a poor
i pitiful fallacy the difficulty is not in
d the system itself but alas in the gen
d eral tone of society which has
e been with all its idle parade of lib
e erality educated into the approval ol
t the vicious slave system and the un
d christian contempt and loathing of one
e great section of their fellowmen thai
this is only the simple truththat the
if fault lies with america herself nol
it with her difficultiesis proved b
if the conduct of her legislature which
e but a short time since strengthened
the hands of the slaveholders by pass
ing a bill enabling them to recovei
e from any part of the united states sucf
wretches as may have succeeded in es
t caping from slaverya bill by which
j the man who may have gained hit

years ago maythough he should

n petence and safety and reared up a
i family around him with all the associa
tions of home making his freedom s
j thousandfold more dear be dragged
i back again to all the horrors of the
slavecell the fetter and the whip
f the evil results of this perniciouc
j i enactment are illustrated by the ac
f counts which we give elsewhere ol
the recent riots in boston aq or
ganized system of raistnoo is opposed
i to the carrying out of the bill by that
portion of the population whose abhor
rence of the slavetrade is greater than
their respect for human enactments
i every effort is made to baffle the at
tempts of the emissaries of the slave
holders to recover the fugitives and in
t more than one case where skill in out
i witting them failed open force was
resorted to and the poor wretches who
t had been arrested were rescued by
violent means of course in no state
can a violation of its laws be suffered
to go with impunity when an enact
ment comes into force it must be main
tained or the government of the coun
try will fall into contempt and the
danger of anarchy be risked by the
nation the american government
has accordingly been obliged to take
proceedings against the benevolent
violators of its recently enacted law
and in this nineteenth century in a
free community we are shocked with
the appearance of a proclamation from
the authorities calling on the citizens
to aid in the prosecuting of all who
may have rescued a fugitive slave
or have harbored or concealed such
fugitive contrary to law how de
graded is the proud starspangled ban
ner of that nation whose government
has voluntarily converted itself intoa
hunter of human slaves
it is terrible disgrace branded on
the brow of america this traffic in
human beings vaunt she ever so
muchhold she her head ever so high
she dare not in the opinion oi

other great powers whilst the curse
of slavery flourishes within her em

graded before the world it is no
excuse to say that but in a portion oi
the country this evil exists it matters
notthe stain rests equally on the
whole confederation from florida to
massachusettsthe brand is legibly
stamped on the government that has
made itself the tool and defender of the
slaveholders and it is no answer to
say that this slavecurse is more offen
sive in sentiment than in realityeven
were this true that the black is
generally not illtreated gods image
is degraded to tbe level of the beast
and a living crime against humanity
blights the morality of tbe land wbat
man in whose breast all the fine feel
ings of our nature are not extinct does
not detest and execrate a system so
frightfuly destructive of morality and
natural affection that under it the
father has been known to barter for
gold the children of his slavethe illicit
offspring of his own body in a con
dition of society where such a thing
could even once occur there is some
thing fearfully revolting and that such
a condition of society should bt pre
served in a state boasting of its un
paralleled freedom and advancing
enlightenment is an anomaly whose
solution can be found only in the de
pravity to which the human heart is so
prone this is the curse of america
today this is the evil that paralyzes
her moral strength and degrades her
people and until she can fling the
incubus off she cannot proceed on that

suggests that each section of the re
ligious world of great britain aiid
ireland should send a friendly remon
strance to those churches of the united
states with which they sympathize in
doctrine and discipline upon their re
sponsibilities their duties and their
dangers in relation to slavery that
the american clergy stand in need of
remonstrance cannot be denied as
our contemporary remarks the con
duct of the clergy in the the free states
has always been the reflection of the
public opinion upon that subject whe
ther for right or for wrong they have
followed but have not led the national
sentiment as the public have felt
the pulpit has spoken in the earlier
period of their republic while the
people were warm with the achieve
ment of their own freedom the
churches strongly protested agains
the continuance of slavery in the
southern states some of the resolu
i tions passed in the years to  to
i  by synods conferences and
general assemblies of congregation
alists presbyterians and methodists
speak of slaveholders as man
stealers as sinners of the first
i rank as perpetrators of the highest
kind of theft but in process of time
public opinion altered as the free
states became commercially and politi
i cally interwoven with slavery and the
slave power the churches were found
echoing the general feeling against in
terfering with the peculiar institution
of the south the protestant episco
i pal church has not shown the incon
sistency which marked the course ol
i the other religious organizations of the
united states it never evinced any
i sympathy with the slave and boasts o
not having been disturbed by the anti
slavery agitation several of theii
churches are under colored ministers
of great talent and unquestioned in
t tegrity but the episcopal conventior
i hss steadily refused to admit them ink
its body
rev dr parker of philadelphia
said in a recent thanksgiving sermon
i that there were no evils in slavery
but such as were inseparable from any
other relation in civil and social life
i the rev gardiner spring a popular
and fashionable presbyterian ministei
ol new york and well known in this
i country by his religious writings lately
proclaimed rom the pulpit that god
for the last  years fixed his brand
upon the negro that he would not fight
against god and that if by he prayei
he could liberate every slave in the
world he would not dare to offer it
the rev moses stuart dd late
professor at the theological seminary
at andover printed a pamphlet during
the discussion of the fugitive slave
bill justifying slavery from the bible
and passing the highest panegyrics upon
mr webster the rev orville
dewey dd has just declared at a
public lecture while vindicating the
obnoxious law that he would rathet
send his own mother into slavery and
go himself than see the union between
the free and slaveholding states dis
solved with such clerical endorse
ments of the unchristian enactments ol
this bill the antislavery papers at th
present moment abound human
beings remarks the advertiser are
sold without any attempt at disguise
by the ecclesiastical bodies of the
united states to support theological
seminaries and places of worship
synods and assemblies of divines have
formally declared that the marriage
tie between slaves is not binding
this atrocious decision has evidently
no other object than to facilitate their
separation by sale
meanwhile there are brave god
fearing men who through scorn and
obloquy lift up their voices against
this great wickedness the calumniated
abolitionists strive night and day to
open the eyes of the people and the
clergy too to the crime to which they
are privy
in a recent debate in the house of
representatives at washington the
hon joshua r giddings in referring
to the late fugitive slave bill made
the following comparison between
professor webster who was executed
last august at boston and the hon
daniel webstei secretary ot state
sir i was about to make some
comparisons but perhaps they may be
regarded as indelicate during last
summer two distinguished gentlemen of
the name occupied much of the public
attention one was said to have com
mitted murder and the other to have
procured the passage of this law one
was hanged for his crime the other
for his efforts was taken iuto the exe
cutive cabinet one destroyed the
life of an individual the other contri
buted his efforts for the passage of this
law which must consign hundreds
perhaps thousands to premature
graves i sir cannot speak for others
but for myself i would rather meet
my final judge with the guilt of him
who hoe gone to his account than o
him who now sits in yonder cabinet
language such as this used at so
early a period of the congrtssiona
sessions gives little color to the asser
tion of the political press of the united
states and reiterated by the cor
respondent of the times that the
agitation upon this fearful law is sub
siding mr giddings would not have
ventured to give solemn utterance to
such a sentiment had he not believed
that the conscience of his country was
not become totally callous nor with
out the conviction of being supported
by a large amount of public opinion
while asserting that there was a law
of right of justice of freedom im
planted in the breast of every human
being which bade him look with
scorn on such a law as this would he
have concluded his address by exclaim
ingthe spirit of the pilgrim
fathers which was manifested at
bunkershill at saratoga ard at
yorktown still exists in the north
the same spirit which resisted the
stamp act will resist your fugitive
slave bill the spirit which threw the
tea into boston harbor will set your
infamous law at defiance the spirit
ftiich overthrew the power of the
british crown will submit to no force
that shall compel it to comply with the
odious provisions of this enactment
miscellaneous
english women in the
country
there are other guests in the house
sir charles m lady p some
irish ladies without titles but so rich
in natural gifts as to make one feel the
poverty of mere rank and a charming
family of grown up daughters it would
be difficult perhaps to have a better
opportunity to judge of the life of the
educated middle class of this country
than in such homes as this and what
impression do such examples make
upon my inind you will ask i will
tell yon not without remembering
how many fair young readers you have
at home the young english woman
i  less conspicuously accomplished than
our young wotneu of the same position
in america there is perhaps a
little less of that je ne scais quoi that
nameless grace which captivates at
first sightthan with us but a better
and more solid education more dis
ciplined minds and above all more
common sense in the whole art o
conversation including ail the topics
of the day with so much of politics as
makes a woman really a companion
for an intelligent man in his serious
thoughts in history language and
practical knowledge of the duties ol
social and domestic life the english
women have i imagine few superiors
but whet perhaps would strike one ol
our young women most in english so
ciety would be tho thorough cultiva
tion und refinement that exist here
along with the absence of all false
delicacy the fondness of english
women even in the highest rank foi
out of door life horses dogs fine cat
tle animals of all kindsfor theii
grounds and in short everything that
belongs to their homestheir real un
affected knowledge of and pleasure ir
these things and the unreserved wa
in which they talk about them would
startle some of my young friends ai

young members of the family here thii
morning in an exploration of the mys
teries of the place no sooner did wc
make our appearance out doors
than we were saluted by dogs of al
degrees and each had the honor of ar
interview and personal reception
which seemed to be productive ol
pleasure on both sides then some o
the horses were brought out of the
stable and a parley took place betweer
them and their fair mistresses som
favorite cows were to be petted ane

were descanted on with knowledge am

discussed and shown with such lively
unaffected interest that i soon saw m 
fair companions were born to lov

nothing about the garden because yoi
know that it is especially the ladyi

with no tase for gardening would b
as great a marvel as an angel withou

may dictate and yet many of my
young countrywomen of their age
whose educationwholly intended for
the drawingroomis far below that 
have described would have fainted
with terror and halfblushed with false
delicacy twenty times in the course of
the morning with the discussions of
the farmyard meadows and stables
which properly belong to a wholesome
country life and which are not in the
slightest degree at variance with real
delicacy and refinement i very well
knew that there are many sensibly edu
cated young women at home who have
the same breadth of cultivation and
the same variety of resources that
make the english women such truly
agreeable companions but alas i also
know that there are many whose beau
ideal is bounded by a circle that con
