f mr remond said that in prcaeoting
thii resolution he would preface it with
a single remark and that was this that
lie hoped that every person present
would be free to take part inthediscus
 sions of the convention and would fur
ther cheerfully suggest the utility ol
every one participating in the same and
that there may not be any impediment
in the way of any gentleman or
i who rnav desire to address the meeting
s would most respectfjlly recommend
 that a general invitation be extended to
all who may favor the convention with

the following gentlemen were offered
and elected to constitute the committee
on rolldr i j peck allen m

the committee then entered
their business arj returned the names
of all the males ami females who were
members of the convention
the following resolutions were pre
sented and read through the business
committee anti adopted by the con
vention to wit
i resolved that the american
churches by endorsing the christiani
ty of slaveholdersby extending to them
the right hand of fellowshipby shutting
their doors against the cries ot the
slavesby remaining indifferent to his
wrongs by picking haws in the reli
gious creeds of antislavery menby
joining in the slaveholding charge of
infidelity against the slaves advocates
and by proscribing the colored man at
j the communion table have placed
themselves in the line ot positive hos
tility to the antislavery movement and
the deadliest enemies of the long im
bruted and perishing slave
d resolved that in the unholy sys
tem of american slavery we behold a
skillful subversion of all human rights
a bold and blasphemous attempt to blot
out the distinction broadly marked by
the finger of god between men and
tilings between persons and property
a warfare against human responsibility
a warfare against all the principles and
i maxims of human justice a plain viola
tion of all the commands in the deca
loguc comprehending in its essential
principles the destruction of marriage
parental and family duties and clearly
involving the crimes oftheft robbery
adultery and murder and is therefore
j the broadest foulest and bloodiest curse
that was ever inflicted on the family of
man
 resolved that wc offer unto the
most high our devoted thanks for the
large measure of success which has
followed and crowned the humble la
bors of the friends of human freedom
up to this period and that we solemnly
pledge ourselves to more faithful earnj
est and persevering efforts to overthrow
slavery and to promote the moral and j
social elevation of our people than has
heretofore characterized us
 resolved that a committee of
five be appointed to draft an address to
the citizens of the city and county of
philadelphia the following named
gentlemen were appointed that commit
i teerev h h garnet rev g
galbraith rev v t catto dr j j
g bias and dr  j peck
resolved that slavery exists in
i this country because the people will its
existence and can only be overthrown
by changing the national will there
fore resolved that by adopting the
language of the illustrious oconnell
ve will agitate agitate agitate
until the people will be changed and
our rights and liberties are restored
 resolved that a genuine love of
liberty is the highest native impulse im
planted by deity on the native soul it
is older than organizations or institu
tion and is not dependent on them for
existence
i s resolved that the true mission
of institutions in the world is to give
i support and sustenance to this heaven
born principle and they cease to be
useful when they have abandoned this
the first and greatest of all public vir
tues
 resolved that whatever confers
popularity and respect upon slavehold
ers serves to increase the popularity of
slavery and this serves to shield it
from attack and consequent destruc
tion
 resolved that of all opposition
which is arrayed against us that which
emanates from our own class of the hu
man family is the most grevious and de
plorable inasmuch as that opposition is
not only cruel and wicked but unex
pected and unnatural
 resolved that the greatest in
sult that can be offered to a cause is to
shut the doors of the church against its
advocates
i resolved that the conduct of
the rev stephen gloster in presenting
to the mind of the rev h h garnet
a strong probability that the doors of
his church would be opeued for
slavery meetings and thereby seducing
that gentleman into his pulpit on sab
bath morning last that said gloster has
thus added another evidence of his pro
slavery and dishonest character
id resolved that as a means the
better to embody and to concentrate the
energies of those who favor the cause
of immediate emancipation and the
moral social and mental elevation of
the oppressed we recommend at once
the formation ot an association in this
place the object of which shall be to
support the north star published at
rochester raise funds and employ
suitable lecturers
 resolved that a committee of
five be uow appointed by tins conven
tion to prepare a constitution for the
association proposed in the foregoing
resolution
 resolved that this convention
recommend to the ministers of the dif
ferent colored congregation in this
city that they take up a collection at
right is of no sextruth is of no color god is the father of us all and all we are brethren
their earlet convenience forthebede
fitof the north star and that a com
mittee of three consisting of rev wm
douglass j j g bias and m w
gibbs be appointed to inform the pas
tors of the several churches of this re
quest
resolution  was read and unani
mously adopted without discussion
resolution  came next under con
sideration mr f douglass spoke
eloquently upon the resolution calling
upon the professing christians of this
country to cov ider weii their connex
ion with the churches and ponder well
their position lest they may be found
fraternizing with slaveholders he re
buked in a cutting and sarcastic man
ner those individuals who would attach
jgename of infidel to hmself or any of
his antisfvery coagues as uttering
a slander for the purpose of paralyzing
the cause of reform now rapidly pro
gressing among our colored friends
rev h h garnet followed our friend
douglass and made a powerful and ef
fective appeal to the common sense of
the people as holding any longer a
proslavery connexion in their church
es he called upon all men to unite
with the slaves friends in breaking
every link which would connect the two
contending parties m r deluny
made a few remarks and closed by
calling the attention of the people to
those churches that have closed their
doors against the antislavery cause
mr isaiah ware and john c bow
ers came forward and requested to be
heardeach in turn took the stand in
opposition
resolutions   g   
were read and adopted without discus
sion
resolution  was commented upon
by f douglass and other gentlemen
in the midst of mr douglass remarks
mr worthington one of mr glnsters
elders arose and said that mr garnet
had a note in his possession in answer
to the one sent by mr garnet asking
for the use of the church and that what
mr douglass was then saying was not
so and would therefore say that he
was uttering a falsehood mr doug
lass yielded the floor for mr worth
ington to proceed wjiifli not being ac
cepted mr bowers fnoved to lay the
resolution on the table untii mr gar
net shall he present carried
resolutions i    passed
without opposition
mr garnet having arrived the note
was called for and read when the house
decided that the remarks of mr f
douglass were strictly true ana that
the note was but another deception

the committee appointed to prepare
ttie address reported as follows
address from the antislavery convention
assembled in the brick sley church oct
j and id  to iho coorcd citizens
of the city and county of philadelphia
the undersigned committee ap
pointed by a convention of your fellow
citizens of this city and county to ad
dress you upon matters appertaining to
our general interests take pleasure in
the performance of the duty we so
licit your patience and impartial atten
tion to the things which we respecifully
i suggest that ou may be fully qualified
to judge of the worth and character of
the principles which we shall advance
and which we trust will commend
themselves to your hearts and secure
your systematic cooperation
if we should present our subject to
you in a single sentence we should say
equality brotherly love and liberty
to all men this is our theme
a union of sentiment and mutual co
j operation upon questions of general in
terests is indispensable to our success
in our onward career in the cause ot
freedom the same power that gives
our foes success in an unholy warfare
upon human rights will be far more
potent in our huuds whenever we arm
ourselves in a righteous cause slave
holders and their supporters appreciate
the old adage in union there is
strength shall we value this great
power less than they we most sin
cerely hope that the future history of
this people will prove that we do uot
the rain from the clouds tails in single
drops to the earth and swells the re
sistless streams that sweep onward to
the ocean the condensation of steam
gives velocity to complicated machi
nery and a union of kindred hearts
trusting in god is the power in his
hands by which he sways and governs
the moral world we therefore exhort
you to love and cherish union of action
among yourselves on the question
which are equally important to us all
by being united ourselves we can
break the union of slaveholders their
bond of uniou is slavery and is formed
in helllet ours be composed of peace
love mercy and freedom and it will
be blessed of heaven and will strength
en through all time and will be reful
gent with glory in all eternity
are you counected with the gory in
stitution of slavery in your ecclesiasti
cal relations are you a presbyterian
a baptist an episcopaliana meth
odist or of any other religious body
that is in union with slaveholders if
so we entreat you to alter that relatioo
forsake these murderers and destroy
ers of your people and let the world
know why you do it thus will you
cleanse your hands of blood and record
on the book of life your condemnation
of the accursed system of slavery
we believe your consciences on tfeii
matter are rightfollow we beseech
you the convictions of your con
science
rochester n y friday november  
come out from among these men
stealers and menslayers they live
and reign upon the broken hearts and
prostrated liberties of yoor brothers
 and sisters parents children bus
bands and wives sighs mingle with
the chiming of bells and groans are
the deep bass of the organs of those
synagogues of satan and dens of
thieves they use the sacred bible to
sustain these enormities and from their
pulpits and down their aisles the voice
of your brothers blood louder than
that of the murflered abel cries
come out of her and be ye sepa
rated
we ask you not to give up your faith
but we pray you to draw a line between
slavery and freedom and be ye on the
side of god by so doing nothing
will be lost but everything will be
gained both in a temporal and spiritual
point of view above all you will gain
the peace of a clear conscience and
the approbation of jehovah come
out o come out from among them
now that you are among them they
trade in the souls of your fell jwnien
what more could you do were you se
parate from them if you sympathize
with them then you are as guilty as
they if you are opposed to their ini
quity why do you continue to struggle
against your better judgment and re
main with them
by enlightened politicians throughout
the civilized world slavery has been
pronounced a curse to man and a sin
against god it has been pursued by
the avenging sword of the almighty
from land to land on this continent it
is confined to the united states and
braziland there it is trembling be
tween the fierce fires of freedom that
are closing upon it from the north and
the distant south it cries for help
and pleads for its life as the flames roll
on and now we call upon you to look
and see from whence it receives suc
cor whither does it flee for a final
refuge it leaps in among the priest
hood and shelters itself behind their
altars in the words of james g bir
ney the american church is the
bulwark of slavery in the language
of the rev albert barnes if there
was no slavery in the church there is
no power that could keep it in exist
ence a single day do we charge the
truth home upon your minds in the
presbyterian church slavery has its
advocates in the persons of chftrlcs c
jones of south carolina william s
plumer of maryland and joel parker
of philadelphia the episcopalians
have their bishops meads and polka
and aliens win h barnwell south
carolina the methodists have their
soules and bascoms and the baptists
theif davis and fullerthese and oth
ers rule the churches in favor of the
devil they take the bible and shield
the abominable system of slavery which
embraces robbery theft idolatry sab
bathbreaking murder adultery rape
and defiance to god these men had
long ago deluged the world with infi
delity and drowned the last hope of
justice had not instinct been superior
to reason and conscience the sovereign
of argument thank god that con
science and instinct reign triumphantly
aud that there is hope for mankind
beloved friends remember what is
the foundation of christianity it is
this that you do unto others the
things that ye would that others should
do unto you pure religion and
undefiled before god and the father is
this that ye visit the widows and the
fatherless in their afflictions and that
ye keep yourselves unspotted from the
world we are to recognize our
selves in the persons of our enslaved
fellow men
the committee would entreat their
brethren henceforth to exclude slave
holders and their apologists from their
pulpits to withdraw their support from
the american board of foreign mis
sions and bible and the tract socie
ties all of which in this country are
j proslavery and use your pecuniary
means for the promotion of your reli
gious institutions which are clear ol
bloodguiltiness
we advise christians of the various
orders whose connections are pro
i slavery to meet together immediately
i and draw a line not of complexion but
principle and declare their independ
ence all this can be done and your
former faith and order retained if they
are valuable to you but we believe
tiiat just in proportion as the hearts ol
men are influenced by the spirit ol the
gospel the teachings and discipline ol
the bible will supersede the dogmas ol
men and christians in a given com
munity will be regarded as the church
of that community press on in the
good way and do and speak the truth
the truth in love

pdmund esqdear sir
some weeks ago while m boston i
received a donation from a friend ot
humanity who desired of me informa
tion through the liberator respecting
the stored population of canada west
i u wj the promise of information
sk n r equally ghfy her 
proceed without further apology to
g the colored population of canada
l twn v a non sly estimatedat from
au
laws here know no man by the color ol
his skin there has never been a distinct
census taken of them i think the
number woold all a little short of 
 some having emigrated to the
west indies and many returned to the
northern states where they are com
paratively safe though not constitu
tionally so as an asylum for the fu
gitive slave canada yvest is a desira
ble country much more so than is gen
erally supposed the climate is mild
and salubrious the soil is unusually
fertile and productive and bountifully
rewards the hand of industry the fu
gitive having been accustomed to toil
in the south can if industrious sub
sist here comfortably if lazy he will
suffer and ought to die for he that
will not work neither should he eat
and jailing to eat he will surely die
 has never yet however attended the
funeral of one who died of starvation
in canada nor ever heard of such an
instance as among the white inhabit
ants some are more industrious and
consequently more comfortable and
prosperous than others recently
there has been a marked decrease in
the emigration to this country from the
house of bondage for the reason
that civilization is increasing in the
northern states and many are stopping
by the tray should barbarism entirely
disappear from the north and the gold
en rule of christianity which is loudly
professed become the governing prin
ciple the fugitive slave would no longer
be complied to fly naked and desolate i
to the realms of victoria for liberty
and protection i have the pleasure of
saying that fugitive slaves are now bet
ter furnished with the means of comfort
on their way than formerly hence
their necessities arc not so great after
they get here
what they most need is instruction
as they generally come into canada
deplorably ignorant of letters at
three different points they are receiving
instruction viz amhersthurg twenty
miles below detroit at dawn sixty
miles from detroit and twenty from the
st clair river and at the queens
bush fifty miles northwest of the head
of lake ontario at these points the
gospel is preached regularly education j
promoted and clothing boohs c
distributed among the destitute at
amherstburgh isaac j rice and his
wife formerly from northern ohio and
miss armeda gibbs of boston are la
boring with becoming zeal fugitives
more frequently reach that point than
any other in canada at queens
bush where the settlement is large
john s brooks formerly lron massa
chusetts and his wife from bloomfield
me are laboring with christian forti
tude and fidelity in peculiarly trying
circutrftetanccs also elias e kirk
laud and his wife who previously to
 spent two years in dawn bro i

happy to learn that the weslcyans at

him at dawn t e writer of this is on 
hand serving as a missionary local
and at large endeavoring to do his du
tv aided by his wife and mrs loranna
parker the latter from oneida county
n y she has for several years had
the charge of the juvenile school a
better than which is not to be found in
this part of canada number of scho
lars  she required a new school
house and might have  to  scho
lars the manual labor institute is not
at present in so flourishing a condition
as is desirable it has never accom
plished much in the summer season for
the reason that young men choose to be
out at service in the winter it is usual
ly thronged i here is not so much en
couragement for educating adults as
children and the trustees are more
disposed to attend to the latter and as
soon as practicable to open a depart
ment for the reception and instruction
of orphans between the ages of  and
 years dawn is the only place in
canada where property is held by trus
tees for the advancement of education
here it consists of three hundred acres
of the very best of land at the head of
navigation on a beautiful stream 
acres improvement a few buildings
includin a steam sawmillworth about
 the whole property might be
estimated at about 
here are vast resources undevel
oped by means of which thousands of
colored people might obtain a comfort
able livelihood the place is new and
the population small but rapidly in
creasing a nucleus has been formed
around which great interests rnay yet
cluster this settlement is as it should
be surrounded aal somewhat inter
spersed with white people i have al
ways opposed exclusive settlements
and am equally opposed to exclusive
schools let white and colored peo
ple mingle together and have their
children educated together in the same
schools and the low vulgar prejudices
which prevail would soon disappear a
considerable number of the colored
children of canada have free access to
existing schools in common with white
children this has been brought about
since my efforts commenced among
them one word ia regard to our sup
port we are here serving the cause
of philanthropy as volunteers having
no regular or reliable support guaran
tied us from any source under the
heavens we work under no sectarian
auspices our mission is purely anti
slavery aud if entitled to the confidence
of abolitionists ought to be supported
by them
i have thought proper to state these
facts because many suppose we are
well cared for by the american church
es which is far from being the case or
that an antislavery board called the
american missionary association sus
tains us which is a great mistake the
litter serves only as a channel through
which help comes if particularly desig
nated for our mission or for schools
connected therewith and not otherwise
our receipta through this channel are
gg ssr r
small compared with our necessities
and much of thewtime it is our lot to
suffer these things are perplexing
and ought not so to be i would fur
ther state what i know to be true of
others as well as inyself that we are
obliged after planning wisely econo
mizing closely and working prodi
giously hard w ith our hands much of the
time to maintain our lot ting and continue
our services to sacrifice our own ef
fects or put what li tie worldly sub
stance we have in jeopardy to keep up
credit and enable us to live and fre
quently the poor are suffering while
boxes of clothing intended for their re
lief are wailing at ports for months
subject to charges of freightage which
it is not iu our power to meet such is
the fact at the present time and it is a
shame that it is so  have no appeal
to make having often made them to but
little purpose what little substance 
possess is serving me as the basis of
credit till help shall come from some
source or my labors here terminate
this is a sad picture hut the truth
must be told i may never be heard
from again but would say in conclu
sion that those generous friends who
have sympathized with the forioru fugi
gitive and aided me in my work have
my sincere thanks and best wishes
very respectfully yours

it is signed by frederick douglass
and several other persons douglass
it may be remembered has been in the
newspapers in former days has like
john an buren travelled in kngiand
some years ago and has made himself
notorious in sever ways by his ac
tivity and talents he has been keeping
up the agitation among the colored peo
ple in the north originally he was
a slave in the south but tugk to his
heels one day and somehow made his
escape he is now the great leader of
the colored abolition section of the
north and inay be considered as the
compeer of john van huren the
big gun of the white section of thesamo
party
the manifesto put forth by these col
ored people is quite a curiosity in litera
ture philosophy and shaving in all tho
speeches proceeding from john van
huron that orator generally confines
himself to fhe subject of the exclusion
of slavery from california and the or
ganization oj a party at the north
founded upon sentiments of hostility
towards southern slavery as a political
or social element john appears to be
always remarkably cautious not to give
any encouragement to the abolition of
slavery as it now is in the southern
states but when a party shall have
been once organized upon such senti
ments as he now attempts it will be
very difficult to stop in mid career
and make its supporters be satisfied
with the mere exclusion of slavery in a
remote territory bordering upon tho
shores of the furolf pacific
frederick douglass the leader of tho
other section in the same agitation and
belonging to tho black side of the ques
tion lets the cat out of the bag in
the manifesto it seems that the colored
race at the north are determined here
after to abandon shaving beards black
ing boots and carrying trunks or par
cels their ambition is roused to higher
occupations they talk of mingling
with all the institutions of white soci
ety what ute white institutions tho
institution of marriage is a very im
portant white one in the social scale
and we presume that that is meant as
well as the rest and that the emancipa
tion of the colored races of the south
would not satisfy frederick douglase
and his compatriots without the same
facility being obtained for blacks and
whites to marry and to be given in
marriage together douglass says that
shaving bootblacking and carrying
parcels are nothing better than being
slaves to the community and that they
ought never to relax their agitation
until this species of slavery is abol
ished as firmly as tlyit which exists in
the south
the movements declarations and
singular developments df john vafr
buren and the white abolitionists and
also of frederick douglass and his
colored brethren begin to throw a good
deal of light upon the future progress
and purposes of this party and its vari
ous branches should they obtain an as
cendancy in the north and henceforth
in the union not only will general

this marked period in the history nf the
re public is pawedthe question of the pre

people can settle that question for the coining
four years the contest has been conducted
with great activity and considering the is
sues with great moderation it was a deci
ded improvement in this respect on the eam
patgn of iwo and  and thus far deserves
commendation the result of the election is
yet unknow n no one looks for anything like
a victory for the free democracy in the poli
tical and party sense of that word snd yet
al may feci that any considerable vote in such
a cause is victory fiat whatever be the re
sult of this canvass it is plain that the dis
cussions which have engrossed it have done
a large share of incidental good to the cause
of the perishing slave the free soil move
ment for the time being has been the main
exponent of the antislavery sentiment of the
noith it has brought money talent and
genius to the help of outraged and bleeding
humanity and has pleaded the cause of the
lacerated bondman through the press and on
the platform with an eloquence stirring and
powerful hundreds of thousands have
through the means of this party beard foi
the first time the wrongs of the slave exposed
and the duties of the north partially defined
w e have attended their conventions and have
almost forgotten that these men after all art
not abolitionists and arc not to he relied or
as the leaders of the antislavery movement
ol this land their arguments against sla
veryagainst the slave poweragainst the
extension of slavery have been so ardent and
vigorous chat for the time being all suspi
cions that they would falter in the work were
silenced the election is now over and there
is less reason to apprehend that their enemies
w ill take undue advantage of our expression
vc shall now declare our belief that tim
movement ought not to be regarded as the real
antislavery movement of the country and
belief that so far from regarding
our movement in the light of a political one
we should strive by every means in our power
to keep it mainly a moral movement catch
ing up the smouldering coals from fires kin
dled long ago in the desolate wilderness ol
proslavery sentiment by the faithful pioneers
those young travellers to the land of freedom
have had little difficulty in keeping themselves
warm during the last four months the path
which they travelled had been travelled before
and many of its rough places had been made
smooth by the bleeding feet of early pioneers
in this sacred cause
charles sumner of fioston one of the
ablest and most eloquent free soil men in
massachusetts declared recently at the close
of a speech in faueuil hall that he would
not have been permitted to make the same
speech theie ten years ago and said that
such an act would have subjected him to a
mob lie evidently spoke there on privi
leges bought by the hard toils of abolitionists
the facts arguments and principles with
which they so powerfully assailed the ram
parts of slavery have been draw n chiefly from
repositories prepared to their hands the
ground had been deeply ploughed for them
and they found it comparatively mellow re
quiring little effort to cultivate it it came
into operation not by its own impulse hut by
invitation and a state of preparation which
made it easy to operate the track which
they have pursued was broken by other hands
than theirs pride and selfglory may con
ceal it but lime w ill reveal that to the earnest
unwavering and faithful toil of win lloyd
garrison and the american antislavery
society with its early auxiliaries we are in
debted for the present free soil movement
in the heat of this movement it ought
perhaps to lc expected that those who are
actively engaged in it will often forget to give
credit where credit is due if it be not in
human nalure so to do it at least accords
w ith human experience we dart around the
land as on eagles wings seldom thinking of
the hard hand laborer who levelled the hills
raised the valley bridged the river blasted
the rocks and tunneled the mountain the
man of soft skin delicate hands and whose
brow has never moistened with the sweat of
honest toil rides through the country on
cushioned seats with his luggage secured in
the van car w hile he whose sinews built the
road travels the turnpike with his luggage
strapped to his back and at nightfall begs a
place in the farmers stable to rest his weather
beaten brow what is true of the primary
laborer in matter is apt to be true of the same
class in any branch of inoials they ow
that others may reap they become poor
that others may become rich the lot of la
borers and reformers generally will be that of
the abolitionists it will be theirs to look
beyond the praise of men for their reward
w hile they are faithful to principle they will
always he too odious in the popular view to
be regarded as suit able candidates for offices of
emolument or honor nor ought they to re
pine at this they have a higher and better

lived for tliemsclves that their own ease and
pleasure have not been consulted that they
have denied themselves that they hare suf

must rise for the reward of disinterested toil
for the wellbeing of mankind a motive
power less strong and ccruin than this would
be insufficmßt to withstand the trying hard
ship ol the reformer the anchor of his
faith must sink deeper than the unstable and
evershifting sands of exjedienqy it must
rejunse in the imsom of gud there alone he
will find security from the tempi at ions pre

from w reck and rum the storm may come
and the whirlwind and tempest may unite

regarding the true anbslavery reformer
in this light we cannot allow that they are
fairly represented in a oliiical party acting
under the american coosuiutioo and pledg

the estimation in which the recent mani
festation of colorphobia and meanness by the
editor of the rochester courier in the case
of rosetta douglass is held by the british
press may be gathered from the following
notice pf that affair by the british banner
after giving an account of the transaction
the editor says
in this interesting incident we aepapuch
to excite hope for the descendants or ham
now in cruel bondage the chief governess
of the school clearly main tests an excellent
spirit and the children too are without an
exception true to the nature within them
which unsophisticated knows nothing of
color as a condition of human love and social
intercourse the parents also to a roan
are unanimous in favor of the admission ol
i rosettaone man and only one appears
among the whole w ith the heart ot a perse
cutor is this nothing does such a fact as
this mark no progress in public feeling who
will deny that this community composed oi
various classesgovernesses children and
parentsmay be viewed as in a good degree
a fair representative of the whole people of the
lnitcd states and if so does not the re
demption of the three and a quarter millions
of colored people now in chains draw nigh
this revolting and solitary persecutor to
whom we thinktoo much deference is paid
is in our mind an object of pity even more
than of contempt for we conceive sefre
spect an approving conscience and real
heartfelt happiness must be unknown to an
individual that could shut out from the bless
ings ot instruction a child so gentle and gifted
as rosetta douglass on the simple ground of
color such men are a blot on the fair face
of america let us hope that when the
present wretched class to which that perse
cutor belongs have been gathered to their
fathers they will have no successors and that
we shall see an end to them
the prospect widening
it is not only in the free states that the
allimportant question of slavery is attracting
attention kentucky is moving the free i
soil movement although it pledges nothing
in reference to states where slavery already
exists as indeed it can do nothing has
powerfully drawn the minds of the free in
habitants of those states to the subject it is
impossible that the dark slave system can
much longer be suffered to exist in this or any
civilized community the truth when once
it gains a foothold never recedes but waxes
stronger and stronger until the perfect day i
antislavery truth it cannot be denied is still
feeble iu its utterance in the slave states and
seems to promise but insignificant results the
slave power is referred to in terms as slightly
as possible condemnatory cautiously worded
rcsoutions are parsed at public meetings as
if written by men who had just emerged from
gross darkness and were not yet sufficiently
inured to the surrounding light to distinguish
with clearness the objects by which they are
surrounded but they cannot rest there
they must ere long discern the truth more
clearly their mental eyesight will become
more and more distinct and then the fearful
sin of slavery will stand before them revea ed
in all the hideousriess of its naked deformity
then will they hate it with a perfect hatred
and hating denounce and labor for its over
throw it is impossible to see slavery as it
is inhuman brutalizing debasing a curse to
men and accursed of god and not hate it
it is impossible to see it dooming  joooo of
our fellowcreatures to the fearful misery
of hopeless bondagea bondage from which
there is no escape but with deathno refuge
but in the grave and not denounce itde
nounce it in words as strong as the english
language can afford it is not possible to use
words that can express too strongly the utter
inhumanity and barbarity of the slave system
there are some who are fearful of using harsh
language against slavery and slaveholders
but their fears are groundless tne slave
holder deserves no considerat on he has
placed himself beyond the pale of human sym
pathy by the enormity of his gu it he
must speak trumpetlongued who would reach
the ear of the slaveholder he must use words
of burning fire who would cause the heart
of the relentless manstealer to bum within
him but theie must be the cloud before the i
rainthe dawn before the day and every
new exhibition of autislavery feeling in the
southern states is welcomed as an omen of
the coming release for the bundmaudeliver

a correspondent writing to tbu louisville ex
aminer says
i have the satisfaction to advise thee
that there is no doubt of the passage of an
enactment w hich will have in its effect the
gradual abolition of slavery it i to be
brought forward by heury clay in the con
vention that is to meu next waiter to revise
be constitutionand its success is undoubted
another writer to the louisville courier
observes
when it is recollected that slaves are re
garded as very unsafe projerty on the ohio
river aud for one hundred miles back and
that fourfifths of tiro voters of kentucky are
nonsuveboklers the presumption may be in
dulged by those in favor of gradual emanci
pation that a majority of riit members of the
convention will be in favor of riieir peculiar
notions the great body of foreigners who
support themselves by daily labor may be
ruuiiled in opposition to siv try and in favor
of gradual emancipation

there is reason to believe that slavery wil
soon become the allabsorbing topic in mis
souri and that some plan of abolition will
speedily take effect in that state
in virginia the subject of slavery has at
tracted much attention the shore counties
which have been principally devoted to the
cultivation of wheat and tobacco are im
poveiished the fertility of the soil is ex
hausted and therefore unsuited to slave cul
ture wcstern virginia is said to be rapidly
growing in prosperity the soil of that
mountainous region has never been except
to a limited extent cursed with slarery
this stale of things will doubtless operate
at a not distant day to bring about the aboli

states are to a greater or less extent shaken
with the discussion of the question may
this discussion continue and increase rousing

stealer from his dream of iniquitous security
and god speed the right j d
il a man wishes to live an easy and com
fortable life and to become rich and popular
let him not be a reformer look at the men
who occupy high stations are they the re
formers of the lime no look at the
wealthy and those who live at ease and high
in the esteem of their fellowcitizens are
they the reformers no look all around
amongst the admired and the mighty are
they ihe reformers no if you want to
find the reformersthe real salt of the earth
you must look amongst those who are de
nounced as madmen and fanaticswho are
sneered at as having little intelligence and less
influence there you will find the reformer la
boring patiently and unweariedly asking the
world for no favors and stooping to no cor
ruption v
it is but rarely that the reformer sees the
successful issue of his labors truth is ol
slow growth it is also ofttimes mean in its
originissuing mayhap from a cloister a cel
lar or a garret drawing around it at first the
poor and the despised but gradually taking
root deeper and deeper and sending forth its
branches wider and wider till the world rests
in calm repose under the grateful shade of its
sheltering foliage
those reformers who in past timesuc
ceeded in carrying forward their labors to the
desired termination came into the field at a
time w hen the world was ripe cor their efforts
the sowing time of truth had long before
gone by and those who performed that laboi
had been removed and were then almost
forgotten it was before the thunders ol
luther that the popedom fell the people
learned from him to despise the anathemas
of st peters and the excommunication of the
clergy he extracted the poison from the
triplecrowned monster but we know not how
many sincere men in the darkness and soli
tude of their cloisters had wrestled vigorous
ly and prayed earnestly for enlightenment and
truth we know not and can never know
with w hat crying and tears they labored to
bring out that truth which to their minds was
but darkly and partially revealed when
luther began his denunciations of popery
europe had become wearied of its religious
tyrants and eagerly welcomed one who had
courage and nerve to lead the van in a strug
gle to throw off the yoke it was not crom
well that first raised the standard of opposi
tion to kingcraft at many conventicles
strong protests had been made against the un
warrantable interference of the king with tlx
right of prophesying luther and crom
well were both great lefurmersthe greatest
ol their time but they could not have accom
plished their object had not the labors of oth
ers who had gone before them prepared the
public mind to second and fall in w ith their
efforts far more numerous have been the
reformers of that class who after epending a
litetime in the thankless labor of proclaiming
the truth in the ears of unwilling listeners die
at length leaving behind a few to cherish
their names and spread abroad their thoughts
and many to calumniate their characters and
heap curses upon their memory but what
does that matter the reformer can get
along wdl enough without either fame or re
ward he does not expect these he does
not woik for them he is indeed indifferent
about themwhere truth beckons him
there he must followr and in days past has
ufttimes followed to infamy and death
so it has been and so we may safely pre
dicate it will be for years to come death way
uoi now he any part of the reformers portion
but neglect and disgrace assuredly will be
the man who wishes for wealth and populari
ty must not be a reformer he must not get
before but stay with the multitude going just
as far and no farther than public opinion goes
with him ifhe does this he is and
cannot fail of finding popularity and success
ihe world hates its teachers it has often
tried to stop their mouths it does not like to
be told of its vices and its errors much less
will it reward those who do speak them out
plainly yet the truth must be spoken
those to whom the commission is given will
speak it all the threats of tyrants cannot
pteveut no fears of disgrace or ncgls can
turu them from their purpose speak they
will and the world must bear and though it
hales must follow their guidance

after the presidential election
the president is elected it matters not a
great deal whether the alareholder taylor or
the doughface casa in either ease the re
sult is sufficiently melancholynot because of
the power which is put into the hands of ooe
whom it ia only too evident ia unfit for ita ex
ercise but as the election of either seems to
east a doubt upon the fitness of the american
people for aelfgor eminent neither of the
candidates it is ever dreamed by his most
strenuous supporters is a man of more than
ordinaiy virtues or ability in the opinion of
the opposing party both of the nominees if
what is affirmed concerning them be true in
stead of being elected to the office of chief
magistrate should forthwith be sent to the
state prison or a lunatic asylum and yet
one or the other of these men has been
elected
tbe contest that bm just ended affords a
melancholy retrospect tergiversation fraud
and falsehood have been the means unscru
pulously used by the opposing parlies and a la
mentable destruction of confidence between
man and man cannot fail to have been pro
duced it may well be doubted whether the
advantages gained by frequent popular elec
tions conducted in such a spirit are not more
than counterbalanced by their attendant evils
for the time everything else is forgotten
all the schemes of benevolent effsrt are set
aside labors for the improvement and ame
lioration of the world cast into the shade
and nothing deemed worthy of consideration
but the comparatively insignificant ques
tion who is to be president well it is
ended rowdyism may retire from the field
for a season it has received attention and
consideration enough for the last few weeks
wonderfully useful it has doubtless been to
both parties but all that is over for a time
it may retire and hide itself till the next elec
tion there is one good end which an elec
tion servesthat is to show us our fellow
citizens we should never know who they
are unless such occasions as these brought
them forth into political existence and day
light once more o rowdyism r hide your

heaven that men will again have an opportu

and calm reflection and by the time the next
presidential election rolls aroundit is to be
hoped that they will present a brighter and
belter aspectj d
proslavery there will be found in
another column a long letter from a south
erner purporting to be a reply to the letter to
thomas auld published some weeks since
the writer of course shoots wide of the
mark but the letter serves to show are
the kind of ideas that perambulate the brain
ol the slaveholder the argumentsor ra
ther the statements advanced for the letter is
wonderfully far from containing any argu
ment are simply ridiculous it would be an
insult to the common sense of the reader to
pietend to answer them the letter affords
moreover an illustration of the gentlemanly
and christian bearing of a southerner
who can condescend as he says to lower
his dignity by writing to a negro there
ill be found also on our first page an article

sentence was barbarous and tyrannical no

ever that such barbarities are perpetrated
there is a country which boasts of its free

over those of every other countiy sarejv
the laws of that country must be models of
humanity and civilization let us see the
sentence passed upon smith obrien was
that you be taken from whence you came
then be drawn in a hurdle to the place of ex

deadthat afterwards your head shall be sev

cut off to be hanged in the usual manner the
head severed from the body the body to be
divided into four quarters and the head and
quarters be set up in the most public places in
the county where such an act was committed
laws of maryland
now which is the most barbarous of the
twothe sentence for treason in englan d
or for petty treason in america if there
be any difference the law of maryland is the
most atrocious the sentence passed upon
obrien is that prescribed by law it will
not of course be executed if it be barbarous
for eugland a nation some of whose laws
were enacted at least five hundred years ago
to have on its statutebook such a law against
treason committed by a free citizenwhat is
it for america none of whose laws are more
than sixty years old to have amongst its en
actments such a barbarous punishment for
petty treason by a slave may we not
say of it barbarism unparalleled not to be
tolerated in the nineteenth century bloody

messrs editors i avail myself of the
present moment to communicate to you rela
tive to the liberation meeting held in
broadway tabernacle new york to raise
 which in addition to the  al
ready contributed in washington by the
friends of freedom is the sum demanded by
those modern shylocks bruin and llill to
ransom tho pound of flesh nearest the
hearts of those christian ladies the misses
edmonson
the facts in the case are these after the
piratical capture of the packet schooner pearl
by the domestic american slavetradcrs these
young hdies two of the passengers of that
illfated bark were sold to these pagan usur
ers by their pirate captors wm l chapin
a citizen of that republic which declares
slavetrading to be piracy arriving in west
ern algeria soon after that painful occur
rence and meeting with the disconsolate
father of these ladies who would not be com
forted because his daughters were not very
naturally and rationally felt interested rn their
behalf and their case soon became a part of
the history of the times the friends of
freedom and haters of iniquity soon set them
selves at work to effect their release it is
true they felt that as a principle this modus
optrandi would  stop the domestic slave
trade that the chivalry of maryland and vir
ginia would commence raising stock for the
northern as well as for the southern market
and thus increase this horrible traffic but
who that has ever had a mother wife sister
or daughter could let an aged father whose
lovely and christian daughters were about to
be placed upon the bloody altar of slavery
and sold to the southern sensualist appeal in
vain as much as i despair of the abolition
of slavery by such means yet if the inhabi
tants of this trading city could resist such ap
peals i should despair of there being salt
enough in this nation to abolish that  any
other evil by any means
as in the early stages of the antislavery
movement an appeal was made to those who
held the keys to the public conscience and
generosity but unlike then the moral and
political elements were set against domestic a
well as foreign piracy the cooperation of

ihe rev  v beecher made a speech

by dr dowling and capt knight both in

were unwilling to leave until the money was

whatever it is said a young msn whose
name was harris the money must be
raised in this house this night shouted a
dozen voices at once it seemed to me that
these young men were bidding in behalf of
god humanity liberty and virtue agai nst
the devil barbarism slavery and licentious

libertine at the south would pay half the prico
himself to possess half such properly and
oh to think of lovely intelligent chrislia

came showering in until it was announced
that there was hut o short when some one

lingeied cheering for freedom beecher

in speaking of the change in the moral and

embarked upon the waters far from it we
are glad to acknowledge that some of them
honorably resisted the popular current of

missus kpitors i closed a finincr
letter by stating that american protestantism
has changed the divine right of kings to the
dmne right of complexion i now claim
your attention by stating that one of the effects
produced by the american revolution was to
change the power of national sovereignty
from an individual birthright to rule vested in
the magna charta of king john to a com
munity right founded on a complexional ta
riff and secured by the constitution of the
united states to all those who are born on this
soil and congregate from the different por
tions of the gloe who are distinguished by
tbe flickering shade of white su far
we an concerned the cftect of this arrange
ment has been to change the ruling power
from one to many monsters
american republicanism now presents the
stiangc anomaly of seventeen millions of
sovereign rulers to three millions of subjects
for seventytwo years this inequality in the
rights privileges and condition of a portion of
the people of this country has received the
moral and religious sanction of the people
both in church and state until the primitive
doctrine of the natural equality of man hos
nearly become obsolete  iie right to enjoy
lib rty and pursue happiness that formed the
basis of physical resistance to the mother
country has been excluded from universality
in our frs ns t and tbe unnatural and sacrile
gious robbery has been sustained and de
fended by the popular religion of the country
tne true history of the protestant religion
of this country towards the colored popula
tion is a history of wrong and outrage for
which as believers in future rewards and
punishneits its professors must answer at
tbe bir of i id they have inscribed on the
soil of our ignorance an idolatrous love for a
religion w hich true light and knowledge will
leach us to loathe and execrate as transla
tors and inteipretcrs ol the old scriptures
they have turned the hible against usthey
jj ive pointed us to thir divine authority to
purchase aud cusjare the heathen and then
turning to us exclaim that you aie the
iieatheu they have taught our people to
believe m their god and their translators and
rom n iiutors of the scriptures and thus by
their superior wisdom power and authority
have been successful in making us the ignor
ant dupes of a folly that desecrates our man
boal by making us become the obstinate de
fenders of a system of religion which vindi
cates our own degradation and for which wc
can hvqt hope to obtain the approbation of
she wise and good in the present or succeeding
ages
tiie protestant sects who wield and
guide the popular rejigaou of this country
have through their highest instructors bish
ops clergy ami laymen as well as their reli
gious presses not only apologized for
but defended the rigbtfulness of american
slavery so iioportaut a foothold has this
doctrine obtained amuug the sects that anti
slavery has been denounced as heretical
how then can we expect any but a prosla
very religion to be prevalent among tbe col
cred people since their forms doctrines and
ceremonies are but tbe daguerreotype like
ness of the religion of their oppressors it
is true wc have distinct houses lor worship
to suit the prejudices of the public taste hut
we have no distinct religion calculated to vin
dicate our natural equality with the nations of
the earth before clod and the world north
ern prejudice combined with our own action
has so far separated us lroin the w hite church
es that but little opportunity is afforded us of
learning their higher virtues the religion
vve have came almost as directly from the
sunny south as rain falls from the clouds
of heaven it has for the most part been
heralded forth by men from the south whose
habits and education taught them to lend the
knee to the  dark spirit of slavery such
a religion to us is not a blessing but a curse
its ministers in the place of spreading truth
knowledge and true happiness are involving
us in darkness misery pain and degradation
our religion is but the reflecting shadow oi
the creative genius of our opjjtessors i heir
orthodoxy is ours when they denounce
the friends of freedom so do tec w e assist
them m sj reading a sanctimonious influence
over tbe right of tbe oppressor to multiply
lithographic s ars on tbe bodies of ourfellow

this state of things will naturally continue
until we become religiously divorced ftotn

tbe predominant religion of the sects our
religious institutions were planted on slave
cursed soil they are nourished by us jmiwer
and inhale its baleful atmosphere and they
can never be made to suit the genius and
spirit of a free people until they are raised to

the necessary comforts of life in order that
they may reach their lands
 resolved that it is the duty of every
man that holds a deed of that land to adopt

portunity of saying to all of ray colored friends 
in a few words that i am an experienced
surveyor and that  have followed that busi
ness botii in the northern western and
southern states and that i have lately ex
plored to some extent those parts of the
country in which are located the lands donated
by gerrit smith esq and that they possess
many very superior natural advantages i
would therefore recommend to all those that
have received lands or who may hereafter re
ceive lands to hold on to them as their most
valuable earthly treasure and sooner suffer
nakedness and hunger than part with them
i earnestly recommend to all those that have
pledged their land for debt to lose no time in
redeeming them and i can but hope that
colored people will assist and advise one an
other m a matter of such vast and such gener
al interest

fbcd doi glus i hare seen in one of
my papers a letter of yours to your old mas
ter to the strain of reasoning of which i
would reply for him and send you what is
calculated if you be not indurated and pur
blind to throw cold water on your audacity
and presumption and to give you some bap
tism of sense i know i am lowering my
dignity to write to a negro but i do that as
i wish to hare an effctual bit at the white
and black abolitionists of the northand
after giving you this seasonable physic shall
leave you alone amid your mephitic glories
unless you wish to answer and would pub
lish my letter and yours in the paper you
edit when i will give you a fair heat and
see which would have the mastery of reason
i have long been of opinion that the amer
ican people ought to dispatch the negroes to
africa and have done with them i would
have yankees also to send off their colored
free as the south their slaves but rather
than not have this done i would have a per
petual slaveryaye and bring you back in
subjection to your old master
the people of the north especially that
portion which ntakes a tool of you violate
the constitution of their and our government
ly nojj remanding you black ninny to mr
auld and by turning that instrument in a
variety of ways to their own convenience
they steal our slaves that holy writ in
the tenth decalogue said they must not covet
and then they complain and vapor because in
selfdefence we interdict their bringing col
ored sailors to our shores indeed their and
your whole forte is to harass the south into
jivil war and as garrison and yourself avow
to have disunion and all the deadly conse
quences just because a portion of these states
act on the mosaic and noachian institutes
which are sanctioned of jehovah on your
race as certainly and firmly as your ethiopic
skin diabolic demons you would blas
pheme god and hate men and denounce the
scriptures before you would allow noahs
curse on your race and his blessing on ours
any sanctity
now calmly if you can consider this mat
ter were we to free every negro in the south
what would be the consequence behold
the fruit of west indian emancipationthe
whites leaving the islands the blacks and
mulattocs robbing violating and ferocious
but you abolitionists dont careyou say
freedom anyhow maugre consequences and
would have liberty given to the negroes
though utter ruin or amalgamation or even
downright atheism or continual wais be the
result this we cannot do i do not know
what the south would ultimately do with the
negroes
i want the south in mcicy to itself and
the north to send all the colored people
safely to liberia and other parts of africa
this  pray aud have long even to agony
prayed the lord god almighty to cause to
be done as a hope alike for the two races
and a bounty to the poor negroes for africa
is their land and no where else among other
races are the children of ilam any better than
servants nor can be until the actual millenium
what is their hope
the cause is not as you wrote mr auld
of maryland one of separate personal identity
moral links exist between all beings and the
greatest equality is founded on reciprocal obli
gations now this reciprocity is according
to the condition and capacities of the several
races as of individuals one man is made
the superior in bodily and mental faculties of
anotherone race or men better than another
each therefore sh uld know and by sub
mitting to his sphere of duties all work welj
for the good of all the mechanic who is
fitted by birth or by faculties for construc
tion only cannot arrogate to be the equal of i
councellors in the cabinetnor can the negro
whose form and faculties are inferior to the
white man presume to be his equal without
violating the order of natureand calling in
question not only certain passages in the two
testaments but the will of the omnipotent t
submission to gods ordination and will is
the only utility b resisting this men but
the more prove the destruction of their tem
poral and eternal prospects as a black your
place is below the whiteman as surely as your
hair and velvet like coarse skin and smell
is inferior to his hair and skin and odour
nor has the negrq a right to attempt to de
stroy the harmony and beauty of the white
frame by amalgamation all your hope is
to submit and to bless god and hope to be a
new bom to a heavenly equality in every re
spect with us if your feelings revolt from
this you would find it hard to get to paradise
and are conscious of the rebellious nature of
your soul against god s providence
you compare your sisters with your mas
ters amanda this is reasoning if they
were equal which is not the case nor did
mr auld take your sisters as you suppose
he found them and you by inhentence and
the idea of their violation and that of turning
your gratklmama out into the woods evident

the habit is an african one wb re also they
devour the aged and idoliie the slimy snake
and from which custom for rescuing your
fathers and bringing the race to the light of
truth you never cease maligning our ameri

antislavery
bazaar
to be held in minnra hall on the a and
 st of december 
under a deep and abiding impression of the
duty we owe to god and our fellow beings
the antislavery women of rochester feel
constrained to continue to persevere in their j
efforts for the oppressed and suffering bond
men who still remain toiling unrequited in the
southern prison house we are frequently
brought painfully to remember that not only
is their labot wrested from them unrenumer
ated not only do they suffer from intense
hunger and cold not only are the females
our sisters subjected to thcruel and pass
ionate outrages of their tyrannical masters and
overseers but there are daily instances of sun
dering the dearest ties in natute thus separ
ating them forever and cm we expect any
thing bettercan we look for benevolence or
fine feelings from a system so foul and fiend
ish as slavery it would be unreasonable
because a corrupt tree cannot bring forth
good fruit therefore knowing that with
out associative action we cannot rendet effi
cient aid to this holy cause we affecionately
invite the cooperation of the citizens of roch
ester and the public generally we ask them
to bear in mind the injunction of jesus all
things whatsoever ye would men should do to
yoa do ye even so to them remember
also the beautiful parable in which he calls
our attention to the sick and to those who are
in prison and concludes by the fotcible asser
tion inasmuch as ye have done it to one of
the least of these my brethren ye have done
it unto me we feel assured all that have
hearts to feel and are careful to attend to the
monitions of conscienceall who are deter
mined to live for the good of our race instead
of devoting all their time  their own per
sonal ease all who feel bound to improve the
precious time alloted to them here by pro
moting as much as possible the cause of truth
and righteousness in the earth will come for
ward in the work of laboring to banish forever j
the demon of slavery from our land and in j
so doing instead of an example of corruption
and wickedness we should bo a light to the
world
we hope no one will feel  poor nor any
too rich to enlist in this holy cause toe
christians influence in whatever situation is
always salutaiy and will certainly produce its
good effects we ask for the aid of men and
of woman we call on the old and the 
young the farmer the mechanic and the j
merchant we ask all and every one to give
us their help to devote what they can spare
either of money or of the fruits of their la
bor to the work of restoring men and women
to themselves to their manhood to the rights
and blesings with which they wore endowed j
by our creator
for this object we propose holding a fair
in dec th and st we ask the females
in the adjoining towns and country around us
to get up sewing circles and prepare such arti
cles as will be most saleable and to come
f irnisb tables give us their company and
help us not only in selling those things thus
prepared hut in convincing th  public mind
of the necessity of our perseverance and
fidelity and thus be helpers in hastening the
day of emancipation

visit to sarah pubeck
having spent twentyfour hours ii
boston and seen as much of the vanity
sin and folly of men as we desired wi
proceded to salem to visit that great
esl ol all sufferers in hie whole universe
on entering her ehnmhcr we could bu
just discover her form as she is no
able to bear the light her windows an
darkened more than any other sick roon
 ever entered but after being in tin
room a few minutes we could discen
every object distinctly and even ob
serve the mild and pleasant countenance
of the sufferer but how shall we de
scribe her case i cannot it is im
possible for words to convey a correc
idea of her state to understand hei
wc must see her and hear her al
who have visited her after reading m 
former description of her case say t ikm
doubted the truth of the descriptions
and some of my enemies visited her fo
the express purpose of detecting am
exposing falsehood in rnv writings foi
they thought it impossible for the ac
count to he true but were forced t
admit that the truth was not half told
and could not be told in such a inannei
as to convey any lively idea of the real
ity but to begin
sarah purbeck has been confined 
years during which time she has nevei
been known to sieep one moment noi
has there ever been two minutes at i
time in which her body and limbs have
been quiet or when she has been free
from intense physical suffering hei
disease is universal spasms but jet us
sit down by her bed and observe her as
she is thrown about by spasms ovei
which she can have no control she
reaches out her left hand which she has
the use of in some degree grasps mine
with a strong hearty feeling saying
i i am glad to see tiiee dear brother j
have thought of thee a thousand times
since thou wast here and feel very
grateful for thy visits she then grasps
the hand of my mate draws her nearer
throws her arms about her neck
kisses her as fervently as she would an
own sister or mother who had long been
absent thanks her for her kindness in
calling at this time as her bones arc
twitched out and in at the joints by the
muscles are heard in any part of the
room grinding and snapping one
against the other and before her salu
tation is completed she is drawn for
ward and thrown back against the thick
pillows with such a force that often
jars the whole house the moment the
spasm ceases she speaks in as mild and
pleasant a voice as man ever heard
asking us to be seated by the time
the sentence is completed her right arm
is thrown up over her head and every
muscle to the ends of her finders is
drawn so tight that her arm hand and
fingers are as hard and stiff as tli ugh
they were solid wood her countenance
shows that she can hardly avoid scream
ing aloud and there her hand must re
main in the same position with her
shoulder wrenched out at the joint till
the muscles relax or till the spasm
acting on some other set of muscles
throws her arm into some other pos
ture
it should be remembered that she
sits up in bed not having been able tc
lie down in seventeen years and hei
posture while sitting is most uncomfort
able her feet are both drawn bad
and round by her right side whicl
throws her body from the center o
gravity and thus renders her positior
irfore painful but even here nature ha
relieved iter for her spine has curvet
or in some way changed its position sc
that instead of being up and down hei
back is on the left side and render
the more support to her in her uncom
fortable posture this appears to me
be the work of nature changing or ac
commodating herself to circumstan
o
ccs
her spasm ceases the muscles ol
her arm relax and she asks for drink
yet at the stillest moments there is such
a continued twitching of the muscles
that the bed and bedstead are contin
ally shaking like the floor of a ma
chine shop or factory where all
kinds of machines are kept in motion by
water or steam the girl approaches
her with drink she reaches her hand to
aid the girl in placing it to her mouth
when another spasm twists her elbow
out at the joint and turns the arm be
low the elbow nearly round a spot as
large ns a z cent piece near the elbow
is as black as though it had been poun
ded and as sore caused by these
spasms or the twitching of the arm
she appears to b in as much pain as
she can possibly endure without scream
ing aloud but the moment the muscles
relax she speaks as calmly and pleas
antly as though she were free from pain
again she reaches tor the drink and
takes one ir two swallows when the
spasms seize the muscles around the
throat and she strangles pants and
struggles several minutes as though she
wouid never breathe again and as soon
as the sti angling ceases she coughs
violently and sometimes vomits blood
now site is comparatively quiet for a
few seconds vet tlie jar like that of a
machine shop is continual her elbow
and shoulder flying out and in at the
joints like the springs of machinery
again a spasm draws iier forward and
then throws her back against the pillows
with a violence tiiat one wouib think
must stun her and the next moment her
jaw is drawn out of joint by other mus
cles and the moment that spasm cea
ses her hand tlies up against her face
with so much force that one would
think the blow enough to stagger c
strong man one eye has thus been
beaten out and her lace is often black
and blue lroni these blows the next
moment her arm m thrown around be
hind her and presse d against her back
with such force that it would be diffi
cult to press a case knife between her
arm and back her hand arm and all
the fingers are as stiff and as hard as
wood and the poor creature must suff
er till some other muscle coutracts and
throw s her into some other posture
 bus the sufferer has been tormented
with spasms day and night during sev
enteen years without one minute inter
mission except when exhausted nature
has fainted away and even then her
limbs are twitching about and out and
in at the joints times without number
sometimes the spasms throw her from
the bed to the plastering overhead and
sometimes on to the floor many o
her joints have been dislocated hun
dred and perhaps thousands of times
and the lightest spasms are attended
with pain similar to that caused by the
severest rramp and she says if she
would give way to her feelings her
screams would be heard half a mile
at one time her jaws were firmly locked
twentyfive days during which time all
the nourishment she took passed
through tho aperture caused by the loss
of a tooth she has not swallowed s
particle of solid food for years but sub
sists entirely on liquids which are ta
ken with great difficulty and sufiering
and she is not conscious of having
slept a moment for seventeen years
and has not been a moment withoul
pain
singular as all this is there are oth
er things equally astonishing how
she has lived all this time is a ques
tion that has puzzled all that have evei
seen her a stranger on seeing her il
he had no knowledge of her history
would not suppose she could live sis
hours and yet there she has been sev
enteen years day and night in contin
ual motion and never free from pain
when  expressed surprise at her liv
ing so long and enduring so much she
replied it is as great a miracle as was
ever performed by christ in the days ol
his flesh
another mystery to many is how her
mind is kept so quiet and patient as no
inurmer or complaint ever escapes her
lips but on the contrary she is perfect
ly resigned to her lot and says she has
no desire to have one pain the less but
is willing to drink the whole cup with
resignation she believes her heav
enly father is ever present secs and
know s all her sufferings and is fulfilling
some wise purpose
but i must draw this article to a
close and yet the truth is not hall
told
and now reader can it be believed
that in this nation of high profession in
the wealthy town of salem amid religi
ous churches and the profesedly pious
this poor sufferer in the midst of ali
her sufferings must have the care of a
family a father over jk years of age
and herself and nurseand keep her
purse in bed and order the purchases
of the family and settle all her bills
can it be believed that she is compell
ed among professed christians to de
pend in part on transient gtfts or sup
port that she is often out of
besides her other sufferings has
ditional worrinient of being in dent
without knowing whence means will
come for her relief it is even so and
this of itself is sufficient comment on
the state of pure christianity in the
communityand is sufficient proofofthe
truth of all the hard things i have said
about the churches
after spendi ig three or four hours
with the poor sufferer we arose to de
part when she again grasped my com
panion by the hand drew her nearer
threw her arm about ber neck kissed
her and wept aloud o it is better te
visit that chamber of suffering than the
house of feasting
i handed her two dollars one from
j hammond of shirley mass and
one from friend b of new york and
could but wish that it had been ten
times as much 
if any one doubts any part the above
relation let him write to the selectmen
of salem or any other person and he
will be told that the account is true
and if any who may read this article
may have a desire to express his sym
pathy for her by contributing to supply
her wants they inay direct to me or to
sarah purbeck salem mass
after bidding her adieu we entered
the car and soon arrived at our quiet
cabin feeling that our time had been
exchanged for that which is of more
value than silver or gold
lroia tlw christian chronicle
maternal courage
we have rarely if ever met with a
more striking example of maternal
selfdevotion united with a singular
presence of mindthan is offered by
the following circumstance which oc
curred two or three weeks ago in the
slate of new york the extracts
which we give are made as will be
perceived from a letter written by the
heroic mother herself to a friend a few
days after the events narrated had oc
curred
mrs accompanied by her
daughter a young girl about twelve
years of age and some young children
with their nurses went to visit
cemetery a favorite dog nanied
carlo was permitted to accompany
them as escort and the little ones were
amused by their gambols as he ran and
leaped by their side on reaching the
cemetery mrs and her daugh
ter were a little in advance of the rest
of the party
when suddenly we were all arrest
ed by the most horrible yelps from car
lo who came plunging writhing and
foaming furiously mad the dog took
a circuit round and as the shrieks
went forth from and
he is mad he is inadl echoed
ves he is madrun for your lives
in the same breath i tore from my
shoulders a large blanket shawl as my
only defence carlo immediately made
for mary who was running with all the
speed possible i shrieked mary tis
vou he pursues turn as quick as
thought at the same time i kept
nearly pace with the dg and as dear
mary turned i enveloped him com
pletely with iny shawl winding the
corners which i held in my hand for
the purpose closely round his neck
it was ol course only for one moment
 could hold him but every instant
count d and enabled marv to change
her course so that he was unable to
pursue her in any direct liue but the
instant be escajed from me he made
direct for her again a frothy foam is
suing from his tn ulh accompanied bv
that unearthly yelp
i he others had made their escape
from the comet cry and  was left alone
among the dead to contend with and
protect my child against a raving mad
dog oh who can imagine my feel
ings calm and perfectly selfpos
sessed i remained giving directions
unceasingly to mary who followed them
quicker than given all the time the
dog was at full speed save when i
muffled him with the vkawl it w
only by mary making short turn an
leaping upon palings that i had an op
portunity of stopping him at all
several time be o nearly reached her
as to raise his paws to spring np to the
spot she occupied and each lime
strength and thought were given to me
to cover him with the shawl and wind it
round his neck thus she escaped
until aid was sent kven that i fear
might have been too late had he not
fallen ir a fit from which be was never
allowed to rise his head waaaevered
from his body by the heavy bww of an
axe given by a strong arm while mary
stood directly over him upon a high
i fence whither be had pursued her
one week has passed and last
night was the first time i have been
able to shut out from my sight that fu
rious dog gnashing his jaws uttering
those horrid yelps and foaming thick
froth from his mouth rushiug after my
poor child
in the midst of the horrors of the
scene described with such simplicity
and vividness how touchingly sublime
appears a mothers love again and
again the mother offers her life in sac
rifice for that of her child each time
that te shawl was throw n around the
furious animal he might have turned
upon that noble woman and made her
his victim yet still she persevered
and god in mercy made her the instru
ment of saving the life of her beloved
daughter
one word on the remarkable pres
ence of mind here displayed it is a
quality w hich all should cultivate it is
invaluable in the hour of danger and
who knows when that hour may be at
hand the timid and irresolute are in
imminent peril themselves and entirely
useless to others while those who have
learned to maintain a control over their
thoughts and preserve presence of
mind are often made the happy instru
ments of saving those whom they love
from danger and from death x
the secret or success lt may
to some appear like vanity in me to
write what i now do but i should not
give my life truly if i omitted it when
i tilling a cart of manure at the farm
dunghill i never stopped work because
i my side of tire cart might be heaped
up before the other side at which was
another man i pushed over what i
had heaped up to help him as doubtless
he did to help me when i was last and
he was first when i have filled my
column or counns of a newspaper or
sheet of a magazine with the literature
for which i was to be paid i have
never stopped if the subject required
more elucidation or the paper or maga
zinc more matter because there was
no contract for more payment or no
likelihook of there being more when
i have lived in barrackroom i liave
stopped my own work and have taken
a baby from a soldiers wife when she
had to work and nursed it or have
gone for water for her or have cleaned
jan other mans accoutrements though
it was no part of my duty to do sol
when i have been engaged in politico
literature and travelling for a newspa
pcr i have not hesitated to travel
many miles out of my road to ascertain
a local fact or to pursue a subject into
its minutest particulars if it appeared
that the public were unacquainted with
the facts of the subject and this at
time  when i had work to do which was
much more pleasant and profitable
when i have needed employment i
have accepted it at whatever wages i
could obtainat plough in farm drain
jin stone quarrv at breaking stones foj
roads at woodcutting in a savpit as
a civilian or as a soldier  have in
london cleaned out a stable and
j groomed a cabmans horse fora six
pence and been thankful to the cabman
for the sixpence i have subsequently
fried literature and have done as much
writing for ten shillings as i have readi

not been content to begin at the begin
