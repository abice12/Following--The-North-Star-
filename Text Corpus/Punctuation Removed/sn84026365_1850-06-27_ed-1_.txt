the slavery agitjan
country has been aax
toward tlte seat of
six months the agitation
mrmtion to slavery has during that
bk phfcjtl been painfully felt in every sec
kjc ftan bbhe republic that agitation
hfs given rise to many apprehensions
and fears and so much denunciation
that every one must have felt much so
licitude as to its termination the
perseverance of the men of one portion
of the confederacy in urging the ap
plication of the jefferson proviso to
bills relating to the territories ac
from mexico and the threats of

t it prospect ol a
w rutnlul thundeis is
fearful than it was at the be
hefig of the present session of con
at the beginning ol the session it
was assumed that the adjustment of
the great difficulty was impracticable
and a dissolution of our happy confed
eracy was predicted with the most un
doubting confidence it has since been
discovered that there is no necessity
compelling a dissolution of the union
and men have looked forward wilh
much hope to several different proposi
tions for the pacific settlement of the
momentous question w hich has rocked
the country to its very centre
the contagion of fear and of dis
union seized on the legislatures of
several states and they proceeded to
declare their grievances intolerable
and their unchangeable determination
to encounter all the perils of disunion
unless tbe people of the northern
states should speedily withdraw their
countenance from those men who seem
ed bent on pushing matters to a crisis
the legislatures of mississippi ala
bama south carolina georgia and
virginia resolved that dissolution was
necessary unless the men of the north
should cease from troubling them and
their darling institution the heav
ens grew black and angry with clouds
and the weatherwise prophesied a pro
digious tempest but the tempest has
not yet reached us and there is now
but little expectation that its des dating
energies will be down upon us
the reaction in ihe southern states
has been most marked four months
ago the project of a southern conven
tion at nashville seemed to be emi
nently agreeable to the people generally
in the south as the period desig
nated for the meeting of the delegates
om the southern states approaches
ie project of a convention is less and
less favored indeed into such disre
pute has ihe project fallen that it is
seriously questioned whether a south
ern convention will be held it has
been very generally abandoned by all
those who have hearts sufficiently
large to love the whole union and il
any meeting take place it is pretty cer
tain that it will be composed of disaf
fected persons only of men who are
weary of the confederacy as it isol
men who are anxious for a breaking
asunder of the bands of our national
union at any rate whether the con
vention shall be attended by a few per
sons or by many its power to do evil
will not be alarming for the people in
all the states with the exception o
those residing in mississippi and south
carolina are hostile to the meeting
and will indignantly reject any scheme
that may be nurtured in it and pro
posed for tbeir adoption
the advocates of the nashville con
vention who were in favor of pushing
matters to the verge of disunion hav
been taught that the people dearlj
love the union and will ding to it
the manses will suffer many griev
ances before they will seek relief ii
disunion oanghly esteemed ant
patriotic gevetror chittenden nevei
uttered a truer sentiment than when ht
declared that disunion odd never hi
vol  no 
admitted to be a remedy for any politi
cal evils but that on the contrary it
would certainly be in itself the consum
mation of all evils our great and in
fluential statesman henry clay too
is right we think in supposing that
disunion would of necessity b fol
lowed by civil wars long fad wasteful
ha who would prefer aivil wars with
their endless and black catalogues of
crimes to tbe continuance of even so
dread a scourge as african slavery
cannot be considered either as a pru
dent or a wise counsellor slavery
should not be abolished by the sword
even if it were practicable to abolish it
in that way the only kind of eman
cipation which is truly desirable is
that which may be brought about by
the will of the people among whom the
institution exists that there are some
men whose hatred of slavery has be
come so intense and so insane as to
induce them to desire disunion and the
civil wars that would follow disunion
as means for the abolition of slavery
is a melancholy truth such men have
permitted their zeal to destroy their
judgment to prostrate one evil they
would inflict a hundred evils on the
country or rather in a blind fury
hugst one great evil which is not
by force of arms they would
scourges on the country to an
unendurable height we have no af
fection although much pity for those
then of blood who would unsheathe the
sword against slaveholders the abo
lition of slavery is not desirable on
such terms for the slaves if emanci
pated against the will of the people
generallywould not occupy a more ad
vantageous position than they now do
we most ardently desire emancipation
but only on the condition that when it
does occur it shall be unaccompanied
with evils worse than slavery itself
when the people concur generally in
the wish to have the slaves liberated
then and then only will the proper
steps be taken to secure to the emanci
pated the blessings of liberty we
have no very exalted appreciation of
that species of liberty which is merely
nominal while thorough genuine soul
invigorating freedom commands our
highest reverence
but to return we are extremely
glad that the people of the south have
rejected the project of disappointed
ambition who have sought to seduce
theisfjftmi√ügteir fidoiitytu union
the common glory of the irehion and
which is of far greater moment ihe
common welfare of the people of all
sections require that the union of
these states shall be preserved there
is not an interest of any kindcom
mercial agricultural social moral
mental or religiousthat would not
be injuriously affected by disunion
thus believing the rejection of the
project of a sothern convention by an
overwhelming majority of the people
has filled our hearts with unspeakable
joy we have everything to hope for
in unioneverything to fear in dis
union
the question which all men are nowi
anxious to have answered relates to
the probability of the adoption of mr
clays compromise measures in the
present condition of things that is pre
cisely the question which it is impossi
ble to answer if mr clays plan is
adopted what will be its effect on the
slavery institution
that plan proposes the admission of
california with its antislavery consti
tution the framing of territorial gov
ernments for utah and new mexico
in which no reference is to be made to
slavery leaving the question of its in
troduction or exclusion to the people
when they shall come to form state
governments the quieting of the claim
of texas to any portion of new mex
ico the abolition of the slave traffic in j
the district of columbia and the pas
sage of a bill the more effectually to
guard the claim of the slaveholder to
his fugitive slave would slavery be
established in utah and new mexico if
the compromise were adopted we
agree with mr clay in the opinion that
it cannot be established in either of
those territories there are already
nearly enough people in new mexico
to warrant them to call a convention to
frame a state constitution and they
i are known to be opposed to the intro
duction of slavery the immigration
of slaveholders into that territory must
be far larger than any one believes it
could be under any circumstances to
insure the adoption of slavery there
so also the present population of utah
is hostile to the introduction of slavery
and there are no inducements offered
there to tempt slaveholders thither
i whenever conventions are called to
frame state constitutions in utah and
new mexico we feel very certain that
slavery will be excluded from these
territories
if mr clays plan is rejected we
think the plan proposed by tbe presi
dent will be adopted that plan pro
poses the admission of california with
her present boundaries and constitu
tion leaving utah and new mexico to
come into the union whenever their
people desire to come in with or with
out the incumbrance of tlavery if
the presidents plan is adopted we
feel very confident that the institution
of slavery will never be permitted to
infest and destroy the best interests of
the people who reside or who may
hereafter reside in any portion of the
territories acquired by treaty from
mexico
whatever may be adopted we ear
nestly hope that the egrae of slavery
shall not be extended beyond its pres
ent limits if national legislation is
necessary to restrict the curse within
right is of ho sex truth is of no color
the limits it now blights we hope such
legislation may be had
there is another subject to which
we wish to call the attention of our
friends aud that is the enterprise of
the slavery men in relation to the es
tablishment of a slavery organ in the
city pf washington
year alter year live slavery men
persisting in declaring that they would
not discuss the merits of the peculiar
institution in congress they assu
med that congress had no business
under the constitution to say one word
on the subject of slavery and they
tried to frown down all efforts to in
duce congress to talk of a subject over
which it could not exert any practical
influence they felt a lofty scorn for
all tflpse zealous men who persisted in
looking into the subject of slavery and
treated their arguments with thorough
contempt gradually however in
the flight of years they relaxed the
iron rigor they had prescribed and
condescended to vindicate the institu
tions of the south the ice once bro
ken a perfect inundation of prosla
very eloquence has taken place de
clamation has become fiery and logic
has grown pathetic in portraying the
beauties and benefits and glories of the
patriarchal system as it exists in the
southern states and now to crown
the matter a newspaper is to be estab
lished for the very object of promulga
ting slavery logic is there no pro
gress here
sixtythree senators and represen
tatives from the sl√üveholding states
have signed an address setting forth
the necessity of a slavery organ in
washington and the necessary steps
have we suppose been taken to get
the project into operation henceforth
then be it remembered that antisla
very logic is not contraband and dis
cussion of the merits of slavery in sanc
tioned by the leaders of the slavery
men
we are pleased with the enterprise
if the slavery folk vindicate slavery
will they have the audacity to deny to
those who righteously detest the sys
tem the right to express their opinions
freely and fully and if discussion
become the order of the day in the
slave states how long will it be be
fore the circumvallatiou which has
been thrown up to guard the institution
will be cast down and the light of
truth and the voice of reform enter
elwood fisher is designated as the
editor of umb slavery organ such se
lection please us very much we
know fisher thoroughly he is a
keen shrewd subtle unscrupulous lo
gician who in his extravagant pre
sumption is in the habit of advancing
the most ultra and absurd propositions
w ith a view of displaying his power in
maintaining them ifwe mi stake not
he will undertake to prove by far too
much he will certainly try to make
it appear that there can be no earthly
good independent of slavery he
will prove as far as he can that the
cause of religion virtue and educa
tion require the presence of slavery
i and will fiercely sustain the proposi
tion that no peqple can be prosperous
unless they rely on negro labor he
will go so far that but few of the most
adventurous slavery tnen will dare to
follow him and in disgusting the mod
erate proslavery people and in bring
ing contempt on the system he will
do very essential service very blindly
it is true to the glorious cause of hu
man freedom we sincerely hope
that the southern organ may go into
effect and that fisher may have con
trol of it in that event the friends
of freedom and humanity will have
abundant cause for thankfulness

national dignity and honor
all on a sudden a little cloud which at
first appeared no bigger than a mans
hand has overspresij the sky and
fitted the political atmosphere throogii
which we look towards oar souiewhau
restless and versatile although as we
had hoped very good and welldis
posed neighbors the french a de
mand upon a petty state for some dis
puted money payments too long de
ferred for the patience of the powerful
creditor which demand we are free to
admit might have been urged in some
what too rude and imperious a fashion
has led to what seems a serious mis
understanding between the govern
ments of the two countries whose bet
interests involved in the preservation
of amicable relations with each other
we hope and believe notwithstand
ing the manifestations of applause with
which the statement of the french
foreign minister of the recall of their
ambassador was received by the
ministerial party in the chamber of
deputiesthat before what we are
now writing appears in print this mat
ter so trifling in its origin will be
satisfactorily airanged if however
it should lead to a war between the
two countries future historians will
have no difficulty in assigning the
blame and the sin of so deplorable a
calamity to the right persons to sy
that it is in itself a sufficient casus belli
is perfectly ridiculous the amount
of indemity which we have forced the
greek government to pay is it ap
pears considerably less than that
named by the french arbitrators but
then we did not wait sufficiently long
for the award to be given and herein
lies the blame and the offence and it
ought as we think to be at once ac
knowledged by our foreign secreta
ry and the cabinet which he repre
sents that we were wrong in acting
thus prematurely it was an act ol
great discourtesy to say the least of
it having accepted the offered media
tionfor offered we believe it wasof
the government offrance to proceed
in so summary a way and threaten
the refractory greeks with that heavy
chastisement the bombardment of their
capital if they did not at once comply
with our demands it was very pro
voking no doubt to the foreign sec
retary to harve alrthis disputing abtt
the items of a long standing debt
which he believed himself perfectly
justified in demandingvery prqvok
ing and tantalizing with a fleet in the
piraeus a few broadsides from which
would very quickly bring these trouble
some greeks to their senses to be thus
put off and played with as it were it
scarcely comported with national dig
nity to be placed in such a position
much less to remain long in it but
then it may be inquired how came we
there at all we had an uudoubted
right to ask for a settlement of the ac
count nay to demand that it should be
paid without longer delay but not to
bully and bluster because we were
met by shifts and evasions snd to draw
the attention of all europe upon us by
a mode of procudure so unworthy of a
great and powerful nation this mat
ter should in the first instance have
been referred to a third power for arbi
tration and there left its immediate
settlement was not of so great conse
quence as to call for the blockade of
the greek ports the seizure of ship
ping the stoppage of commerce much
less the threat of bombardment the
carrying into effect of which would
have inflicted mischief and
misery upon the unoffending people
with whose government we were at
issue and very likely have involved us
in a war with one or more of the great
er european powers who might have
felt or feigned themselves aggrieved
by such a proceeding as it is sufficient
has arisen out of our impetuous and
impolitic conduct to justify serious
alarm for the peace of europe the
french ministry and their supporters
are or pretend to be quite in a fer
ment about the matter and the great
fear is that occasion may be taken to
provoke a war with this country m
order td divert the attention of he
people at home from their own un
popular acts and thus prevent or at
least postpone the political explosion
which seems imminent and inevitable
then we have the times talking
loudly about russia and almost hound
ing on that power to demand satisfac
tion at the hands of our government
for the insult and injury inflicted on
greece of which the mighty autocrat
is to be considered it seems as some
sort the ally and protector lord pal
merston wj know is no favorite with
the times and we think that the tone
assumed by this influential yet unprin
cipled journal on the present occasion
may very fairly be attributed to the ill
odour of tho foreign secretarys name
in printinghouse square we would
not judge harshly but this is the con
slusion to which we are driven by the
tenor of the remarks which have lately
appeared in ihe times we ourselves
think that on this as on several former
occasions lord palmerston has shown
to say the least great want of discre
tion able a diplomatist as he undoubt
edly is it cannot be denied that the
peace of europe has been mere than
once put by him into great jeopardy
calm and indeed should
that roan be who undertakes to regu
late the foreign relations of a country
especially one like ours upon which
other governments have so much rea
son to look with distrust and jealousy
amid the tortuous ways which lead
god is the father of us all and all men are brethren
through the labyrinth of diplomacy he
must be a keensighted a clearhead
ed we had almost said a passionless
man who can walk without arousing
rational jealousies offending national
prejudices and falling into the bottom
less pits of old quarrels and hatreds or
entangled in the thorny thickets
to dp pressing interests and sinister de
signs wheve shall we look for such
a man r and what shall we say of the
age and of the state of political morali
ty which requires such lynx eyed vigi
lance and excessive cautiou in those
who undertake to manage the foreign
policy of nations every now and then
the people of this or of that country
are informed that they are on the brink
of a war with their neighbors across
the river or the mountains or the sea
as the case may be and thus rudely
awakened from their pleasant dream
of peace and security they rub their
eyes and ask what it all means and
then comes out a long rigmarole about
their foreign secretary or their am
bassador having made a mistake or
said or done something disrespectful
to the representative of the nation
against which war is to be declared
or which is about to declare war against
them and aheap of papers are laid
on the table of their legislative as
sembly which they cannot read and
if they could would not be able to un
derstand in the least and when they
ask in all the innocence of simplicity
why the matter cannot be explained
and mutual apologies made ana thus
peaceably settled they are met with
the reply oh our national dignity
our national honor must be support
ed we cannot explain retract or
apologise at least not until after we
have expended blood and treasure in
the quarrel and done our neighbors
it may be our very good customers
all the mischief we can then it will
be quite consistent with our national
dignity and honor to take friendly
counsel togethor or to call in a third
party who shall make a satisfactory
arrangement of the matter and the
poor bewildered suffering people
cannot for the life of them understand
why this could not as well and better
be done first as last but such is the
custom of civilized christendom alas
alas for the common sense and the
religious convictions of a people be
wildered and perplexed by this diplo
matic jargonthis shibboleth of na
tional dignity and honor with
ships in the tagus and the darda
nelles and the canton river on the
coast of borneo and one knows not
where else ready to do the bidding of
consul or ambassador who may fancy
himself and his nation wronged or in
sulted or aggrieved in any way the
great wonder is not that we are so
seldom at war but that we are ever at
peace
tiie wife of kossuth
at the time when all was lost to the
hungarians and each had to seek his
own safety in flight governor kossuth
and his lady who had accompanied
her husband throughout the war
thought it best to separate in order
that one of them if possible might
save their lives for the sake of their
children who had been left under the
protection of their grandmother the
governor determined to remain with
his brave officers still with him and
to share their fate madam k in
formed her husband and a female
friend the wife of an officer where she
would endeavor to seek safety and
as every moment was precious this
delicate lady clothed herself as a beg
gar her husband gave her his signet
ring and the seal of the government of
hungary that these might be a pass
port for her in the event of her meet
ing with those who were friendly to
their cause without any clothes ex
cept those on her back she com
menced her sad and fatiguing journey
on foot she traveled long experien
cing all kinds of hardships privations
and dangers when stopped by the
austrian guards she feigned extreme
old age and said she was in search of
a little grandson who had got lost in
the war so they let her pass little
knowing the value of the prize they
had ir their bloody hands
thus she continued on until she
reached an extensive pasture country
uninhabited except by herdsmen al
most as void of intellect as the herds
they guarded here she sought and
found a resting place these poor
serfs made her a fresh bed of straw
covered her with their cleanest sheep
skins and fed her with their brown
bread and here she remained three
months during which time the winter
cold came on and having but little cov
ering you may easily conceive how
intensely she must have suffered
gov kossuth had sent for his children
that he might take leave of them and
give them his last blessing they were
brought to him by his mother and
again taken to their home the aus
trian executioner haynau had long
since commenced his bloody work
kossuth and those with him fled to
wards the turkish frontier to the for
tress of widden we cannot enu
merate all the sufferings losses and
anguish experienced by these unfortu
nate men during tbeir flight most of
them however reached widden
they were no sooner there thap their
first thoughts were of madam kossuth
and her friend the wife of the officer
to whom she had communicated the
place of her intended concealment de
termined to seek and find her if she
was still alive she sat out on her
wear journey habited in a similar
whole no 
guise as that of madam kossuthas
a beggarand thus she passed the sol
diers and guards of the enemy until
she reached the hiding place of her
friend who bad been the companion
of her youth in happier days and now
they were to encounter new dangers
the herdsmen built them a little cart
awjgave them a hofee as madam
ipuhku hr xoxipty priva
tions and sufferings wasnoiongerftbre
to walk the roads had now became
almost impassable narrow and slippe
ry on the sides of the mountains one
false step would have plunged them
down into an almost bottomless abyss
but with the gallows in their rear and
their husbands before them hope gave
them courage and onward they went
we know not what length of time they
occupied in their journey but as it
was in winter and they had often to
conceal themselves in clefts of rocks
and overhanging mountains from the
scouts of the enemy it must have been
a long and weary one and when dis
covered they passed for beggars and
asked for bread from their blood thirsty
foes tiiey ultimately reached the
town of belgrade where they expect
ed to find their husbands and a ter
mination of their sufferings imagine
then their feelings of disappointment
when they learned that not a hunga
rian was thereall had been removed
to shumla what was now to be done
they were worn out and could pro
ceed no farther hope even had for
saken them no husbands to embrace
no friends to welcome them they
decided to throw themselves upon the
humanity of the sardinian consul
they knocked at his door which was
opened by the consul himself two
beggar women stood before him the
pictures of misery and woe he ask
ed them what they wanted they an
swered food and shelter he re
quested them to come in then the
officers lady introduced him to madam
kotsuth wife of the president of
hungary he could not believe it
until she took from her bosom the sig
net ring and seal of government of
hungary what followed can easily
be conjectured they were received
according to their rank by the kind
hearted consul and after they were
sufficiently rested he made known
their case to the prince of seryia who
sent them his carriageandfour with
an eswort to take them to shumla
the weather was terribly cold and
the roads as bad as they could be but
they ultimately arrived in safetybos

thursday in congress web

lowa c
washington thurs june 
we had a grand opening in the
senate this morning first mr web
ster in his earnest massive manner
argued against striking out the texas
section of the bill embracing the set
ment of the boundary compensation
to texas for surrendering her claim to
newmexico btc sic he was grave
deliberate impressive fercible as
indeed he never fails to be
gov seward followed in reply he
opposed the amendmant on many
grounds but mainly because of this
determined opposition to every part of
the bill he would vote to kill the bill
as a whole and to kill it in detajlto
decapitate it or take it joint from joint
he considered this bill the great obsta
cle to action on the part of congress
that it had already delayed the public
business by months and was still ob
structing and preventing legislation
pressingly needed by the country
let this aggregation of incongruous
measures be withdrawn let the several
subjects included therein be taken up
separately and acted on and congress
might promptly and beneficently per
form its duty to the country
mr clay sprung up as gov s
concluded the senator from new
york charges the friends of this bill
with obstructing the progress of public
business  am amazed at this charge
we the majority of the senate ob
structing business have we pot
steadily and earnestly pressed forward
have we not been uniformly anxious
to bring these embarrassing contro
versies to a decision and have we not
been steadily resisted and impeded by
the senator from newyork and those
who act with him have they not sus
tained every proposition for delay
did they not waste weeks in opposing
the very appointment of the committee
of conciliation but for this resistance
of the minority we might have had this
measure before us two months earlier
than it was presented have they not
fought us in this spirit at every subse
quent step did they not propose to
lay the matter over for a week after
the death of mr chalhoun and have
we not just seen days wasted by them
on a motion for indefinite postponement
which was withrawn as soon as the
senate was ready to vote upon it wc
of the majority press fur action pro
s ress decision the other side has
ought for delay inaction postpone
ment yet we are accused of obstruct
ing the action of congress i repel
the charge with indignation
gen foote of miss next hobbled
up and threw his grotesque little per
son into all manner of unseemly con
tortions while he endeavored to ex
press bis inexpressible indignation and
amazement at gov sewaros inpiita
tion on the friends ot the bill he beat
out two or three of mr clays sugges
tions very thin and made of them a
speech quite respectablein length
b m bwn getting up
rather high tor inst hour and it win
well to rcplepigh the boilers by a sold
injection even of sap  i think the
genera s speech goo d
seward very briefly and cajm
y r joued ha bad intended to say
r to intimate only that this exiraqxdt
nary eombinatiaw of discordant mea
surea in one bill had inevitably delayed
and prevented action on ihe part f
congress u iul to that he adbeiwd
senators were required by this bill to
vote for or against measures they ap
proved in combination with measures
they utterly detestedmeasures they
were even instructed to support unsted
to measures they were instructed to re
sist if was this violation of all pre
cedent and the obvious maxims of
sound legislation which required one
thing to be acted on at a time which
had obstructed and prevented action
it was as though the majority of a
court bad decided instead of taking up
the cases on their calendar singly and
thus disposing of them to combina
them all in one issue swear all iko
witnesses hear all lh lawyers aad
send out the jury instructed to rsadw
one general verdict for the plaintiffs or
defendants oh all fhe cases taken to
gether if tfie minority of the court
this and stand for the old
way of trying each case uy oatif
might be accused of resisting and de
feating action but would thut be just
gen turney of tenn next got the
floor and made a speech dead against
the texas provisions of this bill as
robbing texas of a large territory and
organizing it as newmexico and thus
transferring it into free instead of
slave soil he esteemod this outrage
ous and did not see how any southern
man could abide it
col benton next began to speak
slowly in a low tone and not impres
sively he soon sent me into the
house
but  will not speak of the days
doings in the hall they were a lit
tle more belligerent than yesterdays
but the result was the sameooo
toombs of ga made an ugly speech
against the northern whigs und was
answered effectively by duer of our
state and exspeaker winthrop ba
ker of  also spoke pretty well you
will have the substance by telegraph
byt what use of talking we want
votes the ultra southerners were
violent but they are few hall of mo
strongly antibenton declared himself
in favor of california as she is there
will not be forty votes against her on
the final yeas and nays but oh that
seems such a weary way off i shall
quit to night and go home there is
little hope of any decisive action
soon
there was a vote by yeas and nays
at the outset this morning which may
be misapprehended it was on going
into committee on the california bill
which many strong friends of the bill
resisted at the moment because they

slave property we observe that
it is going the rounds of the newspa
pers that there are 
worth of slave property in the fifteen
slave states of this union this
we do not believe allowing three
millions of slaves this estimate would
be five hundred dollars a head for old
men old women and childrenlame
halt blind c as well as the young
and middle aged men and women
this estimate is too high two or
three hundred each at most would be
nearer the value of all sorts sizes sic
considered which would make the
market value from  to 
only but the real value is less than
nothing the slaveholders are eaten up
by them they must keep them find
and clothe them and pay the doctors
bills winter and summer whether they
have work for them or not indeed in
most cases it would be far cheaper to
hire their labor and again not only
the slaveholders but the country is
blighted and impoverished by the foot

and a curse both to master and slave

not acquainted with the etymology of
the word humbug it is a corruption
of hamburgh and originated it the
following mannerduring a period
when war prevailed on the continent
so many false reports and lying bulle

that at length when any one would
signify his disbelief of a statement he
would say you had that from ham

thirtyfirst congressfirst session
washington wednesday june 
the events in the senate today have been
rapid interesting some of them startling
and possibly important upon the final destiny
of the compromise bill for an hour in the
morning after the special order of the day
was calledwhich is now the omnibus or
compromise bill every day successivelyit
seemed as if the day was to be given to
business and not to speechmaking
a variety of amendments were offered by
friends to the bill or those who look upon it
with some indulgence but who desire to
make it better dissussed in short and perti
nent speeches and voted down one after ano
ther mr walker of wia moved two of
these amendments the fist of which proposed
to admit foreigners in the territories who
hould have declared their intention of be
coming citizens to vote at the elections and
upon the question of forming state govern
ments the other was to strike out the
provision of the bill which prohibits the ter
ritorial legislatures to discriminate between
residents and nonresidents in the matter ol
taxation
mr underwood moved to strike out the
appropriation of two sections of land in each
township to educational purposes and to sub
stitute an appropriation of one section in each
township only according to the fsrmer
practice except in the one ocoregon his
amendment met with the same fate and was
lost only eight senators voting m the affirma
tive ahowrng hat there is some generosity
left in the in the disposition of what
costs nothing
while things in the legislative line were
firogressing thus swimmingly there was a
ittle scene occurring in the center of the hall
which contrasted pleasantly with ihe wide
awake character of all around mr whitcomb
of la whose health i believe by the way is
not very good had sunk into a most profound
sleep his head depending in a picturesque at
titude over the back of his chair and swaying
back and forward as if abandoned by the
owner to its own volutions while his col
league mr bright who sat next to him
casting a half alarmed and comical look
around the galleries as if to see who was
watching the operation made several des
peate efforts to shake the drowsy senator
into consciousness all of which poved
failures the distinguished legislator from
the lioosier state persisted in this senatorial
snoose despite every exertion until aroused
possibly by the stentorian utterances of hi 
own nasal music when he awoke looking re
freshed and innocent
mr hales proviso on jefferson daviss
amendment was voted down without the for
mality of a division the amend itself pro
viding for the repeal of the mexican laws
one of the main reliances for keeping slave
ry out of the territorieswas honored by
the yeas and nays and was also rejected
yeas  nays 
mr foote who had struggled stoutly in
argument against the amendment as unneces
sary pernicious and directly in the teeth ol
the uniform southern pretension that those
lawe do not now exist in force and that the
constitution gives the right to the slaveholder
to take his slaves to the territories in spite ol
any laws to the contrary mr foote whe
said all this caved in when the voting came
round and went for the amendmentyielding
i suppose to the pressure of this position
finally mr underwood who likes to heal
work like the member of a western legisla
ture who got a few couples ol his neighbors
divorced without their consent because every
body else was doing something for their con
stituents and who seemed to be quite inno
cent of the intention of throwing such a
firebrand into the camp offered an amend
ment to the effect that if texas should re
fuse to accept the ten or twelve millions tu
be tendered her in consideration of a misera
ble claim to a mirerable desert without wood
or water she should be privileged to sue the
united states for a settlement of accounts
mr hunk flared up at die insult thus
offered to his state and seemed to think that
the proper remedy was to insult every body
elsethe senate the united states gen
taylor and the rest of mankind for all ol
whih mr badger gave him one of the mosi
genteel skinnings in a forensic way that you
ever listened to this had the effect tc
bring the valliant general down a peg or twe
and he finished off by reading a classical ex
tract from titus livius which he fanccd
presented a striking parallel with the wrongs
that texas is suffering at tlie hands of the
united states
mr webster thought the amendment un
necessary but that instead the president ol
the united stales should be instructed in
the happening of the contingency to sue
texas in a bill to test the tilth to new
mexico
mr foote showed no little alarm and
finally announced in the most formal and im
pressive manner that if the amendment were
persisted m it must prove the rum of the bill
that several senators had declared that n
would be a tine qua non with them that nc
such threat should be held in terrorem ovei
texas he entreated most pathetically that
mi underwood would withdraw his amend
ment mr underwood said that would dc
no good as it would be immediately removed
mr clay raised his placid head above the
waves to still the tumult by piopostng a
compromise he suggested that the amend
ment which he gently reproved his incau
itous colleague for thtowinginto the scathing
ocean of dissensions to increase the storm
should be withdrawn and if renewed by an
enemy of the hill should be voted down as
carlyle says incontinent and that after the
battle was fought out and the dead anti
wounded were duly cared for a joint resolu
tion should be brought in embodying the
question of the subsequent remedy in the
probable contingency of texas proving con
tumacious and refusing to receive the money
the old fox not being willing to be caught
in his own trap the union of different mea
sures in the name bill
this proposition seemed to be received as
a placebo by the majority of the friends of the
bill but unfortunately long experience has
proved that it is not so easy to buy the devil
as it is to raise hirn mr pearce of md
came to the rescue the whole broad ocean
of discussion in relation to ihe powers and
jurisdiction of the supreme court of the
united slates seemed to be opened and to
promise plenty of scope for a innathsdebate
he ended by giving in as hts sine qua non
that some feature shoald be incorporated in
this bill which would at all events secure a
final settlement of the question with texas
mr foote in despair moved an executive
session this seemed about to ire acceded
to when senators around the hall seized the
moment to give notice of amendments ad in
jimtum among those the most impoitant
was one from mi berrien to the effect that
the senators and representatives elect from
california be sent home with a flea in their
ear and that two denature and one represen
tative may be elected after the passage of this
bill in their steadand this he  an
nounced as his imr qua non he has consci
entious scruples and a lender conscience
the cup seemed now to be full mr clay
rose in hts wrath he said that fifty times
during the progress of this bill lie had been
upon the very point of giving up all hope ol
composing the discordant elements which
rule the destinies of the country and that
when he saw the spirit which was manifested
the disposition on the part of every one to
have his own way and to thwart by every
means in his power the progress of the bill
he was disposed to let them all go to the
devil together such was the substance of
his short harangue put however in more set
phases as it is difficult for henry clay to be
 sogry to be ornate and elegant in expres
sion
mr berrien hurled back his insinuations
and said that mr clay had said that he was
aiming to thwail fbt bill
mr clay contradicted him point blank
upon that point without taking luch trouble
to explain
mr berrien stated his position and re
iterated his srte qua non
mr foote deprecated excitement to which
mr clay replied with a look of mingled ex
haustion and despair you sir would be
excited  if you had my task to perform
the scene ended by voting an extra session
tomorrow the fight will be renewed

a free soil state convention
the friends of freedom in michigan with
out party distinction held a state convention
on the th ult at marshall calhoun co
the convention was called to order by hovey
k clark of marshall after which orlan
do moffatt of calhoun was chosen chairman
and f raymond of wayne secretary a
committee of six was chosen to draft reso
lutions expressive of the sense of the con
vention consisting of messrs clarke and
hussey of calhound thompson of branch
crane of baton thomas of kalamazoo and
curtis of oakland
the convention was them addressed by
messrs gibbs and champlain of calhoun
tripp of lenawee stocking of branch mc
bratney of wayne and others
the committee by their chairman re
ported the following resolutions which
after being fully discussed by dr cuitiu oi
st clair messrs clarke and hussef of
calhoun we nnmimously adopted aa fol
lows
resolved that we are in favor of the
application of the principles of freedom to
all territory within the reach of our political
power at all times and under all circum
stances against all supposed limitations of
great interests against all combinations and
against all compromises
resolved that these principles demand
the immediate recognition of the right of the
state of california to admission to the posi
tion of a sovereign state and that the denial
of this right as a concession to the interests
of slavery or any delay in granting it is an
outrage upon the citizens of california and
a violation of the established practice of our
government
resolved that the people of michigan
will in our judgment prove themselves faith
ful to the principles which they have repeat
edly asserted and that among these stand
first in their attachment the power of con
gress to prevent the extension of slavery into
territories now free and their duty to exer
cise it and that the action of the last
legislature of this state in the passage of
the rescinding resolutions wae procured
by the violation of most solemn pledges and
by the most unprincipled of political com
binations and from which the people will
yet vindicate themselves by the punishment
of their betrayers or submit to be degraded
to the position of the willing tools of one
great mans ambition
resolved that the new territories ask
ing that civil governments may be established
among them are entitled to be heard and
that in the organization of such governments
it is the right and duty of the north to insist 
upon the absolute prohibition of slavery
therein as the only means by which slave
ry ever has betn or can be restricted in its
extension in this country
resolved that the compromise bill re
ported by the senate committee of thirteen
like all compromises with slavety is another
proposition tar the surrender of northern
principle to the arrogance of southern pas
sion that we look upon it with abhorrence
as an insult to the northern men and es
pecially to northern juries that we expect
nothing from such compromises but their
inevitable result disappo iitment and de

slavery in california
in the course of his remarks at the com
plimoiiuiy dinner given to him by tb prin
ters and cilizens of albany the hon edward
gilbert thus alluded to the slavery question in
california
a queslioa of greater importance than
these on which he proposed to touch was
the question of slavery they believed they
had settled this question upon the highest
southern ground but he found they had
been led into a mistake so tar as the clause
of the constitution prohibiting slavety was
concerned it was adopted unanimously by
the convention which framed the constitution
and it was unanimously adopted by the peo
ple themselves applause the popula
tionof california for the most part waa com
posed of free laborers from the north and
the south and he placed himself among that
number loud applause they had taken
a solemn oath against slavery of every kind
that neither black slavery nor white slave
ry nor any other kind of slavery should
be tolerated in california thus far they
had accomplished thisapplause they
feel that if african slavery had been intro
duced into calitornia it will degrade free la
bor would never submit to that insult j
applause above and beyound that they
felt the spirit of the agp called for freedom
universal freedom applause and they would
be derelict to what they believed to be their
constitutional duty if they did not provide
for that the question of slavery then so
far as california was concerned was settled
the decision had gone forth it would never
be changed if there were a laten t hope
among the opposition to the admission of i
california that by delay slavery might be
introduced he might as well say at once it
never can great and loud continued ap
plause he felt as he spoke for he in
common with thousands and thousands might
in the vicissitudes of life be forced to dig
for gold and never he believed could they
bring slaves to labor along side of ireetnen
their conscience education principles told
them slavery was wrong they did not de
sire to ride this question they had no po
litical aspirations depending upon it it was
an all pervading principle

has been a wonderful fuss over a mummy at

and was supposed to be a princess  pries

much care in regard to highly excited litefary
taste in boston and in regard to the science
of mummymaking as well as the presump
tion that jewels or manuscripts or something
else very valuable or curious might he found
entombed in this relic of mortality
before the unrolling of the antiquated
thirty we had many literary strictures and
lectuies from the learned in boston and
about in regard to the genealogy of the the
bans of whom the mummy was suposed to
be a royal relic one important point was
to make out that the thebans were a dif
ferent race from the poor black creatures that
mope now among the ruins of the cfy of a
hundred gates oh no it would be bad
taste enough to be paying great respect to the
corpse of a nigger it it be royal we were
assured therefore by the learned doctors that
he thebans were not africans but a nobler
race and had none of the peculiarities of
niggerdom although this did not quite
agree with heroditus and their colemporary
historians nevertheless the learned were sure
it must be so
well the poor old mummy was at length
stripped of its swadiing clothes snd disem
boweled and furnished evidence of ittle else

i american religion and american
slavery
what makes the antislavery warfare most
diffcult and dangerous is the fact that sla
very has long been incorporaild with the religi
ous ideas and institution of the americas
people to buy sell transfer to whip chsiq
and fetter a brother man has been long deem
ed consistent with good fellowship in the
church of the living god and not in compa
tible with a life devoted to pure religion the
very rev chief priests of our religion have
gone the length to asset t that slavery is it
self of divine appointment that in seme
cases it is a high christian duty to hold the
slave in bondage a class less ultra but not
less mischievous than this speak of slavery aa
an evil but that the evil tails upon the mas
ter not upon the slave a more numeroui
class still with bible in hand and faces turn
ed heavenward solemnly declare that while
they fully admit the great evil of slavery
they that the church of god haj
any right lo interfere wilh it they contend
that neither christ nor his apostles evei
made slaveholding a barrier to christian fel
lowship that what christ and his apostlei
never did the church of christ has no ngh
to do that it is ihe duty of the preacher tc
preach the gospel to seek the salvation oi
souls and never to interfere with the lawt
and civil arrangements of society that th
latter must be left to the statesman with
out attempting to decide which type of these
opinions is the most objectionable and injur
ious we may say what must be evident tc
the reader that the whole taken together
has but one aim and leads to but one result
the preservation and perpetuation of slavery
and render al efforts at emancipation both
difficult and dangerousdifficult because the
public ear is chained to the pulpet where the
voice of mercy and justice cannot reach it
dangerous to the humble reformer because
in opposing the abomination under the altar
the crafty priest finds it easy to misrepresent
him as assailing the altar itself and as disign
ing not only to destroy slavery but the re
ligion of the lamb of god thus the chuich
is not only the strongest bulwark of slavery
but it is the point most secure from attack
in her hand is lodged to a large extent the
powers of life and death and woe to the man
who falls a victim to her wrath and provokei
her exterminating thunder he who would
know w hat it is to he isolated in the midst ol
men to see himself regarded with averted
eyes to be an object of general hatred and
suspicion to be deserted and shunned bv all
former fiiends to seea vigorous reputation
wither under the insidious poison of private
slander and to see his business prospects dar
kened and at last destroyed may drink thu
full cup of sorrow by a bold and faithful ex
posure of the wicked position of the ameri
can church and clergy of all motives for
persecution the blindest and most bitter ii
hat which falsely calls itself religion its
thirst is satisfied with nothing short of the
blood at every blow to make war upon the
church of the living god what less than
the dames of hell is an adequate punishment
for such a heavendaring crime what speak
evil of the men who minister at the altar of
the most high for such reckless wicked
nee for such aactilegious temerity let his
character be blasted forever brand him infi
del stamp him atheist call him dieorganixer
and warn the world against him as a most
dangerous man such is but a faint picture of
the malignity of religious persecution as it is
at this moment carried on against the aboli
tionists illustrations of the truth ofthiastate
ment may be found in nearly all the peiiod
icals of the leading denominations of profess
ing christians in this country the conduc
tors of these journals aim to crush in the
most summary manner any man who will
pursue sin to the door of the church the
fear of offending the church the dread of her
overwhelming power seala the lips of many
a timid soul whose heart yearns in sympatny
with the crushed and plundered bondman
there then is the great difficulty slavery
is protected by the church and the church
is regarded as the highest object by the peo
ple her they will stand by right or wrong
many who see this and understand the crimi
nal connection of the church with slavery
and the vital support which she gives to it
nevertheless shun to majes war upon her
and aeek the downfall of slavery through
some other channel they would be ene
mies to slavery and would at the same time
stand well with the church they therefore
sympathize with the slave simply as politi
cians not as christians they would not have
the distracting subject introduced into the
churchbut would gladly tee the evilremoved
by political means this proves the mighty
power of the church and shows with whai
impunity she may shelter sin and how
secure the abominations of slavery and war
may real under the pulpit
we hold and have held for the last ten
years that for the existence of slavery the
american church and clergy are not only
responsible but are the only body which has
the power to abolish slavery in the land it
the dungeon of american bondage be firmly
locked the american church has the key
in the present circumstances of our cause
owing to the discussions with respect to the
extension of slavery we fear attention has
not been as closely fixed upon the church as
her importance demands she should never
be forgotten a the foster mother of the infernal
system of human bondage and in proportion
to the timidity of the many should he the
boldness of the few in exposing her corrup
tions
politic hare no powet tc sustain slavery
as religion has the latter has to do with
mens consciences sympathies and eternal
interests it shakes the trembling spirit over
the vast and solemn expanse ot eternity it
teaches him the shortness of time the little
now of earthly objectsthat this life is but a
probationary state in which our character and
destiny are to he determined forever the
ministers of this religion stand before the
people and proclaim their words under the
general admission that they are called and
qualified to make known the mind of the ever
living and true god as a consequence they
are heard with respect attention and defer
ence such as arc paid to none oiher they
can speak when all beside them must be si

the letter of benjamia coates
having tecently given our views on the
subject of african colonization we deem it
unnecessary to go into a lengthy reply to the
letter of mr benjamin coates the points
by him have boon answered satisfac
torily to our own tniad times without num
ber ilc seems amazed at the amount of
prejudice which the colored people entertain
towaids the american colonization society
we assure him that there is something more
than prejudice and it is an intelligent appre
ciation both of the men composing that so
ciety and the measures they proposed it
has created more prejudice in this country
against the free colored manraised against
him a greater amount of hostility than the
infant republic of liberia will be able to
atone for in fifty years it has taught the
nation that we are low ignorant and besotted
that our elevation in this country is im
possible that afiioa and not america is
our country and some of its members have
gone the scandalous length of tecommending
the enactment of stringent laws against our
rights and liberties with a view to our coer
cion and final expatriation it is is not at all
surprising that colored men should contem
plate that society with other than feelings of
complacency
for ourselves we look with suspicion on
any medium which propose to free the nation
from its unrighteous treatment of the colored
people that does not involve a deep and radi
cal repentance to remove the objects of
american hatred is not to remove that hatred
itself it is a climbing up some other way
and is therefore to be discarded webeg
and entreat our colonization friends to desist
from their colonization scheme and to al
low its sufficient repose toresume that course
of steady improvement which has marked and
will continue  mark the progress of colored
men in this the land of theit nativity
for more than two hundred years we have
been the constant campanions of the white
man and the joint possessors with him of
this country and ihe readiness with which
we adapt ouiselves to the circumstances
around us induces the belief that we eland
as good a chance of advancement here in all
things pertaining to human walfare as we
should do were we instantly transformed to
the western coast of africar a
ft  the letter of m r delany which
takes up a large share of our editorial apace
deseives perhaps a few words from us in reply
with all that he says as to the desirableness
of cultivating amicable feelings among those
whose end and aim is the abolition of sla
very and the elevation of the free colored
people we most heartily agree we shall
probably go as far in promoting such feel
ings as he himself would desire and as far
as is compatible with the free expression of
our honest convictions in respect to the con
duct of our public men
identity of color does not forbid a difference
of opinion and having a commmon object
does not prohibit a free expression of that dif
ference and in the light of these facts we
expressed our sentiments in respect to the
conduct of ward in consenting to address a
public meeting in philadelphia in a colored
church where colored peoj le themselves
were by the terms of the call that convened
that meeting expressly denied the right to
a seat in the lower part of the building which
was expressly and exclusively appropriated
to white persons
we have reexamiinined what we said in
the north star to which mr delany
takes exception and we find nothing in it so
grossly personal as to justify the implied
censure which our friend delany has so feely
lavished upon us one must be stiuck on
reading his letter with the appropriateness
of his advice if applied to himself in cor
recting ourerrors he has followed the example
of many others who have presumed to give
advice by doing the very thing himself
which be disallows in us he compares our
comments upon mr wards handbill to th
uncivilized vulgar attacks of thcmississippi
ruffian and ho goes on imputing by im
plication to be sure such base motives for
our conduct as jealousy envy and mea n
ambitionall of which we think quite gratu
itous and uncalled for we undertake to
affirm that our whole course of conduct to
wards mr ward and we think that the
columns of the north star will bear us out in
our affirmation up to his recent visit to
philadelphia has displayed marked admira
tion of his very superior talents and a high
appreciation of his charactei as a man
when we debated with him in new york a
year since we bore this testimony to his de
portment in that debate he showed himself
a skillful debater as well as a powerful de
claimed and certainly possessed a large power
over the intelligent audience before him with
an opponent of such genius and magnanimi
ty it affords us pleasure to discuss any ques
tion of difference these were our words
one year since on the th may  we
used the following language with respect to
mr ward frederick douglass was followed
by samuel r ward who for about 
minutes poured forth a brilliant stream of
wit humor and argument fairly blistering
the unfortunate mr grant does this look
like ambition envy or jealousy when we
found ourselves assailed on the platform
during the last anniversaries in new york
after encountering and silencing the clamor of
the mob on retiring from the platfbrmwho of
all the talented colored men who were pre
sent did we select to complete the triumph of
human brotherhood over vulgar prejudice
but samuel r ward if we differ with him
now it is not that we love him leu but free
dom and equality more and if m r de
lany should ever venture to hold a public
meeting in the city of rochester or else
where on the proslavery conditions of driv
ing the negro into a separate pew be shall
find us equally ready to denounce such
conduct on his part persona must be respect
ed but principles are above persons and we
must follow the latter though they bring us
into conflict with the whole worldf d

have determined to celebrate the th of july
in that city by opening a fine temperance

and shall probably spend several days in

published in pamphlet form the latter con
tains the call for the convention and tho
introductory sermon by the rev c c
boynton together with sundry letters from
distinguished persons in different pans of the
country who had been invited to attend but
who were unable to be present
this pamphlet also contains a very eloquent
and earnest address by the convention to the
american churches we doubt not that ike
effect of the convention will be beneficial to
the cause of the slave yet we cannot but re
gret that among all the distinguished men
invited to attend it there does not adfcm to
have been one associated with the oldorgani

enced a sad and mortifying damper
the charges made against you were in
consequence of a handbill calling a meeting
gotten up in philadelphia by the whites ex
pressly for yourself the conditions of which
were degrading to the colored people altho
the meeting was to be held in a church be
longing exclusively to themselves having
colored trustees and a colored pastor the
offensive part of which read thus the
lower part of the house will be reserved ex
clusively for white persons who arc particu
larly invited to attend the complaint
against you is that concerning this most pal
pable insult to your intelligence you were
silent during your address
if this charge had come from any other
source than one so reliable as that of freder
ick douglass i would not fot a moment have
placed any confidence in the statement and
since i have seen but one side of the story
not having had an opportunity of seeing your
version of it justice impartiality and per
sonal friendship would induce me to stay
judgment in a measure until an opportunity
offered of hearing both sides
but taking the premises for granted how
can it be possible that samuel r ward
himself a coloied man and an avowed enemy
of all that tends to injure our causesamuel
r ward a professedly hightoned antisla
very manhe of whom governor seward
aid that he never heard true eloquence
until he heard samuel r ward speakhe
of whom horace greeley declares that capt
rvnders and dr grant the famous demo
cratic leaders of the infidel club of tammanv
hall compared with whom are but second
rate monkeyshe of whom a recent writer
in ihe philadelphia leger says he beemed
an animated statue of black marble of the old
egyptian sort out of which our white civili
zation was hewn every degrading associa
tion dropped away from his color and it was
as rich in its blackness as the vplvet pall on
the bier of an emperorhe whom i beheld
at the great free soil convention at buffalo
in  in the midst of assembled thousands i
lawyers judges priests politicians mem
bers of congress and senatorsstepping out
upon the scaffold in the dignity of manhood
without a superior in the crowded multitude
pealing forth in strainsof majestic eloquence
bearing a living representation of those divine
like philosophers who originated mysteries in
ethiopia the sciences in egypt and gave
civilization to the white races of europe
how could such a man as this stand up under
the circumstances charged in the premises to
the dishonor of himself and the disgrace of
hisiace this i confess i cannot realize
this error if committed at all can only be
explained and excused on one point aloneii
must have been an error of the head and not
of the heart and i now call upon yon
sir to give satisfaction at the earliest possible
hour to your numerous friends and admirers
throughout the country on this point at issue
but it is seriously to be regretted that a
hostile feeling appears to exist between mr
douglass and yourself in consequence of
your position you are both menof great
intellectual capacities endowed with much
abilitymen of great celebrity and notoriety
the reputed leaders among your people in
this country being the conductors of the only 
two existing secular newspapers devoted to
the elevation of our tace this being con
ceded you will permit one of the humblest 
individuals among the common people for 
whom you are directing your efforts to give
you his opinion without being charged with j
an impudent interference in a matter that
does not concern him
whatever difference exieta between mr 
douglaee and yourself especially in this in i
stance a mere difference of opinion and
should be so considered and treated and 
would say to mr douglass that with this
view of the subject  cannot therefore under
any circumstances in the case justify the rash
mannei in which he attacked you when
we differ with an honorable man we attack
bis position and not the individual and noth
ing will justify haish personal attacks but an
assault from a dishonorable opponent and
personal enemy and i think a little sober
reflection will satisfy both on this point when
mr d will be willing as he should be to
make acknowledgment for the wrongs done
in this case  mean wrong in the manner
and matter of the attack even though the
allegations were all true to the letter for it
does not appear irom anything that mr
douglass complains that the attack was pro
voked by any course of yours towards himself
personally
you cannot find in the history of enlight
ened deliberations where great rnen distin
guished for their talents however opposed to
each other in position have made such bitter
personal attacks in denunciation of each
other as have passed between you espe
cially in this instance by mr douglass
none i think can be found except it should
be the uncivilized vulgar attacks of the
mississippi ruffian foote of the u s senate
to whom i will liken neither of you in his
outlandish assaults upon the hoaty sage of
missouribenton and upon other advocates
of liberty in the councils of the nation this
and similar cases are the only instances and
these men are wholly without character or
reputation save their heathenish ferocity and
daring impudence
it will not do to justify these things in us
because they are done by the whites this
is no excuse for us  deny that the same
things are done by white men under similar
circumstances occupying the same position
among their people as you occupy among us
a people wholly oppressed all making
struggling efforts for liberty and elevation
among their oppressors have no time to spend
in personal hostility towards each other r ea
pecially among their leaders ive camk
afford to be dividedit costs too much
expense is greater than we can bear it
do for others but it will not do for us nor any
people circumstanced as we are we must
learn adrptationlearn to suit outselves to
the time or the occasion and be equal to any
emergency let others do as they may
this we must do for ourselves if we ever
expect success in the glorious cause of self
elevation
in the american struggle fur liberty against
british despotism supposing washington
warren hancock jefferson and other great
men leaders among the people had ceased
their mutual counsel and cooperation and
commenced hostility among themselves be
cause of a mere difference of opinion what
would have beeome of the common people
both civil and military and the cause of ame
rican liberty this cause being in the hands
of the leaders it is not hard to determine
and shall our cause suffer violenoe in our first
tottering steps at advancement just heaven
decree otherwise
the injury done to our people at large by
these proceedings and the sacred cause in
which you have embarked is
your conception it was on the very morning
of the reception of the extra favored by a
friend in philadelphia and before opening it
that a gentleman stepped up to me suggest
ing the idea of sending for s r ward to
pay pittsburgh a visit when on opening
the package  held in my band what a tale
did it unfold this of course had its
effect thus while others are writing you
into fame you are writing each other down
the public has pronounced upon you as
aspirantsjealous of each others popularity
rivals contending for precedence in the
annals of fame with a determination to ac
complish the design of personal ambition
ihougt it be done over the ragged fragments
of the liberties of your almost hopeless
struggling people the friends of mr doug
lass say ward is jealous of douglass pop
ularity while the friends of mr ward on
the other hand say douglass is jealous of
ward and garnet lest they become as popu
lar throughout ihe country as himself and
this sir you give them good reasen to say
while you continue this personal hostility
towards each other for a division among you
causes a division of sentiment among the peo
ple in regard to you who should and other
wise would be united in a oneness of feeling
toward you
aside from these bickerings the noble ef
forts of you both in the holy cause of your
oppressed brethren and downtrodden humaui
ty have been praiseworthy indeed proud
indeed would  feel at the thought that even
in a lifetime it were possible for me to attain
half the highstanding and respect that is
now either of your privilege to enjoy bui
whatever estimate i may set upon sudh a
proud privilege i had rather remain in ob
scrurity as i am than attain such a position
at the expense of anothers destiny nay

frederick douglass i have often
thought that i should like to converse with
you on a subject on which we seem to differ
in opinion very materially and aware as i
am of the great prejudice that you entertain
in common with most of your

with which you associate
that i takn a great interest

you the subject that i wish to presennw
k with all your prejudice is african coloisl
lion were you a less intelligent man than
you are i acknowledge that i should consider
the task a hopeless one but i cannot bring my
mind to believe that frederick douglass
with his power of judging between cause and
effect can fail to see that the elevation of the
colored man in any part of the world must
have a favorable influence on his race and
that the establishment of an independent re
public of colored men on the west coast of
africa acknowledged by the most powerful
and the most civilized nations of europe
having commercial intercourse with all parts
of the civilized worldthus bringing the citi
zens through the medium of their commerce
into social communication with the citizens of
every clime and particular y with the un ted
states as the country from whence they emi
grated whoso language they speak and
where some of their friends and relations still
residethus appealing directly and powerfully
to the sense of justice and alt the nobler feel
ings of our nature by proving to what the col
ored man can attain under favorable circum
stances conclusively destroying the only argu
ment that many honest and good men enter
tain that he cannot take care of himself and
must therefore be kept in slavery but also
and which perhaps i am sorry to say it is
of more we appealing to the selfinterest
of the whites thn love of gain which is a
powerful incentive the american character
and so strong in it as to overcome even the
prejudice of color or caste arising from slavery
 hat this must be the case and is the case
already to some extent  know and having
teen the evidence myselfhaving had oc
cassiou very often to aid my liberian friends
m their purchases both in this city and new
s ork where their money has obtained foy
them in many cases a consideration thar
iheir color alone would not and with the in
crease of liberia in the power of her gov
ernment and her extended commerce must
naturally flow a much greater intereourse
think you not mr douglass that the
man who may be turoej out of a railroad car
ot is not allowed to get into an omnibus to
day on account of his color should he re
turn from africa next year with his camwood
his palm oil or his gold dust consigned to his
commission merchant here and goes oat
through our cities to make his purchases is
a different man in the estimation of the com
munity from him who is content to stay here
and sell old clothes black boots or dress
fine and drive the young ladies along broad
way orwith their white aprons on make such
good servants at our hotels which of the two
ist me ask you mr douglass is doing most
for his race for his brethren in bonds the
servant or the bootblack here or the freeman
he farmer or merchant of liberia  i do not
ask vou to praise the colonization society
nor to speak well of those who have sustained
it through all its difficulties and embaras
nents if it pleases you best and accord
with your taste and inclination to impute un
worthy motives to in it do
so i am very willingrawhe to bear my
full share of the odium that you may think
proper to throw on colomzationiste and for a
private individual my zeal will entitle me to
ot a vety small portion of the wrath that
should be visited on the heads of those who
have aided by their exettions their influence
their money this most diabolical and wicked
scheme as it has been termed it is not to
deprecate your wrath or your censure that i
write although i believe the time will come
and that before many years when fredeiick
douglass will i convinced that african
c lonization is one of the most povvertul
means not only for regenerating africa but
for regenerating america in effecting ihe
abolition of slavery and aiding largely in the
emancipation of the free colored population
of the united sates from th weight of
prejudice that keeps them down paralyses
their exertions and crushes their hopes and
that being so convinced he will have the man
liness arid independence to acknowledge that
the men who have accomplished this are not
quite such bad men as he had taken them to
be not altogether such an association of foojs j
and knaves as they are represented i am fully
aware of the difficulties you would encounter
afte r oveicoming the deeprooted prejudice o f
your own mind in going counter to the gen
eral sentiment of your friends in acknowl
edging your error and their error in this re
spect had i time and was it important to my
present purpose  coaid prove to you that the
most zealous colonizationists those on whom 
the cause depends for support and who have
sustained it through all its difficulties are the
friends of the colored man in america as
well as as in africa that the most prominent
friends of the colonization cause in one state
were among the truest friends of the colored
man in advocating his rights to citizenship in
pennsylvania by resisting the introduction ul
tli e word while in our late convention for re
vising the constitution a few years since
who ate the friends of ihe emancipation
cause in kentucky and who have labored
so hard and persevering to accomplish it the
last year against the proscriptive influence
of the proslavery party nearly every man
of them colonizatioiusts the breckenijaps
young cassius m clay and so on and in
your own state who has more manfully ad
vocated the right of tiie colored man than
horace grleley i presume that you are
ready to say as i believe you have said be
fore that there are honorable exceptions and
that in charging upon colonizationist a ha
tred to the black man you do not mean
to include some good well meaning mejh 
who have been misled by the scheme now
sir here is where i think you make the mis
take you are accustomed to consider col
onization as a southern scheme got up and
sustained by slaveholders to git rid of the
few colored population that they may the
more scarcely hold then slaves and in sup
port of this opinion you will quote from
speeches from southern mer made in favor
of african colonization where the free man
of color is as a nuance or un

from the
men that comiwpeople are in the habit of
calling upon for aid looking to as their friends
at times of difficulty
ae a case in point i sea in the last num
ber of the north star of june lb a letter
from mr j b yashonof pittsburgh calling
colonization the twinsisler of slavery and
denouncing every man who allows himself to
be colonized in africa as an enemy to the
slave and a traitor to the antislavery cause
yet when in pittsburgh a few years since
i saw mr yashon and had a conversation
with him on the subject of colonization in
the course of which  asked him who he
called upon when they wanted to build a
church or for aid to the colored manwhether
it was not such men as hon walter fotward
or charley brewer esq  thbnly coloni
zationists that i happened to know yet he
said these very men that his son was then
studying law with mr forward and that mr
f had endorsed his note at a  ank for several
thousand dollars mr brewer too they
looked upon as a friend in need yet both
these men do more for colonization than nine
teeuiweitieihs of the whole population of
south carolina mr yashon informed me
at the same conversation that his son intended
to emigrate to france or mexico and has
since then i learn gone tb or suffered him
self to be colonized in haiti has he ihus
proved himself an enemy to the slave ls
and an enemy to the antislavery cause
or is it only going to africa that makes this
gre at difference
but  see that you do not make this dis
tinction as you say in the same paper in reply
to horace greeley to our apprehension
it is far more noble on the part of the free
colored people to remain here struggling
against the adverse winds of and
slavery than selfishly to quit the country
with a view of bettering their own condition
you say further let mr greeley complain
as much as he may of our determination to
remain here it shall go hard with us befote
we shall consent tc leave these shores while
three million of ourcountrymen are in chains
we ate resolved to fall or flourish with
them
well sir i can hardly suppose lh horace
greeley or any other righllhinkug man
does wish frederick douglass to leave these
shores such men as yourself samuel k
ward h h garnet and a few others are
no doubt doing as much good for your race
and probably a good deal more than if you
were in africa but is that a reason for
pieventing those who are not so favorably cir
cumstanced who have not had the opportu
nity for displaying their native talents here
and are so situated as not readily to acquire
the education necessary thereto from emi
grating to africa or any where else if they
desire it without being denounced as self
ish as an enemy to the slave and a
traitor to the antislavery cause  think
you would hardly like to be judged by your
own principles were you not born in mary
land does not slavery exist there and
he you not left yoar brethren in bonds to
settle call it colonize or emigrate as you
please in western new yoik to breathe the
air of freedom while your brethren are suf
fetlng under the jash in maryland was
that selfish are you thereby an enemy to
the slave and a traitor to the antislavery
cause i should say by no means that
although you are enjoying a state of freedom
and equality that you could not have done in
maryland yet you have acquired an educa
tion and move in a society that you could not
obtain in a slave state you edit a paper
and can lecture to your countrymen both
white and colored on theevil of slavery and
accomplish in this way a thousandfold more
for your oppressed brethren than if you had
remained in your native state is it not so
is not every colored man who leaves the
south when he was born and when his
brother in chains yet remain enabled to do
more for them here with greater opportunity
of acting on public sentiment than by remain
ing there j yet according to your doctrine
for the principle is the same precisely no
one should leave the southern states while
slavery exists you not only came away
from it yourself but if i mistake not you
are willing to aid others in doing the same
even to colonizing in canada in a cold un
congenial climate and where their efforts
cannot so well tell on slavery in the southern
states all this i by no means object to
any condition in my opinion is better than
slavery but if you can see the consistency
of denouncing those who escape from slavery
or from the prejudice arising from slavery
which cramps all their energies to a county
where they can enjoy all the rights of man
to a country governed entirely by slavehold
erswhere they can make themselves re
spected and bring all their talents all their
industry all the influence of their associated
force through the government established by
themselves to bear directly on slavery and
in favor of their oppressed brethren both bond
and free and be satisfied with yourself for
doing thing is more than i can
the who
the followers of fox and
persecution in england
would they have
accomplished more by remaining in england
where they were oppressed and taxed to sus
tain what their conscience could not consent
to by colonizing america and building up a
government based on the principlesffree
dom i cannot believe that you so think
and why you should not be willing that your
colored brethren should enjoy the privileges
that you could accord to your while brethren
is to me a mystery the fact isallow me
to say sothat you do youtself injustice in
this matter as well as your brethren you
have looked at one side of the picture so long
and so intently that you see the
other a few weeks since in publishing the
account of the mass meeting of colored men
in st louis in favor of colonization when
mt bell declared his intention   remove to
liberia and saying that the few months he
spent there was the only real freedom that he
had known in his life you asked what ails
the man has he been to africa since
he published iiis pamphlet allow me to
say sir the error was with yourself you
published only part of his remarks and that
part the most unfavorable to liberia and in
endeavoring to give a wrong view to others
you got a wrong view yourself and perhaps
really convinced yii√üragjfijtjiat mr b had
given a discouraging account of the country

that colomzalionimjflh√ühftlering an ac

the london standard of the th pub
lishes the following particulars of a slaver
by h m schooner bermuda lieut jolly
the bermuda it seems was at anchor
off the isle of pines on the south side of
cuba on the lh qlt when a low suspi
cious lookingbrig was discovered outside
steering for land hut without showing any
colors suspecting the vessel to be a slaver
l eut jolly immediately got his little vessel
under way and stood out for the purpose of
overhauling and examining her the brig
however on discovering the bermuda at
once altered her course and made all sail ofl
the land the bermuda in chase and it was
not until after a run of  hours when the
chase had made considerable way into the
gulf of mexico that the burinuda succeeded
in disabling her and making her a prize
in the course of the chase eighty shots
were fired from the bermuda many of which
told on the rigging which was eventually so
disabled as to make her an easy prize she
proved to be the clementio of rio janerio
 tons brazilian measurment commanded
by joas goncales bandeira she had on
board when taken  slaves of whom
several have died since their capture from the
slate of debility in which they were in con
sequence of the want of food which was en
irely out when she was captured the ves
sel had brazilian papers dated in novem
ber  and prior to her surrender she
hnsted brazillian cslors she had taken a
cuban pilot on board and was about to land
her cargo on ihe isle ot pines when discover
ed fv h m schooner
the brig is a very beautiful one and a
clipper she is coppered and said to be
worth one thousand pounds
the vessel and cargo will be proceeded
against in the vice admiralty court under the
british statute which especially gives juris
diction to the vice admiralty courts in sim
ilar cases
the africans are to be landed this morn
ing at fort augusta as we have been gjven
o understand
the same journal of the th gives the
following account of the disposition of the
slaves
the african who formed the cargqj
ihe brig clementio prize to  m schoonot
bermuda were landed to the number of 
all who survive of the  on borad the prize
at the lime of her capture on tuesday morn
ing at fort augusta jn compliance with an
order of the executive from which period
they are placed under the charge of the prin
ciple officers of the customs of kingston we
learn that as a bony the africans were m
better health and condition than they are
usually landed in after so long a voyage a
few of them however were affected with
scurvy and were very weak and it is proba
ble that several deaths will yet take placc
ainong them the majority of them are re
presented as being healthy and comparatively
strong
they will remain at fort augusta until
adjudication of the vessel and cargo by the
vice admiralty court and i hey will then no
doubt be placed under the charge of the
agent genoral of immigration to be dispos
ed of by him according to the provisions of
the british statute which directs that any
slaves taken and condemned in jamaica should
be apprenticed out for seven years these
people cannot of course come within the
ptovisions of our immigration acts we hope
that whenever it becomes the duty of the ex
ecutor or others to dispose of ihe cargo they
will be carefully apportioned among agriouhral
applicants and not enverted into domestic ser
vants as a former cargo was many years
ago to the great injury of the people them

sons of temperancean outrage
the national division of the sons of tem

to  that the admission of negroes irtto the

and palpable violation of the constitution of
the order which declare that any man of

decision we repeat is a violation of the con

the rights of members who have united with
the order nut deeming that it was to be

antislavery convention
a christian anti slavery convention call
ed together by a few of the ministers in
ottawa and its vicinity was held in the latter
part of the last month at that city which
was well attended and presided over by revj
chauncey cook the opening sermon was 
preached by rev owen lovejoy and a
series of resolutions drafted by a commit
tee consisting of messrs mcarthur love
joy barrett and steele was presentedtand
adopted on the subject of the
church to slavery which was as
whereas we believe slavery to be
iff fearful magnitudean impious invasion of
human rightand whereas the chuich of
was instituted for the purpose of op
jg√ü all sin and has the power by generat
htpjrhealthful public sentiment to secure
right political action so that no power could
sustain slavery in the face of its combined op
position and as its present position tends to
strengthen those political influence which
result in oppressive enactments therefore
 resolved that the religious organiza
tionschurchesecclesiastical bodiesand
missionary associations who do uot array
their influence against american slavery are
tesponsible for its existence and continuance
with all its horrors and abominations and all
those who are in connection and fellowship
with those bodies are individually partaker
in the guilt
 resolved that the light which sixteen
yearsof extended and f aithful discussion has
thrown upon the subject of human rights
has brought the churches and great religious
organizations into a posiion where they must
either abjpre american slavery by disfellow
shiping those who practice or defend it or
forfeit all claim to the and to
acortlutent regard for
tenets of an evangelical faith
 resolved that no legislative enact
ments can make it wiong to aid in the escape
of fugitives slaves from bondage and in the
event the bill now pending before the united
states senate for the recapture of fugitive
slaves beemtes a law we shall feel under ob
ligations ityobey god rather than man disre
garding its requirement
the proposal to form a permanent ecclesi
astical organization on antislavery principles
was fully discussed and referred to a com

an incident of ihe siave tradea
gentleman lately from missouri relates to us
the following incident a slaveholder in the
southern part of missouri started for califor
nia taking with him a slave whom he had
promised should accompany him to the mines
and then have an opportunity of earning
enough to purchase ins liberty and that of his
wife and his children the master proceed
ed as far as st louis and there placed him
in a slave pen and sold him for  the
agreement between the master and slave was
as the latter related it to our informant that
he should him to the mines and
work for hours every day and have
the his time to dig on hi own
hook he was to pay his master eight hun
dred dollar for his liberty six hundred for
his witeeffcnd tour hundred each for his
htldren my heart was high said
the negro as he related his story as i
thought of the proepect of becoming free nd
having my wife and children but think how
felt and the teats rolled down his cheeks
when massa sell me to get money to carry
aim to gold mines oh dareer o god for

the story was heart rending says our

the catholic mu  oa sletery
amidst the developments which the vari
ous denominations of protestants are making
of their views and position on the absorbing
subject of slavery it is important to arcertain
the views of the large body of roman catho
lics whose votes and influence are to have
not a little bearing upon the issue at some
stage of its progress this position has sel
dom been defined they have had on many
accounts a reputation of a friendly attitude
in reference to the subject and which we
hoped really belonged to them it would
seem however according to a late exposition
of the doctrine of the church given by rev
dr cammings at the tabernacle and to
which public attention had been invited as a
formal and authoritative expose of the catho
lic position that the catholic church takes
about the same ground as the southern pro
testant churches she proposes to take no
ultra rash or extreme grounda model ol
conservatism in this as in all other reforms
christs command to render unto cesar the
things that he cesars and pauls practical
comment thereon in sending a runaway slave
back to his master as a slave are the key of
the churchs doctrine on this point the
slavery of christs and the apostles day
could not have been violently abolished with
out overthrowing the civil institutions and
jurisprudence of the times no whoesale
edict of abolition was thought of since the
ruin it would have wrought would have been
for worse than tiie evil it sought to oveturn
christ and his apostles never applied to
the bioad law of christian justice
the church condemns cruelty and injustice
but for slavery as an institution independent
of isolated cases she legislates h christian
charity not in philanthropya term which
has been degraded to embrace all sorts of
wild and profitless ideas the sum of the
catholic doctrine then in regard to slavery
throughout the world wan to preach obedi
ence to the slave for the love of godto the
master kindness and mercy in view of the
justice of god wc doubt if bishop hugea
would have taken such ground but it must
pass lor the present as the doctrine of catho
lics on slavery and they are welcome toil

day th instant the bee noticing it
says
the procession consisted of between four
and five thousand persons the most beau
tiful and interesting feature of the pageant
was the cadets of temperancea son of
cold water army of boys organized under
similar laws to those which govern the
sons these boys are not only pledged
against the use of iiquor but also profane
language and tobacco they are organized
under what is called sections we no
ticed with pleasure among the cadets a sec
tion of colored boys they looked as neat
and prim as any in the ranks and appeared
perfectly delighted the record of this one
tact is proof that the cadets are an independ
ent order
while the speaking was going on a gen
tleman upon the platform called us ont one
side and whispered the following in our ear
mr patterson of new orleans desires
that the reporters will not mention the fact
that colored hoys walked in the procession for
fear it might injure the reputation of the or

mr patterson is informed that such re
quests may find listeners south of mason ard

by this time that he ha not lound silent lis

invention of lithography
lithography or the art of printing
on stone owes its origin to germany
the country which gave birth to the
great art of printing with types and to
which w are al o indebted for many
other discoveries of value to mankind
the inventor of the lithographic art
aloys senefelder was the son of a
poor actor at prague where he was
born in  t the family having re
moved to munich the young senefel
der there received some education and
when it became time to think of a
means of living he like many way
ward youths resorted to literature as a
profession of course with want of suc
cessfor no man can begin to live all
at once by authorcraft
to add to the mortification of aloys
his father died leaving a number of
children and the only means ol provi
ding for the wants of his brothers and
sisters as well as his own was to go
on the stage with an aching heart
and an empty stomach aloys persona
ted courtiers revelling in luxury and
gaiety when at the conclusion of en
tertainments he laid down his fine trap
pings at the theatre he retired to a
miserable home to starve on a crust
and a pitcher of water two years
were passetktf this life of privation and
anxiety bw although misery that
hideous phantom or rather frightful re
ality presented itselfcontinually to the
eyes of aloys poetry came like a con
soling angel to soothe his griefs and
reanimate him with courage and hope
for him as an actor the theatre had
lost all its illusions but he still dreamt
of rendering his name famous in litera
ture and acquiring reputation which
some seek even in the cannons mouth
but how to emerge from obscurity
unless his writings are printed sen
efelder cogitated on this to him impor
tant question with conflicting emotions
and at last resolved to be his own pub
lisher and print with his own hand
he was in possession of a few types
hut not sufficient for a page and was
too poor to purchase a press no mat
ter he could invent without being
aware of it stereotype and his obser
vant mind impelled by necessity con
quered the rest
the first proceeding to which aloys
had recourse consisted in pouring seal
ingwax into a soft mould in which his
phrases were impressed by means of
moveable printing types but the want
of strength in the tablets thus obtain
ed and the impossibility of taking
proofs even by the slightest pressure
determined him on engraving his cher
ished verses on copper he had nev
er handled the burin and was unac
quainted with the method of writing in
reverse unskilled in modelling writing
and unacquainted with nearly every
process made use of by engravers
still he persevered confiding for suc
cess in his firm resolution
he set himself to the work and hav
ing coated a copperplate with a com
position intended to impede the action
of acid elsewhere than on the charac
ters to be written he traced the first
few words which would either confirm
his hopes or destroy them for
when the plate was finished he car
ried it to a printer and begged him to
puli a proof what was his joy on
seeing the impressionimperfect yet
full of promise and on the other hand
with what pain did he efface it to com
mence a new attempt viewing with
alarm the diminishing thickness of the
plate which he was unabled to re
place
to produce a new surface senefel
der rubbed the plate with a block of
stone which however was too course
to give the requisite polish brought
to a stand by this defect he remember
ed having seen in his boyhood on the
banks of the isar certain stones which
he hoped would better effect his pur
pose and at once he hastened to the
spot
one idea nearly always leads to
another of the sight of the stones
which previously had served only as
flooring materials senefelder concei
ved the project of making use of them
tor his writing exercises and with him
the thought of an attempt and its exe
cution were the same thing he im
mediately busied himself squaring and
polishing these kelheimstonesso call
ed from the name of the place where
they are found and at length engra
ved them by the aid of acid and pre
pared a suitable ink from wax soap
and lamp black vhich enabled him to
judge of the result of his labor
in all this there is nothing particu
larly remarkable senefelder scarce
ly went out of the beaten track and
his progress was slower than it might
have been had his glyphic and chemi
cal knowledge been a little more ex
tensive long before this day men
had engraved on copper and carved
stone but he was the first in europe to
conceive and executo the idea of eo
graving a stone in reliefan ingenious
and fertile idea the foundation of lith
ography and source of the improve
ments and perfection which it has
since experienced the following is
senefelders account of his discovery
 had just smoothed a slab of stone
so as to coat it with gum and continue
my attempts at writing in reverse when
my mother entered and asked me to
write out for bet a list of th linen she
bad prepared for the wash the wash
erwoman was waiting impatient while
we looked everywhere for a piece of
white paper it to happened that my
whole stock was exhausted having
been used for proofs and my ordinary
ink was dried up as there was no
one in the bouse who could be sent to
buy what he wanted i took the notion
to write the list on the stone which i
had just levelled making use of my ink
composed of wax soap and lampblack
intending to copy it as soon as some pa
per was brought when at length i
wished to wipe of what was written
the idea struck me all at once to see
what would become of the characters
traced with my waxink on pouring
acid over the stone and also to try
whether they could not be blackened
as types or woodcuts are blackened
and afterwards printed the attempts
that i had already made had acquaint
ed me with the action of acid relatively
to the depth and thickness of the incis
ions and led me to believe i should not
be able to produce the letters well in
relief however as the writing was
coarse enough to resist the acid for a
time i went immediatelyto work and
surrounding the stone with wax after
the manner of copperplate engravers
i poured dilute acid over it to the depth
of two inches and left it to stand for
five minutes on examining the stone
at the end of that time i found the let
ters in relief about the thickness of a
card some strokes which probably
had been written too fins or not recei
ved sufficient ink were slightly in
jured the other had lost little or
nothing of iheir breadth which gave
me the hope that writing well traced
could be produced in greater relief
senefelder then goes on to describe the
various modes he took to ink the form
none of which succeeded until he pre
pared the lid of a box very level by
covering it with thicknesses of cloth
the enterprising artist now fondly
imagined that the obstacles in the way
of publishing his poetic thoughts were
removed he was impatient to give them
to the world but he was poor he
has no possessions which could be con
verted into money the household goods
belonged to his mother by and by he
remembered that to enter the army as
a substitute for another will assure him
a bounty of  florins and with this
sum he can purchase sufficient materi
al to start a small printingoffice
here again he was disappointed his
bohemian birth disqualified him for the
bavarian service
deprived even of this bitter resource
senefelder addressed himself to mr
gleissner the court musician and pro
posed to print his musical works the
proposition was accepted and m
gleissner in addition consented to
advance a moderate sum with which
the struggling aloys commenced litho
graphic printing in munich sooh af
ter the works of the friendly musician
were issued from presses also invented
by senefelder a copy of the first book
was presented to the elector of bava
ria who in return sent a hundred
florins to the new printer
the news of his success soon made it
self heard and the artists reputation in
creased as his labours continued when
a rival started up to claim priority ol
invention senefelders right was how
ever satisfactorily established and he
was commisioned by m steiner derec
tor of public instruction to print a col
lection of songs and chants for the use
of schools the results surpassed the
expectation of the new pulron one
object especially excited his attention
a small vignette placed at the head of
one of the chants and which although
ill executed convincingly proved that
chemical printing would reproduce
both music and design full of the
idea thus suggested m steiner re
commended senefelder to engage the
services of skillful draughtsmen so as
to substitute correct drawings and good
taste for the rude illustrations generally
found in popular literature and from
this beginning we may date the litho
graphic designs and sketches now so
widely diffused
shortly afterwards having to print a
book of prayers in italic characters
and but little experienced in that style
of writing senefelder succeeded alter
numerous trials in making autograph
ic ink and paper once possessed of
this double secret instead of writing
himself upon the stone he employed a
more skilful hand to form the charac
ters upon the new paper with the new
ink and then by a simple and ingeni
ous process he transferred the writing
from the paper to the stone and was
thus enabled to obtain an almost unlim
ited number of impressions from the
original and in this way what has been
called autography was invented
senefelder wa now more than ever
on the road of discovery and as the
equei showed he did not stop until he
had carried his art to such a pitch of
perfection that artists coming after him
had scarcely added a new process to
his instructions i remarked he ob
serves in his narrative that paper
written upon with lithographic ink and
well dried when dipped in water with
which were a few drops of oil took up
this oil on all the written portion while
the rest of the paper especially when
it had been dipped in gumwater or
starchwater much diluted remained
free of oil this made me think of
trying the effect of paper printed with
ordinary printing ink  tore a leaf
from an old book and passed it through
a weak solution of gum and laying it
on the stone i took a sponge charged
with a thin oil colour and rubbed it all
over the paper
the printed characters took the
colour at once while the paper remain
ed white i then placed another white
sheet above put under the press and
obtained an excellent copy of the print
ed sheetalthough reversed it would
be possible by this method to reprint
old books without great cost or even
editions of new ones
here we have evidence that the in
vention of anastatic printing which
was trumpeted as a new and extraor
dinary discovery a few years since
ivas in fact due to senefelder it is
lowever remarkable that being thus
icquainted with the process of trans
ferring old impressions he did not think
of applying them to the stone this
s one of those curious oversight to
vbich all men are liable and for which
t is not easy to give an explanation
still the persevering artist went on
rora trial to trial from deductionto
leduclion and at last discovered the
nethod of drawing on atone with
crayons to engrave without the use ol
acid and even to execute the earliest
essays in ebromolithography
arrived at this point scnefeldei
could regard his labors with legiti
mate pride chance effected nothing
for his famefor chance is a word
void of signification invented to con
ceal our inability to discover the se
cret connection of effects and causes
the artist was inspired only by his ge
nius and his poverty
being of a generous and communi
cative disposition senefelder revealed
his processes to learners who after
ward employed their knowledge to
their masters detriment in  tc
secure himself and those dependent on
him a share of the profit to be derived
from his longcontinued exertions he
associated two of his brothers with
himself in partnership and petitioned
the king maximilian joseph to confei
on him the exclusive privilege of litho
graphic printing a patent for fifteen
years had just been made out when one
of the chief editors of music in bavaria
offered to aloys a sum of  florins
if he would teach him his art and re
move to offenbach to establish a litho
graphic press the proposals were
joyfully accepted and three months la
ter the new business was in full activ
ity
this success led to wider views ant
senefelder was invited to join in i
scheme for the simultaneous introduc
tion of lithography into the four princi
pal capitals of europe in further
ance of this scheme he visited london
bnt left england after a short stay
without having accomplished his ob
ject
from this period senefelder appears
to have been engaged in a series o
speculations more or less unfortunate
we find him again at offenbach ther
at vienna afterwards at pottendorf
where he successfully applied his in
vention to the printing of cottons ant
began to dream of fortune when na
poleons continental system came tc
prevent its realization he returnee
to munich and found that his brother
had sold their business for an annua
pensiqp of  florins the govern
ment refused to confirm the privilege
of his patent but eventually consid
ering his merits and the benefits tha
had accrued from his invention the
 appointed him inspector of lith
ography with an annual salary of fif
teen hundred florins senefelder hat
not forgotten his first friend gleisner
and impelled by a feeling of gratitude
solicited and obtained for him a com
j f irtable post in ope of the governmenl
offices
thus tranquil as to the future sen
efelder married but his wife died soon
aftertheir union he waited thret
years and chose anotherone ever
way qualified to become the compan
ion of a man of genius in  he went
to paris with another invention a sorl
of pasteboard intended to supersede
the heavy stones required in lithgraph
ic priming not finding it answer he
adopted plates of zinc with which sr
much has subsequently been effected
alter a lime he returned to bavaria
living tranquilly on the salary attach
ed to his office and occupying him
self in painting in which he obtainec
considerable skill he was thus en
gaged when disease overtook him he
became blind and died in  leav
ing a widow and a son to inherit his
fame
senefelder affords an interesting ex
ample of what may be accomplished
by persevering thought and industry
he possessed great kindness of heart
and his integrity wasunimpeachable
his artistfeeling was vivid and pow
erjkfcand to this cause may be traced
