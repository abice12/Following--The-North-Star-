horace manns reply to hon
daniel webster
in a chronological order i must now
consider some vitally important views
which have been submitted by some
members in the house and by mr
webster and others in the senate in
mentioning the name of this great
statesman and in avowing that  am
one among the many whom his recent
ly expressed opinions have failed to
convince it is due myself however in
different it may be to him or to his
friends that i should express ray ad
miration of his powers my gratitude
for his past services and the diffidence
with which i disseuted at first from
his views but j have pondered upon
them long and the longer i have pon
dred the more questionable they ap
pear i shall therefore venture upon
the perilous task of inquiring into their
correctness and while i do it with the
deference and respect whichbelong to
his character i tjhall do it also with
that fidelity to conscience and to judg
ment that belong to mine he is great
but truth is greater then us all
i shall confine myself mainly and
wholly perhaps to mr websters
views because he has argued the
cause of the south wilh vastly more
ability than it has been argued by any
one among themselves if his conclu
sions then be not tenable their case
is lost
mr webster casts away the pro
viso altogether he says if a reso
lution or a law were now before us to
provide a territorial government for
new mexico i would not vote to put
any prohibition into it whatever p
 the reason given is that slavery
is already excluded from california
and new mexico by the law of na
ture of physical geography the law of
the formation of tha earth p 
california and new mexico are asiatic
in their formation and scenery they
are composed of vast ridges of moun
tains of enormous height with broken
ridges and deep valleys p 
now this is drawing moral conclu
sions from physical premises it is
arguing from physics to metaphysics
it is determiuing the law of the spirit by
geographical phenomena it is under
taking to settle by mountains and
rivers and not by the ten command
ments a great question of human duty
it abandons the secondcommandment of
christ and all bills of rights enacted
in conformity thereto and leaves our
obligations to our neighbor and all
human rights to be determined by the
accidents of earth and water and air
to ascartain whether a people will
obey the command of christ and do
to others as they would be done by it
looks at the thermometer what a
problem would this be required
the height above the level of the sea
at which the oppressor will undo the
heavy burdens and let the oppressed
so free and break every yoke to be
etermined barometrically alas this
cannot be doneslavery depends not
upon climate but upon conscience
wherever the wicked passions of the
human heart can go there slavery can
go slavery is an effect avarice
loth pride and the love of domination
are its cause in ascending mountain
idee at what altitude do men leave
these passions behind them different
ll fuy quotations fr mr wbsur an takes
frost tbs edition of bis spesdi which he dedicatd
to tbs people of messecliueetu amoe the
owns reediafs which bare appeared i suppose
us to he the meet authentic
right is of no sex truth is of no color
vegetable growths are to be found at
different heights depending also upon
the zone this i can understand
there is the altitude of the palrn the
altitude of the oak tbe  altitude of the
pine and far above them all the line
of perpetual snow but in regard to
ionocence and guilt where is the white
line how high up can a slaveholder
go and not lose his free agency at
what elevation will the whip fall from
the hand of the master and the fetters
from the limbs of the slave there is no
such point freedom and slavery nn
the one band and climate and geology
on the other are incommensurable
quantities we might as well attempt
to determine a questionin theology by
the cube root or a question in ethics
by the black art slavery being a
crime founded upon human passions
can go wherever these passions are
unrestrained it has existed in asia
from the earliest ages notwithstanding
its formation and scenery it labors
and groans on the banks of the ural
mountains now there are today
 slaves in russia not one
rood of which comes down so low as
the northern boundary of california
and new mexico
sould it be said that slavery will nto
go into the new territories because it
is unprofitable i ask where is it profit
able where is ignorance so profit
able as knowledge w t here is ungodli
ness gain even for the things of this
life how little is the hand worth at
one end of an arm if there is not a
brain at the other does not maryland
virginia north carolina and other
states lurnish witnesses by thousands
and tens of thousands that slavery
impoverishes yet with what enthusi
asm they cherish it generally igno
rance is a necessary concomitant of
slavery of white persons over 
years ago unable to read and write
there were according to the last cen
sus  in virginia  in
north carolina  in tennessee
and so forth i have a letter before
me received this morning dated in
indiana in which the writer says he
removed from north carolina in 
when he was  years old and at that
time he had never seen a newspaper in
his life can there bo genius the in
ventive talent or profitable labor
where ignorance is so dense can the
oppression that tramples out voluntary
industry intelligence enterprise and
the desire of independence conduce to
richesyet this is done wherever
slavery exists and is part and parcel of
its working is any other form of rob
bing profitable yet individuals and
communities have practiced it and
lived by it and we may as well rely
upon a law of physical geography to
arrest the one as the other it is not
poetry but literal truth that the breath
of the slave blasts vegetation his tears
poison the earth and his groans strike
it with sterility it would be easy to
show why the master does not abandon
slavery even amid the desolation with
which it has surrounded him there
is a combination of poverty and pride
which slavery produces on thejdoctrine
of natural appetence and which there
fore it exactly fits the helplessness
of the master in regard to all personal
wants seems to necessitate the slavery
that has begotten it all moral and
religious principles are lowered till
they conform to the daily practice
custom blinds conscience until with
out any attempt to emancipate or
ameliorate their victims man can
preach and hold slaves as yorick
jests and sings over gravedigging
but slavery cannot go into california
or new mexico because their staple
productions are not tobacco cane
cotton or rice p  these are
agricultural products but is slave
labor confined to agriculture suppose
that predial slavery will not become
common in the new territories can
not mental if slaves cannot do field
work cannot they do housework
there is an opening for  slaves
today in the new territories for pur
poses of domestic labor and beyond
this let me ask who possesses any
such geological vision that at the dis
tance of a thousand miles he can pene
trate the the valleys and gorges of
new mexico and say that gold will
not yet be found there as it is in cali
fornianot in sand and gravel only
but in fortyeight pounders and fifty
sixes this is the very kind of labor
on which slaves in all time have been
so extensively employedthe very la
bor on which a million of slaves in his
paniola lost their lives within a few
years after its discovery by columbus
gold deposites are now worked within
 miles of santa fe the last account
which i have seen of a company of
emigrants passing iron santa fe to
california by the riveftlfeila announ
ces rich discoveries of gold upon that
river
a fellow citizen of mine has just re
turned home who says he saw a slave
sold at the mines in california in
september last as yet the distant
regions of the gila and the colorado
cannot be worked because of the
apaches the utah and other tribes of
indians but admit slavery there and
the power of the government will be
invoked to exterminate these indians
as it was before to exterminate the
cherokees and seminolenot to drive
them beyond the mississippi but be
yond the styx a few days since a
letter was published in the papers
dated on board a steamer descending
the mississippi which stated that a
considerable number of slaves were on
board for california under an agree
ment with their master that they should
be free after serving two years at the
mines we know too that the reasod
assigned for incorporating a provision
in the constitution of california au
thorising its legislature to pass a law
for the exclusion of free blacks from
the states was that slaves would
be brought there under this very form
of agreement and by aod by the coun
try would be overspread by people ot
color who bad bought tbeir freedom
the sagacious men who framed the
california constitution came from ail
pitii of the territory and being col
lected on the spot having surveyed
all its mountains having breathed its
air at all temperatures and turned up
its golden soil these men had never
discovered any law of physioal
geography which the fell spirit of
slavery could not transgress slaves
were carried into oregon ten degrees
of latitude higher up its colonists re
enacted the ordinance of  before
congress gave them a territorial gov
ernment in the territorial govern
ment that was given them the prohibi
tion was inserted and president polk
signed the bill with an express protest
that he ratified this exclusion of slavery
only because the country lay north of
the missouri compromise linebut that
had it embraced the very region in
question he would have vetoed the
bill
gen cass never took the ground
that slavery could not exist in the new
territories and no inconsiderable part
of the opposition made by him in mas
sachusetts and in other states was
placed expressly upon the ground that
he would not prohibit it mr webs
ter in his marshfield speech sept 
 opposed the election of gen
cass because through his recreancy
to northern principles slavery would
invade the territories this was ex
pressed with the usual clearness and
force as follows
he gen cass will surely have
the senate and with the patronage of
the government with every interest
that he as a northern man can bring
to bear cooperating with every in
terest that the south can bring to bear
we cry safety before we are out of the
woods if we feel that there is no dan
ger as to those new territories
yet mr webster now sas that to
support the proviso would do dis
grace to his own understanding p

during the same campaign also
the hon rufus choate one of the
mosi eloquent men in new england
and known to be a personal friend of
mr webster delivered a speech at
salem in which the following passage
occurs
it is the passage of a law to say
that california and new mexico shall
remain forever free that is fellow
citizens undoubtedly an object of
great and transcendent importance
for there is none who will deny that
we should go up to the very limits of
the constitution itself and with the
wisdom of the wisest and the zeal of
the most zealous should unite to ac
complish this great object and to de
feat the always detested and forever
to be detested object of the dark ambi
tion of that candidate of the baltimore
convention who has ventured to
pledge himself in advance that he will
veto the future law of freedom and
may god avert the madness of all who
hate slavery and love freedom that
would unite in putting him in the place
where this thrice accursed pledge inay
be redeemed is
there a whig upon this floor who
doubts that the strength of the whig
party next march will insure freedom
to california and new mexico if by
the constitution they are entitled to
freedom at all is there a member of
congress that would not vote for free
dom you know there is not one
did not every whig member of con
gress from the free states vote at the
last session for freedom you know
that every man returned home covered
with the thanks of his constituents for
that vote is there a single whig
constituency in any free state in this
country that would return any man
that would not vote for freedom do
you believe that daniel webster him
self could be returned if there was the
least doubt upon the question
mr choate then addsupon this
question alone we always difler from
those whigs of the south and on that
one we propose simply to vote him
down mr webster now says he
will not join in voting them down
under such circumstances it is
frivolous or captious to ask for some
thing more than dogmatic assertion
that slavery cannot impregnate these
new regions and cause them to breed
monsters forever
on a subject of such infinite impor
tance i cannot be satisfied with a dic
tum i want a demonstration i cannot
acceptthe prophecy without inquiring
what spirit inspired the prophet as a
revelation from heaven it would bn
most delightful but as it conflicts with
all human experience it requires at
least one undoubted miracle to attest
the divinity of its orgm
according to the last census there
were more than eight thousand persons
of african blood in massachusetts
abolish the moral and religious con
victions of our people let slavery ap
pear to be in their sight not only law
ful and creditable but desirable as a
badge of aristocratic distinction and
a a political social moral and re
ligions blessing and what obstacle
would prevent these eight thousand
persons from being turned into slaves
ton anj day by the easy cheap and
rochester n y thursday may  
shorthand kidnapping of a legislative
act africans can exist here for th
best of all realonathey do exisi
here k state af slavery would not
stop their rospiidtion nor cause then
to vanish intofhin air think foi
a moment of this complaints we con
stantly hear in certain circles of th
difficulty and vaxatiousness of com
manding domestic service if no mora
or religious objection existed againsl
holding slaves would not many oi
those respectable and opulent gentle
men who signed the letter of thanks to
mr webster and hundreds of other
indeed instead of applying to intelli
gence offidfs or visiting emigrant
ships for domestics as we cell them
go at once to the auctionroom an
buy a man or a woman with as little
hesitancy or compunction as they now
send to brighton ior beeves or to tat
tersalls for a horse if the cold of the
higher latitudes checks the flow ol
african blosd or benumbs african
limbs the slaveholder knows very well
that a trifling extra expense for whips
will make up foible difference
but suppose a doubt could be rea
sonably entertained about the invasion
of the new territories by slavery even
suppose the chances to preponderate
against it what then are we to
submit a question of human liberty
over yast regions and for an indefinite
extent of tine to the determination ol
chance with all my faculties  say
no let me ask any man let me re
spectfully ask mr webster himself if
it were his own father and mother
and brothers and sisters and sons and
daughters who were in peril of such
a fate whether he would abandon
them to chance even to a favorable
chance would he suffer their fate to
bedetermiied by dice or divination
when positive prohibition was in his
power asd by what rule of christian
morality or even of enlightened hea
then morality can we deal differently
with the kindred of others from what
we would with our own he is not a
christian whose humanity is bounded
by the legal degrees of blood or by
general types of feature
but mr webster would not taunt
the south neither would i i would
not taunt any honorable man much
less a criminal still when the most
precious interests of humanity are in
peril  would not be timid i would
not stop too long to cull lovers phrases
standing under the eye of god in the
forumof the world and before the august
tribunal of posterity when the litigants
are freedom and tyranny and human
happiness and human misery the prize
they contest it should happen to the
sworn advocates of liberty as quin
tiilian says it did to isocrates not
to speak and to plead bnt to thunder
and to lighten mr webster would
not taunt the south and yeti say the
south were never so iusulted before
as he has insulted them common
scoffs jeers and vilifications are flat
tery and scophancy compared with the
indignities he heaped upon them look
at the facts the south waged war
with mexico from one and only one
motive for one and only one object
the extension of slavery they refused
peace unless the surrendered territory
that territory must be south of the ab
horred line of  deg  min the
sumc president who abandoned the
broad belt of country on our northern
frontier from  deg to  deg m
to which we had in his own words
an unquestionable title would allow
no prohibition of slavery to be imposed
upon the territory which mexico ceded
though she would bury it a foot deep
in gold the proviso had been resis
ted in all forms from the beginning
southern whigs voted against the
ratification of the treaty foreseeing the
struggle that was to follow desperate
efforts were made to smuggle in an
unrestricted territorial government
against all parliamentaryrule and all
constitutional implication the whole
south as one man claimed it as a
describabie weighable estimable
tangible and most valuable right
to carry slaves there calhoun ber
rien badger mason davis the
whole southern phalanx whig and
democrat pleaded for it argued for it
and most of them declared themselves
ready to fight for it and yet mr web
ster rises in his place and tells them
they are alt moonstruck hallucinated
fatuous because an ordinance of na
iure asd the will of god had settled
this question from the beginning of the
world mr calhoun said immediately
after this speech give us free scops
and time enough and we will take
care of the rest
mr mason said
we have heard here from various
quarters and from high quarters and
repeated on all handsrepeated here
again today by the honorable senator
from illinois mr shields that there
is a law of nature which excludes the
southern people from every portion of
the state of california i know of no
such law of naturenone whatever
but  do know the contrary that if
california had been organized with a
territorial form of government only
and for which at the last two sessions
of congress she has obtained the en
tire soutnern vote the people of the
southern stetes would have gone there
freely and have taken their slaves
there in great numbers they would
have done ao because the value of the
labor of that class would have been
augmented to them many hundredfold
whv in the debates which took place
in the convention in california which
formed the constitution and which
any senator can now read for himself
god is the father of us all and all men are brethren
after the provision excluding slaver
was agreed upon it was proposed t
prohibit the african race altogether
free as well as bond a debate aros
upon it and the ground was distinctly
taken as shown in those debates thai
if the entire african race was not ex
cluded their labor would be found st
valuable that the owners of slavet
would bring them there even thougl
slavery were prohibited a under con
tract to manumit them in two or three
years and it required very little rea
soning on the part of those opposed tc
this class of population to show that
the productiveness of their labor would
be such as to cause that result an
estimate was gone into with reference
to the value of the labor of this class oi
people snowing that it would be in
creased to such an extent in the mines
of california that they could not be
kept out it was agreed that the labor
of a slave in any one of the states from
which they would be taken was not
worth more than one hundred and fifty
dollars a year and that in california
it would be worth from four to six
thousand dollars they would work
themselves free in one or two years
and thus the country would be filled by
a class of free blacks and their former
owners have an excellent bargain in
bringing them there
yet mr webster stands up before
all this array and says gentlemen
you are beside yourselves you have
eaten hellebore you would look
more in character should you put on
the cap and bells in sober sense
in seeing his object clearly and in pur
suing it directly don quixote was
dr franklin compared with you
the dog in the fable who dropped his
meat to snap at its shadow is no al
legory in your case i see two classes
around mewise men and fools you
do not belong to the former the
chancellor who keeps the kings idiots
should have custody of you such
is a faithful abstract of what mr web
ster said to southern senators and
through them to all the south
here certainly was u reflection upon
the understanding and intelligence ol
the south such as never was cast on
them before but the balm went with
the sting they bore the affront to
their judgments because it was so
grateful to their politics and pockets
 think it no injustice to those senators
to say that they would have nearly
torn him in pieces for such a collective
insult if it had not added fifty per
cent to their individual property and
secured and perpetuated their political
ascendency
to help our conceptions in regard
to mr websters course on this sub
ject let us imagine a parallel case or
rather an approximate one for there
can be no parallel suppose a contest
between the north and the south on
the subject of the tariff to have been
raging for years the sober blood of
the north is heated to the fever point
the newspapers treat of nothing else
public meetings and private conver
sation discuss no other theme hun
dreds of delegatee wait upon congress
to add if it be but a feathers weight
to the scale which holds their interests
petitions flow in in thousands and tens
of thousands it is announced that
mr calhoun will pour out his great
mind on the subject expectation is
on tiptoe all eyes from all sides of
the country are turnedfowards wash
ington as the muazzius is to mecca
the senate chamber is packed and
the illustrious senator rises after a
historic sketch of existing difficulties
after reading from the speeches which
he made in  and in he pro
ceeds to flay that he withdraws all op
position to a tariff to any tariff he
will not offend the delicate nerves of
northern manufacturers by further
hostility were a bill then before
him he would not oppose it take
the schedules says he scornfully to
northern senators and fill up the
blanks from a to z with what percent
ages you please for ad valorem rates
put in nunimums and maximum at
your pleasure  will taunt you no
longer i am for peace and the
glorious union i have discovered an
irrepealable and irreversible law of
nature which overrules all the devices
of men you cannot make one yard
of woolens or cottons in new england
there water has no gravity steam has
no force and wheels will not revolve
in vermont and new york wool will
not grow on sheeps backs i have
penetrated the geology of pennsyl
vania and through all iu straiio
tions there is not a thimblefull of coal
nor an ounce of iron ore and if there
wrre combustion would not help to
forge it for oxygen and carbon are di
vorced as massachnsetts contributed
onethird of the men and onethird of
the money to carry on the revolution
ary war i am willing to compensate
her for her lost blood and treasure to
the amount ofhundreds of millions of
dollars with which she may fertilize
the barrenness of her genius and in
dulge her insane love for churches and
schools had the great southern
senator spoken thus  think that even
idolatrous manworshipping south
carolinaa state which mr calhoun
has ruled and moved for the last twen
tyfive years as a puppetshow man
plays punch and judywould have
sent forth through all her organs a
voice of unanimous dissent
as much as freedom is higher than
tariff so much stronger than their
dissent should be ours
mr websters averment that he
would not reeffirm an ordinance of
nature nor reenact the will of god
p  has been commented on mor
pungently than  am able or willini
to do it has been said that all lav
and all volition must be in harmonj
with the will of the good spirit 
with that of the evil one and if w
will not reenact the will of the former
theu either all legislation ceases pr w
must register the decrees of the latter
but one important and pertinent consij
belongs to this subject which j
have nowere seen developed it is
this endless doubts and contradiction
exist among men as to what is the
will of god and on no subject is there
a wider diversity of opinion than on
this very subject efslavery whose
law wasjreenacted by
of  whose when the african
slavetrade was prohibited whose
when it was declared piracy true
it is useless to put upon our statute
books an astronomical law regulating
sunrise or high tides but that is phy
sical and beyond the jurisdiction of
man while slavery belongs to morals
and is within the jurisdiction of man
cease to transcribe upon the statute
book what our wisest and best men
believe to be the will of ged in regard
to our worldly affairs and the passions
which we think appropriate to devils
will soon take possession of society
in regard to slavery piracy and so
forth their are multitudes of men
whose fear of the penal sanctions of
another life is very much aided by a
little salutary fine and imprisonment
in this look at the noble array of
principles which is contained in the
declaration of rights in the constitu
tion of massachusetts is it not a
most grand and beautiful exposition of
the will of god a transcript as it
were from the book of life so of
the amendments to the constitution ol
the united states yet our fathers
thought it no tampering with holy
things to enact them and in times of
struggle and peril they have been to
many a tempted man as an anchor to the
soul sure and steadfast
i approach mr websters treat
ment of the texas question with no
ordinary anxiety having been ac
customed from my very boyhood to re
gard him as the almost infallible ex
pounder of constitutioual law it is im
possible to describe the struggle the
revulsion of mind with which i have
passed from an instructed and joyous
acquiescence in his former opinions to
unhesitating dissent from his present
ones
i must premise that i cannot see
any necessary or beneficial connection
between the subject of new texan
states and the admission of california
and the government of the territories
the former refers to some indefinite
future when from its fruitful womb o
slavery texas shall seek to castf
forth its untimely birth in this excit
ed state of the countryat this critical
juncture ef our affairs when there is
sober talk of massacreing a majority
of the house ol representatives on
their own floor and a senator instead
of threatening to hang a brother sen
ator on the highest tree provided he
could catch him in his own state now
draws a revolver of six barrals on an
other brather senator on the floor of
the senate in mid sessionat such a
time i say when however few abels
there may be at work in the political
field there are cains more than
enough would it not have been well
to have said sufficient unto the day
is the evil therefore
as the basis of this argument mr
wsbster quotes the following resolu
tion
new states of convenient size not
exceeding four in number in addition
to said state of texas and having suf
ficient population may hereafter by
the consent of said state be formed
eut of that portion of said territory ly
ing south   north latitude com
monly known as the missouri compro
mise line shall be admitted into the
union with or without slavery as the
people of each stale asking admission
may desire and in such state or
states as shall be formed out of said
territory north of said missouri com
promise line slavery or involutary
servitude n except for crime shall be
prohibited
note here first that only four
states are to be admitted in addition
to said state of texas and second
that such state or states in the
plural as shall be formed from
territory north of deg min shall
be free if two or only one free state
is o exist on tb wsult mi am mf tbs lino
then how many will be left for the south
side  should expose myself to ridi
cule were  to set down arithmetically
four minus one equal to three yet
mr webster says the guaranty is
that new states shall be made out of it
the texan territory and that such
states as are formed out of that por
tion oftexas lying south of deg
min may come in as slave states
to the number of four in addition to
the state then in existence and ad
mitted at that time by these resoiu
tions p 
here mr webster gives outright
to the south and to slavery one more
state than was contracted lorassum
ing the contract to be valid he
makes rdonation a gratuity of an en
tire slave state larger than many a
european principality he transfers
a whole state with all its beating
hearts present and future with all its
infinite susceptibilities of weal or woe
from the side ot freedom to that of sla
very in the legerbook of humanity
wlfat abridal gift for the harlot o
john dick funtb
whole no 
was not the bargain hard enough
according to its terms must we ful
fil it and go beyond it is a slare
state which dooms our brethren of tha
human race perhaps interminably to
the vassalsate so insignificant a trifle
that it may be flung in as small
change on the settlement of an ac
count has the south been so gen
erous a copartner as to deserve this
distinguished token of our gratitude
why by a parity of reasoning could
he not have claimed all the four states
in addition to said state of texas
as free states the resolutions di
vide the territory into two parts onu
north and one south of the line of 
deg min could not mr webster
have claimed four states lor free
dom with as sound logic and with far
bettor humanity than he surrendered
them to slavery when texas and
the south have got their slave states
to the number of four inte tho union
whence are we to obtaiu our one or
more free states the contract will
have been executed and the consent
of texas for another state will be
withheld
notwithstanding all this mr web
ster affirms the right of slavery to four
more states in the following words
 know no form of legislation which
can strengthen this i know no mode
of recognition that can add a tittle of
weight to it catching the tone of his
asservation i respond that i know no
form of statement nor process of rea
soning which can make it more clear
that this is an absolute and wanton
surrender of the rights of the north
and the rights of humanity
but i hold the texan resolutions to
have been utterly void and proceed to
give the reason for my opinion
i begin by quoting mr webster
against himself in an address to the
people of the united states from the
mass antitexas sfate convention
jan th  the subjoined passage
which is understood or rather i may
say is now well known to have been
dictated by mr webster himself may
be found
but we desire not to be misunder
stood according to our convictions
there is no power in any branch of the
government or all its branches to an
nex foreign territories to this union
we have made the foregoing remarks
only to show that if any fair consti
tution could show such a power to ex
ist anywhere or to be exercised in
any form yet the manner of its exer
cise now proposed is destitute of all de
cent semblance of constitutional proprie
ty
thus cancelling the authority of mr
webster in  by the authority of
webster in  i proceed with the
argument
though the annexation of texas waa
in pursuance of a void stipulation yet
it is a clear principle of law that when
a contract void between the parties
has been executed by them it cannot
then be annulled if executed it be
comes valid not by virtue of the con
tract but by virtue of the execution
i bow to this legal principle and would
fulfil it but any independent stipu
lation which remains unexecuted re
mains invalid such is that part of the
annexation resolutions which provides
for the admission of a brood of texan
states the resolutions themselves say
in express terms that the new states
are to be admitted under the pro
visions ot the federal constitution
and the constitution says new states
may be admitted by the congress into
this union by what congress t
plainly by the congress in session
at the time when application for ad
mission is made and by no other the
fourth texan state inay not be ready
for admission for fifiy years to come
and could the congress of  bind
the congress of  the congress
of  and all future congresses
will derive their authority from the con
stitution of the united states and not
from any preceding congress put
the case in a negative form could the
congress of  bind all future con
gress not to admit new states and thus
protanto annul the constitution posi
tive or negative the result is the same
no previous congress on such a sub
ject can enlarge or limit the power of
a subsequent one whenever there
fore the question of a new texan state
comes up for consideration the con
gress then in being must decide it on
its own merits untrammelled by any
thing the predecessors have done es
pecially free from a law which while
im spirit fa tnousand times
more odious in principle than aftntuea
of mortmain
admitting that a future congress
on such a subject might be bound by
a treaty  answer that here was no
treaty while the fact that a treaty
clause was introduced into the resolu
tions in the senate for the sake of
obtaining certain votes that would nev
er otherwise have been given in their
favor and under an express pledge
from the executive that the method
by treaty should be adopted which
pledge was forthwith iniquitously bro
ken leaves no element of baseness and
fraud by which this proceeding was
not contaminated in the name of the
constitution then and of juaticp let
every honest roan denounce those res
olutions as void alike in the forum of
law and in the forum of conscience
and admitting texae herself in the
union yet when application is made
for any new state from that territory
let the question be decided upon the
merits k may then possess
there is another objection to any fu
tare claim of texas to be divided into
states which grows out of her own
neglect to fulfil the terms and spirit of
the agreement in the territory north
of the missouri compromise line sla
very or involuntary servitude except 
for crime shall be prohibited so
reads the bond but if texas suffers
slavery to be extended over that part
of her territory then when it becomes
populous enough for admission and is
overspread with slavery a new state
may present a free constitution be ad
mitted by congress and before the
slaves have time to escape or to car
ry the question of freedom before the
judicial tribunals presto this free con
stitution will be changed into a slave
constitution under the alleged right of
a state to decide upon its own domes
tic institutions and thus the word of
promise which was kept to the ear
will be broken to the hope if texas
meant to abide by the resolutions of
annexation and to claim anything un
der them it as her clear and imper
ative duty forthwith to pass a law se
curing freedom to every inhabitant
north of the compromise line in this
way only can the resolutions be
executed in their true spirit that
territory is now in the condition of an
egg it is undergoing incubation
from it a state is hereafter to be
hatched but before promising to ac
cept the chick it would be agreeable
to know whether a viper had impreg
nated the egg
but there is a still further opjection
of whose soundness i have no doubt
but should i be in error in regard to
it the mistake will not invalidate any
other argument tho parties to that
agreement stipulated on the ground of
mutuality without which ail contracts
are void some states were to be ad
mitt id to strengthen the hands of sla
very and some of freedom a line of
demarcation was drawn now on
iovestication  believe it will most
conclusively appear that there is not
an inch of texas territory north of
the stipulated line it all belongs to
new mexico as much as nantucket
or berkshire belongs to massachusetts
it was a mistake on the part of the
contracting parties if on the part of
texas it was something worse than a
mistake the mutuality then fails
the contract is nudvm pactum tex
as can give nothing for what she was
to receive and is therefore entitled
to receive nothing but what she has
got
in regard to the business of seeing
that fugitives are delivered up mr
webster says my friend at the head
of the judiciary committee mr but
ler of south carolina has a hill on
the subject now before the senate
with some amendments to it which i
propose to supptftt with all its provis
ions to he fullest extent
we published this bill a few weeks since
and all who read it will remember its main
features
it will be observed that the first
section of the hill after constituting
the judges of the courts the seventeen
thousand postmasters the collectors
and sofqith as tribunals without ap
peal for the delivery of anybody wti
is sworn by anybody anywherp t
be a fugitive slave refers to the be
fore mentioned officers in the words
residing or being within euch statt
where such seizure or arrest is made
that is the judge postmaster collec
tor c need not to he ar inhabitant
of the stale or hold his office in th
state where the seizure is made but
it is sufficient if he is such officer an
where within the united states mr
butler or mr mason therefore maj
tend the postmaster of his own city 
village into massachusetts with an
agent or attorney who brings his affi
davit from south carolina or virginia
in his pocket the agent or attorney
may arrest any body at any time car
ry him before his accomplice g
through with the judicial fotros am
hurry him to the south the officer
after his judicial functions are dischar
ged turning bailiff protecting the pre
d speeding the flight
still further this bill derides th
tiwl by jury secured by the jonstitu
tion a man may not lose a hors
without a right to this trial but hi
may his freedom mr webster speak
tor the south and for slavery not fui
the north and for freedom when in
abandons this right such an aban
donment it would be impossible to be
lieve of one who has earned such fami
as defender of the constitution ii
would be more reasonable to suppose
the existence of some strange misap
prehension had not mr webster with
the precision and strength which art
so peculiarly his own declared his de
termination to support this hideous
bill with all its provisions to tht
fullest extent when at the sam
moment another bill of which he took
no notice wa pending before the sen
ate introduced by mr sewkrd ol
new york securing the invaluable
privilege of a jury trial
 disdain to avail myself in sober
argument of the popular sensitivenets
on this subject and i acknowledge mv
obligations to the constitution while
it is suffered to last but still i say
that the man who can read this till
without having his blood boil in bis
veins has a power of refrigeration
that would cool the tropics
i cannot doubt that mr webster
will yet see the necessity of reconsi
dering his position on this whole
question
mr webster says it is my firm
opinion this day that within th e lasi
twenty years as much money has been
collected and paid to the abolition so
cieties abolition presses aud abolition
lecturers as would purchase the free
dom of every slave man womap and
child in the state of maryland and
end them ail to liberia
the total number of slaves in mary
land according to the last sensus
amounted to  at  apiece
which ia but about half the value
cl btm tly assigned to the southern
laves by southern menthis woilld be
 allowing o each for
transportation to liberia without any
provision for them after their arrival
there and the whole sum would be
 in round numbers twen
tyfive millions oi dollarsmore than
a million and a quarter in each year
and about five hundred dollars per
l had sot supposed the abolition j
sts had such resources at their com
mand
i have dwelt thus long upon mr
websters speech because in connec
ion with his two votes in favor of mr
footes committee of compromise
which votes bad they been the other
way would have utterly defeated the
committee it is considered to have
lone more to jeopard the great cause
of freedom in the territories than any
other event of this disastrous session
i have spoken of mr webster by
name and i trust in none but res
pectful terms i might have intro
duced other names or examined bis
positions without mentioning him i
have taken what seemed to me the
more manly course and if these views
should ever by chance fall under his
eye i believe he has magnanimity
enough to respect me more for the
frankness i have used if lam wrong
 will not add to au error of judgment
the meanness of a clandestine attack
if i am right no one can complain
for we must all bow belore the majesty
of truth
should the north fail i have stil
onemore hope it is that new mex
ico will do for herself what we shal
have basely failed to do for herl
both these hopes fail our country ii
doomed to run its unobstructed car

we beg to return our sincere and heartfelt
icknowledgments to the ladies of the north

mi of four hundred duilira considering
he many disadvantages under which they
i iboied while making their recent effort in
new york in behalf of our paper it may
veil be deemed eminently successful but
three months fiotn the organization of theii
yommittee intervened before the holding ol
the faira period altogether inadequate for
ringing out an average display of the taste
dtill and ingenuity of the ladies of new
york yet the fair presented an appearance
which would compare favorably wqh that of
jny fair on the same scale for any ordinary
oenevolent object but on this point it is not
important that we should speak we have
no doubt that ihe committee will have from
ihe pen of their able and efficient secretary
a report which will do justice to their labors
is well as to those who sent contributions
we beg again that the ladies will accept our
est thanks for ibis valuable donation which
hall be faithfully appropriated to the object
fr which it is designed
at the same time we gratefully remember
ihe assistance rendered to the ladies com
mittee by prof reason of central college
and mr george t downing of new york
we think that without their aid the fair
could not have been successful constant in

they were at once the right hand men of the

having been during the past few weeks
the special object of attack marked out by a
corrupt and fiendish press for assassination
the victim of a continuous train of almost
unprecedented abuseharraseed and dogged
from day to day by the furious blood
hounds of american slaveryl should be
something more than a stoic if i did not
feel and acknowledge a sense of profound
gratitude to the god of the oppressed that 
am again permitted safely to occupy my
editorial chair never since the day i enter
ed the field of public effort in the cause of my
enslaved brethren have i been called to en
dure persecution more bitter insults mors
brutal violence more fierce acorn aod con
tempt more malicious and demoniacal than
that heaped upon me in the city of new
york during the past three weeks i have
been made to fee  keenly that i am in an
enemys landsurrounded on all aides by
hardships difficulties and dangersthat on
the side of the oppressor there is powei
and that there are few to take up the cause
of my deeply injured and downtrodden
peoplo these things grieve but do not
appal me not an inch will  retreat not
one jot of steal will i abatenot one word
will i retract and in the strength of god
while the red current of life flows through
my veins i will continue to labor for the
downfall of slavery and the freedom of my
race lam denounced as an offender lam
not ignorant of my offences i plead guilty
to the worst of those laid to my charge
amplified as they have been enormous as
they are alleged to be  do not shrink from
looking them full in the face and gloiying
in having committed them my crime is
that i have assumed to be a man entitled
to all the rights privileges and dignity
which belong to human nature that color
r is no crime and that all men are brothers
i have acted on this presumption the very
head and front of my offending hath this
extent no more i have not merely talked
of human brotherhood and human equality
but have reduced that talk to practice this
i have done in broad open day scorning con
j cealment i have walked through the streets
of new york in company with white per
sons not as a menial but as an equal this
s was done with no purpose to inflame the
public mind not to provoke popular viol
eitce not to make a display of my contempt
 for public opinion but simply as a matter of
course and because it was right so to do
 the right to associate with my fellow worms
of the dust on terms of equality without
regard to color is a right which i will yield
only with my latest breath
my readers will have observed in the
t vorth star of last week an account of a
i most cowardly assault made upon tne iu the
battery at new york like most other
r statements wiiich emanate from the american
press this one though partly true is false
in several particulars it is not true tbit i
s walked down broadway with two white fe
male resting on my arm in the case alluded
to although i insist upon the right te do so
it is not true that the ladies in company
with me placed themselves under the care of
the gentleman ruffian who assaulted me
nor of any of the villanous party nor of any
body else it is not true that i sneared or
spoke to the loafing assailants the facts briefly
are these myself and friends were going to
philadelphia and supposing that the john
s potter departed from new york at twelve
oclockwe rode down a quarter before twelve
 but found on our arrival that we had been
mistaken the time of starting being halfpast
one oclock the intervalthereforewe passed
in the battery when about to leave for the
steamer five or six men surrounded us as
sailing us with all sorts of coarse and filthy
language and two of them finally struck the
ladies on the headwhile another attacked me
i warded off the blows with my umbrella
and the cowardly creatures left without doing
any personal harm thinking that we should
not be disturbed by them again we walked
slowly toward the steamer one of the mob
observing that i was off my guaid ran up
liehind me and before i could put myself in
a position to ward off the assassins blow 
was struck in the face these are the whole
facts in the case  never was more calm or
selfpossessed than when under his beastly
assault i felt no indignation towards the
poor miserable wretches who committed the
outrage they were but executing upon me
the behests of the proslavery church and
clergy of the land doing the dirty work of
the men who despise them and who have
no more respect for them in reality than
they bave for me  shall have say

it becomes my duty as an humble advo
cate of equal rightsas a defender of the
principle of human freedomto record my
earnest testimony at this crisis against what
appears to me to be s most disgraceful con
cession to the venomous hatred so strongly
cherished in this city by the white against
th e colored people when principle is sacri
ficed in high placeswhen high and import
ant trusts have been scandalously abused
it becomes those who suffer from such epos
tacy to repudiate both the traitors and ih
treachery this is their duty to do boldly
and earnestly and at whatever cost of popu

the same
you have read tlhmiiiidbijl and you ah
ready see in it that upon which  beg to
offer a few remarks and against which i
would bear my humble but not the lest
honest testimony ynthavt it here first
stated that a white committee wjs appointed
at franklin hall to sedm a place of meet
ing for mr ward niv why was a white
committee selected fronts meeting composed
of both white and colored personal was it
because a committee imposed in part of
colored persons would htvor too much the
idea of social equality aa it merely an
act of courtesy towards the whites and a
mark of humility on the pact of the colored
people there assembled i ipr whatever fpa
son the measure was adoptm  am opposed
to all such measures and heartily
repudiate this away with sb compromises
to secure goodwill when condition
upon which it can be attained n a sacrifice of
selfrespect and acknowledgment of our own
inferiority in the very first announcement
then in this handbill i find cause of com
plaint and although the basis of that com
plaint standing alone mighty pass without
animadversion standing as is does in con
nection with other and more obnoxious fea
tuies f hate felt in bestowing
upon it this word of oflpfent
the reader is next informedby the authors
of this handbill that they hare labored in
vain to secure a halt in whph mi ward
might hold a meeting and llege as the
reason of their failure the prejudice against
the negro race this was undoubtedly the
true reason the prejudice against the
negro raceaye the this un
natural unreasoning and raaligdffht prejudice
is the secret of most of our sifriai troubles
and misfortunes by it we ati proscribed
plundered and oppressed this it is that has
shut us out not only froqj hallsl from hotels
from steamboat cabins from the ballotbox
from lyceums from places of amusement
from churches from almost eviy honorable
employmentbut even from decent burial
grounds in this city yes it is this venom
ous prejudice that stands as if armed with a
thunderbolt to btrike dead any black man
who dares to seek his own and the true ele
vation of his race this prejudice it is
which we are to meet encounter and subdue
before any essential change for the better can
take place in our condition this is the
goliath which at present defies all the armies
of israel and alas at the very moment
when the colored people of this city had
reason to hope that an effective blow would
tie dealt upon the head of this arch enemy
the very principle for which we are bound to
contend has been most cowardly and shame
fully abandoned
here it is in these significant lines read it
again the lower saloon w he ai
propriated exclusively thlmlu white
fellow citizens who are respect
fully requested to attenj
it is not easy to conceive of a more slame
ful concession to the spirit of slavery and pre
judice than this it is colonization sanctioned
by the very men who profess to loathe and
detest it separated from the circumstances
it is a violation of the very first principles of
hpman brotherhoodfor which the friends of
freedom have contended for more tlian twenty
yearsit is the wholesale adoption of the
mean and unchrielian negro pew system
which has been everywhere regarded as the
strong bulwark of slavery and oppression
but taken in connection with the declared ob
ject of the meeting ihe well known character
of the gentlemau for whom tle meeting wa
convened and the complextion of the people
who own the church in wnich the meeting
was heldit is the mostcowardly contempti
ble and servile specimen of selfdegradation
which has ever come under my notice it
is literally admitting that all that has been said
by our enemies of our unfitness for the pos
session of equal rights and privileges in the
relations of life is true and that it ought to
be reduced to practice what use will the
revilers and slanderers of our people make of
this concession why this and none else
than this that we are sensible of our
own inferiority that we know our place
that we are conscious of our own unfitness
for the society of white people that it
is quite proper we should be separated
from them in the house of prayer that the
two varieties of the same family ought not to be
allowed to occupy an equal footing that the
lower and commodious part of the churchthe
house ot worship should be reserved for white
people exclusively and that colored people
should be separated and sent up stairscol
onized such then are the inferences
which our oppressors may naturally draw
from this open and palpable abandonment of
the doctrine and practice of human equality
imo which the colored people of this city
have boon wantonly and scandalously betray
ed let me ask those colored men whtf have
sanctioned this disgraceful transaction to
show if they can wbat difference there is
in the principle of caste and exclusiveness in
volved in this caseand the principle upon
which mr ward and colored men in gen
eral are excluded from the chinese mus
eum is there any are not the two things
founded on the same basis mr ward was
excluded from the chinese museum because
tie was a colored man colored men by
this notice were excluded fro the lower pari
f st marys street churchbecause of
their color the principle was that the same
in the one ease as is the other and it is
equally te be reprobated io both cases he
who approves the one has no right to con
demn the other  out of thine own mouth
will i condemn thee thou that sayest a man
halt steal dost thou steal thou ths
sayest that god is impartial art thou par
tial will you condemn in others that which i
you justify in yourself how long will ii t
take you to convince thswoild of human
equality and brotherhood by preaching whik
you openly violate the piinciple in youi
practice la precept stronger than exam
ple will men redace practice that
which the preaeher himself tacitly admits to
be impracticable alas for human weak
ness and the spirit of compromise which is
here displayedpurchasing the oppress ori
fovor by selling our birthright to liberty
this seeking our elevation in the ray path
way to selfdegradation will end only in dis
appointment shame and confusion
the question will naturally arise as to how
mr ward and hi friends will dispose of this
handbill and justify his speaking and their
assembling under its provisions r upon this
subject  cannot speak positively  have
understood from respectable sources that
mr ward denies being tbe author of tbe
handbill thia is goodso far as it goes
but to my apprehension it falls far short ol
exculpating him from just and severe censure
lie does not and cannot deny that he was
apprized of the infamous arrangement before
the meeting took plaoe he knew all about
the matter beforehand hit anawer to one
friend was that white men wrote the bill
and if there wu anything wrong in it white
men must make it right
now this answer is anything than credit
able to tbe honeaty consistency and good
sense of him who made it it is evasive
unsatisfactory and a mere quibble whict
will only sink its author deeper in disgrace
than the act which he deaigned to shitlc
from condemnation in a matter of this sort
a man like mt ward cannot be allowed
neutial ground he is here as an apostle o
hbetty and equality he is jealously it
watch over and boldly to defend the cause o
human freedom what if mr ward shouk
throw off all responsibility in the matter 
slavery and give up the contest under the
ridiculous pretext that if there he any
wrong in it white men have committed the
wrong and white men must mend it
would any man regard him in any othei
 light than as an apostate
i the answer in question shows to what vile
and paltry shifts a man in a false position
 willtesort he was rem inded of the nature
 of this bill by another friend who pointed
outthe objectionable feature which it con
tained and made no answer at all now
why was this course pursued by the elo
quent samuel r ward where was his
sense of justice where was his impartiali
 ty where was his manly indignation why
did he not denounce the whole transaction ai
once and declare either that he would not
speak under such a call oi that he would
take this handbill as the basis of his discourse
and show the improprietyof sending forth such
a handbill but he made no such declaration
 he manifested no sense of the insult offered
 to colored citizens and worse still attended
the meeting made an eloquent speech
treated his hearers to any quantity of fun
and never raised a whisper against the in
 famous handbill
now this leaves mr ward without excuse
 his silence at such a time was a sanction of
 the whole proceedings he is responsible
for the insult and degradation offered to the
colored citizens of philadelphia he mighi
have cleared himself of all blame in the mat
ter by disclaiming the contents of that hand
bill in the presence of the white committee
who are supposed to have framed it this it
seems he lackeo the manliness to do he
could not so far test thestnceiity of bis new
c converts and risk their applause as to tell
rthem that they were yet in the darkness of
slavery and under the influence of prejudice
but glazed the who e matter over in silence
now if this be fidelity what is treachery
i it is now no time to mince mattersno time
i to ran with the hare and hold with the
hound the colored people of this city and
i country have had enough of this playing
f fast and loose and the time has come unless
i i mistake the signs of the limes when they
i will demand of thotw who stand forth as their
advocates an inflexible adhesion to the prin

of blasphemy

sigma refers to my late blasphemy a
new york but makes no quotation aly
speech moves his choler and stirs within
him a holy rage surpassed only by that which
was expressed by that notorious profligate
and rioter capt isaiah rvnders who with
ins nefarious confederates day after day in
vaded the antislavery meetings in new york
uttering imprecations and threats against the
nonresisting friends of the slave and beha
ving in the most beastly manner
rynders says the new york courier
and enquirer seemed to be in a violent
passion probably bis feelings were much
wounded at hearing daniel webster and the
christian religion treated with evident dis
respect the pan on and representative
of ihe brothels rum holes and gambling hells

the christian religion and our glorious
uiiion  par nobile fratum
what shall be said of the fairness or hon
or of the man who takes a garbled report ol
a speech from a paper intensely hostile to the
speaker and assuming it to be authentic
makes it the occasion of scattering in this
community the most unjust and inflammatory
comments upon ill is this doing as he would
be done by can anything be more despica
ble what i said at new york was com
prehensively thisthat the popular tests ol
piety in this nation were of no significance
and proved nothing of love to god or man
because the offence of the cross has ceased
aad it is everywhere safe and reputable to em
brace them is this blasphemy or the ut
terance of an undeniable fact i said that a
profession of faith in jesus now costs noth
ing for his praises are everywhere sung and
his deeds are everywhere lauded by none
more loudly than by those who enslave and
imbrute their fellowmen and therefore this
is no longer a true test of piety can this be
truthfully denied finally i declared mv

xxxlst congressin senate
washington may  
after the ptesenmion of petitions mr
yuee moved to take up his resolution sub
mined yesterday in relation to the invasioi
of cuba
mr hale hoped it would not be taken up
asit must lead to debate and the time had
no arrived for taking up a special order
mr webster hoped it would be taken up
it was an important subject and ought to le
disposed of
the question being taken it was agreed to
consider the resolution mt walker moved
to amend by adding a proposition n questing
of the president by what authority he lisi
despatched vessels of the united states to
inieicepl or suppress the supposed resolu
tion
mr yuloe accepted the amendment and
addressed the senate in support of his reso
lution fiom information which he had re
ceived be was inclined to believe that the
expedition referred to was not a military ex
pedition such as contemplated by our neu
trality ob iations he recognized in the
highest r fft the importance of preserving
our neu ality obligations and designed to
make no to all proper constitutional
measures to that end what he desired to
call the attention of the senate to waa whai
seemed to him to be a gruss usurpation ol
powei by the president an attempt to cover
up a delinquency at home by the commission
of a great wrong abroad an expedition
had left our shores not for the commission ol
any act upon our own possessions or upon
the high seas and when beyond our jurisdic
tion altogether the executive had taken
measures to attest and defeat their move
ments if the rumors upon which the exe
cutive action was founded were true the ex
pedition was designed tor the coast ot cuba
a foreign jurisdiction and the duty assigned
to our national vessels was tr prevent its
landing upon that foreign coast and to pre
vent the landing of stores and supplies this
act was grossly in violation and denial ot the
tights of emigration and expatriation i
w as an outrage also upon the freedom ol
commerce national law provided a that
whenever a civil w ar breaks out or the flag
of revolution is unfurled there being two
belligerent parties in the field it is a neutral
commercial right of any citizen of the united
states to hire or sell vessels for the purpose
of furnishing either of the belligerent panies
with supplies of arms or anything else tins
right the executive was charged with having
violated in a manner in his opinion most un
justifiable and inexcusable in conclusion
mr yulee declared that while he had no
previous information with reietence to this
eipednion h a sympathies were wth the re
publicans who were endeavoring to release j
themselves trom tyranny and oppression
mr webster regretted that mrwalker
bad thought necessaiy to move the amend
ment he had offered because it was rather
offensive in its terms and was not exactly re
gular as il enquired under w hat authority a
certain alleged act had been done befoe any
evidence of the execution ot that act had
been furnished he imped the amendment
would be withrawn but if it was not he
would vote lor the resolution even as
amended he had beene xceedingly surpiised
at some of the propositions asserted by the
senat who had said among other things
that ihis s ipposed act of the president looked
like ftn act of warwar against whom
whil country what colony  what pro
vince it was important that we should gov
ern ourselves by some distinct undeislandmg
of the neutral duties of the government ano
of all her citizens as defined by the law ot
 if we mean to be neutral we were to
consider oui treaty stipulations everybody
knew that out stipulations with ispain ihe
executive jiower ol ihe united slates has
over and over again assured spainas far
as the executive could give such assurance
that it ahe would not voluntary give up iter
possession of cuba to a european power the
united slates would do all in their power tu
aas st spain in maintaining her possession
he did not intend to say how tar these stipu
lations were binding on congress bui simply
to remind the  n te that such stij ul ti ms had
been given as tar back as jacksons adminis
tration and made for the purpose and with
the view of inducing bpain not to part with
cuba to the advantage of an european pow er
and the consequent detriment ot our imer
asts and these views and acts of the exe
utive had been published again and again
and no objection to idem had ever been
beard
but what was it that had been complained
about it was said that the president had
directed a portion of the naval armament ol
the united states to go to cuba fi r certain
specific purpose and if the facts were as
stated and supposed to be those purposes
were not only legal right and constitutional
but the course ascribed lo the was
made hit duty by positive statute this
was a military expedition fitted out in the u
s to act against cuba il that was ihe fact
as the law forbade and was designed to pre
vent the fitting out of such expeditions in the
u s whatever the president had done was
eoriect whatever had been done had leen
placed upon the giound that the expedition
wav a military one and that it had been pro
jected and coinmeneedjin the united slates
if so the executive ws by law directed
wherever he could withinand under the juris
diction of the united siates to exert both
the military and naval power to supprtss the
expedition if an ameiican vessel was found
on tire coast of cuba in me execution of the
purpose of the expedition it was as much
under our jurisdiction as if laying at one ot
our harbors for it was a generally admitted
fact that the jurisdiction of the u t on
board of american vessels extended wherever
our flag floats the senator had also said
that tf a landing was made upon the island ol
cuba under a revolutionary flag that was a
breaking out of a civil war in which wc must
remain neutral between the parties engaged
in it that he admitted to be true but when
autfh civil commotion was aided on the one
side cr the other by tire fitting out in tins
country lf an armament that was against ihr
law of  rind what that law was express
ly designed to prevent the senator had
also thrown out a general remark that he
w as afraid this act of the president was ano
ther of acveral acts calculated to lead to the
suspicion that the policy ol the administra
tion is antirepublican mr webster thought
the remark gratuitous and unfounded ht
believed the president designed to execult
ike law honestly fairly and firmlyhe knew
of nothing in ins hie or acts to lead to the
supposition that the president was not a
good a republican as the rest of them
mr clay looked upon he movement i
altogether premature and did not design u
enter into its discussion he httped that thi
senate would not have their attention turner
from the admission of califoroa by any exp
diton fitted out in the south against cuba
he moved that the resolution be laid on thi
table fvt the puipose of taken up tbs specia
order which was agreed to
 be senate then resumed the consideration
oflne nimbus bill and mr soule addresser
the senate in support of the amendment sub
milted by jefferson davis against the pro
posed compromise scheme after a genera
reference jo the former questions pending be
tween the north and suuth be wbraiue
seme remarks on the texts boundary ques
tiou and objected to the provision of the til
which cut off two and a hair degrees which
by the compact with texas tell to tbs slave
holding territory the fugitive slave bi
had come back hardened with lestnenom
the question referring to the district of c
lurobia waa embarrassed with provision
which gave up all therights which he aout
had claimed and freed all slaves who wer
brought into the district and prevented
citizen from getting a slave the next pos
lion was the admission of california includin
in her boundaries all the territory acquire
fiom mexico adapted to slaver cultivation
before committing himself on this vote h
desired to consider the nature and extent i
ihe compensation given to the south in lh
establishment of territorial government
reading the tenth section of the bill whici
prohibits the tetritorisl legislatures from pas
sing any law hi relation to slavery he asked
what was this compensation nothing mor
than the statu quo of mexican lawthe stat
quo of mexican law with a vengeance
first the report declared that slavery doe
not exist by mexican law and next the bil
prevented the legislature lrom even recog
mzing slavery mr davis amendment dii
nut surrendei the docttine of noninterference
it merely protected rights which belong h
citizens of the territory under the consiiiu
lion the tenth section was a oounterpaito
ihc second resolution submitted by mr clay
which was met with such a burst of indigna
tion and alarm the bill instead of leaving
the question of the existence of slavery ji
mexico to be deiermined prohibited the
territutial legislature from passing any law
on the subject and gave to congress the pow
er ot voting any territorial law he also
considered the question of the existence ul
slavery in new mexicohe admitted that a
constitutional congress in mexico in 
abolished the slavetrade the measure was
considered by mexicans as belonging to i hat
class of legislation which is cal ed organic
it was consdered by the mexican authorities
that the mexican law was superseded by
american law thus a law prohibiting burial
rights to protestams w as abolished and su
persfded by ametican law but there was
another kind uf slavery in mexico peonage
and if the mexican law prohibiting alri
can slavery prevailed then the law establish
ing peon slavery also prevailed it would
iollow that an american citizen might be
come a slave to mexicans ermont estab
lished the same kind of slavery by the firsi
section of her constiiution it existed as an
institution in mexico but he maintained that
be did not himsell approve it mr soule
closed his remarks with an eloquent ana im
passioned appeal against the compromise
measure
mr clay said the debate had been conduc
ted thus far with great irregularity the
question before the senate was upon an
amendment involving a single point in the
discussion of which senators have launched
out upon every branch of the whole snbjcct
in vindication of the action of the committee
he felt bound to answer some of the objec
tions which had been urged by the senator
lrom louisiana the senator objects to this
scheme of compromise would the senator
bring forward his scheme of compromise
his proposition which should give peace to
the distracted country it was his duty to
sry what he wanted the senator had ob
jected that the compromise committee had
brought back the fugitive slave bill burdened
with restrictions instead of improvements it
was a little remarkable that the objections
to the fugitive slave bill came from those
stales who suffered little or none from the
escape ol slaves while it was entirely satis
tactory to those states which suffered most
lrom that cause
mi clay proceeded to defend the bill from
the objections which mr soule had urged
lu the course ot his remarks
mr soule interposing admitted that
slavery was abolished by the mexican law
hut contended that the constitution of the
united states set aside the law of abolition
e o instanti
mr clay resumedlf the senalor so be
lieved what more did he wantwhat did
he askwhat would he have would the
senator say
mr soule expressed his readiness to an
swer he was willing to abide ny the tenth
section it amended os proposed by his friend
from mississippi mr davis and had no
objection  but would go for the bill with
important but reasonable amendments
mr clay w as glad to hear the senatoi so
express himselfthere was some hope of
him afier all he had supposed from nis
speech that he was committed irrecoverably
against anv measure of compromise would
mr soule be satisfied with the section if the
clause objected to was stricken out alio
gethet
mr soule would be satisfied with the
amendment of mr davis
m claybut the senator knew that they
could not agree to that because it assumed
a tact winch he denied that slavery already
exists in mexico and a so that the constitu
tion ol the united stales carried slavery
there if however he would he satisfied
w ith a provision that the legislature shall
neither establish not exclude slavery he mr
clay wuuldftssent to it li was time that
the troubles in the country should be com
posed he had not been among those who
believed the immediate danger to the union
existed but he w as one of those w ho believed
that if this agnation was continued a year or
two longer there was no telling w hat danger
might ensue if the dissolution of the union
in terms did not ensue that w hich was next
to it to be dreaded wouldthe dicsolution ol
the ties ofcbmtian brotherhood which bind
us together as a nation lie also expressed
the belief that if this compromise bill or
some measure of the same character did not
pass nothing would be done for california
the territories and a fugitive slave act noth j
i mg to soothe the agitated feelings of the
country and to save the effusion of blood
and even if congress should pass any one er
i more of these measures it w ould have no
beneficial effect upon ihe country because
one section would continue biiterly to re
proach the other for having secured its own
ends without making provision fur the others
he also again contrasted the presidents plan
of settlement with that which the committee
had presented and called upon the friends of
i the former in preference to the latter to
stand up face to face in its defence he
challenged the contrast all agreed that it
was necessary to restore peace and harmony
to the country by some means what then
were the measures proposed fur that purpose
there were five gaping wounds all and each
bleeding and threatening destruction what
was the plan of the presidentlo heal all
thee wounds no but to close up one ol
them only and leave all the rest to produce
certain death instead of proposing a plan
comprehending the whole subject he had
pioposed one which was at most a feeble
palliative
he mr cay had seen with surprise and
regret the rebalance made by the chief mag
istrate to the scheme of the committee the
president had come here with his plan re
commending the admission of california
the senate agreed to that aa far aa it went
but thought it necessary to go further and so
proposed the president ought then in ihe
spiritbl compromise which should prevail in
both ends of the avenge w hen the com
mittee proposed additional enactments to heal
np these wounds he should have hailed the
measure with joy and given it his sanction
and support instead of opposing it it in any
mauner whatever mr clay also again
commented upon the evils of a military gov
ernment in a time of profound peace as ap
plied to the teriitories and ridiculed the idea
of any action by which the south should
maintain the equilibrium of power in the
union slavery was nut the only interest
in the minority in this country the mauulac
luring fishing commercial and other interests
 were alt in the minority and yt the majority
had not destroyed them in conclusion be
referied to the settlement of the miaaoen
question and predicted that the jov triumph
sad exultation which filled the country upon
ii it adoption would be again witnessed upon
the consummation of the pending measure

california message
mr haymund whig of va had taken
his position before the assembling of con
 gress in favor ol the admission of california
and had seen nothing to change his views
i he defended the president from the charge
 of usurping legislative power and invoked lu
north and south to stand on the platform ol
 nonintervention he said that he and mr
beale dem represented one filth of the
white kipulation of virginia and there was
not a sane man in favor of a southern con
federacy the people in the northeastern
section believe that the nashville convention
was conceived in sin and that ihe object ol
ihe getters up is disunion there need be
no fears for the old dominions pairiotbm
the disunionists in that commonwealth could
be put to rout by her sxity clerks in office

mr gerry dem of maine said that the
people of the north in common with the
civilized world have no sympathy with slave

sacredly and religiously discharge the duties
they owe to the uuion and slave holding

abolished except by the action of the states

what i saw at noondayin the streets
of cincinnati
friday may  was a delightful day
the sun seemed to shine with more than
usual splendor and as the several proceeding
days had been characterized by cold raint
and muddy streets the inhabitants were in
great numbers to enjoy the balmy air ot the
cheering spring the hole city appeared to
wear an aspect of peace and mildness that 
had not  e nre ol my short so

day while sitting at my window studying the
phases of human nature that passed with
the lively throng that crowded one of the most
public and fashionable of her streets that my
ear was startled wi h the cry ofmurder 
looked out and beheld multitudes rushing to
ward the market equate but to dense be
came the crowd that nothing could be seen
save the cloud of dust that arose from their
centre giving unerring indications that a
struggle for life was there going on yet
above the din and confused attendant upon
such a scene was heard the cry of an unfor
tunate victim for help suddenly theciy
ceases and the gathering crowd way
in all directions one blow from a weapon
neld in the hand of the kentuckian had pros
rated the struggling victim and silenced his
cries the captors jour in number then
drew iheir huge bowie knives and cocked
their loaded pistols and one exclaimed with
stentorian voice stand back you cowardly
ruffians ihe nigger is mine and ill have
him they then seized the negro who
had sufficiently recovered to stand upon his
feet and with the blood streaming down his
sable cheeks they began to push him toward
the river the captive was a mulatto much
belter dressed than his raptors and looked
much more the man he was slim and tall
and straight as an arrow lie had diank at
the fountain of fteedom and appreciated its
worth he had resided for years in ihe city
nor dreamed of mulesation and the though
of being again returned to the lash ol hu
master caused him to renew his leeble ex

pursuers help friends help he cried
as they hunied him or for the love of god

that pious feeling among sailors
which is so frequently awakened by
the vicissitudes of their lives has called
the name of providence to be given
to more than one coral reef and deso
late island in the indian seas rare
ly perhaps has it been more appropri
ately bestowed than if was on a small
rocky islet which lies to the northward
of the mozambique channel a few days
sail from the isle of bourbon this
story is scarcely known even to mari
ners of the nation to which the hero of
it belonged and therefore to make it
familiar to our readers may not be
thought undesirable
in the year of  m cremacy
the captain of a bourbon trading ves
sel resolved to visit the little island of
providence in order to obtain a cargo
of cocoanut germs for planting in the
colony to which he belonged the ap
pliances for navigating the eastern
coast of africa were at that time very
rude chain cables were not known
but were made from the fibres of the
plain simitar to teose which are called
goumonton in the belebeo coir on the
spanish main these cables are very
liable to be cut by the sharp reefs and
coral bottom which abound so plenti
fully in the indian ocean and in or
der to spare the anchors a wooden
frame filled with stones called a pe
gase was the frequent substitute
immediately on his anchoring in this
manner at providence m cremasy
went on shore and sent back his boat
with her crew to the ship while he ex
plored the island he had thus been
occupied for sometime when the ca
ble of the pegase broke and the ves
sel was carried out to sea by one of
the violent currents which set off these
shores the mate made sail as spee
dily as he could to regain the anchor
age but he was unable to head the
current and the night fell while he
was endeavoring to do so the cap
tain left on shore by this accident had
on at the time nothing but a jacket
and a pair of white trousers and for
his sole weapon a manchette a kind of
short sabre used in boarding
when he found himself condemned to
pass the night in this desert island his
first care was to construct a place ol
shelter and with the broad leaves ol
the cocoa tree he built up an ajoup
or hut and made his supper of cocoa
nuts eating the fruit and drinking the
milk he did not sleep over soundly
for he was tormented by ajvague appre
hension concerning his vessel the sense
of loneliness oppressed him and he
was somewhat in fear of rats and other
noxious animals at daybreak he
was on shore anxiously looking out to
discover a sail on the horison bul
nothing was visible through the misty
morning air the sun rose and dis
pelled the mist but his rays fell upon
a wide expanse of azure sea unbroken
by any vessel
he sat down on a reck and began
to meditate upon his future destiny
there was but one course open to him
to bestir himself for the supply ol
his daily wants with his manchette
in his hand he set out once more to
explore the territory of which he was
the unwilling sovereign he got noth
ing but cocoanut for his breakfast and
dined also upon the same fruita lux
ury to a schoolboy but held not in
equal estimation by a hungry sailor
though he thought himself lucky that
the island produced anything eatable
by dint of prosecuting his researches
m cremasy succeeded in making an
addition to his vegetable diet in the
shape of some wild cucumbers but he
was unwilling to eat them raw and
had no means of cooking them by fire
a native if the island had been peo
pled would have lit one for him by the
friction of two pieces of wood he re
membered the method of the savages
and procuring a sort of light wood
made a hole in it with another piece of
a harder kind and by twirling it rap
idly endeavored to kindle a flame but
whether from accident or want of skill
he wasnot successful in his attempt
and when the sun went down he was
once more left in darkness
on the following day he again look
ed out for the ship but again without
success he therefore redoubled his
efforts to procure fire and by dint of
perseverance at length produced a
light smoke upon the wood he then
hastily collected some fibresbres of the
cocoa nut and placed themin contact
with the ignitied substance and at
last was rewarded by a brillianj spark
which presently broke into ablaze
he now got together a sufficient
quantity to keep the fire all night
heaped it with branches and dried leaves
and watched it with interest until the
third moruing broke tired out with
his exertions he at length fell asleep
but he had not been asleep long be
fore he was awakened by a singular
noise as if some one was slowly creep
ing towards him he opened his eyes
and looked wishfully into the obscurity
of the dawn and presently saw a large
object stealing across the sand
he grasped his manchette and wait
ed nervously for its nearer approach
at length he discovered an enormous
turtle come according to the habits of
that animal to lay its eggs above high
water mark the turtle always selects
a situation that catches all the rays of
the sun they make a hole in the sand
cover up the eggs and fifty days af
terwards without fail their instinct
brings them back to disinter them
at the moment when the layer of sand
which covers them is removed the
young turtles break their shells and
follow their dam to the waters edge
and when they reach the waves they
make themselves fast to her belly and
are towed out to sea to qualify them
jn time for the feasts of the aldermen
as soon as m cremasy ascertained
who his early visitor really was he
walked stealthily towards her and turn
ing her over kept guard over her till
daylight came and dispatched her
it was a task of some difficulty to cut
her up but when he had succeeded
he found himself repaid for his trouble
the turtle was capital he boiled the
meat which he thought excellent and
preserved the fat which he disposed of
in the shells of the small turtle on the
shore and oat of the fibres of the co
coa nut be made wicks in this manner
constructing a very notable sort of
lamp antique in fashion and moreo
ver highly useful to season bis
turtle be then procured salt from the
evaporation of sea water and convert
ed the shell of his visitor into a cald
ron with these civilized means of
cooking he ceased to enjoy his cocoa
nut milk and laid in a stock of fresh
water obtaining it by sinking a well
into the sand
it soon became necessary to wash
his linen but he could not bring him
self to the resolution of remaining a
siogle instant entirely naked he there
fore would wash one garment at a time
wearing his shirt until his trowsers
were dried and vice versa he next
burnt a clear space round his hut to
keep off the rats and fortified himself
within a ditch well fenced against in
trusion by sharp palmetto branches and
the stiff leaves of prickly pears
in the course of his walks he had
seen a number of pigeons who allow
ed him to get tolerably close to them
he therefore set to work to hunt them
down on foot with a long pole and
thus added a very agreeable dish to
his repast for when roasted they pro
ved extremely tender and succulent
with flesh and fowl to supply his
table it was not long before he got a
third requisite of  good dinner on
the south side of the island was a coral
reef upwards often leagues in length
which the tide when it went out left
high and dry at low water the fish
hid themselves in the hollows where
the water remained and our solitary
islander discovered in this fact a new
source for employment every day at
low water he went out to the reef
sought for the reservoirs which con
tained the greatest number of fish and
then harpooned them with his boarding
sabre some of these he salted and
the rest were immediately cook
ed
but however earnestly m cremasy
labored to improve his position on 
thought dominated over all othersthe
hope of finding the means of escaping
from his solitude when not employ
ed in procuring and preparing food he
passed his whole time on the lookout
for any vessel that might shape her
course within sight of providence
his eyes were ever turned towadrs
that point of the compass where his
own ship had disappeared anda thou
sand painful apprehensions disquieted
himthe dread of its having been
wrecked on some of the sunken rocks
of that dangerous archipelago being
the most paramount but he was not
one to give himself up for any time to
inactivity he knew the value of the
proverb which tells men to assist them
selves if they look for aid of others
and accordingly resolved upon con
structing a beacon which should be
visible at the distance of several leagues
it was without difficulty that he suc
ceeded in collecting a sufficient quan
tity of heavy wood to make a pile he
heaped it a mass of dry leaves and
placed dry branches in alternate lay
ers with the trunks of the cocoa and
the palmetto this accomplished his
eyes wandered toward the ocean to
seize the favorite moment for lighting
up his beacon but da followed day
and his solitude grew more and more
dreary his only pleasure consisted
in watching the frigate birds as they
chased the gulls and robbed them of
the prey they brought home from the
great waters it was after all a mel
oncholy sort of pleasure for the
screams of the tarnished sea birds did
not tend much to enliven the solitari
ness of the shore
m cremasy at length began to get
uneasy about the condition ofhis ward
robe how could he manage to cov
er himself he asked when his shirt
and trousers were torn to tatters
the necessity of the case suggested
an expedient he manufactured a
kind of cloth out of the threadlike
substance of the interior ol the palm
wheth he wove together as well as he
was able it was not a firstrate pro
duction but it served at all events to
prevent the sun from scorching and
the night air from chilling him and
then he had the ineffable satisfaction of
admiring his own handiwork he
managed also to fabricate a pair of
sandals out of the ropy bark of the co
coanut tree
in this primitive costume he deter
mined upon examining the island thor
oughly the task was not difficult
for providence is little more than two
leagues in circumference and the sur
face is nearly level about onethird
of it the part which lies to windward
is covered with a forest of cocoanut
the currents and the prevailingwinds
have cast innumerable seeds on the
eastern shore where they have ger
minated taken root and in the lapse
of ages created the forest we spoke of
the remainder of the island is merely
a sandy plain with stunted shrubs scat
tered here and there but little grass
and what there is course in touch and
salt to the taste a more desolate spot
altogether can hardly be imagined
and here it seemed probable that mr
cremacy was destined to end hia days
deliverance came however when he
least expected it
he was one evening returning to
his ajoupa in a very pensive mood
absorbed in thoughts of the home he
feared he should never revisit when
as he stooped to gather some shellfish
for his supper be fancied that some
thing like the sails of a ship glittered
on the horizon in the rays of the set
ting sun he had been so often de
ceived by the clouds which assumed
the same form that he was afraid to
trust to his first impression he
watched the object steadily and noted
that while the aspect of everything
else changed this alone preserved its
first appearance and moreover that
it was nearing the island he could
no longer doub that it was a ship
his heart beat high between fear and
hope was if his own vessel or a
strangershould he at once light the
beacon at the risk ofrapidly and per
haps uselessly consuming what it trad
given so much trouble to collect
but the sail gmw closer he re
solved to take his chance ind the mo
ment it became dark enough for his
purpose he set fire to tie pile a
pyramid of flame shot up in o the sky
tod a minute afterward the report of
a gun assured hi that the signal had
been seen he ow listened intently
and the next sosnd that reached his
ears was the noiii of the oars in the
rowjodks as with measured beat thej
urged the boat as ore the keel gra
ted on the rocky bottom but he bad
already hailed the crew and in the
joyous answer ttyri floated over the
breeze he heard jhis own language
and recognized the voices of his ship
mates the vessel in the ofling was
his owu and the mate had come back
to look for him carried away by the
violent currents and water and pro
visions failing the former had been
obliged to make for anjouan near ma
gotte to vitual the ship he then re
turned in search of his captain
the exile wrote the history of his
thirtytwo days imprisonment and pla
ced it in a bottle which he hung upon
one of the most prominent treeß on the
coast an english vessel passing by
a few months since happened to send a
boat on shore for a supply of cocoa
nuts and thus discovered the narra
tive the sailors also tound that the
island was overrun with wild poultry
for when m cremasy took leave of
providence he lefthehind him a small
stock which multiplied as he desired
it was an offering of grateful remem

a pleasant occupation a cor
respondent of the albany express has
furnished the annexed account of an
individual residing at lake george
whose employment is thst of catching
and taming rattleshakes the staple
commodity of the principal mountains
in the vicinity of the lake
during my rambles i fell in with
a queer old covey apparently about
sixty years of age who profers the
sport of catching rattlesnakes to the
more pleasant and less dangerous one
of shooting deer and other wild game
or catching trout i was shown six or
eight ofthese amiable creatures which
were safely secured in a strong cage
made expressly for their accommoda
tion i his man sells large quantities
to itinerant showmenothers he kills
for the purpose of obtaining their oil
which is said to be very valuable be
ing an excellent remedy for rheumatic
and other complaints the modus
operandi of catching them is as fol
lows a strong leather loop or noose
is attached to the end of a pole eight
or ten feet in lengthwith this pole
he cautiously approaches the den in
front of which the snakes bask in the
sun placing the noose over the head
and neckthe noose being so construc
ted that when the snake struggles the
tighter he is held rendering escape
impossible when the old fellow wish
es to tame them and render them harm
less he extracts their fangs in the
following manner he lays the head
across a log of wood then places his
foot on the neck pressing it until his
snakeship throws back his upper jaw
the mode in which they bitehe then
applies a pair of pincers and with the
coolness of an experienced dentist
pulls out the fangs one by one he
has been twice bitten by these reptiles
and at one time came near losing his
life his body being swollen in a horri
ble mannerbut he fortunately discov
ered a weed of spontaneous growth on
the mountains which has proved to be
an infallible remedy for the bite of the
rattlesnake it is said there is no
accounting for tastes this mans em
ployment is a pretty fair illustration of
