from the new york tribune
slavery and freedom
the speech of gov seward
which we publish at length its indispu
tably one of the ablest and most con
clusive yet delivered in the senate up
on the compromise bill the com
pactness of its reasoning the breadth
of its scope the statesmanlike clearness
and profundity of its views and the
strength and felicity of its language
alike commend it to public attention and
render it fully woriliy the reputation
and position of its author it will be
read with approval and admiration by
all liberal and thoughtful men and
will be remembered after the contro
versy which has occasioned it has pass
ed away and is forgotten
mr sewards speech ou the compro
mise bill
in senate tuesday july  the
compiomise bill being under consid
eration mr seward having obtained
the floor spoke as follows
mr president if an alieg in our
land should chance to enter here dur
ing these high debates he would ask
whether california was a stranger and
an enemy or an unhidden and unwel
come intruder or a fugitive powerless
and portionless and therefore importu
nate or an oppressor and scourge of
mankind and therefore hateful and
dangerous we should be obliged to
answer no california yielded to per
suasion rather than to conquest she
has renounced her lineage language
and ancieit loyalty she has brought
us to the banks of streams which flow
over precious sands and at the base
of mountains which yield massive gold
she delivers into our hand the key that
unlocks the long coveted treasures of
the eastern world california refuses
only to let us buy and sell each other
within her domain so rich in all the
elements of legitimate commerce
she invites us to forego an unjust in
jurious and inglorious dominion over a
caste and to extend the sway of peace
of arts and of freedom over nations be
yond the seas still slumbering under
the mingled reign of barbarian super
stition and unalleviated despotism
the very head and front of her offend
ing hath this extent
the president of the united states
recommends nevertheless that cali
fornia shall be admitted unconditionally
wltue a committee of he senate insists
on conditions
i prefer the presidents suggestion
but not merely because it is his al
though i truly honor his patriotism and
fully confide in his wisdom nor do 
prefer his suggestion out of disrespect
to the statesmen by whom it is oppo
sed my veneration for them has been
abundantly manifested heretofore and
meeds no display of protestations now
we are in a frarnb of things disjointed
and in the confusion resulting from a
severance of parties and new conjunc
tion of statesmen each of us is
obliged to rely on the guidance of his
own judgment and conscience
i submit sir that the conditions
are unreasonable injurious and op
pressive in regard to california so
far a they are found in the bill before
us they are ist the establishment
of a territorial government in new
mexico silent concerning slavery
d the establishment of a like gov
ernment in washington d com
promise of a border dispute between
new mexico and texas the gar
ment of compromise thus quilted of
various fabrics with artistic skill is in
geniously pieced out with collateral
conditions in a report of two other
bills concerning slavery in the dis
trict of columbia the recapture of fu
gitive slaves and other national inter
ests or pretentions of slavery
it is not contended that california
needs aid from these conditions nor
that they can give it california is
taxed for superfluous power to draw
the dependent measures into port
which otherwise would founder and be
lost this forced condition therefore
hinders and tends to defeat the admis
sion of california
why is california subjected to this
pnibiymm√ü ut  dow she come with
volfc  no 
out right she has atreaty ia thal
treaty denied or questioned no il
it is unanimously affirmed
forma abide delay no her
lous condition not only appeals  out
justice but touches the very virtue oi
compassion within ns why then
should california be kept waiting
winter we make u eiretm throughout
the entire orbit of slavery california
neither brought the states into confed
eration nor constructed the constitu
tionshe neither planted slavery in
the slave states nor uprooted it in the
free states she is not found by the
side of texas invading new mexico
nor allied with new mexico in resisting
texas
she is guiltless equally of buying
and selling of holding and emancipa
ting of reclaiming and of harboring
slaves anywhere she has neither vote
nor speech here nor elsewhere where
this angry strife can be composed
she hns severed at a blow and forever
the loose political connection the only
connection she ever had with utah and
new mexico the slave states indeed
insist on a right to colonize new terri
tories with a caste but all agree that
the community in any such territory
may establish a constitution prohibit
ing caste california already coloni
zed has done this already and her
maturity is not well questioned al
though it has been as rapid and as be
wildering as the presentation of a mid
summer nights dream there is
therefore neither community nor con
nection nor even congruity between
the admission of california and the
conditions demanded it is binding
eros to antcros confiding youth to
querulous and wrangling age the
struggling hind to ravening hounds
we were told long ago that califor
nia would take time by yielding to this
most unjust combination we have
seen the error of that hope we are
making the overland journey of 
miles between the pillars of hercules
when we might have crossed the straits
of gibraltar on a smooth sea in six
hours
we were told that a minority in
another part of the legislature might
prevent the admission of california
and even bring the south to a dead
stand but it must work in its own
democratic and constitutional way or
must cease to work at all no one
nor more of the states can assume the
responsibility of arresting the govern
ment by faction optimis auspicis qui
quae pro republica quae contram uni
publican contra auspicia feed
i submit now that the conditions de
manded are equally unreasonable in
jurious and oppressive in regard to the
other parties affected by the combina
tion viz texas new mexico utah
and the district of columbia
each of these parties ought to be re
garded as asking only a just award
and congress is to be deemed ready
to make a just one and no other
such an award can he made only by
bestowing a distinct and separate con
sideration on each claim the same
principle of dialectic philosophy which
forbids multifariousness of issues and
confusion of parties in the administra
tion of justice condemns incongruous
combinations in legislation
the bill before us seems adapted to
enable senators to speak on one side
and to vote on the other to comply
with instructions and to evade them
to vote for the line of  o m and to
vote against it to support the wilmot
proviso and yet to defeat its applica
tion to the only territories open to its
introduction i solicitif stronger
language were courteous i might de
mandfrom the majority here a sub
division of the bill to enable me to vote
effectually for what i approve without
voting equally for what my own judg
ment concurring with instructions
condemns and thus to place myself
where i should invite all others no
place themselves under exact and full
responsibility to their states and to the
people
while i leave the interests of texas
in the care of her honorable and excel
lent senators i must be allowed to
think that their consent to this bill be
trays a want of confidence in her claims
or in the justice of congress a just
claim ought not to need an unjust com
bination those who assume that
texas has a valid title to all of new
mexico east of the rio grande as high
as the d parallel will necessarily re
gard that state as surrendering for a
pecuniary equivalent an evtensive re
gion effectively secured to slavery to
the equivocations of this compromise
those on the contrary who regard the
pretensions of texas in new mexico
as groundless will as certainly protest
against the surrender of  square
miles of soil pregnant with liberty to
the hazards of this adjustment both
of these parties i think must agree
that the united states ought not to pay
texas the equivalent unless her title
is good then the united states have
no constitutional power to buy her ter
ritory if they may buy a part of tex
as for purposes not defined in the con
stitution they may buyjhe whole if
they may buy the territory of a
slave state to make it free that may
equally buy the soil of a free state to
sterilize with slavery if it be replied
that the title is in dispute thenthe
transaction changes character the
equivalent is paid for peace and tex
as is not yet lifted up so high nor the
united states brought down se low as
to obtain my consent to so humiliating
a traffic
i have heretofore said that i could
vote to pay the debt of texas on the
ground that the repudiation of it by the
right is of no sex truth is of no color
united states in the agreement of an
nexation was fraudulent but texas
seems to prefer that we should buy do
main and dominion from her rather that
pay her debts she must be content
therefore to satisfy us concerning the
cardinal points in the bargain viz
first the reasonableness of tin
amount jo be paid
secondly the value of the equivalent
we are to receive
thirdly the title of the vendor
fourthly the use to which the ter
ritory it to be applied
first how much are we to pay
the sum is set down in blank and the
blank kept open the host achilles
keeps thicket here a philosopher re
plied to a man who ask leave to see
what he carried under his cloak i
carry it there that you may not see it
well we are obliged to assume that
texas is to be paid more than her
claim is worth because she will not
trust to a distinct and independent ne
gotiation the payment is a condition
ot the admission of california and thus
we see california the desire of the na
tion and the envy of the world redu
ced by the senate of the united states
to the humiliation of chaffering with
moneychangers and stockjobbers
continually baiting her offerrwith rich
er rewards to obtain her admission into
the union
the extent and value of the acquisi
tion are equally unsatisfactory when
the question is on the sum to be paid
texas owns nearly all new mexico
but when it comes on the domain to be
obtained it turns out that we are to
cede to texas apart of that province
to save the ret surely if we concede
to texas the admiration her represen
tatives require they must admit that
she knows how to coin our admiration
into gold
the titlerit is beyond dispute
that the territory which texas offers
was from time immemorial an integral
part of new mexico and that not an
acre of it ever was in the possession of
texas jt is equally clear that the
united states found it in the possession
of mexico and conquered and bought
it and holds it by treaty solemnly exe
cuted it is as certain that texas
never conquered it never bought it
and has no treaty concession to show
for it
but texas insists that she has an
equitable title she asserted i think
in  by a law on her statute book
that her boundary should be the d
parallel that is she declared her
purpose to conquer so much of new
mexico but she never executed nor
even attempted to execute that pur
pose she came into the united states
without it her statute was therefore
mere orutumfulmen and the united
states in the articles of annexation re
fused to commit themselves in the claim
of texas subsequently the united
states waged war against mexico not
for the claim of texas but for other
causes and being thus engaged ac
cepted new mexico and california as
indemnities for the expenses of the
contest after paying fifteen millions of
dollars for their access in value thus
the united states from obligation to
texas acquired the territory of new
mexico making the conquest and pay
ing the whole consideration alone
the claim of texas is as groundless in
equity as by the strict rules of law
the claim of texas is just as good to
the whole of california as to new
mexico
nor is the proposition more satis
factory in regard to the purposes to
which the territory is tc be applied
i am satisfied that the soil of new
mexico is free soil now by the opera
tion of unrepealed mexican laws i
know that it would be less safe if this
bill would raise a cloud upon the ques
tion  prefer rather to leave new
mexico as it is
new mexico has no representative
here every phase of this compro
mise exhibits a dismemberment of her
territory and yet she is to receive no
equivalent texas has already a vast
domain of surprising fertility new
mexico is less expansive and compara
tively sterile this bill nevertheless
literally applies the scripture he
that hath to him shall be given and
he thht hath not from him shall be ta
ken even that which he hath
the perversion of right proceeds up
on the ground that either new mexico
has no certain title or that she has no
political government to defend it
sir new mexico was a distinct col
ony of spain new mexico was a state
in the republic of mexico and after
wards was a political territory in that
republic she was never less than
that we found her in that condition
and character she sustains that char
acter now only her allegiance is
transplanted to the united states
whils some of the powers of govern
ment suspended by conquest remain in
abeyance she is a republic accord
ing to the definition of cicero res
publics res populi coitus multitudinis
juris consensu et ultilitatis communis
societas
new mexico has domain population
resources and qualified dominion arts
customs laws and religion she holds
these physical and moral elements of a
state subordinate to the united states
but nevertheless distinctly and apart
from all other communities new
mexico moreover has founded her
institutions on the principle oi the com
mon origin of man and the common
government of god and thus she pos
sesses the first last and chief element of
democratic or republican states
impartial civil liberty that element
which favors the creation of wealth
rochester n y thursday july  
without which a state must be power
less the equalization of property with
out an approximation to which a state
is exposed to oppression that diffusion
of knowledge without which republican
institutions cannot be preserved and
the developement of strength courage
and enterprise without e jltate
cannot flourish new mexico has
adopted the system that u oestadap
ted to maintain war and the system
that is best adapted to secure peace
new mexico therefore might well
have aspired even under mexican sway
and much more aspire under the fos
tering care of the united states to
such greatness as the free states in
this union have attained such great
ness as is attainable by purely demo
cratic states only
newmexico pressed by the en
croachments of texas and by the jeal
ousy of the slave states implores from
us protection of her territory and of
her constitution this bill of com
promise compromises ber claims by
dividing her territory right and left
boldly assisting a part to undisguised
slavery and the rest insidiously to ex
posed freedom sir if i concur in
giving any government to newmex
ico it mustbe as good a one as sho
has already although the drama of
our conquest in mexico tails into suc
cessive acts conducted by different
performers it is nevertheless one
whole transaction and if this bill shall
pass that transaction so far as new
mexico is concerned will be the con
quest of a free republic and the con
version of it in wholeor in part to a
slave state
what is newmexico that she
should be thus wronged an unof
fending rival prostrate at our feet i
pray you senators for the sake if not
ofjustice at least of magnanimity to
exercise your power over her by spar
ing her to punish her by forgiving
her the crime of loving liberty too
well her ancient charter contains
the glowing words established by the
consent of mankind as the foundation
of all true government which jeffer
son made our own
all men naturally were born free
aud were by privilege above all the
creatures born to coinman and not to
obey earthly authority not derived from
their own consent
that charter is in hands if
we erase all that out and give the
charter back to newmexico a muti
lated and lifeless thing we shall have
repeated the crime of the partition of
poland the crime of the subversion of
the recent brief but brilliant republic
of italy ws shall have emulated the
stuart who seized the charters of ihe
free corporations of england and
thereby lost a throne and shall have
surpassed the guelph who interpolated
taxation without representation into
the constitution of britain and thereby
lost the empire which we enjoy sir
it would be an act so unjust and so ty
rannical that it would upon the prin
ciples of our separation from great l
britain work a forfeiture of our title j
altogether hear what the good las
casas said to the emperor charles v
concerning these very possessions
notwithstanding your grant of all
this country from the popo and your
title by conquest you have yet no right
over them unless you do in the first
place as the principle end regard
their good the reason is that regard
is to be had to the principle aud cause
for which a superior or an universal
lord is set over them which is their
good and profit and not that it should
turn to their destruction and ruin for
if that should be there is no doubt but
that from henceforward that power
would be tyrannical and unjust as
tending more to the interest and ben
efit of that lord than to the public
good and profit of the subjects which
according to natural reason and the
laws of god and man is abhorred and
deserves to be abherred
sir i beg those citizens of the me
tropolis in the state from which i came
who have requested me to vote for this
bill to consider it in these aspects and
then to examine me and say how
look i that i should seem to be lacking
injustice and humanity so much as this
fact comes to
but it is said that the ordinance of
b is unnecessary in new mexico and
therefore is an abstraction and that it
gives offence
i cannot yield implict faith to these
who assure me that the pecularities of
soil and climate in new mexico ex
clude slavery they are combined
with other statesmen who deny that
point and this bill concedes the point
itself it expressly covenants to admit
new mexico as a slave state if she
shah come in that character i cannot
surrender a just and benevolent pur
pose to arguments which knit contra
dictions as closely as words can lie to
gether i know that there are slaves
at this moment in utah and i know
moreover that the discovery of a few
flakes of gold or of a few grains of
silver or even of a few clumps of coal
in the unexplored recesses of new
mexico would be followed by a new
revelation of the will of the almighty
in regard to it
sir perhaps those who excuse this
measure can point me to a tyrant who
ever deprived his subjects of what he
deemed necessary for them nero
thought that one neck would be more
than enough for the roman people
when he wished that they had but one
that he might destroy the body politic
at a single blow perhaps they can
point me to any act conferring or de
claring human rights that was not an
abstraction it was observed by one
god is the father of us all and all men are brethren
of the founders of the commonwealth
of england that the promulgation oi
those rights had always been in term
not concrete but abstract our own
experience is the same there is the
declaration of independence with its
solemn recital of the natural equality
of men and of the inalienability ol
their essential rights there is the
constitution of the united states be
ginning with a sublimesummary of the
objects and ending with its jealous bill
of personal rights what were these
but abstractions
there is the same bill of rights in
every constitution and even the con
stitutions of many of the slave states
hopefully assert abstractions of equality
which for want of only a complete de
velopment of political justice are not
yet reduced to the concrete by estab
lished laws
perhaps moreover the apologists
can show me some act declaratory oi
human rights that did not give of
fence the tyrant of france took um
brage at the noble motto which alger
non sidney inscribed in the album ol
the king of denmark nay algernon
sidney expiated with his life the offeoce
of publishing as mere abstractions
the fundamental principles of our own
constitution and among them was
the wilmot proviso thus expressed by
that immortal patriot
the liberty of one man cannot be
limited or diminished by one or by any
number of men and none can give
away the right of another 
equal justice always excites fear
and therefore always gives offence
otherwise its way would be smooth and
its sway universal the abstractions
of human rights are the only perma
nent foundations of society it is by
referring to them that men determine
what is established because it is right
in order to uphold it forevei and what
is right only because it is established
in order that they may lawfully changt
it in accordance with the increase ol
knowledge and the progress qf reason
the abstraction now in question is
the right of all the members of a state
to equal political freedom that is the
wilmot proviso that is the proviso ol
freedom call it by whatsoever name
you will if it ever was right at any
time at any place under any circum
stances it is right always in all places
and under all circumstances it can
be renounced safely nowhere cer
tainly new mexico is not the region
nor is hers the soil nor hers the clime
where it should be renounced new
mexico is the very field of the contest
if we surrender here where we have
all the vantage ground where else
shall we find ground in which to jnake
resistance
we have taken a breathing spell
from annexation of territory to divide
the gains this division once made
no matter how the national instinct
an instinct fostered by democratic sen
timents and sympathies and invigor
ated by martial ambition will hurry us
on in a career that presents scarce less
formidable obstructions whatever
seemed attractive to the slave states in
louisiana in florida in texas in
new mexico and in california is sur
passed in the valley of mexico in
yucatan in cuba in nicaragua in
guatemala and in other states of
central america there are fields
native to the tobacco plant to the rice
plant to the cotton plant and to the
sugar cane and the tropieal fruits and
there are even mines of silver and of
gold there the climate disposes to
indolence indolence to luxury and
luxury to slavery there those who
can read the wilmot proviso only in
the rigors of perpetual winter or in
arid sands will fail to discern its inhi
bition our pioneers are already in
these inviting regions our capital is
making passages through them from
ocean to ocean and within ten years
these passages will be environed by
american communities surpassing in
power and wealth if not in numbers
the unsettled and unenterprising states
now existing there you will say that
national moderation will prevent further
annexation but national moderation
did not hold us back from the missis
sippi nor from the nueces nor from
the rio grande nor from the coast of
the pacific ocean the virtue grows
weaker always as the nation grows
stronger
the demand of the slave states for
a division line of  o m or else
where across the continent between
slavery in the south and freedom in
the north betrays the near expectation
of these conquests the domestic
production and commerce in slaves will
supplant the african slave trade and
new slave states will surround the
gulf of mexico and cover its islands
these new states combined with slave
states already existing will constitute
a slave empire whose seat of com
merce on the crescent levee will dom
ineer not only overibe southern portion
of the continent but through the miss
issippi and its farreaching tributaries
over the valley between the alleghanies
and the rocky mountains this sir
is the dream of the slaveholder and
this is the interpretation thereof i
know full well that it is woven of the
stuff which all dreams are made of
i know how hopeless would be the at
tempt to establish and to maintain such
states and an empire composed ol
such states but i know that nothing
seems to slavery impossible after ad
vantages already woa and that calara
tiea distant and therefore divided will
tot deter it from the prosecution of its
turpose or extinguish the hope of
luccess
there is i sound maxim which teach
whole no 
es that every government iaperpetually
degenerating towards corruption from
which it must be rescued at successive
periods by the resuscitation of its first
principles and the reestablishment of
its original constitution the bloed is
not more native to the heart than the
principle of the equality of men con
tained in the ordinance of b to the
constitution of the united states
the constitution of the united states
confers no right upon congress to de
prive men of their natural rights and
inalienable liberty i shall therefore
insist upon applying the proviso not
only when it is necessary to save a ter
ritory from slavery but even when its
application might be waived as a means
of preserving and renewing the con
stitution itself it cannot be bad politi
cal husbandry to stir the earth and ap
ply the fresh mold to the roots of the
vine our forefather planted when its
branches are spreading themselves
abroad and clustering upon the states
which surround us
cherishing these opinions i have
struggled to extend the ordinance of
b over newmexico if i fail in that
i shall not then surrender it by enter
ing into the ridding covenant contained
in this bill but shall fall back as i did
in the case of california upon the peo
ple of the territory and leave new
mexico ip the mean time under the
protection of her ancient laws deeming
her more safe in resting free through
without guard in open danger than in
closed in a suspected safety this
sir is noninterventionsuch nonin
tervention as you and i can practice
and can justily not voluntary self
imposed nonintervention to betray
or expose freedom but compulsory
nonintervention when all intervention
to save it had failed the president an
ticipated that falure through the known
discordance between the two houses
of congress as we all might well have
anticipated it and therefore he re
commended the alternative without an
unnecessary trial it would have been
wise for the slave states to have ad
opted it then it would be wise for
the senate to adopt it now if we re
ject it a iittlo longer we shall only
reach it at last through the necessity
which he so well foresaw when that
time comes he will have his triumph
ant vindication for then it will be
seen that he did the most for harmony
and for freedom when to dull and pre
judiced apprehensions he seemed to be
doing nothing
i need only indicate the application
of these remarks to utah
the district of columbia the off
spring of the repubic is cherished
equally by all the states and if the
destinies of the nation are corruptly
apprehended the capital must one day
stand in dignity and for the liberal
arts without a parallel but it yet
lacks one element of greatness the
dignity af labor its atmosphere sup
presses although it cannot smother
the love of liberty which is a public
universal and undying affection why
should the great interests of the capital
be cast into the balance to bring up
the already buoyant scale of califor
nia the only reason is have
decided to overload that scale with the
weight of your gratuity to texas and
of the suppression of freedom in utah
and newmexico
such sir is the manner in which
california texas new mexico utah
and columbia are wronged by casting
their interests into the misshapen chaos
of fairseeming forms and mischiefs
manifold which constitutes this ex
traordinary scheme ef compromise and
adjustment
the scheme has engrossed the sen
ate six months to the exclusion of near
ly every other measure if it ever
shall reach the house of representa
tives its most auspicious promise there
is a rejection to be followed by a final
disagreement between the two houses
and this will be the sum of the history
of the first session of the thirtyfirst
congressthe history of an attempt to
break in one compact and twisted
bundle of fagots so strong and gnarled
that they could hardly be snapped
singlyan attempt to overcome rea
son passion and prejudice altogether
instead of engaging reason alone
we were driven and harrassed into
this strange proceeding by alarms ol
danger to the republicwell sir
california newmexico utah and the
district ot columbia were no sooner
crowded and crammed into this un
wieldy rickety arkthrough distrust
of the customary vehicles of legislation
to weather out the dark and danger
ous storm than the storm passed away
like a cloud in autumnthe ominous
kalends of june have come and with
theft tht extracofstiutiona as en
blage at nashville but not its invading
fleets and hostile armies so also the
crisis in the house of representatives
has come without disclosing the steep
ruin once apprehended the political
elements have subsided from their wild
uproar why not now resume the
voyage in separate vessels and follow
ing the presidential chart make the
port speedily and in safety
the answer is that the common
wealth is laboring of wounds which
threaten its safety it cannot be im
proper to apply to each of them a test
that will search it to the bottom
the first of them is the alleged ne
glect to surrender fugitive slaves hus
wound bleeds afresh at every return of
congress to the capitol
thamrao came next behind
whose enowd wound in lebanon allured
i he byrsn demrele to lament hi fee
in amor on diules all a tummers dejr
sir it i not proved here thafibrfc
fugitives a year are withheld against
lawful demands nay i think it it not
proved that even one is so withheld
the value of what is called slave pro
perty because the laws of slave states
makes it property is not impaired one
dollar strength beauty and youth
bring their accustomed prices whet
then is the evil the people of the
free states hesitate at the execution of
the act of  among them without an
adequate provision for distinguishing
between the real fugitive and the free
i citizenbetween surrendering tho un
j happy slave and kidnapping the still
more unhappy freeman atid what is
jyour remedy to give the form of
trial after the surrender in hie state to
j which the alleged fugitive is convey
ed sir this will only aggravate this
j exaggerated evil are you then pre
j pared to confess that this proud re
public approaches its downfall because
ia slave sometimes finds a refuge under
it in spite of its laws
the nextof these evils is the agita
tion about slavery in the district of
j columbia there are only a thousand
slaves here alt told the people of
the free states remonstrate against
j their being held in hopeless bondage
j but they wait patiently uutil the mind
of the nation can be moved to abolish
it what answer does this bill gve to
these remonstrances it proposes to
remove the slave shambles across the
potomac and in return for that con
cession exacts a guarantee of the
continuanco of slavery until mary
land shall consent to its abolition
sir this is heating the wound by plung
ing deeper into it the knife hat made
it shall we then authorize the newly
returned minister from russia to give
to his imperial master the gratifying
intelligence that this republic the
equipoise of despotism hastens to a
fall by a cause so inadequate and so
inglorious as the bare possibility that
 slaves may some five ten or
twenty years hence be redeemed from
bondage
the next of these evils is the en
croachment of texas upon new mexi
co well sir we will leave the ter
ritory of new mexico in the keeping of
the president and her free institutions
to the care of her own people until she
can come here as a state and demand
admission into the union
the fourth of these disasters is the
solitude of  mormons in the ba
sin of the salt lake but this soli
tude is of their own choice they
could could not live under govern
ment in any of our states it is there
fore solitude sw r eetened by independ
ence the remedy proposed by the
compromise is to extend to them in
stitutions like those from which they
fled sir the mormons when they
shall have gathered a population ade
quate to sustain a state government
can es tablish one and in the meantime
they will be living under the protec
tion of our arms and enjoying the only
laws they are yet prepared to endure
the is then only one real wound
upon the body politic the suspension
of california and this is the very one
which with exquisite surgery the
president proposes to us to heal imme
diately and by itself alone
but it is insisted that trivial as those
disturbances are the country is never
theless irritated excited and distracted
sir the country seem  to me neither
excited nor distracted it is worried
by our own delays and has become im
patientnot impatient yet enongh to
approve this bill but impatient for the
admission of california alone that is
all
still it is replied that the slavery
question must be settled that ques
tion cannot be settled by this bill
slavery and freedom are conflicting
systems brought together by the union
of the states not neutralized nor even
harmonized their antagonism is
radicaland therefore perpetual com
promise engenders conflict involves
unavoidably all questions of a natiuna
interestquestions of revenue of in
ternal improvements of industry of
commerce of political rivalry and
even all questions of peace and of war
in entering the career of conquest you
have kindled to a fierce heat the fires
you seek to extinguish because you
have thrown into them the fuel of pro
pagandism we have the propagan
disni of slavery to enlarge the slave
market and to increase slave represen
tation in congress and in the electoral
collegesfor the bramble ever seeks
power though the olive the fig and
the vine should refuse it and prop
agandism of freedom to counteract
these purposes nor can this propa
gandism be arrested on either side
the sea is covered with exiles and
they swarm over the land emigration
from europe and from asia and from
polynesia and from the free states
and from the slave states and from the
slave states goes on and must go on
will go on in obedience to laws which
i should say were higher than the con
stitution if any such laws were ac
knowledged here and i may be al
lowed here to refer those who have been
scandalized by the allusion to such
laws to a single passage by an author
whose opinions did not err on the side
of superstition or tyranny
if it be said that every nation ought
in this to follow their own constitutions
we are at an end of all our controver
sies for they ought not to be followed
unless they are rightly made they
cannot be rightly made if they are
contrary to the universal law of god
and nature discourses on govern
ment by algernon sidrey ch  p 
and wherever these emigrants go
whether they go from necessity or of
choice they form continuous unbroken
streaming processions of colonists
founders of states builders of nations
and where colonies are planted states
are formed of nations built labor is
there the first and indespensable ele
ment and it begins and prosecutes to
the end its strife for freedom and pow
er while the sovereignty of the ter
ritories remains here the strife will
come up here to be composed you
may slay the wilroot proviso in the
senate chamber and bury it beneath
hails tomorrow
when the strife is ended in the ter
ritory you now possess it will be re
newed on new fields to fortify advan
tages gained or to retrieve losses io
curred for both of the parties know
there is yet that word hereafter
senators have referred us to the
promise of peace heralded in the mex
ican compromise sir that prophecy
if but half its journey yet the sa
nexation of texas the invasion of mexico
this prolonged struggle oter california this
desperate contest for the snows and sands of
new mexico and deseret are all within the
scope and limits of the prediction and so are
tire strifes yet to come over ice bound regions
beyond the sr lawrence and sunburnt plains
beneath the tropics
but while this compromise will fail of all
its purposes it will work out serious and
lasting evils all such compromises are
changes of the constitution made in deroga
tion of the constitution they render it
uncertain in its meaning and impair ita vigor
as well as its sanctions this compromise
finds the senate in wide divergence from the
house of representatives by reason of the
undue multiplication of feeble consumptive
states effected by former compromises of
the same sort you will incur that evil until
the congress of the united states will be un
able to conduct the business of the cojntrv
by reason of a chronic disagreement between
this and the popular branch and the result
will be the abolition of one branch or of the
othei either of such would probably he fa
tal to liberty
this compromise is rendered doubly dan
gerous by the circumstance that it is a con
cession to alarms of disorganizatjpn and fac
tion such concessions once begun follow
each other with fearful rapidity and always
increasing magnitude it is time high time
hat panics about the union should cease
that it should be known and felt that the
constitution and the union within the limits
of human security are safe firm and perpet
ualsettle what you can settle confide in
that old arbiter time for his favor and aid in
settling fot the future what belongs to the
future and you will hereafter be relieved of
two classes of patriots whose labors can well
be sparedthose who clamor for disunion
either to abolish slavery or to prevent eman
cipation and those who surrender principles
or sound policy to clamors so idle
sir the agitations which alarm us are
not signs of evils to come but mild efforts of
the commonwealth for relief from mischiefs
past
there is a way and one way only to put
them at rest let us go back to the ground
where our forefathers stood while we
leave slavery to the care of the states
which it exists let us inflexibly direct the
policy of the federal government to circum
scribe its limits and favor its ultimate extin
guishment let those who have this mis
fortune entailed upon them instead of con
triving how to maintain an equilibrium that
never existed consider carefully how at
some timeit may be ten or twenty or
even fifty years henceby some means by
means of their own and with our aid with
out sudden change or violent action they
may bring about the emancipation of labor
and its restoration to its just dignity and pow
er in the slate let them take hope to
themselves give hope to the free states
awaken hope throughout the world they
will thus anticipate only what must happen
at some time and what they themselves
must desire if they can corne safely and as
soon as it can come without danger let
them do only this and every cause of disa
greement will cease immediately and forever
we shall then not merely endure each other
but we shall be reconciled together and shall
realize once more the concord which results
from mutual league united counsels and
equal hopes and hazards in the most sublime
and beneficient enterprizo the earth has wit
nessed the fingers of the powers obove

mr sewards speech
it is not our intention to fill up our col
umns with long political speeches but when
the nation is the subject of an agitation sel
dom if ever excelled when it is in the midst
of a great moral conflict which marks a dis
tinct period and forms a crisis in our national
histoiy when the friends of three millions of
bleeding and oppressed men women and
children are beginning to be heard in the
national councils and when in those councils
the voice of truth of humanity and of god is
finding an utterance we cannot regard it as
anything else than duty to let our readers en
joy for themselves some of the first fruits of
the struggle in which they have been engag
ed for years we regard this speech of mr
seward as well as his former and the various
heartcheering speeches that have been utter
ed in congress this session as some of the
first fruits of the long struggle in which abo
litionists have been engaged
we do not regard this speech as superior
to mr sewards former effort it is indeed
more classic and ornate but it lacks the poin
and edge which the former possessed that
which gave us the most pleasure in mr sew
ards foimer speech was his advocacy of the
faw of god as superior to law of man
while therefore mr seward and aboli
tionists propei differ as regards the prosla
very or the antislavery character of the con
stitution both must come at last to the same
conclusion that slavery even if constitutional
ought immediately to be abolished mr
seward and those who act with him politi
cally must come to this conclusion from the
position he and they occupy namely that
slavery is contiary to the law of god the
aboliiionist comes to ihe same conclusion be
cause he believes slavery to be contrary both
to the law of god and the constitution ol
his country
how moitifying it is to see a politicise
boldly and faithfully condemning slavehold
ing as contrary to the law of god while at
many professed ministers of christ declare il
to be in harmony with that law
so far as we have been able to observe th
speech meets with very general favor

the senate was occupied as will be seen
today with the concluding portion of mr

ed his more ultra positions and to talk more

listened in or out of congress it command

may regret or conuemn some of the opinions
he has advanced during this session bis
great abilities were universally admitted by
all who heard him of both parties i have
seldom if ever beheld the senate when it
was hushed into so profound silence by a
speech upon any ordinary occasionl can
not help imping that senator seward will
renounce every vestige of ultraism and come
out upon purely national grounds but i think
lie is fast verging toward such a position

his speech which will be found in another

letter from the editor
cincinnati july  
dear readers after a long and tedious
journey i reached this farfamed young city
of the west yesterday at  p m i took
passage from buffalo on board the new and
beautiful steamer alabama  for sandusky
city on tuesday night at ten oclock
there was some hesitation on the part of the
clerk about giving me a ticket but after
consulting with tbs steward and waiting on
a number of white gentlemen who applied
for ticketa long after i did he at last conde
scended to give me a firstclass ticket for
ten dollars through to this city and to direct
me to a stateroom which though badly ven
tilated was quite tolerable did not duty re
quire it i would never travel on lake erie
beautiful as it is while the abominable pre
scription of colored persons prevails for of
what value are all the beauties of nature
where human nature itself is violated degm
ded and insulted
parting with my esteemed friend a h
francis of buffalo who kindly accompanied
me to the steamer and did what he could to
secure me a comfortable passage i went
immediately to my beith seeking to avoid
recognition or observation and to pass the
time of the trip in quiet i was of course
required during the passage to take my
meals alone in other respects my fare
though not equal to that of the first table
was good enough for a plain man
notwithstanding my desite to pass unob
served during tbe passage thanks to th
proslavery pressl am altogether too noto
rious to travel long unknown in any part o
i this country  was soon surrounded by i
number of gentlemen and solicited to addrest
the fpasseogers the unanimous consent o
all parlies being obtained j did not feel a
liberty to decline and therefore addressed th
meeting in a speech of one hour and a half
and was listened to for the most part wit
evident interest there were slaveholders or
board and some proslavery men wtio o
course did not very well relish ray anijpad
versions on our national character and pe
culjar institutions but the affair as a whole
passed off well and the effect i ihink wai
good several gentlemen spoke to me after
ward in a kind and respectful manner and ai
altered tone of feeling towards me was pretty
evident there were a number of pleasan
and intelligent colored men on board ant
they seemed especially gratified that i hat
spoken and some of them showed their in
terest in our common cause by subscribing
and paying for tbe north star so mucl
for my antislavery meeting on board tb
steampacket alabarfla
wednesday was a beautiful day and th
broad expanse of tbe inland ocean with the
imposing forests which extend along its south
shore presented a view of beauty and gran
deur seldom surpassed the steamer touched
at several ports on the lakefairport ash
tabula and cleveland the landings were
performed with great despatch and we were
soon off again swinging clear of the land
and breaking again the cresting waves of the
broad blue lake about twenty hours from
buffalo our steamer brought us safely into
the bay of sandusky this bay is a fine
sheet of water encircled by land well cov
ered and sheltered by lofty luxurious woods
and forms x fine harbor sandusky city is
built upon a low fiat uninteresting illcon
ditioned surface and looks peculiarly inviting
to sickness it is not surprising that tbe
cholera should have made such inioads and
havoc among its population the land is
exceedingly low and but poorly cultivated
for many miles around the railroad from
sandusky to springfield is rightly named the
mad rivet railioad for though the river
may be tame enough tbe road is one of the
craziest that this country affords its rails
are flat and are so irregularly laid as to jostle
tbe cars from side to side like a ship encoun
tering adverse waves upon ibis toad i was
tossed all night sleep wta out of the ques
tion i felt as tired in the morning as a sailor
at the pumps the road from springfield to
cincinnati is good and will compare favorably
with the best railroads in new england and
new york there is no proscription on ac
count of color on this roadat least  re
ceived no ill treatment from any of the serv
ants or officers on it tbe country from
springfield to cincinnati is charmingly beau
tiful the soil is rich the crops look well
and promise a fine harvest tbe miami
valley through which the road from spring
field to cincinnati passes is one of the
in tbe country its woods are peculiar for
richness covering the hillsides from base to
mimeail no lover of nature can pass thro
his valley witboutbeing soothed and chsrmed
j its tranquil beauty the trees reminded
ne of some of the best caradfiw woods ol
stilish noblemen they needed little labor
o make them superior in many respects to tbe
aoet beautiful in devon bite when i
bought that this fertile valley is probably l
owned by the hardlnded fanner whose
neat dwelling and luxuriant fields broke upon
me at intervals and varied the pleasant view
l felt that the people might well celebrate the
fourth of july they have some reason to
do so i could almost have joined with them
if i were not checked and saddened by the
recollection that even this beautiful valley ia
but uommon huntingground for menthat
even here the panting slave may be ckaaed
caught chained and buried back into inter
minable slavery with t bis thought i could
not but look upon the parade and noisy de
monstrations which met us at every village
aa bellow mockerydeceitful show
five hours brought us from springfield to
cincmsaii and in foil view ot the ohio
river this is the nearest approach  have
ever made to the land of slavery since i es
caped the grasp of my inaater now nearly
twelve yeara ago
during the memorable odfe hundred con
ventions held in the western states seven
years ago under the management of the
massachusetts antislaveiy society i waa
strongly tempted to accompany my brother
this city but waa earnestly ad
it by my amislavery friend
who deemed it unsafe  was then a slave
british gold had not broken tbe legal power
of mv master over my person and it was
feared that  might be kidnappedspirited to
the kentucky side of the ohio and doomed
to a life of slavery saw the danger and
shunned it yet i felt a certain slavish feeling
quite galling to my spiit i had reached the
southern wall of my prison and was
chafing against its rough aides when  had
fancied myself in a free state there ia a
bitter peculiarity in feelings induced by such
a state of things to dread the serpent the
hyena the tiger and other ferocious inhabit
ants of tbe untamed forest is natural we
shrink from these instinctively but to be
afraid of our brother man to dread the
approach of a being whose presence should
shed over us the bright beams of social hap
piness and inspire us with confidence and
brotherly kindnessa being who should em
body in his character the light and light of
justice and mercyto see in a being ranked
by the living god as but a little lower than
the angelsthe malign qualities of the vul
ture and the wolf adds to the pang of fear
an intense mortification and sense of degra
dation too painful to be described that
hundreds of slaves prefer the danger and
darkness of the dismal swamps to the homes
and plantations of their christian masters
is proof that they dread he wolfish propensi
ties of the slave holder more than they dread
the real wolf the appetite of the wild beasts
may be satisfied his thirst slaked but who
can satisfy the blood thirsty slave holder
he is unappeasable the more he gets the
more he wants this vindictiveness is equal
to his selfishness while the one is increased
by torture the other is not lessened by what
it obtains like the insatiable horse leach
bis cry is give give give from the power
of such monsters it is not strange that the
slave should strive to keep elear but  am
digressing my journey to this city though
in many respects agreeable wan altogether
too rapid rough and laborious to afford me a
chaifce of writing a word for the star by
the way and the distance from cincinnati to
rochester is so great that  fear this will not
reach the north star office in time for next
weeks paper i shall however hoping
against hope huny off a short sketch of my
journey and doings since monday morning
ist of july up to this the fifth day of my
absence from homef o
the above letter was received too late to be
inserted in the last weeks paper
letter row the editor no 
cincinnati july  
my last letter brought me to cincinnati
and to the fifth of july  have been so hur
ried by my appointments and oppressed by
the excessively warm weather as to be una
ble to attend very faithfully to my editorial
correspondence ah who sympathize with
the object of my mission and some who do
not so sympathize appear to think that they
have especial claims upon my time and at
tention and to these claims well or ill found
ed  have been disposed to yield
my first meetings here were held in college
hall a spacious room capable of accommo
dating from one thousand to fifteen hundred
persons j held two meetings on the fifth of
july afternoon and evening the audience
was large and the thermometer at ninety
six as might have been expected so soon
after the fourth of july when the great deeds
of our venerated and revolutionary sires were
fiesh in every mans memory it was difficult
to speak with any force or faithfulness with
out giving offence to some patriotic souls who
heard me iu my first speech i did this
my sentiments btired up the elements of
wrath in a couple of gentlemen from louis
ville kentucky their chivalrous spirit was
dreadfully ruffled and they spoke right out in
the meeting one of them bravely told roe
that i ought to be in the penitentiary and
that if he tad it in his power he would put
ijte there with many other similar compli
mentary expressions their impertinent and
vulgar interruptions were exceedingly annoy
ing to the hearers but not very embarrassing
to me they were turned to the accountof
freedom and perhaps did as much good as
anything  could have said during the time
occupied by the interrupters j observed that
these gallant kentuckians received very little
encouragement from the citizens of cincin
nati if i mistake jtot the men of the
buckeye state  have nearly come to the
conclusion to let the man stealers of old ken
tuck do their own mobbing and other dirty
work and although they believe in allowing
to slave holders some privileges that they do
not usually accord to others or claim for
themselves they nevertheless seemed to think
on this occasion that theie were limits even
to the privileges of slave holders according
ly one of the cltaeoa stepped toward the up
roarous slave holding dondiet ana gave them
to ondeistand that  they did not cease their
aoboeralic demonstrations they might possi
bly get their cloth soiled mad perhaps other
wise mired they were tom that if they did
not behave they weuld be put oo of the
boose this sober admonition bad the desir
ed effect the gentlemen became orderly and
all has gone os smoothly since i understand
tme of them now mr stewart professes to
have become a convert he sat very quietly
and listened very attentively to my remarks at
thesecood meeting whu know but what
be may yet fine bis slaves such a result is
out impossible though i fear it a improbable
cincinnati is one buttered and fifty miles fiom
louisville a hasty conversion might easily
vanish into thin air during the journey
from one place to the other the oorrnpnng
influence of slavery is so strong that be must
be a well organised man and deeply imbued
with the spirit and principle of human free
dom to rise above its pernicious power
 have now held five meetings and deliver
ed five addreaaesin this city three in college
hall one on walnut hill and one in the
second baptist church on baker street all
the meetings have been numerously attended
and i am informed that many have kept away
on account of the intense heat and the preva
lence of cholera this dreadful disease
seems to have fully entered upoe its mission
of death and numbers its victims by fifties per
day the german population suffer moat
from the ravages thus far but it now seems
likely to spread among the population at
large there are several causes which make
cincinnati peculiarly liable fp this and other
frightful diseases it is completely surround
ed on three aides by lofty hills so that the
purifying brecoes bvp not fair spope jt is
closely and compactly built the houses are
high the streets are uarrow and are paved
with a soft limestone wholly unfit for the pur
poseit being next to impossible to keep
them in repairthey are cuf by the wheels of
carts drays and carriages into deep boles
these soon ll up with water and filth the
hot sun blazing upon them they foment decay
and with the aid of swine that wallow in them
they send forth a noxious stench truly sick
ening i understand that it is the purpose of
the city authorities to cause these limestone
pavements to be taken up and to relay the
streets with a superior harder stone which is
now obtained from the bed of the river
when this is done it will be much easier to
keep the streets clean and the health of the

in slavery right 
is slavery morally right i this is a ques
tion which in the abstract would receive an
unanimous negative but when viewed through
the medium of selfinterest it becomes debata
ble and gives rise to councildarkening con
troversies the advocates of slavery seldom
refer to its moral legality but attempt to jus
tify it on the grpupd of constitutional legality
southern chattel breeders with all the
navivete of the shrewd patriaieh of ring
streaked memory point to the federal cove
nant and with the pathos of injured inno
cence complain of its infraction when men
of the north refuse to make more effectual
provisions for depriving people of certain
inalienable rights among which are life lib
erty and the pursuit of happiness when in
the course of human events they dissolve the
bands which have connected them with others
and assume that station to which the laws of
nature and natures god entitle them and
eyen among northern men who have often
times been reputed wise reprehend this re
fusal because it appears to them like an effort
to reenact the laws of god and the declar
ation of independence they seem to think
that although it was wrong for the south to
chattelize man still it may possibly be txpe
dient for the north to rechattelize him or
to compare great things with spallthat
there should be more effectual provisions for
the restoration of stolen goods to the thief
after they have been recovered by the lawful
owner but a higher principle than consid
erations of mere expedience should influence
the decision of questions involving the dearest
interests of humanity the dictates of just
ice imperious justice must be regarded
there is there can be but one answer to this
question slavery is wrong totally wrong
let those who would rather be right than be
president beware of following the ignis fatuus
of decomposing hopes of greatness into the
moral quagmire of expedience it is vain to
attempt to effect a compromise between the
laws of god and the third paragraph f the

these dear friends who with their wives
have been engaged for several months as onr
readers are aware in visiting the west in
dies arrivedin new yoik early on the
th ult from jamaica we have had the
pleasure of seeing them in new york and
also in philadelphia their report of the
effects of emancipation upon the planters snd
the colored people differs widely from the
accounts circulated in the newspapers of this
country
a great change has come over the minds
of the planters in regard to slavery and
our friends met with none who would he wil
ling to have the old system restored they
were received everywhere with the utmost
kindness and held large antislavery meetings
in most of the colonies rejoicing to see even
old oppressors hearing testimony to the val
ue of human freedom and expressing their
gladness that slavery ia no more amongat
them
the sentiments of our friends relative te
the condition of the laborers and the eause
of the existing commercial depression in the
islands are similar we believe to those ex
pressed by a correspondent of the new york

dear friendwe beg leave to lay be
fore you brief statement of fecta in relation
to injuries recently inflicted upon ua for
some time previous to itm april the colored
ehsdien of albany attended the several
district schools in the city as it was clearly
heir right to do the colored people being
shslly with others for the support oi
rubiie schools but at that time our school
commissioners adopted a resolution ejecting
the coioted children from the slid schools
i fot no other fault than their complexion and
i directing the several teachers not to adroit
our children for instruction thus compelling
us to send oor children to an inferior school
provided for their exclusive use and incon
veniently located or else to be deprived of
the benefit of the public school fund
this act of injustice induced ua to make a
united effort to have these grievances re
moved and accordingly we assembled and
protested in respectful but earnest terms
t a bjt ib of the commiasiooera and
em  recind the offensive reao
lntvr our appeal va made in yinthe
commissioners did not even ueign to reply to
it thus virtually denying ns the right of
petition them on the subject of our wrongs
a further appeal to the superintendent was
equally futile
failing to obtain redress by these pacific
mesne snd regarding the principle involved
as of top greaj importance to he abandoned
without struggle yre have resolved to teat
the legality ot tbeir doings in a court of jaw
to cany out our purpose we are compelled
to request the assistance of our friends our
object in now addressing you is to solicit a
contribution from you in aid of our under
taking apd wp confidently trust that our ap
peal to your generosity will not be made in
vain n deciding upop the merits of our
application to your sympathies we hope you
will divest yourself of any unfavorable im
pression growing out of our soeialj condition

your letter in behalf of the colored people
of albany is just received
the colored people of the northern states
are not mistaken in tbeir conclusion that they
are the subjects of the deepest and most
cruel wrongs rut they are mistaken in
regard to the remedy for those wrongs this
remedy is to get rid of their selfdegradation
and to cultivate selfrespect until they res
pect themselves others vyill not respect them
until they cease to degrade themselves
others will degrade them i have held this
language to them for many years but they
prefer closing their ears to me and opening
them to their flatterers and deceivers
how traitorous to his own rights and the
rights of his racehow wanting jn selfre
spect nay how baseis the colored man
who will consent to belong to a church or to
a political party the members of which make
his complexion a bar to social equality what
a curse to the antislavery cause is such a
colored man i care npt what my be his
merits it is better for this cause that he be
below than shove ground
i have often thought with horror of the
significance of the vulgar and profane ex
pression ill see you damnd first and
yet i would see a man damned sooner than
i would consentto damn myself now one
of the most effectual ways of man to damn
himself is to degrade himselfto defile and
debase his soulby such political and eccle
siastical associations as those to which f
referred he had better see all the
politicians and religionists around him go to
perdition than suffer himself to be guilty of
descending from the heaven of selfrespect to
the hell of selfdegradation
shall i ever see the day when the colored
men of the north shall sternly and invincibly
refuse to vote for those or identify them
selves in church relations with those who
refuse to eat by the side or to ait in church
by the side or to let their children sit in
school by the side of colored persons slave
ry cannot long survive that blessed day
your proposed litigation will probably
avail you nothing inasmuch as you despise
yourselves your judges and jurors will also
despise you nevertheless your cause is
right and i will stand by it and contribute
money to sustain it i send yon herewith my
draft for  you will write me from time
to time as you shall need mere money to
carry pn the law suit
notwithstanding this recent insult to the
colored people of albany i expect to hear
after the next fall election that they have
again voted for anliabolitionists and the des
pisers of their race in the name of consis
tency what right have they to complain of
this insult

passed after discussion
resolved that passing events do but
deepen our conviction that a sectarian reli
gion is the greatest hindrance to the deliver
ance of the slave
resolved that eveiy slaveholding gov
ernment is bat a piracy and that hence if
pirates invade cuba or south carolina bra
zil or georgia there is no more reason why
abolitionists and believers in righteous civil
governments should sympathize with the in
vaded than the invading pirates
resolved that the government is deeply
unjust which disfranchises woman which
denies its subjects the right to buy and sell
freely what they please which permits the
sale of intoxicating diinka which consumes
the earnings of its subjects in wars which
tolerates or practices land monopoly which
refuses to the accused or to any party litigant
the right of having his cause tried by judges
and jurors who are not members of secret so
cieties or which sanctions or permits the
practice of the matchless crime of slavery
whereas the new york stale temper
ance society has from the first proclaimed
hat the suppression by civil government of
the sale of intoxicating drinks is the meas
ure most emphatically indispensible to the
success of the cause of temperance and
whereas at its late annual meeting it re
considered and rescined its resolution that it
is grossly inconsistent for the friends of tem
perance to be connected with political pat
ties which refuse to favor the aforesaid meas
ure
resolved therefore that a member of the

the count and countess dembinski
we had the pleasure of a visit yesterday
fiotn the count dembinski neyhew of gene
ral derobidski of the hungarian army after
many dangers and sufferings he has reached
this country in company with his heroic
wife and intends to make his home among
us at least until a more auspicious day shall
dawn for the independence of his unfortunate
country he has sdrved as officer of engi
neers both in the austrian and hungarian
armies and his appearance denotes the pos
session of practical energies which will we
believe insure him success here the fol
lowing interesimg account of his adventures
after the fall of hungary was written on
board the steamship washington by his
fellow passenger mr g p r
the name of the gallant old general
dembinski is familiar to all who have taken
an interest in the struggle of the hungarians
lor constitutional independence but it is not
so generally known that hia nephew a young
and ioble engineer officer of great promise
also drew the sword in the same good cause
and was the companion of kossuth in all his
struggles and misfortunes it is this young
nobleman count dembinski who after hav
ing sacrificed all his prospects in this high
cause now seeks a refuge on these shores
with bis young countess who has shared all
his dangers and sorows we have only
space to give a very brief sketch of a history
in which every page is a romance of real
life but the facts are these and they are
vouched for by authority which we cannot
doubt
count dembinski a young nobleman
from polish galicia was a major in the
hungarian service and during the war ol
hungarian independence became aidede
camp to the governor kossuth he mar
ried in the midst of the troublous times which
we have lately seen in europe a young lady
of temeswar in hungary she with noble
devotion followed him to the field and re
mained in the camp for many months at
length the vast force brought by russia to
the aid of austria the suriender of gorgey
and the fatal battle of temeswar rendered
the hungarian cause hopeless and kossuth
accompanied by the young count and count
ess and a few other friends faithful to him
to the last fled to widden on the turkish
frontier here they remained three months
receiving protection from the turkish au
thorities it is true but suffering dreadfully
from many privations as well as from con
stant rumots of the demands of austria and
russia for their extradition and from the
news of the coldblooded slaughter of many
of their fiiends and companions left in hun
gary
at the end of three months they were
removed by the turkish officers to shumla
an eighteen days journey in the midst of win
ter it is impossible to describe all that the
young countess had to endure during this
march being often obliged to walk on fool for
many miles under rain suow and all the
inclemency of the season but she was cheered
by the promise of comfort and protection for
herself at shnmla and of employment and
independence for her noble husband all
these hopes however were destined to dis
appointment it is well known that the
sultan made most liberal provision for the
hungarian exiles but it is well known also
that his officers with shameless peculation
perverted the funds destined for their support
from the proper objects and during their
three monhs detention at shumla the suf
ferings of the count and countess were
terrible both from privation and from the
inclemency of the weather at first they
were placed hi tg hall pierced in every
part with unglazed windows out me tmenae
cold soon drove them to take refuge in a
mere hut of the smallest size through which
the rain and snow penetrated at many points
treated more as prisoners of war than as
guests their nourishment was exceedingly
scanty and the promise of employment in
the ottoman army to the count was loaded
with the condition that he should abjure the
faith of christ which he firmly declined
the health of the young countess at length
gave way undet her suffering and she was
prevailed upon to accompany to constanti
nople an old german lady who had previous
ly made the most noble exertions in behal of
the hungarian exiles at constantinople
the young lady was most kindly received by
john p brown esq dragoman acting as
charge daffairs at the time for the united
stales who took her to his own house and
treated her like his child during three months
in the mean time the count her hus
band was still detained at shumla till after
kossuth was forcibly removed to kentijha
count dembinski was still anxious to accom
pany his leader but he was not permitted
and after some further detention he at once
received the intelligence that his wife was
seriously ill at constantinople and be received
passports from the american legation the
turkish authorities however would not
suffer him to depart and he determined to
effect his escape obtaining the disguise of a
hunter he made his way through innumer
able dangers to varnr where not daring to
embark in a steamer he obtained a passage
in a greek vessel which was eight days in
reaching constantinople by the aid of some
friends called forth by his misfortunes and
high qualities he was enabled to proceed to
england in the poltinger steamer anthence
embarked in the teamer washington for the
united slates

they breathe a tone of honest indignation

antislavery in old timesh is well

zeal and courage in preaching against it while
he christian world was asleep on the sub

of dr bellamy attached to the new edition
of bellamys works which is interesting
and illustrative of the feeling of the most con

dr hopkins called one day at the houst of
dr bellamy and while there pressed on
the latter the duty of liberating his only
slave dr bellamy defended the custom of
slaveholding by the usual arguments but dr
hopkins having refuted them one after ano

to act on the principle of doing to others as
he would have them do tq himln reply
dr bellamy said the slave was faithful and
judicious that he was trusted with everything

dissolving the union
we recollect an account of circumstance
which occurred ir a neighboring town mwj
years since which is so apposite to the state
of political matters at the present day that
we cannot forbear the temptation to repeat it
a worthy citixen happened to have for hi
partner a lady of very exacting disposition
and withal not of the most mild and agreeable
temper whenever she had a desiie to be
gratified and fai led to obtain her husbands a
assent to it by any other means she bd an
unfailing resource in threatening to commit
suicide the poor man got along with this
as well as he could for a long time till lie
found his ability to comply with all that was
required would soon be exhausted when he
formed the desperate resolution to leave
madam to her own course and see the result
the opportunity soon ooccurred the
usual threat was made he very quietly
offered her any assistance she might need in
the accomplishment of her purpose she
seized a knife and ded te an adjoining room
where she had pieviously placed a dish ol
water for the occasion and fastened the dooi
aftei her soon a sound was heard s  of a
liquid falling upon the floor in a moderate
stream then the falling of a person upon the
floor succeeded by groans and kicking at
first violent but gradually subsiding till all
was still the husband thee called wldcci
son john and seat him to inform the neigh
boring women of what had happened and tc
aak their assistance on the melancholy occa
sion and also to call on the nndertaker and
bespeak a coffin for his mother
at this juncture just at john was aboui
starting the door flew open and madam
came forth in a towering passion she de
nounced her husband and the whole family
as unfeeling brutes who would stand by and
could see a fellowbeing shuffle off this morta
soil without lifting a finger to prevent it
she gave full vent to her rage till it exhaust
ed itself and she became calm her bus
band then gave her some salutary advice
appropriate to the occasion and the result
was a perfect cure the threat was nevei
afterwards repeated and eace and harmonj
were restored to the family
when our politicians instead of spending
their breath in needless eulogies on the bene
fits of the union and thus inviting thesi
threats from the south shall content them
selves with simply doing light dispensing
justice with an equal hand to both north anc
south and leaving each to its own course
to disunion if they choose it will soon bring
things to a crisis it will then prove tha
those who enjoy the chief benefits of thi
union those to whom it is a matter of almos
life and death will come to see it in its propel
light and will never commit the suicidal act
which for effect they have so otten threat

john greenleaf whitier
there said our driver is the
birthplace of john g whittier
whilst he pointed to a plain farmhouse
on the edge of the town of haverhill
situated a short walk from the roadside
or as the poet himself describes the
old homestead our farm house was
situated in a lonely valley half sur
rounded with woods with no neighbors
in sight
soon after my arrival at the busy and
beautiful village of amerbury where
the great poet of humanity now lives
 ascertained his whereabouts and
gave him a letter of introduction writ
ten by our mutual friend w a w
an untiring colaborer in the
workfield of reform i found him at
home in his modest little quaker cot
tage where his friends and visitors are
sure to meet with a kind reception on
the adjoining lot is another nest in the
bushes where a family of singers give
vocal utterance to the melody whittier
writes mr w responded to the rap
at the door and invited me to take a
chair in a plain neat room which com
mands a view of a large and beautiful
garden where he spends a share of
his leisure time when his health will
hermit him to work there he gave
me an introduction to his excellent
mother and after a little chat on the
common topics of conversation politely
invited me to remain and take tea with
him
i knew quite well that i was in the
presence of one of the purestminded
and most gifted men in america a
man whose name and fame are world
wide and as familiar as household
words a man whose mighty thoughts
are winged with words of fire but
he was so unassuming so accessible so
frank and so well posted up on all
natters of news thatvhatever subject
is broached one feels at home in the
presence of a friend whilst conversing
with him this eminent poet of the
slave is about forty years of age hie
temperament is nervousbillious he
is tall slender and straight as an in
dian he has a superb head his brow
looks like a white cloud under hie
raven hair his eyes are large and
black as sloes and glowing with ex
pression he belongs to the society
of friends and in matters of dress
and address he is a quaker of the
strictest sort should a stranger meet
him in the street with his collariesi
coat and broadbrimmed hat he would
not discover anything remarkable in
his appearance he certainly would
not dream that he had seen the ellioti
of america but uncover his head
and see those starlike eyes flashing
under his magnificent forehead and he
would see at a glance that a greal
heart a great soul and a great intel
lect must light up such a radiant fron
tispiece his fellow townsmen art
proud of his fame and well they mu
be for amesbury will be known al
over the world to the end of time a t
the residence of john g whittier
the poet of the poor
mr whittier is a philanthropist
he saw poor downtrodden heart
broken humanity with its aching head
pillowed on the snowcovered moun
tains of the north its blistered feel
clanking chains in the rice and sugar
fields of the south its outspread hands
and bleeding arms reaching from the
rising to the setting sun he saw it
loaded with fetters trampled in the
dust robbed beaten and left for
dead and whilst its blood cried to
heaven for vengeance men with
crowns mitres crucifixes and censers
passed by on the other side and the
bashful country boy rebuked kings
dukes presidents priests levites
bigots zealots and politicians because
they heaped qp the burden and rive
ted the gyves and swung th gory
lash whilst he cheered the good sama
ritans who with their tears washed
away the crusted blood from the
wounds healed the crushed heart and
made it leap for joy whilse they ele
vated humanity so that it stood with
the angels his sou burns with fiery
indignation against oppression and all
acts of inhumanity
wherever he discovers the talisman
of intellect he recognizes a brother
though his skin and bones were of
the color of night they are trans
parent and the everlasting stars shine
through them with attractive beams
he knows that complexion is not a
crime crisped hair is not a sin thick
lips are not a transgression and he has
bared his arms to avert the blow that
would plough the quivering flesh of the
toilworn slave he has heard the
wail of the distracted mother who
like rachel refuses to be comforted
because her child has been torn from
her bosom and sold into hopeless servi
tude where her eye cannot pity his
sorrows where her hand cannot alle
viate its distress and he has denounced
such fiendish cruelty with an eloquence
and pathos approximating to inspira
tion he has seen hollowhearted
statesmen tear the stripes from our flag
and put them on the backs of our
countrymen and he has spiced sheets
that will preserve such mummies in the
amber and pitch of infamy forever
he has seen the fugitive flying from
the house of bondage with hunters
and bloodhounds on his track in hot
pursuit and he has shouted god
speed the slave until lungless echo
has repeated the cry on every hilltop
of the free north he has seen where
the redhot brandingiron has been
pressed on the shrinking flesh of a
freemans hand until the sizzling blood
spouted from the wound and the an
gel of his muse touched his lips with
a burning coal from the altar of god
whilst he immortalized the patient hero
and annihilated everything but the
damnable infamy of the heartless
soulless persecutors
mr whittier is a sincere lover of
truth and right and his language is
in vain and long enduring wrong
the weak may strive against the strong
but the day shall yet appear when the
might with the right and truth shall
be and come what there may to stand
in the way that day the world shall
see pardon my drawing the lines
into prose shape i quote from memo
ry and fear i might do still greater
injustice to the author by measuring
the sentiment off into verse such
men as he are excluded from the south
but slaveholders can no more keep out
his sentiments thun the fool could keep
the wind out of the barnyard by clos
ing the gate judging by the emotions
excited by his writting we are led to
the conclusion that he usually writes
with tears in his eyes but a certain
magazine publisher whose likeness
accompanied one of the numbers of
his magazine can testify that his satire
punishes like the sting of a scorpion
head the following lines
a moony breadth of virgin face
by thought unviokited
a patient mouth to take from acorn
the hook with banknotes butted
its selfcomplacent sleekness shows
how thrift goes with the fawne
an unctuous unconcern for all
which nice folks call disho nor
whittiers poetry is eloquence mea
sured with a golden reed logic on
fire pathos crying in the notes of the
nightingale philosophy playing on the
harp humor laughing in numbers wit
rained down from heaven in a shower
of stars his writings are not free
from imperfections of style and senti
ment but men seldom notice pebbles
while they joo at the lights in the
cerulean arch above he is the au
thor of several volumes of prose which
are widely circulated he is a man
of great versatility of talent his
verses are full of philosophy beauty
and sublimity he sympathizes with
the unfortunate and chastises the op
pressor with a whip of adders in some
of his patriotic appeals he reminds us
of the old prpphets had isaiah lived
in he might have written
the following lines without impairing ilia
reputation
now by our filbert ashes wheret the spirit
of the trueliearted and the unshackled gone
sous of the old freginen do we but inherit
their names alone
is the old pilgrim spirit quenched within us
stoops the proud manhood of onr tout so low
that mammons lures or party wile can win us
to silence now
no when our land to mins brink is verging
in gods name let us speak while there is time
now when the padlocks for our lits are forging
silencf for crime
some ot his best have been
published in beautiful style in boston
lataly but the work is so expensive the
masses are not able to buy it his
writings do not need such costly em
bellishments to be appreciated any
more than the sun needs a stained win
dow through which to shine the lark
and the nightingale need not the cos
tume of the peacock to ensure admira

a puzzle for philemon
rev dr eli noyes the distinguish
ed hebrew scholar of the freewill
baptists and now pastor of the roger
williams church of providence writes
to the morning star an interesting ac
count of a modern onesimus whom he
had begotten not in his bonds but
amid the joyful feelings of one who has
escaped from a bondage worse than
death perhaps some of the signers
ofthe letters to mr webster have been
so long strangers to the feeling of
spiritual parentage that it would be
idle to appeal to such sensibilities as
paul expressed to philemon but
there are thousands of christian pastors
to whom no casuistry could confute
the candid conclusion of mr noyes
a fugitive from slavery
yesterday we baptized in the roger
williams church a man who recent
ly escaped from one of our states
where he was held in slavery now
we suppose it was right enough for the
church to receive him to fellowship
upon a profession of his faith and for
us to baptize him even slaveholders
understand do the same but what are
we todo with him now some of our
great men statesmen divines c
have been calling us back to our con
stitutional duties which they sat re
quire us to send the fugitive back to
his master now we wish to be good
peaceable and obedient citizens we
by no means wish to favor any fanatic
ism that would destroy our glorious
union we wish to act deliberately
rationally and charitably in this affair
and yet we do not see how we can send
our brother back into slavery for to
tell the plain truth he wont go and
should we advise him to do soand send
a letter by him as paul did by his con
vertonesimus he would only doubt
our friendship and we are confident
no modern philemon of the south would
receive our epistle from his hand
well considering that the man has
been sold four times and has had a
pretty decent quantum of flogging we
cannot blame him he does not be
lieve that even his profession of chris
tianity would shield him from the awful
lash for philemou of late has become
fearfully impartial towards all run
aways saint and sinnerbrother ac
cording to th flesh and brethren
according to the spirit must share the
same fate from his implacable hand
upon the wholewe conclude that we
shall not send our brother back into
slavery till god gives us another bible
from which we do not read thou shall
not deliver unto his master the servant
which is escaped from his master unto
thee he shall dwell with thee even
among you in that place which he
shall choose in one of thy gates where
it liketh him best thou shalt not op
press him deut    no
we shall not send him back till god
effaces the last sentiment of humanity
which he has written with his own
finger upon our hearts neither shall
we let any one take him away we
believe our brother is about as safe
among us as he would be in canada
though many of us are great peace
men yet we think it would be a very
difficult affair indeed for any gang of
manstealers to kidnap and carry off
our friend x n
how a man foretells the time
or his death i know not whether 
sent you some curious facts respecting
vivaciousness but i have met with
enough to lead to important physiolo
gical conclusions and in particular to
explain the sufficiently common fact
of six persons fixing the hour of their
death and living exactly to that time
the simple solution is that they would
else have died tooner southey to col
eridge r
the gipsies of hungary
the food of the hungarian gipsies
is commonly the flesh of animals which
have died which they consider very
dainty and prefer to that which is
killed they make no difference of
kind swine lambs calves game and
beasts or birds of pray are all alike
acceptable the only kind of work
they generally do is in iron and wood
for kitchen utensils they ptetend
besides to cure sick cattle but their
main resources are begging and steal
ing in which they show their highest
and indeed most astonishing talents
we have often observed this personal
ly they can exercise the most re
markable power over dogs
in hungary every house has one
or more of those animals of the largest
and most savage kind it is extremely
dangerous for a stranger to enter an
unknown court yard where one of
them isloose but you may have the
most savage dog possible and as soon
as a gipsy enters the yard he appar
ently does not see him but licks his
paw or sleeps and immediately the
fellow stands in your kitchen or saloon
and begs his begging flows most
fluently from his lips and the more
you give him the more fluently he
begs afresh but the thankfulness of
the gipsies is as grateful as their beg
ging is doggish and intolerable at
houses where they receive regularly
something however little they fre
quently sleep before the threshold for
its security for as the different bands
correspond with each other they carry
out in unsion their gratitude or ven
geance if you have once done a
gipsy a good turn you will never atter
be either robbed or betrayed by one
of his people on the contrary if you
remove afterwards to the most distant
part of the country and a snare be set
for you either by thieves robbers or
political opponents or even it anything
be undertaken against you by the
courts of government you may be sure
some gipsy will stand suddenly before
you in the dusk of evening and warn
you of what is coming but it you un
justly treatd a gipsy your family and
properly will be as if outlawed the ob
ject of vengeance to every gipsy band
the huts of the domiciled gipsies are
commonly built of clay covered with
straw or reeds with narrow oriental
windows and door unfastened irreg
ular marrage dirt laziness and a con
tinual noise and strife reside within
them the women practice chiroman
cy or live from prostitution
before we speak of the higher class
or aristocracy of the gipsies we must
say something of their music who
ever has not heard the music ot the
gipsies cannot conceive it meiss
ner says it is as if curiously crowned
serpents were playing in an enchanted
forest in the clear sunshine
that the violin can rave and weep
one cannot conceive in its full meas
ure by hearing paganini old bull
sivori ernest molique or ghys for
it is only the violin of the gipsy that
can rave and weep i have often seen
rigid or languid englishmen and phil
osophic germans when m hungary
introduced into a chorda common inn
upon a lonely ptusta plain and over
fiery wine hearing the melodies of the
gipsies suddenly spring up and dance
as the tarantula had seized them till
the swarthy inuscians had ceased to
play when they would sink down ex
hausted such an effect however can
the violin only produce on a wild lone
ly pussta in the midst ot natures
grandeur and coldness and when the
listeners are under the inspiration of
wine
the musical talent of the gipsies
reaches its highest grade only in the
class we have styled the aristocracy in
this class the change of their manners
in assuming the refinements of civili
zation is so rapid and perfect that
one cannot see the metamorphosis
without astonishment a fellow that
but a few months ago was brought
from among his wild companions in the
forest unwashed never in his life
combed accustomed to live on dead
animals becomes after so short a time
with one of these bands more elegant
than a count more difficult to please
in his appetite than the greatest ex
quisite and inquiring more attention at
a hotel than a cabinet minister thus
uncommonly quick do they put on all
the forms and manners of the elegent
world moving with al the ease and
assurance of born aristocrats
but yet there is always something to
betray the gipsv nature first there
is the copper color of their countenance
which the greatest care at the toilette
cannot remove and then if you enter
his dwelling you soon see further evi
dence of his origin he sits himself
most likely with bis feet stuck under
the window fiddling his finest clothes
are thrown into a heap with his old
ones all lying together perhaps on
the floor pr on the bed covered with
feathers the candle is stuck in a
champaigne bottle his pocketbook
with cigars is lying in the spit box
and in every thing within there are
marks of the same russioelegant in
dolence which the gipsy never throws
off
