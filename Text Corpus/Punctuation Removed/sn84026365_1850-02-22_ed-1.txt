argument
of charles sumner esq against the con
stitutionality of separate colored schools
tn the case of sarah c roberts vs the
city of boston before the supreme court
of mass dec  
continued
still further and here i approach a
more technical view of the subject
it is an admitted principle that the re
gulations and byelaws of municipal
corporations must be reasonable or
they are inoperative and void this
has been recognized by this court in
commonwealth vs worcester  pick
r  and in vardines case j
pick  and in the city of boston
vs jesse shaw  met  it was
decided that a byelaw of the city ol
boston prescribing a particular form
of contribution towards the expenses of
making the common sewers was void
for inequality and unreasonableness
assuming that this principle is appli
cable to the school committee their
regulations and bylaws must be rea
sonable their discretion must be ex
ercised in a reasonable manner and
this is not what the committee or any
other body of men may think reason
able but what shall be reasonable in
the eye of the law it must be legally
reasonable it must be approved by
the reason of the law
and here we are brought once more
in another form to the question of the
validity of the discrimination on ac
count of color by the school commit
tee of boston is this legally reason
able is it reasonable in the exercise
of their discreion to separate the des
cendants of tha african race from the
white children in consequence of their
descent merely passing over now
those principles of the constitution
and those provisions of the law which
of themselves would decide the ques
tion constituting as they do the highest
reason but which have been already
amply considered look for a moment
at the educational system of massa
chusetts and it will be seen that prac
tically no discrimination of color is
made by law in any part of it a des
cendant of the african race may be
governor of the commonwealth and
as such with the advice and consent of
the council may select the board of
education aa lieutenant governor
he may be tx officio a member of the
board he may be the secretary of
the board with the duty imposed on
him by law of seeing that ull children
in this commonwealth who depend up
on common schools for instruction may
have the best education which those
schools can be made to impart he
may be a member of any school cdm
inittee or it teacher in any public
school of the state as a legal voter
he can vote in the selection of any
school committee
thus in every department connect
ed with our public schools throughout
the whole hierarchy of their govern
ment from the very head of the sys
tem down to the humblest usher in the
humblest primary school and to the
humblest voter there is no distinction
of color known to che law it is when
we reach the last stage of all the
children themselves that the beautiful
character of the system is changed to
the deformity of caete as in the pic
ture of the ancient poet what was a
lovely woman above terminated in a
vile unsightly lish below and all
this is done by the committee with
more than necromantic power in the
exercise of their mere discretion
it is dear that the committee may
classify scholars according to their
age and tel for the obvious reasons
that these distinctions are inoffensive
pod especially recognised as legal in
right is of no sextruth is of no color
the law relating to schools revised
statutes c   they may alsc
classify scholars according to theii
moral and intellectual qualifications
because such a power is necessary tc
the government of schools but the
committee cannot assume a priori
and without individual examination
that an entire race possess certain
moral or intellectual qualities which
shall reader it proper to place them all
in a class by themselves such an ex
ercise pf the discretion with which the
commijmn are intrusted must be un
reasonable and therefore illegal
but it is said thatjtha committee in
thus classifying the children have not
violated any principle of equality in
asmuch as they have provided a school
with competent instructors for the col
ored children where they have equal
advantages of instruction with those
enjoyed by the white children it is
said that in excluding the colored chil
dren from the public schools open to
white children they furnish them an
equivalent to this there are several
answers shall touch upon them only
briefly as the discussion through
which we have now travelled substan
tially covers the whole ground
ist the separate school for colored
children is not one of the schools esta
blished by the law relating to public
schools revised statutes chap 
it is not a public school as such it
has no legal existence find therefore
cannot be a legal equivalent in addi
tion to what has already been said
bearing on this head i will call the at
tention to one other aspect of it we
have already seen that it has been de
cided that a town can execute its
power to form a school district onlv
by a geographical division of its terri
torythat there cannot be what the
court have called a personal limitation
of the district and that certain indivi
duals cannot be selected and set off by
themselves into a district perry vs
dover  pick  the admitted
effect of these decisions is to render a
separate school for colored children
illegal and impossible in towns that
have been divided into districts they
are so regarded in salem nantucket
new bedford and in other towns of
this commonwealth the careful opin
ion of a member of this court who is
not sitting iu this case given while at
the bar hon richard fletcher and
extensively published has been consi
dered as practically settling this point
but there cannot be one law for the
country and one for boston it is true
that boston is not divided strictly into
geographical districts in this respect
its position is anomalous but if se
parate colored schools are illegal and
impossible in the country they must be
illegal and impossible in boston it is
absurd to suppose that this city by
failing to establish school districts and
by regarding all its territory as a single
district should be able legally to esta
blish a caule school which it otherwise
could not do boston cannot do indi
rectly what the other towns cannot do
directly
this is the first answer to the sug
gestion of equivalents
d the second is that in point of
fact it is not an equivalent we have
already seen that it is the occasion of
inconveniences to the colored children
and their parents to which they would
not be exposedif they bad access to the
nearest public schools besides indict
ing upon them the stigma of caste
stilt further and this consideration
cannot be neglected the matters taught
in the two schools may be precisely
the same hut a school exclusively
devoted to one class must differ essen
tially in its spirit and character from
that public school known to the law
where all classes meet together in
equality it is a mockery to call it an
equivalent
d but there is yet another answer
admitting that it is an equivalent still
the colored children cannot be com
pelled to take it their rights are
equality before the law nor can they
be called upon to renounce one jot of
this they have an equal right with
white children to the general public
schools a separate school though
well endowed would not secure to
them that precise equality which they
would enjoy in the general public
the jews in rome ate asnfined to a
particular district called the ghetto
in frankfort they are condemned to a
separate quarter known as the jewish
quarter it is possible that tha accom
modations allotted to them are as good
as they would be able to occupy if left
free to choose throughout rome and
frankfort but this compulsory segre
gation from the mass of citizens is of
itself an inequality which we condemn
with eur whole souls it is a vestige
of ancient intolerance directed against
a despised people it is of the same
character with the separate schools in
boston
thus much for the doctrine of equi
valents as a substitute for equality
in determining that the committee
have no power to make a discrimina
tion of color or race we are strength
ened by yet another consideration i
the power exists in any caso it mitaf
exist in many others it cannot be res
trained to this alone the committee
may distribute all the children into
classesmerely according to their dis
cretion they may establish a separ
ate aahool for the irish er germans
where each may nurse an exclusive
spirit of nationality alien to ear institu
tions they may separate catholic
from protestants or pursuing their
discretion atill further thev may separ
ate the different sects of proteatants
rochester n y friday february  
and establish one school for unitarians
another for presbyterians another foi
baptists and another for methodists
they may establish a separate ecboo
for the rich that the delicate taste o
this favored class may not be offends
by the humble garments of the poor
they may exclude the children of me
chanics from the public schools anc
send them to separate schools by them
selves all this and much more car
be done by the exercise of the high
handed power which can make a dis
crimination on account of color or
race the grand fabric of our public
schools the pride of maachusetts
where at the feet of the teacher inno
cent childhood should meet unconsci
ous of all distinctions of birthwhere
the equality of the constitution and of
christianity should be inculcated by
constant precept and examplemay be
converted into a heathen system ol
proscription and caste we may then
have many different schools the repre
sentatives of as many different classes
opinions and prejudices but we shall
look in vain for the true public school
of massachusetts let it not be said
that there is little danger that any com
mittee will exercise their discretion to
this extent they must not be entrust
ed with the power in this is the only
safety worthy of a free people

from the eighteenth annual report of the ma
achuietla antislavery society
our aim
the lapse of time and the progress
of events havebut served to confirm
or deliberate andotten recorded opin
ion that the only exodus for the slave
from his bondage the only redemption
of ourselves from our guilty participa
tion in it lies over the ruins of the
american state and the american
church both the one and ihe other
as this report however imperfectly
and feebly has abundantly proved
are in league with the oppressor and
batten on the crushed bodies and man
gled souls of the oppressed the
cornerstone of the american church
as well as of the american state is the
slavery of the african race we pro
test against both we call upon all
men who love god and regard man to
come out of both and tq unite in build
ing a holier temple for the worship ol
the true god a more sacred capitol
for the service of a better common
weal than those structures which rest
on the hearts and are cemented with
the blood of threemillion slaves we
are convinced more and more by the
experience of every day that this
course is not only the absolute right
but that it is the highest expediency
we know that we have never so shak
 en the church we have never extorted
from her so large a share of the decent
homage of hypocrisy or compelled her
to assume the mask of antislavery so
eagerly as since we have shaken off
the dust of our feet as a testimony
against her and left her to be joined to
her idols we know that we have
never made our voice reach to the ut
termost part of the union so clearly
our opinions and practices have never
been so distinctly repeated and pro
claimed by the universal press by the
legislatures and by the congress ol
the united states or our philosophy
and method been so well understood by
the general mind of the country as
since we have adopted the principle ol
no union with slavehold
ers
the work which the american abo
litionists have undertaken is no light
one they aim at nothing less than a
reformation of the religion and a
revolution in the government of the
country tiiey seek to rescue chris
tianity from the shame and republi
canism from the infamy which slave
ry has justly brought upon themboth
they aspire to assist in the building up
of a church and of a state such as the
martyrs of religion and freedom in
all past time foresaw when they joy
fully yielded themselved to the stake
or to the block these hopes of the
yearning ages have been hitherto
mournfully defeated the experiment
of a great nation with popular institu
tions on these western shores has
signally failed we are not the model
but the warning of the nations and
this owing to the disturbing element of
slavery which our fathers introduced
and we suffer to exist in our national
economy we see plainly that the
elimination of this abhorred ingredient
must precede any successful attempt
to erect a true republic enduring and
flourishing under the auspices of a
pure religion to do this is the ap
pointed and the chosen work of the
abolitionists in the of such
a puupose the sectarian strifes the
partizan struggles the social compe
titions of the hour dwindle and disap
pear oarsis the only movement of
this age and country that will impress
itself indelibly on the destines of all
coming time while the ephemeral
objects which agitate the contempora
ry mind must soon pass away and be
forgotten the change which we eeek
to achieve will influence the condition
of mititons as long as the earth sheh
endure for such an end we may ell
forego the temptations of a vulgar am
bition and cheerfully dedicate to its
accomplishment the best powers of our
miuds and the beet years of our lives

it has been decided in new orleans

thirtyfirst ogress
washihgtoo feb 
senatethe vice president tate
the business before the senate to be
the motion to receive a petition of citi
zens of delaware and maryland ask
ing a peaceable dissolution of the uni
on mr chase having the floor ad
dressed the senate in support of the
petition he cited a case wherein a
similisr petition had been frequently
quoted in discussion kfcfeelievedthal
the senate wpre boundkio receive every
petition no matter character
and if it exhibited a mhrtnkcn view ol
the powers of congress or the expe
diency of the measure prayed for con
gress should express its disapprobation
by subsequent action the right ol
petition was a great and sacred one to
be demanded and not a poor one to
be begged forhe had no objection
to whatever action the senate might
deem proper to give to this and similiar
petitions he only asked that all he
received and treated alike
mr dayton said that the right of pe
tition was well settled it was the rem
edy which a citizen or subject had to
ward the sovereign and he had yet
to learn that it extended to the destruc
tion of the sovereign it was limited
always to the redress of grievances
he wns opposed to the reception oi
this petition and would vote against it
because it asked the destruction of the
sovereignthe dissolution of the uni
onthe violation of the constitution
by those who had sworn to support it
it asked what the senate had neither
the right nor the power to do and was
not respectful to the body to whom it
was addressed
he agreed with all that mr hale
had said the other day relative to the
petition from north carolina presented
by mr mangum there were wrongs
as have been said on both sides and
he was prepared and her after always
should vote against rccei ing these ag
itating petitions no matter where they
come from
mr cass honored the right of petit
ion as much as any man but he did
not reckon it so high as the seimtor
from ohio the people thank god
had a much more effectual remedy in
their hands than the right of petition
they had the right o action the bal
lot box was worth a thousand rights of
petition and could be exercised by all
the people was it to be contended
that congress had no discretion as to
the reception of petitions would they
consider themselves bound to receive a
petition asking congress to pass an act
declaring that there was no god
surely not the constitution secured
the right to the people of petitioning
for the redress of grievanceswould
any man contend this was such a pe
tition there was no comparison be
tween this petition and that presented
by mr mangum
he alluded to the blessings with
which a kind providence had crowned
our country and said that the root of
all our evil was to be found in our fail
ure to appreciate and render to the
creator the meed of gratitude for all
that we have received dissolution
was but another name lor warand
yet here were the descendents of penn
asking that it be granted if the petition
was to be granted our borders where
ever they inay be would be the scene
of one of the bloodiest wars the world
ever sawand for what what was
to be gained by it who were to reap
anything but the bitterest fruits
mr webster regretted that this pe
tition had been presented and he would
be surprized if it received any votes in
the senate lest any one shonld by
his vote imply that congress had any
power over the subject he thought that
the petition to be consistent with itself
ought to have been preceded by a pre
amble somewhat as follows
gentlemen members of cougress
whereas at the commencement of the
present session you and each of you
took a solemn oath upon the holy e
vangelists of almighty god that you
would support the constitution and the
government now therefore we ask
you to take immediate steps to break
up the union and destroy the consti
tution as soon as you can
mr hale was glad that mr cass
had obtained new light since he voted
the other day against receiving a peti
tion from pensylvaniaasking no action
by congress but simply requesting
congress in view of contemplated ac
tion upon the subject of slavery on the
admission of new states not to admit
such states into the union the sen
ator had declared that north carolina
was right in remonstrating against the
contemplated action by congress that
was all the petition which mr cass
had voted against
mr cass replied that the petition in
question contemplated adverse action
by congress in case ot the application
by a new state for admission without a
restriction upon thequestion of slavery
mr hale said the petition intimated
no such septiments
mr wale stated that he had exam
ined the petition and recognized the
name of no one of its  signer as a citi
zen of delaware
mr cooper eloquently addressed the
senate adverse to the petition and
hi support of the union alluding to the
evils which must follow its dissolution
and declaring that he would vote against
all petitions from either north or south
looking in the remotest degree to so
disastrous an event
mr clemens declared that the south
had never been guilty of aggressing
the north alone was responsible for the
got is the father of us all and all men are brethren
danger which menaced the union
there are no dissolutionists in the soutl
i not a man who would dare rise ant
 avow the treasonable sentiment
i mr chase said the question of re
ception had uot been met mr cast
and others had passed over the res
question and stated the reasons fbi
which they would not grant the pray
er of the petitionthey mistook theii
own position he contended thatthe
reception of the petition was no jest a
to the principle involved in the petitiou
mr seward wished the senate and
the country distinctly to understand
that the question was not upon the
propriety of dissolving the union or
the power of congress to dissolve it
but simply whether the petition should
be received and referred to a commit
tee with instructions to report that the
senate had neither the power nor the
disposition to entertain the question
with this view he would vote to re
ceive the petition which he had de
nounced as emanating front madmen
that he had never seen and never ex
pected to see the petition which he
would not recieve it was no apology
with him for refusing to receive the
prayer of his fellowbeing that he had
no power to grant it
petitions from madmen were at least
harmless and the easiest way to get
rid of them was to recieve them and
dispose of them ns they deserved no
other petitions tor a dissolution of the
union would ever be sent here if the
present one should be received and the
rebuke administered to it which was in
the heart and mouth of every man in
the chamber the senate were not
above giving reasons even against a
dissolution of the union george
washington had not been above it
and why should the senate

tion to receive the petition was nega

the senate proceeded to the con
sideration of the order of the day
mr berrien arose and addressed the
senate on the subject of slavery ex
pressed his views of the magnitude and
difficulties of the subject and conse
quent conviction of the crisis which
now exists in the affairs of the country
the people of the south had at last
been awakened to a sense of their dan
ger and a feeling has been awakened
which could no longer be trifled with
he uttered no menaces and trusted
the north would heed the voice of
calm dispassionate warning which he
bw raised the oounlry had passed
through many crises but none so
fraught with danger as the present
and unless better counsels prevail than
hitherto the direct consequences will
ensue
he trusted that a better feeling would
prevail this hope amounted almost
to conviction that the storm would lull
and peace and happiness would again
be diffused throughout ail our borders
after paying a most beautiful tribute to
mr clay wishing that he might long
live to participate in the blessing ot uni
ty and peace and that when he should
be called to leave off the frail gar
ment which he has so gracefully worn
his closing eyes might rest on a free
united and happy republic
mr berrien proceeded with an ar
gument upon the immediate question of
legislation for the territories and
against the establishment of a princi
ple which should forbid in all future
time the flag of the uuion to float over
any state or territory where slavery
may exist except in those states where
that institution now exists the south
called upon congress not to legislate
upon the question of slavery they
had not asked legislative aid it was
legislative interference which they de
precated they called upon congress
to exercise whatever power it had to
organize governments for the territo
ries and abstain from any aefion upou
the domestic institution of slavery
they called upon congress to leave
the slavery question to the great con
stitutional arbiter between the two sec
tions that was all tbe south asked
what then he would appeal to the
senator from kentucky mr clay
what had the south to yield what
was it that they had to yield was it
their constitutional right to invoke the
decision of the highest tribunal in the
union that they were called upon  to
give up surely such a demand could
never be entertained he then pro
ceeded to examine more specifically
the question of the power of congress
to take any action upon the question
of slavery in the new territories argu
ing against the existence of any such
power
at three oclock mr berrien gave
way to a motion that the further con
sideration of the subject be postponed
until tomorrow which was agreed to
mr king submitted a resolution call
ing upon the secetary of state for any
papers in his department relative to
the conduct of captain david cook

a motion was j pending from last

sented by mr cromrml from citizens

measures for the settlement of interna
tional difficulties by arbitration and a
congress of nations

in the negative yeas  nap 
mr thompson of miss desiring to

the house then went into committee
of the whole on the state ofthe union
on resolution relative to collection ol
customs
the amendments were considered
mr winthrop of mass took occa
sion to present a memorial from 
importing merchants of boston without
distinction of party remonstrating
against the treasury circular and
requesting that the expenses of weigh
ing gu aging and measuring be paid by
that class and expressing regret that
the revenue cutters have been called
out of service he believed that not
less than twenty millions of imports
were received at boston on which a
duty of  was paidthe
secretary issued the circular only on
compulsion and would relieve the
merchants whenever he bad an oppor
tunity
mr vinton of ohio offered an
amendment to the resolution of the
senate the same as that offered and
adopted as a substitute by the com
mittee of ways and means on friday
excluding the expenses of collecting
revenue in california and oregon from
the appropriation proposed suspending
laws limiting compensation to officers
and expenses there until further action
of copgress
after five minutes remarks made in
explanation on one side contending
that appropriations for california and
oregon should be specific and that the
amendment did not allow one cent
more than was asked by the secretary
of the treasury mr vintons amend
ment was lost by a tie vote
various amendments were offered
and remarks predicated on them
mr thurston had conversed with
the representatives from california
and they took the broadest ground
against giving the least discretion to
the secretary on that section he was
told that the collector at san francis
co was giving four dollars a day more
to assistance than was allowed at the
north and that congress will be called
upon to make appropriation for special
services it is a fact that the expense
of living in san francisco was lo a
day and unless congress make ade
quate provision how can it be expected
that the necessary officers can be em
ployed the port of asteria has long
been without a collector and the gov
ernment was in consequence cheated
out of hundreds and thousands by the
hudson bay company bringing in tfieir
cattle and goods without paying duties
whatever course the committee may
adopt let them not include any portion
of the pacific coast he was in favor
of retrenchment but not such as would
cause the government to lose in the
collection of duties
mr green offered a preamble in
the nature of a censure on the secre
tary of the treasury for spending too
much money and accused him of not
carrying out the spirit of the act of
march 
the committee rose and reported the
following as agreed to in lieu of the
senates resolution that instead of
the sum appropriated for expenses for
collecting the revenue in act d
march  a sum equal to onehalf
of that expended in collecting revenue
for the fiscal year ending june 
 exclusive of expenses for storage
cartage drayage and labor in that
year be appropriated for the remain
ing halt of the year ending june
 together with such sums in ad
dition as may be received for cartage
drayage labor and storage exclusive
of expenses incurred in california and
oregon and provided that ail laws
limiting the compensation of officers
and other expenses shall be suspended
in califoania and oregon until further
action of congress
mr bayly moved to strike out the
exclusion of california and oregon
motion disagreed by one majority
the question was taken on agreeing
to amendment in committee of the

the queston was now taken on

with the country on the great question
of free territory
affrican colonization there are
two aspects under which the colonisa
tion cause may be regardedfirst as
an opiate for slaveholders consciences
by confirming the prejudice that blsck
and white men cannot live under the
same government in a state of legal
equalitythat general enrancipation
can only be safely attempted on condi
tion of the total expatriation of the
black race from this country hat
sort or phase of colonization wo de
cidedly object to but the coloniza
tion from choice of a great number of
our emancipated blacks on the soil
from which their forefathers were tom
by the manstealer with a view to the
introduction of christianity and the
useful arts there and the closing of
the entire eoet f africa against the
ravages of the slavetrade that aspect
of colonization we heartily concur and
delight in the following resolutions
just adopted by the legislature of indi
ana savor of the right spirit
ji joint resolution in relation to the
slave trade
whereas the policy of suppressing
the african slave trade by au
armed blockade has upon the whole
praved an entire failure said trade be
ing as vigorous now as it was before the
blockade was attempted and where
as it is likely that england will soon
make overtures to our general gov
ernment demanding a release from all
treaty stipulation whereby she is ob
liged to keep her expensive fleet on
the african coast tor the suppression
of the slave trade and whereas both
the government of the united states
and england are convinced that some
other plan must he adopted to check
that traffic and whereas the settle
ment of the african coast with colonies
of civilized colored men is the cheapest
and best plan of suppressing said
traffic being likewise calculated to
further the work of colonizing oar
people of color which plan of suppres
sing the tade is true american policy
therefore
be it resolved by the general as
sembly of the state of indiana that our
senator and representatives in con
gress be and they are hereby request
ed in the name of the state of indiana
to call for a change of national policy
on the subject of the african slave

slavery in america
a public meeting was held in the stock
exchange hall albion street leeda eng
land on tuesday evening january th for
the purpose of hearing an address on the
subject of american slavery by william w
brown a man of color and a fugitive from
slavery the attendance was good and but
for the inclemency of the evening there is
no doubt the hall would have been crowded
amongst the gentlemen present on the
occasion were noticed on the platform al
derman john wilson rev thomas scales
rev c wicksteed rev a m stalker
rev r brewer mr councillor town ed
win baines esq thoe hovey esq jas
kitson esq ac iic
tbe rev c wicksteed expressed his re
gret that robert jowiti esq who was to
have taken the chair could not attend a cir
cumstance that mr jowiti regretted as much
as the meeting would in his absence al
derman j wilson a friend was called to
tbe chair
the chairman expressed his regret at the
absence or their much esteemed friend and
fellow townsman robert jowilt who was
one of the oldest and most zealous antisla
very advocates in the town hear hear
with the object of the meeting he had entire
sympathy and he did not think that tbe ques
tion of slavery as it existed in america
could be too frequently or too prominently
brought before them and he trusted that the
statements to he made to the meeting that
evening would be such as to induce all pres
ent to promote tbe extinction of such an evil
m a land which prided itself in the profession
of so much liberty and freedom applause
with these observations he would intro
duce to them william wells brown
applause
mr brown who spoke with much effect
and in a style of great perspicuity said the
subject he had come there to lay before them
was one he had no need to say should com
mand itself to the hearts of the english peo
ple as it was one in reference to which they
had shown by their past acts that it not only
commended itself but that they daly appre
ciated it he occupied that evening a
strange position or it might seem so to some
he was there from the united states of ame
rica the country of hfs nativity people
were so accustomed to speak highly of the
institutions under which they had been bred
and reared that it might seem strange that
one from the boasted land of liberty one fiotn
the land of the free and the home of the
brave should arraign tbe government of thal
people before the british public hear
hear he came there not for the purpose
of misrepresenting of praising or of speak
ing against the government of america bui
he came there as the representative of the
three millions of slaves of america and ol
the antislaveiy movement of that country
so much had boen said in favor of america
by americans who had visited this country
that it only seemed proper that some one
should speak in favor of the slave who could
not and who would not put confidence in the
slaveholder or ins apologist who might visil
england he chose rather to send his own
representative one who had himself wore
the chain of slavery he should therefore
speak of slavery as he had seen it and as he
knew it to exist in the alaveholding slates 
america mr brown says the leeds mer
cury concluded a most thrilling and elo
quent address amidst loud and lepeatec
plaudits
edward baines esq rose at the call oi
the chairman to propose a resolution he
said the meeting would be glad of an oppor
tunity not only of expressing their syrnpa
thy with the gentleman who bad addressed
them and who had given them so interesting
and instructive a narrative but also of stating
to the proud slaveholders of america thal
the good man whom they called a chattel
the people of england were not ashamed tc
own as a lellownian as a christian and s
brother hear hear and applause he
alluded to the almost hopeless position of the
antislavery movement in america when bui
si few years ago george thompson esq
tbe now m p for tower hamlets raised his
eloquent voice against it in that country anc
waa obliged to flee for his life observing thal
anch had been the progress of the antislavery
movement since that ume that although peti
tions lor the abolition of slavery were prohi
bited by law from being presented to eiihei
house of parliament now the house ol
congress had fur three weeks been brought
to a dead lock by the evenly balanced slate ol
patties on this very question the plea that
the slaves if liberated might some morning
rise up and cut the throats of their masters
he regarded as utterly without foundation
the masters had the army knowledge edu
cation and everything on their side which
could make a small minority submit to the
rule of a majority the whole number ol
laves did not exceed three millions out of a
population of twenty millions whilst in the
west indies we had only  whites to a
black slave population of  and yei
not a single outrage had been committed when
tbe whole of these slaves were emancipated
hear hear in conclusion he called upon
the meeting to give expression to their opin
ion by passing the lollowing resolution
resolved that this meeting has listened
with deep interest and lively sympathy to the
statements of mr brown which increase
their sense of the dreadful injustice and cru
elty of slavery as it exists in the united
states that the meeting rejoices at the rapid
advance of the antislavery cause in that
country where religion and humanity are
rousing a large part of the enlightened jmipu
lation and of their representatives in con
gress to vindicate the rights of their fellow
men held in bondage and thal it looks for
ward with earnest hope to the period when
the freemen of america shall wipe out the
foul biot on their escutcheon and thus take
the greatest step in the entire suppression ol
slavery through the world
the rev thomas scales very cordially
seconded the resolution observing that his
best energies had been devoted iu this great
and glorious cause they might think they
had done much in emancipating the slaves in
their own colonies but they ought not to re
gard their work as done tiu slavery itself
should cease to exist thioughout the wide
world hear hear he hoped the influ
ence of england would be felt in america
and convince their brethren on the other side
of the atlantic that however much they
might admire ihem in other matters they
could not hut regard them as dishonored and
degraded so long as slavery existed in any
part of the united states applause
the resolution was carried amidst loud
applause
the rev charles wicksteed stated that
this wts not the first time he had met their
friend mr brown for he had met him iw i
very splendid place and excellent society at
the peace congress lately held at paris
where he had seen him shake hands with
distinguished men of every sect and nation
mr brown acknowledged the vote taken
on tbe resolution and after singing two anti
slavery melodies tbs business of the meet
ing wss brought to a close by a vote of thanks
to ths chairman
a scene in the senate
last tuesday in the senate during ibo
morning hour mr hale presented the pe
tition of sevem hundred women of dover
njh protesting against the extension of sla
ve or admission of any more slave states
ths question of reception was raised but
the usual motion lo lay on the table failed
on this motion mr douglas took the ground
that as the senate bad decided to receive
petitioos from the south protesting against
action hs should bow vote to tpceive this po
sition from the north which ahw protested
against action there should be otwxulefor
both sections
mr butler of south carolina tried bishop
at patting down mr hale with what aucceae
the following report will show
mr butter mr preaident i have peti
tion to offer resolutions andfother matters
really requiring immediate action otherwise
there would be no necessity for acting upon
them at all yet sir every morning a gen
tlemen who is in the minority is monopoli
zing the whole time of the senate by peti
tionssuch as this breeding mischief and this
without rebuke and almost with the counte
nance o those who vote for these resolutions
can this be tolerated that the time of this
senate and legislature of the united states
shall be appropriated by mischievous incen
diaries who claim the right to introduce icso
lutionsmemorialsand propositions of this kind
to the senate why sir i have business
now that i think ought to engage the atten
tion of the senate but i cannot bring it be
fore them for every morning that gentlemen
takes up the whole time he has the whole
senate to himself a mere minority comes
here and makes all this mischief and stands
unrebuked so far as i can seeby the senate
i know sir this is a part of his existence
i know that in what i am now saying i am
siving him the food upon which he cui feed
e lives upon mischief it is the very food
that sustains him  know lam not rebuk
ing him sir it is intolerable that a miser
able minority a mischievous incendiary a
madman if you choose to call him so should
come here and interfere with the rights of
other men upon this floor
amidst cries of order order he sat down
inflamed with passion
mr hale i have a word to say sir to the
senator from south carolina mr butler
he says that  live upon mischief and that he
gives me the food i live on if that be the
case he is responsible for it and not myself
but to be more serious he is pleased to de
nounce me as a miserable minority and com
plains of my trespassing upon the privileges
of the senate i leave that questiou to be
decided by tbe community who it is that tres
passes upon the time of the senate sit he
will have to talk longer and denounce more
before he ean convince me that this has been
my prerogative
i have taken up the whole time of the
senate  have  sir for two mornings
and ouly two have i presentedanything of
of this kind since the year  commenced
one of them was the othet day and the other
was this morning so far was i from saying
anything to take up your time that i confined
myself simply to stating what the nature of
the petitions was the talk did not come
from the miserable minority but from a
majority i will not apply any adjective to
them but i have enough at hand that i could
use if i chose the mischief comes from a
majority that seeks to tread down the minor
ity that desires to makethem more miserable
than they really are miserable as we are
i think the senator will find out that our pow
er of speech is not exhausted and while we
may exercise it within the privileges of the
constitution he will find that it will be exer
cised at any and at all hazards
we are not to be frightened ojt of our
rights upon this floor by denunciation or even
by the threat of danger personal to ourselves
small and few as we are we are not misera
ble cowards that can be frightened from the
assertion or the maintenance of our rights
new hampshire blood coursing in new

members wbo are treated like inferiors not

slave states they are received with profound
deferenceand ordered to be printed vermont
presuming as a sister state upon a similar
reception is repelled with words of soorn and
though one month ago her resolutions were
presented to this hour the senate has not
made up its mind whether it will print them
or not and northern senators submit
some people of wilmington north caro
lina get together pass resolutions denouncing
the fanaticism of the north in favoj of slave
ry and threatening the union mr mangum
takes occasion to submit them to the senate
accompanying them with a bitter assault on
the free states and threatening war bloody
war should they persist in their aggressions
the senate overawed graciously receives
the papers treating them with marked respect
but let a northern senator present a petition
against the extension of slavery and thefsen
ate refuses even to entertain the question of
its reception i that body is cowed by the
menaces of the slaveholders
we have but to show our teeth said
mr holmes of the south carolina the other
day and the north is frightened great
was the exultation among southern members
on the sth in the house wheu so many
northern men voted to lay boots resolution
on the table jt was a triumph they had not
anticipated quite so soon not dreaming that
their threats could accomplish so much all at
once
the northern people they presume are
like their representatives they regard them
as shopkeepers tamespirited eaten up with
the love of gain the richmond whig of
virginia commenting upon some belligerent
remarks in the north american of philadel
phia sneers at the graodiloquent talk of its
editors and coolly tells them that they had
better stick to the counter
twice in congress have menaces of bloody
conflict within the capitol been thrown out
by fllaveholding members in the senate
mr davis of mississippi thought the strug
gle if northern men persisted in their ag
gressions should commence here and now
between the representatives of the two sec
tions mr clingman in the house thought
if the worst came to the worst not a quorum
woud be left in the halls of congress to do
business
while these brutal threats are common in
both houses cravenspirited members from
the north are writing home letters calculated
to create a panic among their constituents
mr buchanan a sort of lobby member
never feared before for the union he does
nowmelancholy are bis forebodings gen
eral caaa too is shaken with alarm and
convervng with one of the indiana members
wbo has been taken under the special care of
the south he learns that in the event of a die
solution of the union the state of indites
will go with the south letterwriters do
their share to get up a northern panic end

wiu the people of the free states permit
themselves to be imposed on by this trans

are to be taken in earnestare they prepared
to succumb and excuse their representatives
for abandoning the ordinance of  if

they incapable what exactions will they
not suffer what burdens not bear  there
anything more that slaveholders can ask ex
cept the privilege of setting up slavery with
in the boundaries of re states if prepared
to do and suffer all the slave power demands
we hope they will say so in some authentic
way so as to enable congress to ootne to a
speedy settlement of the controversy let
them meet together is conventions in the
seven states and pass some such resolutions
as the following
that as slaveholders will tolente no
union in which their claims to supreme power
is not acknowledged therefore we cheerfully
assent to this claim now sod forever provid

if this do not suit tehm and if they really
do cherish a purpose to maintain the rights of
the majority to keep free territory free and
secure the ascendsncyof the principle of free

whether they ought not to hold a maas con

present aspect of antislavery affairs
at washington
it is deeply painful and mortifying to ob
servethat the cry ot disunion raised by
the south has already so far accomplished
its purpose as to alarm the members of con
gress into a retrograde movement on the sub
i ject of slavery it strikes us that there is
either a subtle defect in the very organization
of northern men or a marked superiority in
the composition of southern men for in all
controversies between the two the latter
have come off victorious a most humiliat
ing illustration of this has been all along
 presented in the proceedings of the present
congress northern men have shown in
their conduct that they have inherited the
blood without the spirit of their ancestors
r phrenologists would say judging of north
ern paleness induced by southern bluster
that the organs of caution and acquisitive
ness had been cultivated at the expense of the
oigans of firmness and destructiveness the
f poor northern whigs and democrats in
congress have been so completely overawed
by the haughty womandoggers of the south
that they have recently voted twice against
the principle ot the wilmot proviso and in
one case they even voted against the very
words of the declaration of independence
this occurred in the house while in the
senate of the united states a scene has
lately transpired which if possible exceeds
in infamy and disgrace the shocking develop
ments of aposiacy in the house
never has the right of petition been more
ruthlessly assailed nor more wantonly tram
pled on than it was in the senate a few
days since a petition clothed in respectful
language asking for a peaceful dissolution
of the union was virtually spurned from the
chamber by our lordly seoatora and not even
permitted the ordinary privilege of reference
to a committee out of all the libertyloving
hungarianwelcoming and despotdespising
members pf that body only threesew
ard hale and chase were found ready tc
vindicate the sacred right of petitionthe
poor privilege of prayer the american
senate in its action on this question has set
an example of usurpation which deserves the
sternest rebuke the members pf that body
are elected by the people to legislate for the
country and for the performance of this duty
they receive a suitable emolument we pre
sume that it never entered the minds of the
fiaroera pf the constitution that the senate
of the united states should have the ppwpi
of determining for the people for what they
shall or shall not petition the assumption
of this power on the part of the senate ii
an invasion of the rights of the people sc
flagrant and so dangerous that the whole
land should reverberate with indignant pre
tests against it upon the reasoning adopted
by the senate a petition on almost any 
every subject might be rejected withoul
reference or consideration these legislator
should betaught that they are not elected to
tell the people what they want but to give
them what they ask or at least to givt
them reasons for not granting what they ask
rut why should we attempt to define the
rights of the people or the limits ot the
senates power such an effort implies on
our part a belief that the people of this
country entertain an honest lore of liberty
slid a sincere detestation of slavery and that
they only need to have the evil exposed and
the wrong pointed out to adopt spcfi mea
sures as are necessary to remedy the evil
and to redress the wrong it would be the
veriest affectation in us to indicate any such
belief a knowledge of the state of the
public mind and of tbe public conscience
leaves no alternative or conclusion for the
judgment to rest upon but the utter hollow
ness and hypoerisy of the nation in its pro
fessions of attachment to liberty we are
laughed to scorn by our own mocking spirit
when we speak on this subject as though the
people only needed light we opoe cher
ished that amiable delusion it has now
vanished nothing short of the scorpion
lash of mingled soern contempt and ridicule
seems capable of rousing in the masses any
thing like sensibility ot eelfrsepeet
we have been both surprised and shocked
to find to little indignation and asloojshmpot
provoked by tbe insulting and highbanded
violation of the constitution on the part of
the senate in its recent outrage on the right
of petition not have we been leap aston
ished to find so little of honest rebuke admin
istered by the northern press to the miser
able northern apostates who meanly ate
their words tamed their beck upon tbeif
professions hewed their ftilfff knees to the
dark spirit of slavery tnd voted with the
slaveholders of the sooth egsiost the very
principles which they were sent to congress
to protect asd to vindicate vsrfly slavery

in a more logical form than that originally
published in the north star thai measure
which fails to produce a good moral effect fails
morally and ergo is a moral failure r n

the article which refers to the action of
the legislature of indiana on the subject of

the new york tribune it is a great pity
that the tribune should just at this time
feel called upop to favor even in the most
qualified manner the unhallowed scheme of
colonization if any one thing awakens in
our inmost soul a detestation more intense
and bitter than another it is the idea that it
is necessary to remove the colored man from
this land in older to effect his elevation we
regard this proposition emanating from whom
it may as being a most scandalous and im
pudent one that the colored man cannot
prosper here in the land of his birth in a
climate adupled to his health where labor is
abundant and well rewarded where the pre
judice against him is rapidly disappearing

they make what seems to us a great mistake

have original pieces from persons of our own
despised race which would reflect no discre
dit on the fame of some who have won the
high appellation of poet it is indeed a
source of ineffable pleasure to our heart to
be able to stand at this point and to see
rising up all around men of talent and even
of genius who are aspiring to the higher

feh it excessively kind of him to seek us out
doting his short stay and to give us tbii
proof that bis is a heart large enough to re
ceive and shelter every member of the human
family of whatever country clime or color
he may be not a member of our home
circle but who felt the better for his cheering
influence and instructive conversation what
a world should we have were it peopled with
such men as gerrit smith his whole soul
seems to be occupied with thoughts as to how
he may best advance the wellbeing of his

it is highly gratifying to learn that our
new york friends are awakening to the
importance of extending the circulation of

it will be seen by reference to a circular
emanating from the executive committee ol
the american and foreign antislavery so
ciety that an extensive plan of petitioning

connected with the antialavery agitation is
proposed the measure if carried out must
result in good to the cause of the slave in
that it will add to the general agitation

a picture of northern servility to
southern slavery
tbe following is from the independent and
is probably compiled by joshua leavitt
what a disgusting catalogue of instances of
base truckling on the part of the north to
tbe slave power this catalogue should be
in the hands of every abolition lecturei and
ought to be used by him to shame northern
men into tbe appearance if not the reality of
independence p
mr qodey finding thatsyoophancy while
it worked admirably at the south was injuring
him at the north replaced the name of grace
greenwood on his covers without her know
ledge or consent on being informed of this
characteristic act this gifted authoress pub
lished a card disavowing all connection with
the book which ought henceforth
to be styled godeys sycophsntic magazine
a year or more ago mr godey published
in hi dollar newspaper a very humble
confession that he had scrupulously en
deavored to avoid the most distnat allusion m
ike subject of slavery
but mr gadey is not the only member of
the sycophantic association a neighbor
of his the american sunday school union
last yeat suppressed or as they expressed it
dropt from the cataloguew of their stereo
typed books of sixteen years standing at the
dictation of one of their southern vicepresi
dents because in the workjaeob and hia
stanathere was a definition of american
slavery written in mild language
the methodist episcopal church had says
the western citizen as a card for member
ship in one of their societies a picture repre
senting some view of liberty and the gospel
operating upon the slave scene in the distance
this scene was found to be so unpleasant tt
the slaveholders thst it was carefully erased
and fair white figuree made to fill the place
of the blacks
the impartial citizen says that a relative
of f garre taon who waa in hia early years
a slaveholder prepared hia memoir for pub
lication in it waa mentioned the faet that
f g bad become perauaded of the sin ol
slaveholding had freed his slaves and peace
of conscience was the result the mss
were sent to the methodist episcopal book
concern for publication by whom the above
faet waa stricken out
the old school presbyterians offended at
the mutilations which had been perpetrated
from time to time on ike hymns of the good
j watts opposed to issue a perfect and
unaltered edition of wattss psalms and
behold when the book was pub
lishedit wsa perfect transcript of the original
editionexcept that sundry verses and some
entire hymns in which there were ailasieor
to slavery were omitted
we remember says the citizen the nu
merous instances of religious and other books
reprinted from idondou editions from which
ntislavenr paragraphs and chapters were
cot by the helpers and other publishers for
fear of offending the sonth mias sedgwick

your prompt attention it earnestly requested
to this communication pinnae read it with
the annexed farms of petitions and then set
efficiently in the premises
the time has arrived when the people of the
united states are called in the providence of
god to decide for themselves and their latest
posterity whether human bondage with all its
terrific evils shall be suffered to extend itself
from the atlantic to the pacific blighting the
prosperity ot immense portions of our country
and dooming millions ol the human race to ig
norance degradation and wretchedness in
this decision are also involved the political
power and independence of the fief states
and the character and glory of our common
country
the objects which at this moment are most
prominent in public estimation connected with
the subject of slavery ate the cruel and arbi
trary manner in which alleged fugitives from
slavery are seized and carried awaythe abo
lition of the slavetrade and slavery in the
district of columbia and the prohibition of
slavery in the new territories and it is be
leived that the friends of freedom cannot do a
better service at the present juncture to the
sacred cause than by petitioning the national
legislature from all pans of the country respec
ting these great objects the reflex influence
of such petitions will be obvious to every re
flecting mind it will lead to conversation
public discussion newspaper essays public
meetings supplications to the almighty and
sympathy for the enslaved
for several years past there has been a re
laxation among the friends of the slave in this
department of effort it is believed that now
is the time when there are so many pledged
friends of the cause in congress to resume
petitioning with augmented effort we invoke
the aid therefore of every friend of the slave
of every antialavery citizen of every true
hearted american in thia work of humanity
and patriotism let earnest efforts be made to
awaken oar citizens to the momentous impor
tance ef the present crisis and to unite them

beg of you to put the circular ac into the

the slave power ia now making a desperate
and final effort to prevent the admission of
california with the prohibition of slavery and
any such prohibition by congress in respect
to new mexico and thus secure its perma

tinent ita success will be the triumph of evil
involving the subjection of noithem interests
to the ariatoermey of the south and a mighty
empire to the various curses attendant upon
human bondage to attain success resort is
had to threats of dissolutionthreats evidently
intended for intimidation since if carried into
execution they would leault in the ruin ol the

should the effort now fail slavery will never
hereafter acquire sufficient strength to pass its

dear friend the ladies literary and
progressive improvement society of the city
of buffalo is an association which has been
but recently formed having for its object the
great and important principles of the moral
intellectual political and social advancement
of its members by endeavoring to promote
so far as possible evury branch of literature
art and science and encouraging every poli
tical reform which tends to secure human
rights or elevate human character
their object ia also to establish a library
and reading loom and to seek through every
avenue the general interest and welfare of
its members and as they have undertaken
in its infancy thia great and responsible
work they feel it obligatory upon them to
call upon the sympathies of a charitable pub
lic to assist them in lhair undertaking they
contemplate building a public hall for their
accommodation and also for the accommoda
tion of every friend of god and humanity
the election of which they contemplate will
cost one thousand dollars or upwards and
they therefore most respectfully and earnestly
solicit donations from the friends throughout
the country which may be forwarded to the
address of the president or the secretary
and in making this appeal we most charit
ably hope that it will meet a favorable recep

education school discipline
the proper manner of educating children is
an inquiry of vital importanceand about
which there are various opinions some
cling tenaciously to the iod of coercion as the
only means of securing order and obedience
and of developing the better qualities of hu
man nature though this is an error of the
head rather than of the heart i conceive
it to be one which is doing incalculable injury
to the rising generation children are often
found fault with when they should be en
couragedwhipped when they ought to be
advised and as a consequence instead of de
veloping their better natures they become
hardened and revengful
certain i am that kindness on the part of a
teacher to a pupil u the only successful mode
of awakening those faculties of the mind and
heart which are necesaaiy to be aroused and
strengthened in order to the formation of a
proper and desirable character  was re
cently highly pleased by hearing of a teacher
who said he should as soon think of carrv
ing a gun into school as a switch this is
as it should be to think of mending the
heart by bruising the flesh is as absurd as it
is debasing god is love and everything
that emanates from him is pure lovely and
elevating and in dealing with children this
idea should be kept constantly before the
mind teachers of all others should pos
sess that spirit manifested by the saviour
suffer little children to corns unto me for
of such is the kingdom of heaven if we
possessed that spirit and manifested it on all
occasions before those beloved one whom
the father has entrusted to our care we
should save ourselves from many a heart

whichj would appear in tbe characlei and

after the reception ot petitions reports
from committees and resolutions the senate
resumed the consideration of the presidents
message transmitting the constitution ot
california
mr butler addressed tho senate inoppo
sition to the separation of the question of the
admission of california from the other agita
ting question of the daylt would be un
wise he desired to say to the majority not
to place the question of californias admission
in a situation in which the best and wisest
men in the country would have no control
over it he did not make the salvation of the
union under any circumstances the gteat
and paramount question his desire was to
save the union if it could be done at the
same time that the rights and interest of his
constituents were saved he wanted to ae
cnre both together one waa valueless with
out the other he alluded to mr clays
remarks yesterday in relation to the allegi
ance which he recognised and expressed his
surprise that the senator had boldly declared
that he owed no allegiance to the south he
was prepared to hear him say that we owed
allegiance to the union assn entire body but
not to hear him declare that he owed no
legiance to one particular section
mr clay interposing said that he thought
he had said and if he had not said it he
meant that he acknowledged no specific al
legiance to any sectionthat he acknowledg
ed allegiance only to the sovereignty of ken
tucky and to the sovereignty of the union
mr butlei slid that for himself he knew
no union except that which south carolina
might recognise owed no allegiance except
to south carolina and no allegiance to the
union except through her as to the settle
ment of the question of the admission of cali
fornia together with all other agitating
questions so intimately connected therewith
be was willing to render the whole subject to
a committee composed entirely of northern
men for the purpose of ascertaining what
they were prepared to offer the south mr b
then proceeded at some length with remarks
against the admission of culifornia with her
present sonstitution and boundaries asserting
that such act would be a violation of the well
settled practice and usage
he contended also that her constitution was
the result of an usurpation of power for the
purpose of getting rid of the wilmot proviso
measures worse ten thousand times than the
proviso had been adopted he also argued
the inexpedincy of the admission of the new
state contending that it would leave to one
section the choice either of submission deg
radation or secession the south demanded
equalitynothing more and would submit to
nothing less in conclusion he appealed to
the senate to settle this or any one of the
questions connected with the slavery agitation
until every man who desires it should have an
opportunity to express his views in the hope
hat some made of settlement might be sug
gested
mr badger said that he was not responsi
ble for the difficulties which had thus grown
out of the war with mexico if the senator
from south carolina mr butler who says
he had foreseen the danger and difficulties
which must result from the acquisition of
new territory had united with any other
two senators who also foresaw the difficulty
but voted with himif these senators has
cast their votes for an amendment to the
mexican treaty offered by him mr badger
striking out all acquisition these foreseen
troubles might all have been avoided
mr butler interposing said that the amend
ment was offered at too late a day
mr badger resuming remarked that he
had said duiing the discussion of the treaty
that notwithstanding he believed the origin
of the war with mexico to have been un
necessary and unjusthe would rather have
continued it an hundred years than that it
should eave resulted in an acquisition of ter
ritory ta produce internal commotion and dis
union
mr b then proceeded to state his objec
tions toihepropoaed instructions to the com
mittee on territories
mr wkbstkx concurred in the propriety
of giving this subject a calm and deliberate
consideration it was a grand and important
question and he designed for one to give it
a more careful examination it was a ques
tion tn which tho whole country and all sec
tions of the country were deeply interested
and he thought it the duty of every senator
to express the result of his studious delibera
tion thereon he did not design to intimate
any immediate expression of his own views
although he would probably in the course of
the discussion state hia views he was ready
to admit that there were mauy difficulties at
tending the proposition to admit california
but hoped to be able to show that they are not
insuperable it was in this spirit that he
designed to meet the subject
mr hale desired to say a word in relation
to the precedents for the proposed action
some four or five years ago there vere two
exciting questions texas and oregonbe
fore the eounlry they both like the sia
mese twine went through the presidential
election together but when the election was
over and they came to legislate these sisters
were separated and oregon had to ait with
in the cold region of   until taxas was
taken care of this then was a precedent
and he hoped it would be followed he hoped
california would first be taken care of and
then after she hid been brought safely and
nuglv into the union that they would pro
ceed and take up the other questions and
dispose of them also
mr clemens next took the floor when
the further consideration of the subject was
postponed until tuesday and the senate ad
journed to monday next
house of representatives
the house went into committee of the
whole on the state of the union
mr root said that he would go for admit
ting california with her present boundaries
and for ratifying all that had been done he
differed from the president in his doqothing
stlicy and was in favor of doing something
e believed that a majority of both branches
of congress were in favor of action it was
not the fault of the house that nothing was
doqe st the last session for the house passed
a bill at that time but the august senate did
nothing with it the walker amendment
was tacked on to the civil end diplomatic ap
propriation bill in the senate there was s
fixed and settled determination to force it
through and if was not relinquished until it
was known that by rersistanoe the bill would
be lost he was one of those who were de
termined that the amendment should not be
passed and helped to fight it off
we are told that spuihprn gentlemen have
the same object in viewbut they must not
jump too quick nor tun too fast the people
of new mexico should have constitutional
law instead of that of the bowie knife why
was mineeota provided with a territorial gov
ernment she had a population of only 
 what is fhe ohjeptiop urged against
prohibiting slavery in territories now free
because it is said the harmony of the country
would be disturbed in hit opinion it was
rather to avoid disturbing the harmony of
parts of the country the framers of the
constitution never contemplated the acquisi
tion of territoryif so they would we
made soma provision for its management
the provisions in that instrument related to
the territory then possessed we have so
equtl number of free and slave states end
we are told it would be aggteesioo to admit
another free etafe the youth le
isurely stronger than she was st the time of
the formation of the constitution a urge

m r uagod he belonged to the re
viled section of free soilers and there would
be oo difficulty in making an issue with
bim gentlemen bad been taunted with tbe
rematk tbat the wilinot proviso ia dead it
must be gratifying to northers men to be told
to their aces that the wilinot proviso has
been murdered in the rouse by its friends
and trampled under foot but the proviso is a
living and abiding principle in the breaets of
the people of tbe free states it may appear
that instead of the pioviso being dead tboas
twenty membeis who voted to lay it on the
table may have committed suicide not ten
of these men could have come here it they
hsd told tbeir constituents whit they would
have done there was one thing more absurd
than theory of dissolution of the union and
that was the alarm that gentlemen feel about
it dissolution was a mere speculative ques
tion he averred that if this should occui
the children of the ordinance bf  would
float up and down the mississippi river when
ever they please
mr welborne said that the ordinance of
 was passed by the congress of confed
eration before the adoption of the constitu
tion it was a matter of fact that there was
no territory belonging to the states when they
entered into the union
mr fitch asked whether the first congress
did not recognise the ordinance
mr welborne repeated that no territory
then belonged to the states and for this reason
it was pioperly remarked in the federalist
by mr madison that it was out of constitu
tional power to pass tbe ordinance he sub
mitted two resolutions and trusted that they
would be adopted via that it is inexpedient
to receive california as s state with her pre
sent constitution restricting slavery north of
  that the committee on territories be
instructed to report btiis providing for the or
ganization of that prution sooth of that line
and the territories of new mexico and des
eret prohibiting slavery north of   and
recognising the admissibility of slavery south
of that line until the adoption by the inhabi
tants thereof of state constitutions and their
incorporation into the union a portion of
the people of california had different lan
guages religions and colors and two years
ago they were conquerred by our arms by
the laws of naturalization they could not
recognise the first tight of citizen suffrage
would the free states consent to receive cali
fornia without a limitation of boundary this
proposition does not give the whole of the
territory to either party but divides it it
proposes repose but it would be better to
settle the question now than to let it remain
as an apple of discord hereafter he spoke
earnestly on the importance of settling the
question on high national grounds some
times he thought that there was only one
thing people would bow down to and that
was the infernal demon of party he afier
wstds imagined that the american people
were the least considerate and grateful on
earth considering the untold blessings they
enjoy while the downtrodden people of the
old wdrld experience jnunmerable oppressions
and are crowded together while we have
the pure free air of heaven in conclusion
he appealed to all to come forward and honor
ably adjust all their existing difficulties
mr mann claimed to be a free toiler if the
term included one who wished territories to
be free if a slave soiler was one who de
sired to bear slaves he was willing to be
weighed in the balance with the epithets which
had been applied to the free soilers though
the term abolitionist was used as a term of
reproach fortunately it may be used in an
honorable sense and if abolitionist means a
man who desires to abolish what ought to be
abolished then he took pleasure in being
one there are some who desire the abolition
of the union and he was content that to
these the term should be used as a term of
reproach it was applicable to persons at the
north but they wete few in number and
feeble in power it was announced by gen
eral caas that congress has no right to
legislate on any subjects including slavery
pertaining to the territories the senator
was driven to this because if he had admitted
the right to legislate at all it can be applied
to slavery if congress has no power to
legislate how is it that gentlemen propose to
legislate for california new mexico and
deseret and settle their boundaries tf
question cannot be settled according to this
doctrine when persons leave their states
they leave behind them their local laws
they do not carry their rystem of education
with them or their former laws on the sub
ject of lotteries and gaming they become
subject to the law where they locate as to
the souths considering tbe wilmot proviso
an insult there could be none when insult is
not intended and disavowed this is tbe
tule among gentlemen the north propose
the wiliwt proviso only to assert the great
right of mankind it is a fixed and settled
purpose of the north that there shall be no
more slave territory and slave states he
then spoke of the southern convention and
the threats which had been made in case of
the passage of the wilmot proviso a dis
solution of the union cannot be peacable
overt steps must be taken to carry it into
effect customhouses magazines arsenals
ac must first he seizedand this would bring
into requisition the power of the executive
who has sworn to support the union and see
that the laws are faithfully executed and
this weuld inflame the country into civil war
he could not contemplate this subject without
a shudder if the day come it would be with
thunderings above and earthquakes below
and darkness aroundand when the darkness
shall be lifted up they would see the country
severed and the deep profound gulf between
the sections filled with the scarred bodies ot
the combatants and we would find our hands
and garments red with suicidal blood how
could we stand before posterity and say that
the event came to pass because it was deter
mined to carry slavery to a country vyhere it
does not now exist apd to retrograde to the
dark ages while ill the world is looking on
but this was to take place at any and every
hazard if such an event must befall the
country weeanoot but see the disastrous con
sequences

such sectarians and politicians have adop

their principlesthey are deceivedand
therefore we urge them to abandon their sec

teir parties which we say are antiliberty
and join the liberty party the only genuine
instrumentality for the abolition of slavery
not only but for the regenemion of society
we eannot doubt that w l garrison

a sketch
i have worshipped blue eyes and
there is no radiance so heavenly as
that which gleams from them but
black are more bewildering and uen
a shadow of melancholy fails over the
forehead it softens their beauty while
it does not dim them
if yoa will go with me now
to a glen in the highlands and a wil
lowshaded nook i will point out to
you the very spot where yesrs ago
there stood a rude bench on which
many times i have seen the fair girl 
now write of sitting and by which i
once saw her kneeling the cottage
under the hill is occupied by strangers
and its broad hall and large rooms now
ring to the laughter of those that knew
not her whose gentle spirit haunts their
very chambers
she was as beautiful as a dream
never was holier forehead shaded by
raven tresses never were tresses so
glorious as those if i tell you that i
loved sarah d you will call me
an enthusiast and ascribe my admira
tion to my passion i did love her but
only as a boy worships a being very
far above him i used to lie at her
feet on the grass and gaze into her
face and watch the play of her ex
quisite features it was there i learned
first how high and pure and worship
ful humanity may be
she was young and beautiful whai
need to add that she was loved sure
ly i need not add that she loved foi
such as she live on aifection and di
for lack ol it her father devoted hit
fortune and his life to her and shewai
heiress to a large estate as might b
expected she had numberless suiton
of every rank and variety i canno
now remember all of them althougl
i then kept the run of them tolerably
well but of all there were only tw
that appeared to have any prospect o
success and the village gossips wer
occupied in discussing their relative
chances
frank r was the gayest best
hearted fellow in the world and ha
you seen him on his horse by the sid
of sarah d you would have sail
he was made for her so wild was hi
laugh and so joyous her response yet
had you been behind the closed hutte
of the window in the front of the larg
white house on the hill as they rod
by and had you there watched th
compressed lip the broad calm fore
head the pale face and the speakinj
eye of joseph s as he saw then
passing you would have prayed ti
god that that fair girl might belong t
that noble man even as i a boy thei
prayed
god lias answered my prayers
when the long way was traveled over
and the rugged and difficult steep sur
mountedwhen her fairy foot wa
pressed on the rock at the summit o
the hill of life and her eyes gazed inti
the deep blue sky with longing gaze
there even there beyond the blue hi
outstretched armß received her and hi
embrace was heaven
go preach to blocks and stones y
who believe that love is of the clay
go preach to the dead ye who den
the immortality of the affections g
reason with trees or hill or images o
wood or with your own motionless life
less icy souls ye who believe that
because there is no marrying yonder
there shall be on embracing or be
cause we may not use the gentle wordi
r my wife we may not clasp thesi
sanctified forms in our own holy arms
i tell you man that immortality wouh
be a glorious cheat if with our claj
died all our first affections  tell yot
that annihilation would be heaven if
believed that when my head at lengtl
rests on its coffined pillow and mj lipi
sink to the silence and repose of death
these loving eyes will never look int
mine again this pure clasp never b
around my neck this holy caress nevei
bless me more
but see how i hasten in advance o
my story and yet like canning
knifegrinder i remember now that 
have no story to tell or at best it is a
simple history
she loved joe his calm and ear
nest way of loving her won her whole
soul he did not say much to her in
company nor of her but when they
were alone or only some of the chil
dren near his low voice would be musi
cal and she sal entranced with its
eloquence i have seen them seated
on the bench by the side of the stream
and have heard him lead her gentle
soul step by step with him from earth
to stars and then from star to star un
til she seemed to be in heaven with him
and listening to the praises of the
angels
 am unable to tell you how it hap
pened that joseph s left his pro
fession which had been law and
entered the ministry nor am i able to
state though i might guess at the
causes operating in his own mind the
father of sarah d was not a re
ligious man and i am sorry to say
was one of a small class of men who
not only deny the truths of our most
holy creed but take every opportunity
to cast ridiqule on its teachers it was
therefore with great pain that his
daughter observed his coldness and
rudeness to joseph s and she was
not surprised however much she was
grieved when an open rupture ren
dered the suspension of his visits at
the house absolutely necessary
they had never spoken of love
each knew the secret of the others
affection and what need then of words
to tell it it would have been but the
repetition of hackneyed phrases and
yet there is no music in the world so
sweet as those three words i love
you from the lips we love to kiss
but the father of our gentle friend had
feared the existence of some bond be
tween them and peremptorily required
his daughter to break it if it did exist
she replied to him relating the sim
ple truth and he desired her to refute
thenceforward to ace or speak to
joseph
a month of deeper pain than can
well be imagined succeeded this com
mand during which they did not meet
it was on a moony night in august
that rite walked out with me then a
boy three jeers her junior and sat
down on the bench by the side of the
stream the air was clear the sky
serene and no sound disturbed us but
the soft voice of the wind among the
treetops made a pleasant music and
we listened and were silent the still
ness was broken by the voice of joseph
you will pardon me if i pass over
that scene i dare not attempt a des
cription of it it was my fiist lesson
in human suffering and though i have
learned it over and over since then
though the iron has entered my own
soul and seared and scarred it yet i
have never seen nor do i believe i
have ever felt more agony than those
two felt as they parted that night to
meet no more on earth
he bowed his lips to her forehead
and murmured the solemn word for
ever she woke at that word and
exclaimed with startling vehemence
no no there is no such word joe
we shall not meet aaain on earth
my gentle one and what is earth
her tall form grew more queenly and
her dark eye flashed devinely as she
rose and exclaimed in clear and sil
very tones and what is earth these
things must end i will name a tryst
dear joe and you shall keep it ii
you pass first into the other land wail
for me on the bank and if i go hence
before yon i will linger on the othei
shore until you come will you re
member
i will live and die in this memory
she lifted her face to his and hei
arms to his neck and they clung to
gether in a long and passionate em
brace their lips did not separate
but were pressed close together until
he felt her form cold and her clasp re
laxed and he laid her gently down or
the old seat bowed over her a momenl
in prayer and was gone i heard hiit
ay take care of her w and sc
i strove to recall the life that had gone
from her lips and cheeks and eyes i
came slowly and she woke as we wake
in the morning after death has enterec
our charmed circle with an oppressiof
on the brain and a swimming swollei
senselessness of soul
at length she remembered all anc
i raised herself with a halfarticulatec
exclamation of agony broken by a
i sob then fell on her knees by the
bench and buried her face in her hands
and remained thus for nearly half ar
 hour
when she arose her face was a
the face of an angel it wore thai
same exalted look until she died
ithink she took cold that night she
was never well afterward and the nexi
j winter she passed at the south return
ing in the spring very fragile but ver
beautiful
joseph s tvas sent abroad b
one of the boards of missions of the
church but his health failed and he
resigned his commission while he trav
eled through the eastern world
three years fled with their usua
p swiftness to sarah d the
wer very slqw and painful years yel
she was happy in her qniet way anc
no one dreamed of the strange trysl
she was longing to keep on the othei
side of that dark river w hich men sc
shrink from she grew feebler daily
j as the summer and autumn advanced
and in december she was evidentl
dying
one day her mother had been out ol
the bouse perhaps making calls she
returned at evening and among othei
incidents of news which she had learn
ed she mentioned to sarah the death
of her old friend joseph s
the fair girl was reclining in her
large arm chair looking out through
the closed windows at the snow on the
ground and the pure moonlight which
silvered it there was no startling
emotion visible as her mother mentioned
the fact which to her was the most
solemn yet most joyful news the world
could give for now how much nearer
was their meeting i saw a smile flash
across her lace as the joyful news
reached her ear i saw her forehead
raised to feel the caress which i know
she felt she was silent for many
minutes and then spoke in feeble yet
very musical accents and i boyishly
wept aloud then she smiled and
looked at mewith finger upraised and
said wait a little while longer dear
w and then after a moment
she said mother is the snow very
deep
not very dear why did you ask
because if it were deep i thought it
would be difficult for old mr smith to
and our lot in the graveyard are all
the headstones covered mother
what is the matter sarah what
if they are covered
mother dear it is useless to con
ceal it from ourselves or from one
other you know and i quite as well
that i am dying i have not wished to
live only for oue thing i did long for
life and i dreaded to meet death all
alone bnt now i shall not w
will tell you what  mean when i am
gone yes gone dear mother 
shall not be here any longer this
chair will stand here and i not be any
where near ityou will be here and
father and you will rise and walk about
and visit and go in and out and sleep
and wake again and so on day after
day and i shall have no part any long
er in your cares and joysdear mo
therand as she uttered the last two
words she put her arms around her
mothers neck and kissed her fondly
and sank back into her chair again i
sat at her feet watching her matchless
featuresa smile was flitting across
them now there now gone yet each
time it appeared it lingered longer
than before until it became fixed and
so holy so very holv that i grew be
wildered as i gazed and a strange
tremor passed through my body
the breath of peace was fanning her
glorious brow her head was bowed
a very little forward and a tress escap
ing from its bonds fell by the side ot
her pure white temple and close to her
just opened lips it hung there motion
less no breath disturbed its repose
she slept as an angel might sleep hav
ing accomplished the mission of her
god
