j dick and fred douglasl
like not to inisdignify myself by writ
ins to negroes that i know my natural
inferiors and who may be incorrigibly i
bent on insolence aa if aaucineas were
the sign of freedom still to a wellbej
haved and humble negro slave or tree
 should regard it no lowering of digj
nity to correspond with sometimes
neither of you by the paper called
north star if you are both black men
appear to meet the character ofthe col
ored man to whom  would send a let
ter in my first letter i should have
said  have no disposition to lower my
dignity by writing to a rebellious lur
bulent reckless negro who possesses
charms only for kindred white or black
spirits at the north
i now resume the corresp mdence in
order to admonish you of the total ir
relevancy to your race of behaving in
the manner you do towards the south
ern slaveholder and the northern white
man it is always comprehended among
us that the negroes are a peppery irri
table and proud andtlbdurate people
who when they have chance would he
sure to prove always irksome and often
intolerable to european society 
have seen them wantonly sneer at
their white owners and others in the
southern country i have evidence
they continually insult the white people
at the north it seems to be fated you
or to be impossible for you to act with
that becoming propriety which should
evince a worthy and an intelligent and
pious people hence many at the
north wish you in liberia and many
more slaveholders at the south wish the
slaves colonized away in their patrimo
nial dominions all these is the result
more of your character and conduct
than of color only
for evidence that you act improperly
and unintelligently let me call your at
tention to two instances i write you
again to make these corrections in
publishing my first letter to douglass
you said you would not insult the
common sense of your readers by at
tempting toanswer itand that it shot
wide of the mark and was not argu
mentary how did you know it was
not full of arguments could your ob
tuse faculties and dim perceptions never
grasp hold of what is obvious to all
white men of mind that you even if
attempting the work could not contro
vert my points ah frederick you
have not yet been put where powerful
arguments were unyieldingly in con
tention you have not had yet in any
master mind an opponent who would
contest with ou every inch of ground
and leave you finally subdued you
have only been on a gaa in england
where silly abolitionists were but too
ready to give unto all your sinbad
arabian night marvellous tales of
horrors in tin southern prisonhouse
and are in rochester among dear friends
who are more intent white as their
skins are to use you if possible to
mortify the slaveholder than to do you
any good proprui persona meantime
you and your ebon crew form the most
violent and pernicious part of the einan
cipatists
in that letter did you see no argu
ment in my representing the inferiority
and superiority of the two races re
spectively and the necessity of the re
lation now existing between them did
you whilst dick sneered at the de
crees called me a calvinist and
disparage pious aoula not be aw are
that he raa then deriding holy writ
the north star
and blaspheming the apint as you
father ham dtd when he rebelke
against noah ibr dooming him am
drove that ancestor uponhestepps of
asia did i not tell you that yot
would accredit nothing bible am
white may say in the favor of th
blessed part of the humanjamily j
blessing you can no more depreciate
disparage controvert or sap or mine
than you can take the mastery of tin
w hiteman no in any struggle youi
race would succumbhavefever done
sosuppliant in all regions of the world
except haiti where sixteen negro
slaves stood against one white man
with the aid of the british but pitch
any five white rntn against any ten oi
fifteen negroes and give fair play and
as usual the latter will serve the former
can the decrees of god then be
sneered at and i only a calvanist for
asserting them does not the omnip
otent know why and wherefore he did
so constitute the human family and
if he made of one blood all the na
tions that dwell on the earth has he
not appointed the bounds of their
habitations is not african slavery
therefore a violation of the terms ol
that appointment yes it is so the
negro cannot find himself in his own
habitation or element till he is upon
the soil of africa and then if his own
color does not enslave him he is fret
indeed ve cannot go there and en
slave your people and live god has
separated the colors as clearly as any
fact in nature can be proved by philos
ophy and observation
the other instance is your attempt
to underestimate mr webster at lynn
massachusetts it is equally an error
as your attempt not to see the argu
ments of my first letter mr webster
has always been the friend of your race
and never was in favor of slavery hut
he cannot like garrison endeavor to
destroy the constitution of his country
in any effort to liberate the
for aside from the had taste and impro
priety of thus violating his official oath
to serve the constitution next o his
god the inexpediency of such a course
is the more glaring any violent effort
to free the slaves in this land would be
a civil war and perhaps rivet their
chains the more strongly you and
garrison may not care about this and
would attempt to do il and risk all in
one prodigious ruin where then is
your fixed principle mr websters
fixed moral and political and religious
principle disallow his venturing ou so
foolhardy and mar an vprhwrnt
he therefore though he does not like a
slaveholder argued and voted for
taylor in preference to cass and van i
buren and gerril smith for reasons ol i
state and to rescue the country from
in his opinion the political spoilers
his reasons therefore are obvious and
principled though you did not evidently
see them
i would advise you as a friend to go
to liberia and to urge your free col
ored brethren to this course in the
long run stopping in america can do
the aolored race no good and the
heartburnings you experience among
your white friends would always keep
you under excitement strive to have
a good mild amiable heart annd
knowing your place act as one con
scious that gods christs decree is
forever for the best and after awhile
your race s captivity like jobs
he turned und they may form agagi as
of old a republic and a better one in

a m j iu a
in llie month of september last a
congress was held in the city of brus
sels whose great object was to pro
mote and secure permanent peace
among the civilized nations of the
earth by finding if possible an effi
cient substitute for the bloody uncer
tain and costly arbitrament of war
the congress was composed of numer
ous individuals speaking various lan
guages living under diverse forms of
government and entertaining different
political opinions and religious convic
tions but drawn together by a common
sentiment of humanity and an ardent
desire to promote the welfare of man
kind by removing the causes and in
centives to war
the eminent position which you oc
cupy in the councils of the nations of
europe and america induces the
congress of which we are the repre
sentatives to submit to your serious
consideration the great and important
questions which formed the subject of
their deliberations and respectfully
yet earnestly to invite your attention
to the conclusions at which they arrived
they will be found embodied in the
following resolutions
ist that in the judgment of this
congress an appeal to arms for the
purpose of deciding disputes among
nations is a custom condemned alike
by religion reason justice humanity
and the best interests of the people
and that therefore it considers it to be
the duty of the emitted world to adopt
measures calculated to effect its entire
abolition
d thai it is of the highest import
ance to urge on the several govern
ments of europe and america the ne
cessity of introducing a clause into ah
international treaties providing for the
settlement of all disputes by arbitration
in an amicable manner and according
to the rules of justice and equityspe
cial arbitrators or a supreme interna
tional court to be ineesled with power
to decide in caeee of necessity as a last
resort
right  of no sextruth is of no colorgod is thk father of us all and all we are brethren
d that the speedy convocation of a
cong res of n ations composed of duly
appointed representative for the pur
pose of framing a welldigested and
authoritative international code is ol
the greatest importance
the organizat on of such a body and
the unanimous adoption of such a code
would be an effectual mean of promot
ing universal peace
th that this congress respectfully
calls the attention of civilized govern
ments to the necessity of a general and
simultaneons disarmament as a meant
whereby they may greatly diminish the
financial burdens which press upon
them remove a fertile cause of irrita
tion and inquietude inspire mutual
confidence and promote the inter
change of good offices which while
they advance the interests of each state
in particular contribute largely to the
maintenance of general peace and tc
the lasting prosperity of nations
these substitutes for war adopted by
the congress require no arguments tc
enforce them for it is evident that il
they be adopted and applied that terri
ble scoilrge of humanity will cease to
afflict and degrade the nations
few if any of the wars which for
centuries past have desolated the earth
can be justified on the ground of equity
utility or necessity nor can any one
of them be cited whose fearful results
are not loudly condemned by the voice
of humanity and religion the war
spirit of past generations has loaded
most if not all civilized nations with
enormous debts paralyzed their indus
try interrupted their commerce re
tarded the progress of science litera
ture and art and created a spirit ol
jealousy and animosity among the na
tions whicii long years of peace have
not been able completely to subdue
europe at this moment presentsthe
melancholy spectacle of an armed
peace her mighty legions are ready
to take the field and it is feared that
under these melancholy circumstances
a single spark from the torch of wai
may wrap the world in flames may
god avert so terrible a catastrophe
the great questions of peace and
war are confided to the hands of those
to whom the government of the nations
has bean entrusted their responsi
bility is as great as their power and
while the congress would earnestly
pray that the god of peace may
deign to preside over their councils it
would implore them in the name of the
dearest interests of humanity civiliza
tion and religion promptly to tba
most effective measures for preventing
a return of the horrors of war and for
securing to all nations the blessings ot
a solid and lasting peace
the substitution of arbitration for
war would be an immense step towards
the object the principle and the means
of giving it effect might be embodied
in special treaties but tle progress of
sound political opinion leads still far
ther the convening of a congress
composed of the most enlightened and
eminent men of all countries for the
purpose of framing an international
code which shall place the relations
between the different nations on a solid
and intelligent basis and the institu
tion of a high court of nations ibr
the adjudication of questions in accord
ance with the great and comprehensive
principles of such a code woul qjn
only remove the causes ce
ment a noble and between
both governments and people 
in anticipation of so great a result
it is desirable that the necessity ot a
general and simultaneous disarmament
should take place as such an act
without compromising the dignity or
impairing the strength of governments
would he the surest guarantee for the
i preservation of general peace aud the
advancement ot public prosperity
the congress is fully aware that the
i force of circumstances the progress of
modern industry and commerce the
i greater facility and frequency of com
munication between the nations the
diffusion of knowledge and the more
elevated sentiments of humanity and
religion all tend to prevent the recur
rence of war but it is not less assured
that it remains with the governments of
the civilized world to put an end to that
fatal and sanguinary custom tiy adopt
ing those wise and necessary measures
which shall lead to so happy a result
in submitting to statesmen the recom
mendation embodied in the resolutions
the congress entertains a just and legi
timate confidence that they will not be
disregarded and that the governments
of europe and america animated by
an ardent and sincere desire to promote
the welfare of the great commonwealth
of nations will determine as in the
performance of a sacred duty to give
them a practical application and thus
aid in securing the peace of the world

inclusive  held in conformity with
the recommendation of green plain
quarterly meeting by persons from
parte of ohio and indiana
frederick hoover end ruth dug
dale were appointed clerks
after an interesting exchange of sen
timent the following minute setting
forth the character of our effnketion
was adopted with cerfial unanimny
rochester n y friday january o 
believing the religious sentiment is
deeply laid in mans nature that it is
essential to his true interest to bow in
allegiance to the divine laws of god
written in our being and that in the
worship intelligently performed by ra
tional creature man should never con
cede to any combination or order of
men his individual freedombut re
cognizing the infinite source and cen
ter of all inind as sovereign lord
we now associate in the capacity of an
annual meeting that shall be advisory
in its character and designed to aid in
more effectually carrying forward the
testimonies of the gospel which legiti
mately result from a communication
with the source of all good and iu
their nature and essence are designed
to make man the friend of man and
give direction to the noble faculties
with which we are endowed
the meetings constituting this body
will be considered of the congrega
tional order and in all cases regarded
as possessing the right to make tlieir
own local arrangements
reports were then read from goshen
and green plain and the representa
tives all present but one no written re
port from indiana
several communications were read
acceptably and richard wright fred
erick hoover joseph a dugdalc
horton brown hannah howell sarah
micmner and ascha williams are ap
pointed to produce essays of corre
spondence to a future sitting of this
meeting
then adjourned until  next day
near the time adjourned to the
meeting again assembled
the committee on correspondence
produced the following essays of me
pmorial which were approved and di
rected to be signed by the clerk and
forwarded to their several places of des
tination to wit
to the senate and house of repre
sentatives of the state of ohiothis
meeting is impressed with the convic
tion that the statute which makes dis
tinction between man and man op ac
count of color commonly called the
black laws of ohio are opposed to
the great principle of natural justice
and in their tendency exert a detri
mental influence in community we
therefore very respectfully memorialize
your body to repeal them
to the senate and house of repre
sentatives in congress assembled
we are religiously impressed with a
sense of the terrible outrage upon the
wiem nd mmm hr thn
institution of slavery in our beloved
countryand believing an awful respon
sibility rests upon the american people
for its perpetuity we are induced to me
morialize for its immediate abolition in
the district of columbia and also the
internal state slavetrade
to the senate and house of repre
sentatives of the state of ohiothe
subject of punishing crime by taking
the life of the wretched criminal being
introduced into thi meeting we are s
constrained in earnest solicitude to 
call the attention of the legislature to
examine with seriousness this moment
ous subject and see whether ihe pro
gress in civilization and the spirit of
the age does not demand the abroga
tion ofthj ipattrsotne and demoralizing
and substitute therefor
such regulations as shall be instru
mental in more effectually checking vio
lence in the land and reforming those
who have unhappily lived in violation of
those laws w hich were designed to i
make man the friend of man throughout
the world
after the reading of the foregoing
memorials the meeting became im
pressed with the propriety of issuing

tend to destroy individual freedom of

of the glorious gospel and murt be

time is devoted in perpetuating a mysti
cal theology that has no practical bear
ing but rather tends to debase and mai
the work of god in acquiring a
knowledge of science an attainment
very laudable in itself we fear an ac
quaintance with ourselves is sorrow
fully neglected and hence the chaotic
state of our social and spiritual rela
tions beloved friends with earnest
solicitude let us summon ourselves be
fore the court of couscience and ex
amine how far we are instrumental by
the cultivation of improper dispositions
the wteng direction of faculties in
themselves good of infusing into our
religious associations a spirit which
lays waste the simple equality of broth
erhood like the princes of the gen
tiles who exercised authority
against which poisonous influence jesus
cautioned the little band as though he
saw with annointed vision the havoc
distinction and caste would make with
his flocks and how this departure from
the democracy of christianity would
endorse systems of violence w hich rest
on the basis of antagonism to the rights
of man
the weapons of the christian are
peace the most pow erful arguments are
love and we believe if the worldis re
strained in its transgressions and re
deemed from its fearful delusions these
will be found to he omnipotent instru
mentalities
how impressively true is the beauti
ful sentiment of channing the voice
of god in every mind is to be listened
to above all other guides and lords
there is a sovereign within us clothed
with more ample power than any out
ward being and he alone is worthy the
name of man who gives himself up sol
emnly deliberately to obey this internal
guide through peril and death this is
the seminal principle of virtuous free
dom and the very foundation of morals
and religion this the lesson to be
taught alike in republics and despot
isms and yet it has but just dawned
upon the world its full application re
mains to be developed they who have
been baptised by a true experience into
this vital and allcomprehending truth
must everywhere be its propagators
and he who makes one convert to it
near a despots throne has broken one
link of that despots chain it in fit
ihu dißorinr h t a in t ttf idt
sentiment that we place our hope of
freedom the unanimity which has
characterized our deliberations has
been truly cheering and resulted in
memorializing our state legislature for
the abolition of the gallows and the
black laws of ohio and indiana and
the american congress on the subject
of slavery our sympathies have been
deeply enlisted in behalf of all those
who are groaning under the heavy
burden of austere church authority re
quiring assent and obedience to compli
cated disciplines and mysterious creeds
every w f ay revolting to the rational con
clusion of the enlightened mind and
also with those who are standing alone
in lonely places mourning over the ap
parent failure of the religious organi
zations in furnishing health strength
and encouragement to their members in
searching after wisdom and knowl
edge
may w e take the spoiling of our rep
utation joyfully and regard the anath
emas of those establishments claiming
to be christian churches who are the
strong bulwarks of oppression in the
land and infidel to the government of
god as nothing and vanity thanks
giving and high praises to our heav
enly head the pure in heart in seasons
of divine favor ride in the chariot of
love and attain a life where dragons
have no power and happy are they
who find it finally dear friends

whereas the trußc in human be

country throughout christendom and
a serious hindrance to the progress of

mr greeley in a letter to his paper
gives the following account of the pas
sage of the resolution
the scene in the house was of
course one of deep excitement but
there was very little blaster and no in
decorum on one or two divisions the
leading ultra slavery men commenced
by declining to vote bat they generally
bad their names called again and an
swered before the decision was an
nounced mr gott had taken the pre
caution to move the previous question
when be introduced hie raaolutioo and
this being sustained by the house no
debate upon it waa in order aod of
course it could not be thrown over by
offering to debate it an attempt was
made to have a call of the house but
decided not in order since the previous
question bad been ordered but mr
haralson of ga moved that it do lie
on the table and on this motion the
yeas and nays were ordered and taken
and it wdl lost a cry now arose
let the southern members withdraw 
bt i saw non of them bead it tb
oast step being to order the main ques
tion to be pet the yeas and nays wars
very uaueunlly and absurdly called oc
this bet mane of the alavery united
with the anti slavery men in the anna
tire and it prevailed by a large vote
nov came the gneeboo shall the
hanoi util peat and the yean and
nays wort demanded from all sidae with
joifn iick fuimmj i
whole n 
entire unanimity the prevalent m
qp evinced was one of deep earionn
ness and earnest resolution l tbiak
the house is not often ao still during
tna call of yeae and nays the fact
that no similar proposition had eer
prevailed rendered it acparently an
even cance that this would be defeated
until very near the close of the call
several members who did not answer
her called in their order asked to be
called at the close and one or two
i changed their voles all wbo were
within the bar when their names were
originally called are entitled to vote at
anv time before the result ia an
nounced the result was announced
by the the speaker breaking a breath
less silence mr holmes or s c tke
j taylor and the house
i having been a federalist of the school
of b a jackson man of b a nul
lifier of  for polk and dallas in 
end now for taylor and butler who
usually leads the advanced guard of
slavery but who had not been in hid
seat till now rose and cried out let
the southern members retire but i
believe he alone retired it is true
however that many wero deeply ex
cited and that some were grieved to
whom i would not willingly give pain
some wonld have had less objection to
the resolution without the preamble
i others considered that the batter part
of the whole at all events what ia
writ is writ
to dec ion having bean an
nounced mr stuart of michigan
j moved its reconsideration and under
took to make a speech thereon but was
stopped by the speakerthe motion
not being debatable at this time as only
resolutions that no one rises to debate
can be considered the day they are
offered mr cobb of georgia took
an appeal from the decision of the
chair but one hundred and sixteen
members rose in support of the deci
sion and the appeal was given up and
then the call of the states for resolu
tions was proceeded with until nearly
 oclock when a motion to adjourn
prevailed i presurqe tha debate on
reconsideration which may coma up
tornorrow will then have free course
private bills being ordered to stand
aside for that purpose
such is the fitting tloae in con
gress of the th year ince the land
ing of the pilgrims on the rack ol ply
mouth  could have wished that u
occurred on forefathers day but per
haps it is better as it ia the sons of
timpilgri ihrmighnssthe union ao

my ok a a sis  find that not a few are
displeased with the letter winch i addressed
to you treasurer of the american mission
ary association  refer to the letter in
which  signify that for the officers of a re
ligious body to vote tor antiabolitionists and
antilandreformers and others whose senti
ments and characters unfit them to administer
righteous civil government is to furnish a
sufficient ground for the witlidrawment of pat
ronage fiotn such body
perhaps i cannot spend an hour or two
more properly than in an attempt to justify
that letter
our world is in rebellion against its maker
it is of course as unhappy as it is unright
eous but there is a remedy for this sin and
rum that remedy is christianity and the
friends of jod and man are bent upon apply
ing it how shall it be applied most success
fully  by being applied wholly instead of
partially it is true that a measure of good
may result from its partial application but
it is only by its thorough application that the
world can be brought hack to rod and to hap
piness
there is nothing which the chtistianiiy of
the bible more pointedly and fully condemns
than oppression and hv notiiing so much as
by oppression is her progress obstructed
hence they who even tolerate oppression
and much more they who uphold and prac
tice itare if indeed they can is said to lie
applying christianity at all to the sins and suf
ferings of the world applying it very imper
fectly
a people who have been oppressed for
ages are dwarfed and imbecile in intellect and
abject and crushed in spirit now if it lie
too much to say that such a people are inac
cessible to chrstianity it is at least not so to
say that they are very unlikely to become
her subjects are we told that multitudes of
such became christians under the ministry of
the celebrated missionary schwartz  if they
didand this is somewhat doubtfulthey
were nevertheless incapable of teaching and
perpetuating christianity for already the
scene of schwartzs labors is as if these labors
had never been performed is there how
ever the least probability that schwartz
preached a whole gospel lie enjoyed the
confidence of the oppressive government and
this he could not have done had he preached
against its oppressions indeed the rajahs
complimented him for not interfering with the
government
lei it not be understood as saying that
christianity can do nothing for a long oppres
sed people they are not beyond its reach
it can act upon them directly though on
account of the unfavorable circumstances and
infantile capacity and half ruined manhood
to but a very limited extent it can act migh
tily for them by influencing the oppressors to
deliver the oppressed
i have referred to the intellectual feebleness
of the oppressed of india mere children
and that too by reason of their oppressions
are the oppressed of the sandwich islands
also who until recently had none and who
have now but a few of the rights of pro
csrty were the missionaries upon these
lands to withdraw from them not enough
vigoi would remain among their converts to
to retain a hold upon christianitymuch less
to propagate it among the shrivelled victims
of oppression
there are the oppressed irish and the
southern slaves also but little could chris
tianity do for them except through the con
victions it might produce in their oppressors
a christianity for the oppresed which is at
peace with the oppressor is worse than no
christianity not such a christianity was that
which the lamented raymond carried to af
rica
i do not say that all forms of oppression
constitute an equal barrier to the progress of
christianity the oppressed who are re
duced to chatlelhood and those who left to
own themselves are nevertheless denied the
rights of property are it must be admitted
less likely to lie brought umder the saving in
structions of christianity than those who are
simply poor and yet where the masses are
poor it is hardly too much to take up ihe
words of the poet povertys unconquer
able bar and repeat them in the taco of the
power even of christianity herself the rich
cannot be the disciples of christianity no
man who regards himself as richas the
owner of riches which have come into ins
stewardshipis in the way to heaven and
though i cannot say that none of the poor
are rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom
yet i can say that if christianity he not in her
lement when among the rich neither is she
when among the poor her author has
adapted her to achieve her triumphs among
those whose condition was prayed for by
agurwhose lot in life lies between the ex
tremes of poverty and riches that chris
tianity is unadapted both to a state of riches
and a state of poverty is manifest from the
fact that her principles not to say her pre
cepts forbid both richefi and poverty the
universality of christian love would of itself
suffice to prevent either and w hat is more
the nation in winch this truth is unacknowl
edged and unlelt for by her disciples cannot
whilst suen remains the tact lie christianized
i admit that even in such a nation chris
tianity may here and there and temporarily
accomplish something but the masses if at
all affected by her power w ill be only slight
ly and temporarily so

 said in the beginning of this letter that
christianity in order to be most successful
against the unrighteousness and wretchedness
of this world must he thoroughly applied to
u them what wonder then that she
should have made ao small an impression up
on them seeing that with scarce an excep
tion she has never been brought to hear upon
the chief ports of them

no higher duty is christianity under than
ui array itaelf against the so called civil gov
eminent it must overturn them ere it will
lie rid of its greatest enemy and obstacle and
ere it can bless and save the world bui
alas bow few are the cbnstian who believe
ibis kveo those who are at the bead of
missionary bodies and who are conducting
enterprises for the evangehxauoo o the hea
then scatcely suspect the want ol harmony
between christianity and these spurious civil
governmentsand still leas uo they sus
pect that these government and christianity
are in deadly opposition to each other it
ndght well be supposed that the officers of tbs
american missionary a association are an l
exception to this remark mate that associa
tion was organised by libertyparty men
and that too at a time when rt was not vet
discovered that to vote for antiaboliuomsts
i i accordance with liberty party doctrine
but that the officers of this association differ
but little in thi respect ftpm the officers of
other mismortsnr associations is manifest
from the fact that at the late election ail of
tlaem witla probably no other exceptions
than samel it aid iewis tappan and
professor w hippie were in favor of electing
to the presidency the gentleman who finds
for consolation instead of repentance
in that unequalled devotion to die slave pow
er which gained for him the unenviable lain
of the northern man with southern princi
ples it fa btfieted that some of the offic
ers of the american missionary association
were in favor of electing to the chief magis
tracy of this state the gentleman who a
few weeks before had in congress not only
voted against the abolition of slaverjr in thf
district of c olumbia but had made an elabor
are speech to show that the african rare is a
doomed race and that of course he and we
should be religiously careful not to do or say
aught which might tend to arrest the speed
of this doom oh how unlike are the van
burens and jjixes as well as tlie taylors
and casses to the heavenapproved magis
trates to the good king josiah whe
judged the cause of the poor and needy
and to that beautiful pattern of a ruler job
who was a father to tlie poor and how
delivered the poor that cried and tht
fatherless and him that had none to help
i him and who let it also be rememliered
brake tlie jaws of the wicked and plucked
the spoil out of his teeth god gave civil
government for the purpose of protecting
those especially who most need protection
those who are too poor and ignorant and
weak and helpless to protect themselves
but alas how do they pervert it from its
metciful and heavenintended uses who set
 up for the rulers of llnse poor and ignorant
and weak and helpless ones such as despise
and devour them as well put sheep under
the protection of wolves
may god hasten the time w hen christians
shall use christianity in subverting those in
fernal conspiracies against the poor and op
pressed which impudently assume the name
of civil government and in setting up upon
ihpir ruins true and righteous and hlesssed
and glorious civil governments when
christianity shall lx so used there will le
comparatively few infidels she will then
commend herself to the conscience of the
world as the religion of truththe religion
of heaven but what wonder that whilst
her prolessors aud even such of them as ate
ensamples pul civil government into the
hands of the cruellest enemb of the poor
into the hands of those who disdain to eat
with the poor and to sit by their side in the
house of worship and to suffer their child
i ren to go to the same school that the children
of the poor go to and who in short use
civil government to rob and outrage and
crush the poor what wonder isay that
whilst this continues the world should have
but little reverence for christianity and but
little faith in its truth
j the doctrine that christianity will work
flier way through the world in spite of what
ever untoward circumstances are made to
surround men and that she will penetrate all
hearts with her convincing and converting
powereven those hearts which are most
anxious and absorbed with the concern where
to find shelter clothing and food and that
she will butfl through all barriers which the
deep and degrading poverty of the masses
throws across her pathand do it too even
whilst hei disciples are busy fortifying those
barriers this delusive and ruinous doctrine
must be exploded ere the world will embrace
christianity the christian who with one
 hand is sending bibles and missionaries over
the earth and with the other is putting the
enemies aud despisers and robbers of the
poor into ptacen of cirirl power is doing ftu
 more to hinder than advauce the progress ol
christianityfar more to retard than liaster
the salvation of the world
i i readily admit that christians are cal let
i on to lie charitable and to distribute theii
surplus goods among the needy but theii
higher calling is to be just let them insisi
i that justice shall be done to their fellowmen
and especially that they shall have the pro
tection of righteous civil government ant
 there will soon be such an approach to equal
ity in the possessions of men and in theii
i circumstances generally as shall leave com
i paratively little occasion for giving food to tlu
hungry and clothes to the naked
let american christianity not only cease
from her opposition to and contempt of biblt
i politics but identify herself with them an
i on the sabbath and fipm the pulpit and in
j season and out of season preacli them and
j insist that he that ruleth over men must b
 just and that it is a high crime against god
and man to choose any other than just per
sons for rulers american christianity
 also insist that he who would biing under the
definition obligation and sacredness of law
 enactments which instead of being lor the
protection are openly and confessedly for the
destruction of human rights is capable ol
legalization and that he who would admit
j that men may be lawfully plundered of theii
godgiven shares of uie soil and thus bf
denied ja standingplace upon the earth and
that lie who would not acknowledge the duty
of carrying out ill all just directions the doe
li ine of tlie equal rights of all men let hei
j insist that such delinquents instead of being
allowed a place among the rulers and protec
tors of men are to be classed with the op
pressors and murderers of inen let ameri
can christianity  say make such a stand
and she will soon prove hy her triumphs in
this and other lands that she has become tht
true christianity
 cannot close this teller without saying
how gteatly  have been disappointed in the
missionary association of w hich you ye trea
surer i was chairman of the committer
which called ihe convention that organized
the association it was then distinctly un
i dei stood on all hands that whatever else the
 tlie association might or might not be it
would always be an abolition association 
i felt sure that we had at last a missionary
association which would preach abolition
politics to my own country and to other
i countries but alas it is even so soon in
effect an antiabolitjpii association even
so soon its veiy officersnearly all of them
from its president downwardsare in favoi
j of electing to the highest civil trusts men
i who are the avowed opponents of abolition
and the bitterest enemies of the slave
what will the american missionary asso
ciation do will it have the magnanimity to
retrace its steps and again became an aboli
j lion association will it henceforth a
quick consent to have a slaveholder for one
of its officers as a person who will vote for an
antiabolitiunist  will it in a word identify
itself with righteous civil government and
go for the enslaved and the landless and
whithersoever such government demands it
shall go will this be its course then
will it be an inexpressibly rich blessing to the
world but if this shall out be its course
then w ill it be as imotent for good as are the
other missionary associations of the world
thai is a missionary av station which re
fuses to lake ihe side of righteous civil gov
ernment and to labor to rid the world of the
i fait and saiaiuc notions of civil government
winch prevail alimmi universally is unworthy
of patronage i to my mind the plainest of
all plain proniuou and just here it is that
i i iah to utter a u ord of complaint
i yourself a word hy the way which no
less applicable to professor whipple i now
know that your vole at the lau election was in

aaaaal meeting of the western n y
aithßamy society
owing to the state of the weather which
waa but a succession of snowstorms daring
the trine of holding it and the indifferenceo
the people this meeting was hot thinly at
tended very few friends from the country
came in aud almost as tew from the city
judging from the numbers in attendance al
that meeting slavery might well console itsell
with the prospect that abolition will soon be
numbered with the ihings that were not
so however when tt is viewed in the light ol
its proceedings they were fully up to th
marksmall in numbers yet large in prince
pies and spirit the highest ground lh
most unpopular and in our judgment th
most impregnable position was almost unani
mously assumed by the society the doc
j trine of vo union with slaveholders sc
far as that doctrine relates to the churches ol
the country met with a cordial and unani
mous support and that relating to the state
was adopted against a few dissenting voices
the speaking on the occasion was for the
most part of a leas formal and some would
sav of a less dignified character than is usual
to such meetings partaking largely of thf
peculiarities of what ate termed in new eng
land free meetings we think this was
upon the whole a pleasing feature of tht
meeting although at times it presented rathei
a ludicrous aspect to the mere cold and indif
lerent observer so free were our friends
i that they wished to have the resolutions of the
society voted up or down by the public at
large without any reference to their view
and sentiments on tlie subject of slavery and
to have the voice of such a meeting regarded
as the voice of the western new york anti
slavery society absurd and unjust as was
this position strange to say it was warmly
 defended by some of the best friends of the
i antislavery cause in this region one whole
precious morning was spent in discussing thii
singular question very much to the regret
and we ntay add disgust of those who hold tc
the right of a society to speak its own views
i without the interference of any to appre
i ciate the absurdity of admitting everybody to
vote on the resolutions presented for the con
sideration of ihe society we have only to
suppose the introduction of a resolution een
i suring those who voted for general taylor
when the audience is mostly made up of taj
lor whigs no resolution could of course bf
i adopted they could lay it on the table
vote for its indefinite postponement and si
i lence all discussion upon it and do so con
 iafptrtly with mmjktm aai ike tanw tiw
meeting it may be said that a decent re
spect for the persons who called the meeting
would prevent opponents of our views fron
taking advantage of the proposed liberality o
allowing them to vote tlie answer to thai
is the liberality that will allow men only k
vote with us when at agreement oui
views is scarcely entitled to the name thf
i right to vote on the proceedings of the meet
ings implies the right to condemn or approvt
any resolution or measure brought foiward bj
the meeting and if it meant anything in this
i it meant that their approval or disapprova
i would be respected as the will of the meeting
in so plain a case it would seem impossible
i that men should err or need arguments t
lead them to the truth but such is not the
case there were those in the meeting whe
 insisted on the right of all to vote in oui
meeting to the last and denounced us as seek
ing to enslave the public because we were ir
favor of having the voting of the society don
j by the society and not by the public for s
time out society possessed all the syroptonu
j of that disease which proved fatal to the exist
ence of the new hampshire antislaverj
society and we were fiarful that its fate
would be similar to the fate of that society
after much discussion reason prevailed and
tlie society was saved from dissolution by
adopting a resolution admitting all persons to
express their opinions on the proceedings bin
that members of the society alone should
vote it is however to be regretted that one
member of the society mr henry bush
should not acquiesce in this sensible arrange
ij ment hut evidently sought to embarrass and
hinder its happy operation when questions
j were submitted to the action of the society
we are glad to add thai but little sympathy
 was shown with him by the audience and
that the society almost unanimously stood fin
the complete integrity of our antislavery
organization we have no doubt that thu
question is completely settled and that the so
eiety will tor the future be conducted with
i that order which shall inspire tlie respect and
secure the confidence of those who would
j make a combined effort for regenerating the
 public mind oo the subject of slavery we
regard the society to be io a much more hope
ful condition than at auy former time and we
have no doubt that it will grow in strength
and usefuloeae the great error of this so
ciety and we may say of our societies gener
ally has been the laxity of its organization
the lines between us and the j noslavery
community have not been drawn with duffi
j cieot distinctness and too little importance
has been attached to keeping our organization
period we are scattered and disjointed
and have been almost without a tangible form
we believe if ever tbeie was a time when
antiatevery organizations were mated it t
j now the interest manifested in the question
of slavery generally so far from being a
son for relaxing oar organizations a reason
for continuing them in all their exaetaem
this general interest w but a result of the
efforts of the early antislavery societies
and can only be sustained by the very efforts
that brought it into existence
we hope daring the praneel year to see
many antislavery societies formed pee
seaatag all ufa apint and energy of nor early
organizations white theta is a dayman inn to

our readers hare already seen the names ol
the speakm and will observe that our friend
and the friend of mao rev s j may wai
oot among the number to the deep regret
of all his duties at home prevented bis at
tendance his presence and counsel at the
meeting would have added greyly nlt
est of the occasion and strengthened the
bands of the few faithful laborers in thia re
gion the preoeoee of our valued friend a
h francis of buffalo was gratefo to the
feelings of the friends of the slave and ser
viceable to the cause among those whose
speeches served to awaken a deep interest in
the meeting j c hathaway was foremost
his speeches on saturday afternoon and sun
day morning were moot powerful efforts well
calculated to rouse the bear la of all to a
deeper interest in the cause and a more de
termined and faithful application of theii
powers to the removal of slavery from the
world we deeply grieved that such speeches
could he poured forth upon comparatively
empty benches in rochester it told a sad
tale for the moral character of the people
that such a meeting could be held and so few
of its inhabitants should attend itr d
the pioueer and herald of freedom
do have patience with us mr biadburn
we shall probably be able see all your nice
distinctions after a while forgive us we
beseech ymi for our stupidity this time and
we will try to have a clearer vision hereafter
dont be in such furious haste in compelling
us to take our place with knaves or fools
let us remain pupils a short time longer ami
it may be that we shall greatly improve uiidet
your tuition let us tell you that we admit
the correctness of vour alleged distinction ol
the potential and the actual and have
gained hy your explanation though we are
sorry to have put you to the painful neces
sity of making it but may wtf ask who
would think of abolishing anything merely
because it is potentially bad l that is pos
sessed the power to do evil we put it to
mi bradburns candor if he thinks that mr
ingalls meant nothing more in his argument
at providence than to show that land monop
oly had the power to do evil we under
stood him to take the ground distinctly that
land monopoly is not only potentially worse
than chattel slavery but actually so and re
member distinctly of his pointing out certain
mitigating circumstances in chattel slavery
such as the interest which masters may be
supposed to feel in keeping their slaves well
fed to keep up and enhance their value
while the rich capitalist was represented as
having no interest in the laborer and would
permit him to starve and die without food
with respect to the charge that we mis
repiesented the speech of mr bradburn on
the constitution of the united states we will
five him tbe benefit of a repablicattan ef bc
heads of that speech in the providence meet
ing as taken down by the secretary of the
meetingwho by the way holds the same
views on the constitution as mr bradbuix
himself in that speech the first position
is that natural justice is only law and nothing
else can be and we may again add that thii
view ran through the whole argument the
ground too was distinctly taken that sla
very being opposed to natural justice we are
bound to put an antislavery construction upon
those clauses of the constitution supposed to
refer to slavery but here is the speech and
our readers can judge as well as ourselves how
far we have misrepresented mr bradburn
f d
geo bradburnl natural justice only
lawnothing else can be  the applica
tion of certain legal rule of interpretation
would make the constitution an antislavery
instrument viz  seek its meaning trom
its own words  when susceptible of two
meanings that must be given which will fa
vor honesty  deny that slavery ever was
legalizedcould not be legalized under the
charters for they contained clauses prohibiting
slavery it is a mistake to suppose that
massachusetts abolished slavery by tlie adop
tion of the constitution it was abolished by
the judiciary the constitution finished the
work perhaps  there is nothing in the
state constitution establishing or legalizing
slavery  the instrument itself art 
sec  not a word in it about slavery
must go out of it this conflicts with the
rule held to service c this is a
legal holding apprentice are thus held
no statute requiring service of a slave ser
vice is not a characteristic of slavery
under the laws thereof everything
called a statute not a law must be according
to the constitution in the other terms sla
very is not clearly meant benj franklin
did not so understand it nor patiick henry
art  sec if this were read by one who
is a stranger to the the country
would he suppose that onesixth of the peo
ple were held as slav no frederick
douglass himself will not admit it other
persons may refer to many other classes than
slaves foreigners ac the word free is
not a correlative of slave it denotes per

sion than one which professes without per
forming the colored people lack confidence
iin the antislavery society because they see
so much more profession than practice if
the free soil party will give them their
rights they will not ask under what name it
lis done  have never voted but twice and
once was for the free soil state ticket at the
last election in massachusetts
my confidence in the system of the no
voters is lessening and i bid godspeed to
any party which will abolish slavery if it
cannot be done in  c wrights way then
let it be done in martin van burens
way lam out of patience with theories
which ve can never carry into practice
ami welcome any means that will abolish sla
very
remond was replied toby several speakers
 and among others that excellent woman and
devoted abolitionist mary grew we scarce
need say that we think her views of the rela
j tions of the colored people to the antislavery
cause the correct one her reply is as fol
i lows
mary grew said that many of the colored
people do sympathize and cooperate with the
antislavery society and so far as they do
not it is for the same reasons that white men
do notbecause they love their ease their
sect or their money better than the cause ot
the slave
the debate was continued by dr bias
j his remarks are not reported but he was
understood to insinuate that the abolitionists
with all their professions were not so superior
to the rest of the community in their treat
ment of the people of color as might be
imagined
the doctor w as replied to by robert purvis
who
thought the accusations and insinuations
made against the abolitionists for their course
toward the people of color were neither just
nor kind however they nfcight be intended
the abolitionists had been the fast friends oi
the colored people from the beginning in
our darkest hour of trial when hunted by the
mob md ftmkra by the civil authorities
and through all our persecutions we have
ever found them true to us men who have
risked reputation property and life even in
our cause have given too good proof of friend
ship for insinuations or unsustained charges to
disprove it such accusations should not be
made without proofs
we shall deeply regret to see the day
when the oppressed shall become the accusers
of the abolitionists with all the imperfec
tions of the latter and they are many we
are under god indebted to them for all the
improvements which have thus far taken place
in our condition as a people this murmur
i ing against the abolitionists is like the mur
murings of the israelites against moses
brethren cease your assaults apon the aboli
tionists and turn your arms against your
foes f d

these lands must soon be made a blessing
to the colored people or they willbecome a
curse we have hoped and expected much
from them as a means of final independence
to a large number of the oppressed and dis
franchised of this slate and have therefore
felt a deep interest in anything that looked
like their speedy and successful occupation by
the grantees the difficulties and hardships
attending the settlement of a new country
always great are greater in respect to the
settlement of these lands the grantees
are for the most part honest and indus
trious but poor men with large families
depending immediately upon their daily toil
for the means of support who can poorly
spare a single day to say nothing of a dollar
with which to get on to those lands the
hardships and difficulties stare them full in
the face the region of country is cold the
summer season is short there is no living
there withdbt houses and fanning utensils
houses cannot be built and farming utensils
obtained without money and this the gran
tees have not got they must have seed
before they can have a harvest and they
must have something upon which to live
while they are plowing and planting and j
otherwise tilling the soil this tiny have
not and therefore cannot emigrate with
safety to these lands hundreds there are i
who wish to go and settle upon those lands
they only need the means of living there one
reasonof making one harvest and all will
be well after that w have every assur
ance that most of the land is of the very best
quality largely fertile and for a new country
of remarkably easy cultivation now we
ask shall this hi rosing be converted into a j
curse merely for the want of a few hundred
dollars to start with  we hope not poor
as we are we will readily pledge ourselves
to raise twentyfive dotlara towards purchas f
ing farming utensils and helping those who j
settle on those lands next spring we i
would further announce that we will receive i
donations from any person in aid of this ob
jret holding ourselves responsible to the

dear douglass since my last i have
held meetings in wilmington delaware fron
which place i wrote west chester pa an
philadelphia at which plaee i was assisted b
lour worthy friend and colaborer wm w
brown the noble fugitive
there are some two thousand of a eplore
population in wilmington all of whom ap
pear to he quite an industrious and laboruq
people but seem not to have been instillei
with the higher incentives of life educa
jtion as heretofore has been greatly neglectet
and probably but little cared for by the colora
people hence the characteristics of the slavi
stand imminently and a stranger passing
through the place might well mistake four
fifths of the colored porsons whom he wouh
see in the streets to be slave but such u
not the case although in a slave state
there are hut few slaves in wilmingtonsince
like in wheeling virginia they have near
all run off and left the place on sundaj
evening while i was there two slaves tool
the underground railroad makiog good theii
escape as i was informed
there are however a large number o
propertyholders among the colored people
many of whom live neat and comfortable if
their own houses indeed i set it down ai
one of the most commendable traits among
them that their honses were both
and internally remarkable for neatness in ap
pearance and fact
there are three schoola for colored children
here where the minor or primary branch
are taught the beat and most interesting of
these schools is taught by mr daniel b an
derson a worthy intelligent pious colored
gentleman who has some forty pupils contin
ually in attendance mr anderson has aa
yet no class aa fir advanced aa grammar and
geography and still uses pikes old arithmetic
in his school these old books were good in
their day but are not now well adapted to the
progressive system of teaching nor the ready
eomprehenamm of the tender mind of youth
i could wish that teachers would abandon
their old style and method of teaching alto
gether sod at ooee adopt the reformed and
approved methods and works it would he
worth the while if every schoolteacher who
is not conversant with new systems would
suspend their schools for a month and give
heir whole attention during that period to
making themselves acquainted with new and
approved met hods mr anderson is a very
uaetul member of society and himself and
frmily are universally respected by all
the next school is taught by a young while
appear to teach for the mlary dm
whatever it may be it cannot be
for anything else since her pupils are defi
cient in the firm evidences of a welltaught
good manners on entering this
tebool i m laughed in the face by all the
pupils and the dam of larger girls seme of
whom were quite in their teem continued
o meet and laugh the teacher paying no at
lontieo whaterm to their cewdoet m ad
nami forward at a somewhat dtadeat man
or inquiring what i wanted my answer
being that i came lo visit the school she
to rood about to bet sent with apparently an
indignant expieeskm upon her rounteoance
on inquiring about the branches taught in the
srbool i was answered quite ahruplr in
deed i had never been so rudely treated by a
female before it was evident that she con
sidered it impudent for a colored person to
visit the school as an inquirer this 
learned afterwards i pity the children taught
in that school by the present preceptresf i
look upon it at present as an academy of
servjpy
the third is an infant school of some 
children taught by an affectionate colored
lady i learned that a fourth was about to be
opened by a mrs shoby
there is an excellent and most interesting
sabbathschool kept in the basement of zion
a church of colored people uoder the whites
the minister in charge is a white man bu
the others are all colored hus sabbath
school numbers from eighty to one hundred
children of both sexes and various vm from
infints to nearlygrown youths and maidens
the teachers are all colored and a better
conducted and more interesting sabbath
school  have seldom visited every sab
bath there is a task assigned to some one of
the pupils lo recite an esea y or portion
orue appropriate beautiful writing and on
this occasion iheday of my visit on entering
the school the duty was being performed by
a youth about sixteen when the whole school
from the least to the greatest sat with the
most listful attention i addressed the school
as i usually do on visiting them and was
fully paid by the countenances of theehtldren
beaming with delight and gratitude indeed
whatever might be the impression created on
a stranger passing through the streets did he
viit this sabbathschool his impression
would at once be changed for here he would
find the concentrated intelligence of the col
ored people as i believe all the children go to
this school and colored persons from all the
different churches teach here there are
four colored churches in wilmington the
african methodist episcopal church zion
african methodist episcopal church union
african methodist church and zion meth
odist church under the whites quite too
many churches for the population in all con
science perhaps the people would be better
with onehalf the number the meetings
after the first night were numerously attended
by a large concourse of anxious inquirers
after truth on the great subject which must
i now be considered the question of the day of
the moral blevation of the colored people by
selfexeri ion ihe last evening in the rev
abram coles church to whom i am indebted
for assisting me the meeting was attended
ftb unusual interest crowds went away
unable lo gain entrance
i am much indebted to mr and mrs an
derson mr hill and lady for kind hospitality
during my stay in wilmington
tuesday and wednesday evenings the
stfi and th i held meetings in west chester
pa which were well attended by both
classes notwithstanding the almost entire
absence of antislavery feeling in the place
the colored people took great interest in the
meetings filling the house at an early hour
this perhaps is attributable to the fact that
mr a i shadd an old and tried fiiend in
the cause of suffering humanity and the ele
vation of his nominally free brethren resides
here whose excellent character must have
exercised a very salutary influence over the
people generally mr shadd is among the
soundest and best minded men in our country
and was among the patriotic few who in 
assembled together in the capacity of a na
tional convention of colored freemen in
philadelphia when s joacelin a tappan
and w garrison being then colonization
ists and visiting this convention were
forced by reason of the talent there displayed
to turn from the ejrror of their way and
embrace the cause of the perishing slave and
american bondmanof god and humanity
i think i am not wrongly advised in the above
allegation at least it is what colored men
generally claim if wrong of comae i will
be kindly corrected
there are several good mechanics in west
f hestpr doing well and a number of good
welldoing farmers in the neighborhood
working their own lands i suppose this
county embraces more farmers among the col
ored people than any other county in penn
sylvania i would that every county through
out the state contained a pro rata of colored
farmers what a different aspect it would
present to the affairs of our brethren in this
slate our people must become mechanic
and farmersproducers instead of consumers
if we ever expect to lie elevated on a level
with those who now predominate and rule
over us

that you may be brought to see your duty
ihe colored people in this place have a
church which by proslavery influence they
were induced to locatethreefouiths of a mils
oat of town this wa mean in the extreme
and in perfect keeping with that misenbli
spirit which ooce obtained everywhere in this
eounuy taking advantage of the poverty and
ignorance of a people if soeh spirits as
reside m the place now had dwelt among them
then such impositions upon them would not
have been practiced
they have also a good daily school here
taught by up amiable and accomplished young
white lady from connecticut this school
promises much uader the proseat teacher
though there are evidences that previous to
her charge there has been much negftet and
undue indulgence on the part of those who
formerly conducted it lam in hopes ti e
intelligent part of the parents will give weekly
attention to this school which is neceemry in
order to do the teacher justice

dear doeolar i have recently attended
quarterly examination of out city high
school ii ha suggested r few thoughts in
regard to prejudice progress see which i
wish to record and which  hope may not be
uninteresting to you or roor readers
among the spectators at the examination
i noticed mrs paulina wright she has
been delivering a course of lectures here to
ladies upon anatomy and physiology and
they are spoken of in high terms ou may
be aware that jno f emerson esq is the
principal of this school he is a true friend
of the antislavery cause in this his amia
able wife is one with him long a witness
of their devotion to that cause i can never
speak of them but with gratiud years
ago they felt themselves obliged for con
science sake to come out of a pi o slavery
church which admitted to its holy communion
those who traded in the bodies and souls of
men a course which exposed them to popular
prejudice subjected theta to the loss of
many old associations and dear friend but
his long experience acknowledgedahility and
deserved reputation as a teacher ijgve enabled
him to retain the place of principal in our
high school
of the original pieces and recitations pte
sented bv the pupils at the examination i will
speak of one because it moved me at the
time it was whittiers poem massachu
setts to virginia written in  during the
latimer excitement it was recited by a lad
georg wing that boy if he lives will
be an altolitionistan advocate of justice
you remember the old dominion had sent
the bloodhounds up to massachusetts around
the hearths and homes nearbunker hill
hunting human freedom amid the graves of
the fathers they had seized latimer and
put him in a boston jail a boston lawyer
was base enough to hire himself attorney to a
virginia slavecatcher the pecple were
deeply excited whittier felt that the very
stones would cry out he spoke in that poem
in language that thrills bne to read it
wliat asks tlie old dominion tf now her sons have
proved
false lo their fathers memoryfalse to die faith
ttiey loved
if she can scoff at freedom and its treat charter
paru
must vvr of massachusetts from truth and duty
turn
we wage no warwe lift no armwe ding no
torch within
the firedamps of the juaking mine beneath your
soil of sin
we leave ye with your bondmen to wrestle while
ye ran
witli the strong upward tendencies and godlike
soul ot man
but for us and for our children lie vow tliat we inve
given i
for freedom and humanity is registered in heaven j
no slavehunt in our borders no pirate oi ourj
strand
no fetters in the bay slate no slave upon our land
these ate but a few lines from the poem
it was refreshing to the heart to hear it
that such pieces are selected for recitation in
our school is significant
thank god in new bedford schools there
is no prejudice against colot tolerated the
pupils white and colored study and recite
together as a consequence a sense of
equality is cultivateda spirit of emulation ia
awakened among all classes side by side
all receive instruction minds and morals ex
pand simultaneously under the generons hand
of culture the great truth that god is the
father of all and has made of one blood all
the nations is early impressed yet in many
towns and cities of new england it is still
thought proper by the wise and prudent 
to prohibit colored youth from enjoying equal
school privileges for several years past in
 the city of boston with its reputation for
wisdom and morality the friends of justice
 have been laboring lo secure for her colored
citizens an equal participation in the advan
i tages of her excellent public schools how
just the demand that industrious upright
i taxpaying citizens should have their children
i enjoy the benefits of those institutions foj
whose support they are equally taxed to
i deprive them of this is unjust to colonize
them into separate schools whether under an
indifferent or superior supervision is both un
j just and insulting
in  the managers of our lyceum es
tabltshed a rule colonizing the colored people
who attended its lectures a large number
of its members rentonsuated against it
j their remonstrance was disregarded and
they withdrew from the institution subee
i quently those managers endeavored to secure
the services of ralph w emerson theodore
parker anti chas sumneramong the jnost
learned eloquent and popular lecturers of
this country each of these gentlemen at
once refused to lecture before an institution
established for the impxovement of the people
i while its managers enforced a rule insulting
and degrading to a large number who so
greatly needed its benefits my heart rever
enced them for such a noble rebuke of the
injustice it has not been forgotten by the
people of new bedford nor without effect
upon them
in  the t lecture association was
formed by those who protested against that
rule of the lyceum managers tbe associa
tion was opened to all equally and unrestrict
edly it i a standing protest against caste
and has been well sustained when i men
tion as among those who have lectured before
itmessrs osgood of providence hale of
new hampshire clark charming garrison
parker phillips and sumner of boston and
weirs of our own city nothing more need
be said of the lecture since the associa
tion was formed the managers of the lyceum
have rescinded tbe unjust rule places of
j popular amusement ard instiucuon are now
i freely open to all among thoee who attend
them none conduct therasehes with meiepro

friend douolass i noticed in the star
of temperance an article headed the bi
hie cause the writer says already 
there has been a general distribution of the 
bible gratuitously to every destitute family iu 
the united states since the commencement j
of lho efforts of the american bible society j
organized some forty years since does the
writer not know k that there are now in the
united states some seven or eight hundred
thousand families who are destitute of the
bible and those who are reputed heathens
too foi the want of that book and a capacity
to read it they are colored people to be
sure but nevertheless they men and
women and have as much need of the bible
as their more fortunate white neighbors if
the bible society spoken of has not offered
this numerous class of destitute fellowcrea
tures ihe scriptures it is a sad commentary on
their fidelity to they k so zealously
espouse this making fish of one and flesh
of another is not exactly the right thing
as thou ait a plain outspoken reformer
would it not be well to remind the editor of
the star of temperance of his great mis
take nnd desire that it may be corrected in
order that the public may become intelligent

northern democracy the mort alarm
ing result of the election of taylor has been
to strike down never to rise again the noble
band of northern democracy who have fought
our battles from the beginning of the slavery
agitation down to the present tuue but they
have fought the last fight for us the south
ern states would not sustain them and they
are henceforth and forever driven by a portion
of the southern people led on by southern
whiggery to take sides in common with all
the northern whigs against us they can
stand upon their feet no longer with success
northern and southern w higgery charging
them from opposite quarters of the union
they are now by the force of circumstances
added to the ranks of northern fanaticism
the whole north is against us this is the
result of the election of taylor and fillmore
by the southern w t higs they have sown
the wind and will reap the whirlwind were
the storm to burst alone upon their own heads
it would be but a just punishment for the
recklessness with which they have acted
but we all embarked in the same bottom
all that we can do is to hold the pilots wht
have steered the ship into this stormy sea tc

gradual emancipation in kentucky
the georgetown kv herald says that a
paper entitled the chronicle will soon be
established in louisville by john c noble
with a view to oppose any form of emancipa
tion whatsoever the courier of that place 
has already taken ground in favor of emanci
pation and it is supposed that after the elec
lion the journal and the democrat there will
take similar ground some other papers the
herald learns in kentucky will come out for
emancipation when the presidential question
shall have been settled
an old citizen of kentucky writing to us
a few days since remarked if we fail to
secure emancipation i and a good many of my
friends will pull up stakes and leave old ken
tucky to her thraldom
we have no doubt that should the decision
of the convention be against emancipation in
any form kentucky will lose multitudes of
her best citizeos who now linger by their
homesteads in the hope that a better lay is
dawning national era

several wounded the town of yellvill in
marion county arkansas on last monday
week says the bateville eagle was the
scene of one of the most frightful and dis
graceful rencontres that we have ever
known
we would premise that for many years
there has been waged between the turn and i
their friends on the one part and the everetts
and their friends on the other a most deadly
feud the war between the montagues and
capulets did not begin toequalit
it seems that a man named mooney who
belongs to the everett wing was badly
beaten some three or four weeks sityec and
that the everetts and mooney got up a kind
of agreement among themselves by which
they and their adherents formed thetnvelves
into a regulating party and had declared that
the kings shelt williams and mampton
tutt must leave the country
on monday they ail met at yellville
hampton tutt has a store there and was
prudent enough to keep out the way he
knew r that a row would be raised and that
they would if possible kill him jesse tur
ner esq spoke there that day and after
the speaking the two parties armed to the
teeth had some words and drew up in bat
tle arraybut the matter was quieted and no
outbreak took place towards evening and
when the people had pretty generally left for
home the fight commenced a man by the
name of watkins of the everett party shot
down jack king at the same time sim
everett fired at sinclair and missed him
sinclair returned this shot and mortally
wounded everett kings brother was shot
at by bartlett everett the ball grazing bis
shoulder he in turn shot bart everett dead
in his tracks after sim evereit was shot
he gathered a rock and pursued sinclair
but finding king who had been shot in the
beginning of the fight he turned on him
and mashed his skull in a snocking manner
and expired while in tbe ac t king lived
watkinswas badly beaten he was taken
into custody but made his escape that night
it is to be hoped that the people of marion
will unite in putting down these deeds of
blood we fear however that the matter is
not at an end

recognition of the liberian
republic
il seems that president roberts failed
to induce our government to recognise
the liberian republic but he has
been more fortunate with england and
france tbe government of which
countries have promptly and cordially
extended to the new republic the
courteay of a recognition roth gov
ernments too have issued orders to
the commanders of their respective
squadrons on tbe coast of africa to
place a certain number of vessels when
necessary at the disposal of president
roberts in any efficient effort against
the slavetrade mr roberts is now
engaged in negotiating a treaty ol
commerce with the british government
a correspondent of the colonization
herald writing from london october
fkh says
he showed to mr george thorop
son and me last night the draft of the
treaty in the handwriting of mr la
bouchere the president of the board
of trade the treaty is a most liberal
one based on perfect equality and re
ciprocity between the two states great
j britain and liberia
mr roberts thinks in a very few
days more this treaty will be signed
sealed and delivered also and then he
i will be ready to go back to liberia
having succeeded entirely in the ac
complishment of the objects which
brought him to europe
our government under the influence
of the violent slaveholders has stub
bornlyrefused to recognize haiti and
thus severely injured the flourishing
commerce we once carried on with that
republic under the same influence
it seems it refuses to recognize the
republic of liberia
this is reall too contemptible for a
government that has any pretensions
to common intelligence it is paying
rather too much to gratily they color
phobia of a few fanatics jvat era
i
such is american honor such is
american faith hen prisca jides
alas for what in times gone by has
been called national faith but do you
reply that the american faith was ever
pledged to either haiti or liberia and
therefore it can not have been broken
it was most solemnly plighted before
high heaven and universal humanity
on the th day of july t while
haiti was in chains which she has since
broken with as much justice on her
side as these colonies could plead
and with infinitely more of motive than
they could urge or feel for america
than declared all men free and made
equal justice the basis of her defense
and of her rights and the oppressions
they suffered though real and deserv
ing of prompt redress by the mother
country were gossamer to cable
in the comparison with those that haiti
ens were enduring from their palefaced
tyrants yet though haiti sundered
the chains which bound her only some
few years later america refused and
still refuses to recognize her as a sister
republic
and now mark the still more clarion
dishonor and breach of phghtea faith
j in her late refusal to acknowledge the
independence of liberia for she has
given to the emigrants to that colony
encouragement that if they would leave
their american birthplace and plant
themselves on the coast of africa
there they should enjoy all the rights of
freemen which should not be allowed
them here on this pledge they went
and there suffered and many died
i that a remnant might be saved and pos
sess as other men the liberties that
i all mankind hold dearer than life they
duly organized acivil government of
jtheir own after some thirty years of
i vassalage under american rule and
pretended protection and then they
send their chosen chief to claim of their
parent government no more than a ful
filment of that pledge but they are
i repulsed with scorn and are aban
doned in their weakness to self protec
i tion and are denied even a commercial
i treaty infamous as is this conduct of
lour government it is very far from
being unexpected fry us from the
year  we have prophecied this
result for we saw the insincerity of
colonization pretensions of friendship
for the colored racewe saw that
they were deceived into a hope of be
coming a free people by going to afri
ca in order that they might be per
suaded to separate themselves as
otherwise they could not have been
from their suffering brethren left behind
in american slavery a safer posses
sion of their avaricious and cruel op
pressors the cry of colonize
colonize went through this hypo
critical land colonize and be a
free and enlightened and happy people
in africa henry clay stood for
years at the head of that hollowheart
ed pretender to philanthropy the
colonization society and gave the
influence of his name to the fraud
what twenty years ago we believed
now we know and now we confident
ly anticipate the continuation of the
same process of deception so long as
it will be of any avail in persuading
the free colored people to emigrate j
though il must be done in the very
face of this fact of fraud there are
yet colonizationists even at the

immediate adoption of the resolutions
mr calhoun approved of mr baylys
resolutions but coincided generally in
the propriety of the reference proposed
by mr stephens he made one of his
most eloquent and able speeches on the
subject moderate for him containing
nothing intended to excite the south
and but little perhaps which might be
calculated to produce such a result
the meeting was very orderly very
little excitement was manifestedand
even the ultras were quite moderate in
the expression of their sentiments the
remarks of gen rusk senator from
texaslike those of mr calhoun
were listened to with the most profound
attention
mr westcott advocated the adop
tion of mr baylys resolutions and of
his proposed addressconfined to a
historical detail of the aggressions upon
the south
others advocated the reference ol
the resolutions as proposed by mr
stephens on the ground that if the
action of congress at this session con
summated what was proposed hy the
opponents of the south more cogent
and efficacious and direct measures
should be taken by the representatives
of the southern states here but this
was not as will be perceived by the

a visit to abdelkadar
the tribune of the gironde gives
the following interesting particulars of
abdelkader and his family thanks
to the friendly interference of the offi
cer who has wholy devoted himself to
the noble mission of alleviating the ex
ile of this great fallen one we obtained
the favor of a private audience we
found the emir seated on his bed on
our entrance he immediately rose and
squeezed our hands with warmth and
dignity his stature is above the av
erage his white woolen clothes exhibit
in fine relief his superb face which is
adorned with a long black beard nis
white hands are perfectly shaped and
his feet seemed surprised to feel the
softness of the carpets after having
been so long accustomed to tread the
sand since i have confided myself
to the honor of the french remarked
the emir  have not had occasion to
repent a single moment and  can well
understand that weighty reasons at
present prevent the realization of my
wish to live and die at mecca i
will wait here his fine black eyes
the expression of which is at once mel
ancholy and proud became suddenly
animated and darted lighteningone
word had elecrified himand that word
was uttered by a female voice abd
elkader looked sublime he soon
however recovered his habitual expres
sion of gravity and only spoke to us of
the fatigues of his journey and the un
certainty of his present position the
women forming the family of the emir
are lodged in a suit of three rooms join
ing his own apartment his mother
inhabits tbe most distant she is a wo
man of  years of age with a sad and
dejected mien but her eyes sparkle oc
casionally like those of her son she
was indisposed when we visited her
and was reclining on a mattress be
fore an immense brasier surrounded
by young black and white female at
tendants who appeared to serve her
with great seal ami attachment in the
second room were the three colored
wives of abdelkader on their mat
tresses with their children in their arms
the faces of tbe latter are very pretty
their beads are entirely shaved they
say bon jour and shaly bands very
willingly the women are all habited
in white rolls sort of kmw gown and
and double tunica of rnuslm or doth

which reach fas low as their shoulders

here we found the white wife of the
emir on a sofa watching over her chil
dren at play she is about  yean
old and her face is handsome am
though the expression be somewhat se
vere it is by no means bad her white
garments are finer and neater that

a good anecdote a tcorrespon
dent of the troy budget tells the fol
lowing good story
it seems that the person who blows
the bellows of the organ at st lukes
church also attends to the furnace for
warming the building and having oc
casion during service to mind the
fires he left the bellows in charge oi
a coachman lately imported and green
as the emerald isle of his nativity be

directed to furnish the organic element
a short time elapsed but no music
followed the touch of the lady who
presided at the instrument blow
whispered the fair organist blow
repeated the leader and blow blast
you blew echoed the entire choir
but not a puff found its way into the
vacant pipes to wake the slumbering
harmony an investigation now took
place and patrick was found behind
the orgauwith both his hands tightly
clenched around the bellowshandle
a stick of some five feet long and two
inches thick the end stuck in his
mouth his cheeks swelled to the utmost
expansion his eyes distended and the
perspiration streaming from his face
engaged in the vigorous but vain at

pores of the wood into the body of the

that some little time passed before the

a quaint but witty english witei

girls hold up your heads the ques
tion whether woman is intellectnally equal
w ith the lords of creation has often been
mooted but never authoritatively settled
most men we believe regard woman as a
mere satellite a plaything an ornament
anything in short but a being possessing
equal rights with themselves to explore the
field of science to form opinions for herself
on every moral and social question and to
act upon those opinions without saying by
your leave sir whatever differences of
opinion this subject may provoke there is
one proposition the verity of which may be
assumed as selfevident and that is that
woman has the right to a complete development
of her intellectual powers such as they are
even though such development should furnish
evidence of her entire equality with the
stronger sex this truth so recently dis
covered is beginning to exert an influence
upon our plans of female education it is no
longer thought sufficient that a woman should
be barely able to read and write and possess
a little smattering of arithmetic geography
and grammar something more than this is
regarded as desirable and necessary to tbe
complete development of her powers some
of our schools for females are doing a work
the influence of which will be felt in after
generations and among them is the brooklyn
n y female academy in an account
of the recent examination of the graduating
class the n y evangelist says
rev w b lewis in reporting on the
examination of the young ladies in natural
theology intellectual philosophy mora
philosophy the evidences of christianity
butlers analogy and the elements of criti
cism says the mode of examination was such
is to test in the most thorough manner the
acquaintance of tbe pupil with the subject
neither the principal nor the committee
who participated freely in tbe examination
were confined to the order of the textbook
nor indeed to the textbook itselfthe object
being to ascertain the degree of mastery
attained in tlie science and profound and
discriminating as are the topics involved we
must record it as in our view their just meed
of praisethe class acquitted themselves well
nor do we fear a comparison of the days
work with one where the other sex should
have figured we speak what we do know
w ben we say that not every class of senior
sophister in college on the eve of gradua
tion does better justice to tbeee subjects and
if tbe examination conducted under our eye
be taken as a specimen of the whole there
are young ladies who according to their
advantages deserve as well to commence this
day maids or aet as does many a young
gentleman on commeoeement day to be ad
mitted bachelor
