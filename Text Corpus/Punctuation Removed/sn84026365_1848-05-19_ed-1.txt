the senateaprii 
protection of property in the dis
trict of columbia
continued
mr west coll l should like to know
of the senator from new hampshire
if he can say that any nonslaveholding
state in this union has passed a law by
which in case of the abduction of a
slave by an abolition mobthe country or
town is to be made responsible for the
act
mr hale l do not know sir
mr ivcstcolt lt is time enough
then when such a law is passed to
protect the property of slaveowners
to talk of a law to indemnify for the
destruction of property of abolition in
cendiaries
mr foote the senator seemed to
suppose that i wished to decoy him to
the state of mississippi i have at
tempted no such thing  have thought
of no such tiling j have only chal
lenged him to present himself there o
anywhere uttering such language anti
breathing such an incendiary spirit a
he has manifested in this body aud j
have said that just punishment woulc
be indicted upon him for his enormous
criminality  have said further that i
necessary i yvould aid in the inflictiot
of that punishment my opinion is
that enlightened rnen would sanctioi
that punishment but says the sena
tor that would be assassination
think not lam sure that the scnatoi
is an enemy to the constitution of hi
country an enemy to one of the insti
tutions of his country which is sol
cinnly guaranteed by the organic lav
of the land aud in so for he is a law
less person lam sure it he would g
to the state of mississippi or any othei
slave state of this confederacy ant
utter such language he would justly
be regarded as an incendiary in hear
and in fact and as such guilty of ar
attempt to involve the south in blood
shed violence and desolation and il
the arm of the law happened to be toe
short or the spirit of the law too slum
berous i have declared that the duty
of the people whose rights were thus
put in danger would he to inflict sum
mary punishment on the offender but
says the senator victim have been
made and there arc other victims
ready  am sure that he could nol
persuade me that he would ever be a
victim  have never deplored the
death of such victims and  never shall
deplore it such officious intermeddling
deserves its fate i believe that nc
good tnan who is not a maniac as the
senator from new hampshire is appre
hended to be can have any sympathy
for those who lawlessly interfere w it
the rights of others he however
will never he a victim he is one oi
those gusty disclaimers a windy speak
era
mr crittenden if the gehtlcmar
will allow me i rise to a question o
order gentlemen have evidently be
come excited and  hear on all sidei
language that is not becoming i cal
the gentleman to order for his persona
reference to the senator from nev
hampshire
mr footel only said in reply to th
remarks of the senator from new
hampsnire
mr crittenden i did not hear whal
the gentleman from new hampshire
said but the allusion of the gentleman
from mississippi i consider to be con
trary to the rules of the senate
mr foote l am aware ol that bul
such a scene has never occurred in the
senate such a deadly assailment oi
the rights of the country
the north star
mr johnson of md has the chai
decided
j mr foote let my words be takei
down
the presiding officer in tse opinioi
of the chair the gentleman from miss
issippi is not in order
mr foote what portion of mr re
marks is not in order
the presiding officer the gentle
man is aw are that the question of ordei
is not debatable
mr ffestcott l ask whether tht
words objected to are not according
to the rule to be reduced to writing
mr foote l pass it over but the
senator from new hampshire has said
that if i would visit that state i wouli
be treated to an argument why j
would not argue with him what righl
have they of new hampshire to argue
upon the point it is not a mattei
w ith which they gtand in the least con
nected they have no rights of pro
perty of this description and i rejoice
to he able to say that a large propor
tion of the intelligent and patriotic peo
ple of new hampshire do not concur in
the views expressed by the senator this
morning they take the ground thal
the people of the united states the
constitution and the union have guar
anteed the rights of the south con
nected with this property and that the
people of new hampshire have nc
right at all to meddle w ith the subject
why is it not a fact that gentlemen
members of this body among them the
distinguished senator from massachu
setts whom i regret not to see in his
place arc known to be more or less
hostile to the institutions of domestic
slavery but have never entertained the
doctrine that the congress of the uni
ted states had any jurisdiction what
ever over the subject they have
held that any attempt directly or indi
rectly to effect abolition or to encour
age abolition by congressional legisla
tion is at war with the spirit and letter
of the constitution
mr halt will the senator allow
me to inquire if he can point out o
single instance in which  have made
any aggression upon the rights of pro
perty in the south
mr foote that is the very thing i
am about to show hen the senator
from new hampshire undertakes to
assert that those northern men who do
not concur with him are cravens he
uses language of false and scurrillous im
port it is not the fact that his lan
guage will be reechoed in any respect
able neighborhood in new england
his sentiments will find no response or
approvals any enlightened vicinage in
new r hhqpgnd and therefore he has no
right to say that those who are piithful
to the principles of the constitution and
foil to reechothe fierce fanatical and
factious declarations of the senator are
cravens in heart and deficient in any
of the noble sentiments which charac
terize highspirited republicans
mr halel did not use such lan
guage
mr foote did the senator not use
the word craven
mr hale lf the senator will allow
me i will inform him that when the
senator from south carolina remarked
that he supposed it was thought that the
south had lost all feeling i replied by
asking if it was supposed that the north
had no sensibilitythat we had bowed
our faces to the earth with our bucks
to the sail and submitted to the lash so
long that we dare not look up
mr foote the declarations of the
senator from new hampshire just
amount to this that if he ruet me on the
highway and addressed me gravely or
humorouslyfor he is quite a humorous
personageshould say i design to take
that horse which is now in your pos
session aud then announce that he
wishes to enter iuto an argument with
me as to whether i should prefer that
the animal should be stolen from the
stable or taken from me on the road
how could  meet such a proposi
tion by i should say to him either
you are a maniac or if sane you are a
knave and yet this very case is now
before us  he senator from new
hampshire introduced a bill obviously
intended to rob the people of the dis
trict of their sluves i will read and
show that such is the import of the bill
i do not know anything about the paper
to which reference has been made it
has been sent to me as to other sena
tors during the winter hut  always re
frain from opening it the editor of it
may be an intelligent man i have
heard that he is he is certainly an
abolitionist it may be that lie has not
in his paper openly avowed as the
senator from new hampshire seems
very plainly to indicate that lie has
approved of the late attempt to gteal
the slaves from the district but the
publication of such a paper has tended
to encourage such movements
mr hale hen did  avow that i
approved of this movement
mr foote l will show it f ro m this
hill i challenge the senator to pro
duce any such statute from the statute
book of any state of this union
mr halt l have said that the bill
is in substance identical with one of
the statutes of the state of maryland
 have that statutebook before me and
will hand it to the senator
mr johnson of maryland allow
me to see it
mr footeh ow are we to under
stand the senator he will not ac
knowledge that his object is to encour
age such conduct and he shuns the re
sponsibility when we charge upon
him that he himself has breathed in the
course of his harangue this morning
the same spirit which has characterised
this act he says most mildly and quiet
ly by no means i have only at
tempted to introduce a bill correspond
ing substantially with the law on the
right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren
statutebook of most of the states of
ous confederacy and the senator
supposes that all of us are perfectly de
mented or do not know the nature of
the case the circumstances or the
motives which have actuated the sena
tor will he undertake to assert that
he woulb ever have thought of such a
bill if these slaves had not been ab
ducted from the district in opposition
to the consent of their owners by the
parties engaged in this marauding ex
pedition he cannot deny it and
therefore i am authorized to come
to the conclusion that he introduced the
bill for the purpose of covering and
protecting the act and encourage simi
lar acts in the future what is the
phraseology of the bill the honor
able senator here read the bill who
doubts now that the object of the sena
tor from new hampshire was to secure
the captains of vessels and others en
gaged in any attempts by violence to
capture and steal the slaves of this dis
trict no man can doubt it then i
ask have i used language too harsh
and is it not a fact that the senator is
endeavoring to evade a responsibility
which he is not willing to acknowl
edge
mr hale will the senator give
way for a moment i will read an ex
tract from the law of maryland to which
i referred will the senator be good
enough to look at my bill while 
read
an ad relating to riots
sec  be it enacted by the genj
eral assembly of maryland that from i
the passage of this act if any oounty
or incorporated town or city of this
state any church chapel or convent
any dwellinghouse any house used or
designed by any person or any body
politic or corporate as a place for the
transaction of businessor deposit of pro j
pertyany ship shipyard or lumberyard
stable or other outhouse or
any articles of personal property shall
be injured or destroyed or if any pro
perty therein or thereon shall be taken
away injured or destroyed by any ri
otous or tumultuous assemblage of peo
ple the full amount of the damage shall
be recoverable by the sufferer or suf
ferers by suit at law against the county
tow n or city within w hose jurisdiction
such riot or tumult occurred provided
however that no such liability shall be
incurred by such county incorporated
town or city unless the authorities
thereofshall have had good reason to be
lieve that such riot or tumultuous assem
blage was about to take placeor having
taken place should have had notice of
same in time to prevent said injury or
destruction either by their own police
or with the aid of the citizens of such
county town or city it being the in
tention of this act that no such liability
shall be devolved on such county town
or city unless the authorities thereof
having notice have also the ability of
themselves or w ith their own citizens
to prevent said injury provided fur
ther that in no case shall indemnity be
received where it shall be satisfactorily
proved that the civil authorities there
of have used all reasonable diligence
and all the powers entrusted to them for
the prevention or suppression of gucli
riotous or unlawful assemblies
sec  and be it enacted that in
any suit instituted under this act the
plaintiff or plaintiffs may declare gen
erally and give the special matter in
evidence
the honorable senator will surely
now do me the justice to say that the
bill was not dratted with referenc to any
particular case such as that to which
he refers i had not the remotest re
ference to the protection of individuals
concerned in transactions of that char
acter but if  should undertake to say
that  had no reference to demonstra
tions growing out of this transaction i
should be saying what was false for it
was these demonstrations which in
duced me to introduce the bill
mr foote ln one breath the sena
tor makes two directly contradictory
assertions he says he did not draw
the bill in reference to the bill and in
the same breath declares that he did
he disaiins in one moment that which
he avows in the next lam sorry that
i have occupied the attention of the
senate so long i have felt deeply on
this subject we have witnessed this
morning the first attempt on this floor
to violate the constitutional rights of
the south and i hope it will be the last
 trust that the indignation of the coun
try will be so aroused that even in the
quarter of the couutry from which hei
comes the senator from new hamp
shire although his sensibilities are not
very approachable will be made to feel
ashamed of his conduct
mr mangum lt is now about four
teen years i believe since the senate
very wisely by the concurrence of the
most distinguished men on both sides
came to the resolution to exclude dis
cussion upon the inflaming topic f sla
very and that when abolition petitions
were presented upon the question of
reception a motion should be enter
tained which motioq is not debatable j
and the vote taken upon it to lay the
motion for reception upon the table
thera has been ever since this rule
wgs established a steady and uniform
adherence to it but i am sorry to per
ceive that there is latterly a disposition
manifesting itself to depart fmmthe sa
lutary rule of action which the senate
thus wisely prescribed fur itself upon
this question of slavery we know there
are different opinion entertained in
different quarters of the union i stand
here representing one portion of that
union but i could not if i would bring
myself to a state of excitement and
alarm in consequence of any menaces
that may be thrown out  stand upon
the constitutional compromises and
while would not invade the rights of
rochester n y friday may  
others i am very sore that the bowk
portion of the community will not in
vade our rights why should we
pursue this discussion is it believed
that we are to he reasoned out of our
rights are we te be reasoned out of
oor convictions no sir then why
discuss the subj ct why not stand
upon our rights upon our constitu
tional compromises why not stand
thus perfectly passionless but prepared
to defend them when they shall be as
sailed but are they to be assailed
sir nothing has occurred during this
session that has afforded me more satis
faction than to bear from some of the
ablest and most distinguished men in
this union the declaration that while
they are opposed to the extension of the
area of slavery they are not disposed
to trample upon the compromises of the
constitution this is our strength it
is to be found in the patriotism of those
who love the institutions of our country
better than party i believe the great
body of the people are prepared to
stand upon the compromises of the
constitution it is upon this ground
that i stand content and passionless
and if i know myself i shall continue
to do so sir no good can result from
this discussion  shall vote against
the reception of the bill at this time
and why because i think that the
occasion which is selected for its intro
duction is a very unhappy one it
seems to grow out of the occurrence of
an unwarrantable trespass recently
committed upon the rights of the citi
zens of this district without being di
rected to the prevention of such aggres
sions in future but on the contrary
having for its object the suppression of
the inanifestatioas of the feelings of
indignation which such acts naturally
create we who are the only legisla
tors for the district of columbia are
not informed of their wants and wishes
in regard to legislation upon this sub
ject if the people of this district re
quire any other laws than they already
have for the purpose of protecting their
property against unlawful violence let
them indicate to us their wishes and i
shall be ready to lend a willing ear to
their request and to aid in passing such
a law as in my judgment may be ne
cessary for their protection if on the
other hand the citizens of this district
should require other and more penal
laws for the purpose of protecting their
slave property i shall be as ready to
vote for a bill for that purpose but i
shall never vote for the one nor the
other when i find them pressed for
ward by gentlemen of extreme opinions
gentlemen from remote poitions of
the union having few feelings in com
mon with the citizens of the district
sir upon these subjects i am accusi
torned to look to the silent operation
of the law for the protection of ail our j
rights in the state from which i came
there is no excitement in regard to
these subjects if i know anything ofi
the character of that loyal steady 
fixed and moderate state there is no
state in the union which will hold to
her principles ami her rights with more
firmness than that state but we ap
peal to the silent operation of the law
we know nothing of moblaw or of
lynchlaw we know nothing of ex
cesses of this description although
i have lived to be an old man most of
the time in north carolina i have
never seen anything in that state ap
proximating even to a spirit of popular
tumult
mr foote will the hon senator
allow me to ask him whether in case of
a conspiracy to excite insurrection
among the slaves it would not in his
opinion justify mob proceedings
mr mangum ob my dear sir in
former years we had a compendious
mode of disposing of such cases we
have now a mode equally certain
though not so compendious upon a
matter of that nature we take a strong
ground but i am not driven hastily
into legislation that is proposed by gen
tlemen who entertain extreme opinions
on either side

mr douglass l have listened to this
debate w ith a good deal of interest
but w hile i have seen considerable ex j
citcment exhibited on the part of a few
gentlemen around me i confess that i
have not been able to work myself into
anything like a passion i think that
probably the senator from new hamp
shire has done much to accomplish his
object his bill is a very harmless
thing in itself but being brought for
ward at this time and under the pres
ent circumstances it has created a good
deal of excitement among gentlemen on
this side of the chamber
mr calhoun in his seat not the
billthe occurrence
mr douglass on this occurrence 
desire to say a word in the first place
i must congratulate the senator from
new hampshire on the great triumph
he has achieved he stands very pro
minently before the american people
and is i believe the only man who has
a national nomination or the presi
dency i firmly believe that on this
floor today by tbc aid of the senator
from south carolina and the senators
from mississippi he has more than
doubled his vote al th presidential
election and every man in this cham
ber from a free state knows it i
looked on witi amazement for a tune
te see whether there could be an un
derstanding between the senator from
new hampshire and his southern
friends calculated to give him encour
agement strength and power in the
contest bat i know that those dis
tinguished senators from the south to j
whom i have referred are incapable of
such an undertaking yet i tell them
if they bad gone into a caucus with the
senator from new hampshire and af j
ter a nights study and deliberation had
devised the best means to manufacture
abolitionism and abolition votes in the
north the would have fallen upon pre
cisely the same kind of procedure they
have adopted today a few such ex
citing scenes sufficed to send that sen
ator here i mean no disrespect to him
personally but i say with his senti
ments with his principles he could
never have represented a free state of
this union on this floor but for the aid
of southern speeches it is the
speeches of southern men represent
ing slave states going to an extreme
breathing a fanaticism as wild and
as reckless as that of the senator from
new hampshire which creates aboli
tionism in the north the extremes
meet it is no other than southern
senators acting in concert and yet
without design that produces abolition
mr calhoun does the gentleman
pretend to say that myself and south
ern gentlemen who act with me upon
this occasion are fanatics have we
done anything more thandefend our
rights encroached upon at the north
am  to understand the senator that
wc make abolition votes by defending
our rights if so i thank him for the
information and do not care how many
such votes we make
mr douglass well i will say to
the senator from south carolina and
every other senator from the south
that far be it from me to entertain the
thought that they design to create abo
litionists in the north or elsewhere far
be it from me to impute any such de
sign yet i assert that such is the only
inevitable effect of their conduct
mr calhoun in his seat we are
only defending ourselves
mr douglass no they arc not
defending themselves they suffer
themselves to become excited upon this
questionto discuss it with a degree of
heat and give it an importance which
makes it heard and felt throughout the i
union it is thus that abolition de
rives its vitality my friend from missj
issippi mr foote in his zeal and
excitement this morningmade a remark
in the invitation he extended to the
senator from new hampshire to visit
mississippiw hich is worth ten thousand
votes to the senator and i am confident
the senator would not allow my friend
to retract that remark for ten thousand
votes
mg foote will you allow me
mr fouglass certainly
mr moote if the effect of that
remark will be to give to that senator 
all the abolition votes he is fairly enti
tled to them had the senator from
illinois lived where i have resided
had seen insurrection exhibiting its
fiery front in the midst of the mcnj
women and children of the community
had he reason to believe that the
machinery of insurrection was at such
time in readiness for purposes of the
most deadly character involving life
and that dearer than life to every
southern manhad he witnessed suclij
scenes and believed that movements
like that of this morning were calcu
lated to engender feelings out of
which are to arise fire blood and des
elation the destruction finally of the
south he would regard himself as a
traitor to the best sentiments of the hu
man heart if he did not speak out the
language of manly denunciation i can
use no other language i cannot butj
repeat my conviction that any man who
dares to utter such sentiments as those
of the senator from new hampshire
and attempts to act them out anywhere j
in the sunny south will meet death
upon the scaffold and deserve it
mr douglass i must again con
gratulate the senator from new hamp
shire on the accession of five thousand
votes sir ido not blame the senator
from mississippi for being indignant at
any man from any portion of the unt
ion who would produce an incendiary
excitement who would kindle the flame j
of civil war who would incite a negro
insurrection hazarding the life of any
man in the southern states the sen
ator has i am aware reason to feel
deeply on this subject but lam not al
together unacquainted with the peculiar
circumstances of the sections of the
country to which he has alluded 
have lived a good portion of my life
upon the immediate borders of a slave
state i have seen the operation of
such excitements as those of which he
speaks upon both sides of the line i
can well appreciate the excited feel
ing with which gentlemen in the south
must regard any agitating movement to
get up insurrections among their negro
servants
mr doris of mississippi l do not
wish to be considered as participating
in the feeling to which the senator al
ludes i have no fear of insurrection
no more than i have of my cattle i
do not dread such incendiaries our
slaves are happy and contented they
sustain the happiest relation that labor
can sustain to capital ii is a paternal
institution they are rendered mis
erable only by the unwarrantable inter
ference of those who know nothing
about that with which they meddle 
rest this case in no fear of insurrection
and i wish it to be distinctly understood
that we are able to take care of our
selves and to punish ail iaceudiaries
it was the insult offered the institutions
which we have inherited that provoked
my indignation
mr fools will the honorable sen
ator allow me to fiake a remark
mr douglass with a great deal of
pleasure
mr fools lf it be understood that
i expressed may fear of insurrection
which might grow out of this movement
it is a mistake x said that such an au
dacious movement as this could not be
tamely submitted to without encouraging
ita authors to proceed and in that i
think all who have spoken on this side
 of the chamber conear
mr dmti of mississippi l did net
intend to imply that my colleague hac
taken any such course as that which 
disclaimed
mr dong lasta that i intended to sa
was that the effect of this excitement
of all these harsh expressions wil
be the creation of abolitionists at the
north
mr foots the more the better
mr douglass the gentleman mn
think so but some of us at the nortb
do not concur with him in that opinion
ofcourse the senator from new hamp
shire will agree with me because he
can fan the dame of excitement so as tc
advance his political prospects and i
can also well understand how some geit
i tiemen at the south may quite compla
cently regard all this excitementif they
can persuade their constituents to be
lieve that the institution of slavery rests
upon theishoulders that they are the
men who meet the goliath of the north
in this great contest nbout abolition it
gives them strength at home but we
of the north who have no sympathy
with abolitionists desire no such ex
citements
mr calhoun l must really object
to the remarks of the senator wc
are merely defending our rights sup
pose that we defend them in strong
language have we not a right to do so
surely the senator cannot mean to im
pute to us the motives of low ambition
he cannot realize our position foi
myself and i presume i may speak for
those who act with me we place this
question upon high and exalted grounds
long as he may have lived in the
neighborhood of slaveholding states he
cannot have realized anything on the
subject i must object entirely to his
course and say that it is at least as of
fensive as that of the senator from new
hampshire
mr davis of massachusetts l wish
before the vote is taken to say a word
or two for the purpose of placing my
self right with regard to this matter 
am not very apt to be carried away by
any of the excitements that sometimes
have existence in this chamber and 
cannot say at this moment that  parti
cipate at all in the excitement which
seems to exist in the minds of manv
gentlemen here what is the question
that is presented for this body to decide
a stranger coining info this chamber
would suppose that had some meas
ure under consideration which con
cerned the deepest interests of slavery
that we were about to pass judgment
upon some question affecting that great
interest that we were about to legis
late upon the subject in some way that
would affect it in a manner injurious to
the rights of those who own property ot
this description now i think whoever
has listened to the reading of this bill
must he satisfied that there is no such
thing contained in it if i understand
it it proposes nothing which has any
special reference under any construc
tion that can be given to it to that par
ticular description of property we
have laws which make municipal cor
porations liable for damages done to
property by popular tumults where
such corporation is remiss in its duty in
enforcing order and obedience to the
law if i understand the proposition ol
the honorable senator from n hamp
shire he intends nothing more than to
give security to property he pro
poses nothing beyond this this is the
whole matter under consideration hut
gentlemen say this is an unpropiti us
moment to introduce a question of this
sort and why unpropitious because
if i understand them rightlyand i
learn the fact lor the first timea mob
has assailed the office of a newspaper
in this city and has rendered it unin
habitable well how does this con
nect itself with the subject of slavery
why it is said that from this office u
newspaper issues which is called an
aboliton paper suppose all this to he
true it is added by the senator from
new hampshire that the paper is con
ducted in a temperate maimer that it
employs temperate language address
es itself to the reason and understand
ing of the public and that no complaint
has been made against it by the public
well how far this inobocratic spirit is
to be attributed to another event which
has happened in this district is not for
me to say some gentlemen seem to
suppose that it has some connection
with it if it has lam unable to see
it the senator from new hampshire
then introduces a measure and pro
poses to make the corporation liable for
the damages committed in case they
ref usd to do their duty and enforce the
law well such a law exists in many
of the slates but it is said that this is
a very peculiar state of things here
was an abolition press at work in this
building let me ask gentlemen
w bet her they propose to stop the opera
tions of the press whether in other
words they propose to take away fr cu
it its freedom it seems to me that we
might learn a lesson if we wom from
what is going on cm the other side of
the atlantic the agitation of this
question alone the freedom of the
press has overthrown many of the
thrones of europe
do yon not propose by measures of
violence or by any other uwde to put
an end to the discussion of the suject
either by speeches or through the me
dium of the press whoever under
takes a work of this description has
got an herculewo task upon his bands
a task which he will find himself wholly
incompetent to accomplish wellwhy
is it that the senate flies in the face of
this mease re and objects to its recap
tion and  pet it to the calm consid
eration of the senator from south car
olina and those who think with him
whether the iafrrtac i hut mads will
william c sell rmiilil
john dlt k rmm
whole no
nollt mit ihrt ugh at tlwcoumry
t n ht lhr ii will not t considered
evcrjwbett au assault upon the liberty
ot the press and of rpoeth whether
rt will not lc irrcsitible and whether if
jii not imkc a lasting impression upon
i tl üb j flank the petpla
will reason in this way upon the fub
iect and that they will hold cut os
as the duty ot this body lo taka lit
subject into consideration fceid it to
a committee let it be examined and
not presumed as the honorable senator
from south carolina does that because
its provisions do not cover the whole
subject it cannot be made to cover the
whole it it d es not auswer the views
fhe gentleman it can be made to do
so then why fly iu its face why
take this very unusal course of re
fusing to receive the measure at all
simply because by construction
and infeience it is supposed to have
some connection with the question of
slavery now is this wise is it pru
dent does it best accomplish the
object which gentlencn have in new
w hich is to protect this kind of propeity i
i have ever been one of that class of
persons who have at all times con side r
ed themselves bound by the terms of
the constitution on this subject and
have stood ready to support the guar
antces contained in that instrumont
but nt the same time i must confess
that i thought the honorable senator
from illinois in the remarks which he
j made here uttered a great deal of
wholesome truth  thought he admin
istered some wise and prudent aud
salutary udmouitious iu those re
marks worthy of tbe consideration of
all parties here and i hope they will
have their effect i hope a little reflec
tion a little consideration will iuduco
gentlemen to change the course thev
have adopted on this subject and to
permit this measure to take the usual
course of legislation suppose we do
come to a discussion on the question
where let me ask gentlemen is the
harm of discussion why gentlemen
ask what right have you to discuss
our rights of property in slaves by
what authority do you claim the privi
lege of inquiring into this u utter sir
we may have no right to disturb thin
light of property we may have no
right to ulicct the title to it iu any way
no such rights may be claimed nev
ertheless no one will deny to any citi
zen the right to discuss the character of
property ot this kind and the efleet laws
have upon such property who deifies
this right and where is it denied it
belongs to freed in of discussion to tba
freedom of speculation which exists in
every free untrammelled mind men
may advance very absurd notionsthey
may reason very preposterously they
may reach very absurd conclusionsbut
while the whole matter lit s in discus
sion very little in my judgment iu
gained by teitiling that discussion in
cendiary in its character wby do
you expect to satisfy tiie public mind
when mankind discusses the question of
slavery however important it may bo
to any portion of this country and ex
press their opinions in rcgoid to it lo
you expect to put them under foot by
saying it is incendiary if any gentle
man butter himscit with hopes aud ex
pectations of this description he is
doomed to be disappointed this dis
cussion will go on aud the way to meet
error is by confronting it with truth
let the discussion go on let it e frre
everywhere my own opinion is that
all considerate minds here and very
whore are entirely deposed to adlitjo
o the guarantees and compromises of
he constitution and instead of being
weakened by discussion they ate at
sven step strengthened they at every
step become firmer and stronger bonds
jf union let no one try ii they can
so suppress discussion lvcry attempt
to stop it will result as in kuiopc in
one general sentiment which will
trample under foot the power that at
tempts to suppress it this w ill be tbs
iflect of such attempts  invite then
my friends to meet this question boldly
and not let this subject go to the public
in the form which it now pics uts it
self as a bill presented hererelating
to nothing hut the protect n of piopcrty
against the violence ot a mob and de
nied admission to this hall and hat fa
de because supposed to have some in
direct connection with the question of
slavery jct us take sir a more
manly view of the subjectone that
accoids better with the thaiacter of
lughmirdod men let it lake its
course here let it go to a committee
let that committee examine it ana if it
docs not from afty cause meet jour
approbation when it conies to be con
sidered then let other measures take
its place let it take its late but
nothing sir is to he gained by this onu
ual course  assure tbe gentlcmcu
who represent tbe slave interest that
instead of gaining they lsc much
rery much
why mr president cannot every
gentleman see and sec plainly that
when the bill comes to be published
when the terms in which it is conceived
come to be read and undcisto  it will
be seen that it is a measure dijhrmg in
no essential material point lr jaws
existing ui many of the free stales aid
free countries everywhere and as a
senator near me says iu some ot the
slave statesfunking corporations un
der certain circumstances liable ft r the
v iokoce of mobs and w hoever take
the ground that th s bill has been
brought inatm uopropitious mom nt
and ibc th l reason denies it admission
as antes s responsibility that he will
rncttmly uk by and by to get rid of
littaf here we to do with the present
ofwmeut sirwith tbe particular and
peculiar circumstances which surround
be question in my judgment nothing
at all i do not undertake to say what
tiic motive were of the senator from
new hampshire in introtilcing tiu
bill it doea not become me to inquire
into them it iii enough for mo to know
that if the printing office of the union
or national intelligencer wete assailed
and injured bpr a mob that it would be
my duty to inquire bow it happened
and whether further provisions were
required in addition to the present laws
of the district in order to suppress
such disturbances the care and de
liberation  should feel myself bound
under such circumslrnces to exercise
w ith regard to the property of others i
should exercise in this case the
same measure of justice i should mete
out in other eases i would mete out in
this the protection which i would
j feel it my duty to give to the pro
porty of others under all circum
stances i would give in this and il
it turns out that this care is unworthily
tostowed that it docs not demand le
gislation then let it take its destiny
hut this is not theway to deal with it
it docs not in my judgment have the
sanction of deliberation i have al
ways been of the opinion that nothing
has been gained by the opposition tu
tbc introduction of petitions here 
believe if the subject had been left
open and wehad been allowed to go
into the consideration of the subject
gentlemen would have found less ex
citement existing than has been cre
ated hy the opposite course it would
have tended much more strongly in
imy judgment to tranquilize and har
monize the pnbtic mind under all
the circumstances then how are we
to act i think the question is a very
plain one things are brought in and
made to bear strongly on the minds ol
gentlemen which do not belong to this
t question at all i shall vote for the
reception of the hill in order that it
may take the usual course of legisla
tion
mr crittenden what is the motion
pending
f the presiding officer the senator
from pennsylvania made a motion to

from south carolina
mr crittenden l intend to renew
that motion i think after the excite
ment we have all witnessed today we
will be better prepared to decide with
the deliberation which usually marks
the proceedings of this body at a future
session i move that we now adjourn
mr benton will the gentleman
withdraw the motion for a moment
ordered that the bill be printed for
the use of the senate
mr johnson of maryland then gave
notice that should the senator from
new hampshire have leave to intro
duce his bill he would move the fol
lowing resolution
resolved that the committee to
whom was referred the bill relating
to riots and unlawful assemblies in the
district of columbia be and they
are hereby instructed to amend the
said bill by inserting a section in the
same for the effectual protection by
penal provisions or otherwise of the
citizens of the district and other

n letcas an attempt has iteen made it
the district of columbia by a large body o
i slaves to obtain their freedom hy tlight bu
unsuccessfully and whereas tliey ucreaidct
in this design to secure liberty for themselvei
and their children by captain jsayres and hn
crew of the schooner pearl of philadelphia
who are now lying in prison in the city o
w ashington to be tried as felons and w hero
as this ooeunrence has caused great excite
incut in i lie district aforesaid and jed to i
fierce debate in the halls ot congress on tin
part of the tsenators and represent
atives in which the conduct of capt sayrei
and his asskiat s has been stigmatized ai
leionious and piratical and every one win
sympathizes with those martyrs branded ai
acteskiry to robliery and outrage there
fie
i resolved that this attempt by the slave
alluded to receives the cordial approbation o
the american antislavery society as it mtis
f ever one vho is not a traitor to his race
and excites the joyful hope that these are bu
drop of a coming shower w high shall covei
the whole southern country
resolved that it is the riplit of the slavi
to escape from big prisonhourc whenever e
favorable opportunity is presented and the
duty of all to hide the outcast and betray noi
hitn that wandereth whatever may be the
consequences
resolved that most deeply do we sympa
thise with the recaptured in view of the dire
ful sufferings to which they will be subjected
by their merciless oppressors but our sorrow
j is greatly assuaged by the firm conviction that
though for the time being they may have
riveted more closely their ow n chains the ef
fect of their laudable example upon die mill
i ions of their brethren in bondage will be to
i inspire them with a determination to be free
and to hasten the day of their deliverance
resolved that apt sayres and his asso
ciates by endeavoring to secure for these
slaves a safe and peaceful mode of escape on
ward the schooner pearl that they might
stand in the enjoyment of freedom under the
british ilag in canada ard not crouch as
beasts under the starspangled banner per
formed a noble and christian act whichis
worthy of constant imitation under favorable
circumstances and that they deserve and
will receive the blessings of those who are
ready to perish and the plaudits of the friends
of freedom universally
resolved that slavery in the district of
columbia from the hour that district was
coded to the united states to the present time
has been illegal and unconstitutional because
the american government is not empowered
to create prolong or tolerate slavcrv in any
territorial possession that every slaveholding
enactment by congress has been an act of
usurpation and is therefore null and void
that every slaveholder in the district s legally
and constitutionally guilty of felony and
therefore that capt sayres has violated no
law of the land in transporting slaves and
passengers from the district in his vessel
resolved that we rejoice to know that the
case of capt sayres and his companions is to
he carried up to the  ssnpreme court by the
friends of constitutional jaw and there vindi
cated as innocent on the ground of the illegal
ity of slavery in the district of columbia
and that court is hereby solemnly admonished
to calculate if it can the consequences that
will follow a decision sentencing those inno
cent and noble men to an imprisonment for
years r
resolved that slaveholders as such can
have no rights that ihey have no rightful
evin nec on earth they w ere never treated
by god and constitute no part of be human
race tliev are of monstrous and diabolical ori
gin and no law no constitution no compact
no religion that endorses their humanity is to
be obeyed or tolerated
resolved i hat while we appreciate the
presence of mr jlale in the united states
senate delight in the irankness and seipde
votion of mr palfrey and in the gallantry
courage and boldness of mr ghidings of
ohio on the subject of slavery w hen brought
to the consideration of congress we de
plore the melancholy necessity of their po
sition which obliges them to stop so for
short of w hat the hour and the duty of every
americau citizen requires and we are espe
cially sorry though not surprised that nu n
professing to be abolitionists are found wil
ling  hold up ns the highest representative
of an antislavery political idea one who like
mr hale has never vet avowed himself an
abolitionist w ho indeed has broken no
pledges because he never made any but who
lias avowed no principles upon the subject
more radical than those of the young demo
crats ot new a ork and the oung whigs of
massachusetts and the mass of softspoken
men throughout the union
mexican war
resolved that the man who has borne
arms against mexico is a traitor to humanity
and an enemy of american institutions the
statesman who consents to the acquisition of
an inch of american territory on nnv condition
whatever betrays the right of the north
hough lie hastens that welcome event the
downhill oft uo union and that the aboiition
irl who counts the wilinot proviso as any
thing hut breatha reed set up against the
mississippi  has yet the a li c of his cn
t rprise to learn
resolved that while we bid godspeed to
every movement d signed and calculated to
overthrow every species of oppression whe
ther affecting the interests or rights of white
or black men we must reiterate our convic
tion unified as it i by iminmerahle facte
that the antislavery movement in ihiscountrv
in heighth and depth iu length and breadth
in its promise to r the fut re its conflict with
everything spurious in the church and every
thin corrupt in the state in its tendency to
overleap ail sectarian and political harriers in
cultivating the spirit of universal love in
propagating the worldreconciling doctrine of
human brotherhood i ihe umst radical of all
the reforms of the day and its triumph is
essential to the success of every other
resopvd that tliey who are affirming that
the condition of the white working classes is
more intolerable and more to lie dcplomi than
that of the slave populationthat what they
absurdly call wages slavery is worse than
chattel slaverydo grossly msull the common
t nse of mmkmd betray a lack of knowl
edge or of principle and are not to be trusted
tn the sdvorary of the l f fo
br for w hntever sre the grievances of the
while lalwmg population they b r no com
parison to those under which tlie slaves are
gruityig and it the tree workingmen in the
land art to ady extent deprived of ibmrjustj
rights by bad  gmarion the fault is in great
ct their own because they hold in their
d the political power of the country they
n eresiti and they destroy whercss ihc
dam of tin south are utterly deprived of all
heir rights and are therefore hmerless
resolved that while we would nut throw
i straw in the way of the improvement ami
clkf of th white working claw nor iu any
runner dwounge but or the contrary r t
j then in tlifir efforts warmly rncourags than
 lo throw off any burdens under which they
an iduring we would submit to them the
cituity of their expecting to achieve sorb a
victory for themselves while they scorn and
despise the colored population on aceoent of
their complexion refuse to work with them
n equal terms elevate slaveholders to office
and array themselves against ibe antishivery
movement
resolved that the abolitionists of the coun
try should keep it in constant remembrance
tliat an efficient instrumentality in their hands
is to petition tbe slate legislatures to repeal
ail laws making any opprobrious or unequal
distinction between the inhabitants on account
of their com pitsum or condition and espe
cully to memorialize congress to call a con
vention of the people of the united states in
devise measures for the peaceful dissolutioa of
the union in w hich it is impossible for the
dements of liberty and slavery to coalesce
or tyrants ami freemen to live in peace to
gether
h solved that recognizing as we do with
profound gratitude the wonderful progress of
our cause during the last eighteen years yet
cckisidering the effort made to ooovince the
i community that the ecclesiastical organizations
of ihe country will and can abolish the sys
tem nnd that the political parties are ready
 and able to grapple w ith the evil this society
i feels bound to reiterate its convictions that the
july exodus for the slave out of his house
of bondage is over the ruins of the present
american chutch and the present american
union
resolved that this society takes occasion
i at the first meeting held since the reception of
s the remonstrance addressed by forty thousand
women of scotland to the women of this land
to express its deep gratitude to the friends ol
i justice and liberty in old scotland for this no
i ble effort in behalf of the american slave its
i appreciation of the amount of labor necessary
to embody so imposing a testimony and the
i c ireial joy it feels in know ing that in the dread
struggle waging here against such over
whelming odds we have the sympathy and
help of the abolitionists of scotland fur our
j comfort and encouragement
j resolved that as republicans we are
proud to remember that one of the first acts
of the french people after the achievement ol
l their own liberty was to decree the imme
diate emancipation of the slaves throughout
the republic and we are glad the cause ol
freedom abroad is thus relieved from the
heavy burden which our hypocrisy has laid
upon it and more especially as abolitionists
we rejoice in the noble rebuke of american
i inconsistencyglad that france stands side
j by side with england denmark tunis al
j giers and hungary as a lover of human lib
ertv and that the nation whose earlv strug
i gles lafayette so devotedly aided offers thus
to the world the fullest atonement in its power

i s jocelyn
this society which is composed mostly of
colored people is instituted expressly for the
j management of the underground railroad and
to judge by the results keep its business in
constant activity it employs an ageut whose
whole time is occupied in collecting monies
providing for fugitive slaves when among us
and in forwarding them h places of safety
and in all possible ways promoting the inter
ests of the society according to the report
of this agent read nt the meeting last night
j since october last the society have afforded
 aid to g fugitives whom they have sent to
various places of safety mostly in the united
states we copy a single paragraph
while we cannot but deplore the unfortun
ate issue of the recent attempt to obtain their
rights on the part of a large portion of our
brethren and sisters we would not be discour
aged our rails have not been taken up
while friends and foes were earnestly discus
sing this affair three noblelooking men walk
ed peaceably through the city of washington
on their way from old virginia arrived safely
in new york and are now where their op
pressors will not probably follow them
the meeting was first addressed by wm
blown a fugitive slave in a speech which
was forcible throughout and often rose to
thrilling eloquence rev mr garnet fol
lowed in an address hardly less effective we
venture to say that abler speeches than these
two were made at few if any of the many

meeting for the promotion of educa
tion among c olored children
this meeting took place on monday night
in zion church corner of church and leon
ard streets the election of office bearer
for the society for the ensuing year was the
first business which was gone iuto
i he annual report of the society was next
read which gave a detailed account of the
formation of the institutionits labors and
difficulties in a pecuniary point of view ac
c the report stated that the society had
been formed in july  but from thediffi
culties and prejudices which it had to encoun
ter at the commencement but little good
resulted from their labors during the first
year in the spring of  they had esta
blished w hat they called a high school of edu
cation for colored children but it was now
inijkisrihh lo continue that school on ac
count of the necessary funds not being forth
coming at tbe commencement of the
society they only nuirlered twelve mem
bers now however they could boast of
upwards of one hundred and twelve the
chairman of the meeting the rer mr s
e cornish after the adoption of the report
introduced the rev j w c uenningtoua
man of color to the meeting who moved a
resolution to the effect that the society ought
to endeavor to lay the foundation for esta
blishing norma schools so that the school
masters may be regularly taught for the
office of teachers and thereby make it one of
tlie learned protrusion education said he
u one of the most important and laudable
aiuiumeuta which tbe human tutnd can be
possessed of and why but make public
teachers professor it was at one time a
matter of disputation u liethtr or not a colored
mans head could hold as much knowledge as
would save his soul frn erdrtion these
prejudices had now pasted away and it wm
for hr colored brethren to show in their
turn that they were about as far advanced to
edscaitoa and the science of literature aa their
w bite brethren of this great republic j ip
now high time that we show tlmm that we
can think for oararlve aa well aa they can do
go into all the übmnes connected with the
public maftuuuwa of lb great city and you
will hod but precious few volumes on utm
ture that are tbe prudcclou of americana
all tbe works of mnt have been inujorieo
from the old country so that we have really
ttirraud the abilities of out white lneihrvn
in these state m ton higlys vatm the pee
eof this country deny the aristocracy of
gland for their coercion of the eastern
eathxi while at home they bold a far mere
obnoxious distinction between the mdn of
color and what they have been pleased to
denominate the intelligent whites it i
high time that these distmrtions were sunk in
the abyss of owttioo and there is nothing hot
education that will ever accomplish this end
by the establishment of normal schools it
will also keep out from our ranks adventurers
who in too many instances have much
depreciated the education of our rising genera
tion the revd gentleman concluded bv
moving the adoption of this rmolation which
was seconded by mr charles l reason
and earned unanimously
ir j mccune smith next read the finan
cial report from which it appeared that the
j society w as in the meantime in debt to the
amount of fm he also read a long per
tinent and philosophically got op essay of
j his own regarding the propriety of equal edu
cation to the rich and pom he concluded by
recommending that the society adopt the spirit
j of the essay which was unanimously agreed
to
the rev h  garnet next moved a reso
lution in effect that the greatest amount of
good was to be derived to a community by
educating rich and poor colored and while
in the very same seminaries this age
said he is a revolutionizing age the time
has been when we did not expect to see revo
lutions hut now we expect to see than and
they are daily passing before our eyes and
change after change and revolution after revo

m r delany
the following account of his efforts is copied
from the cincinnati herald we regret that
i his communication did not arrive in season for
this paper it will appear next week
the address of dr mr r delany onq
of the editors of the north star rochester
 a colored man on the subject of slavery on
monday evening last in the sixth congrega
tional church was an extraordinary produc
tion in more than one respect apart from
i its being a well arranged discourse clear dis
tinct and forcible from one of a proscribed
and disfranchised race it was a most bold and
manly denunciation of the religious and politi
cal hypocrisy of the times
he made but a short exordium and plung
ed into the midst of his subject without cir
cumlocution or any labored effort to do the
agreeable from his earnest grave and en
ergetic manner it was evident that he felt the
importance of the work he had to perform
and that he had no time to lose in smoothing
over sentences made up of soft nothings
he began by adverting to the well known
persecutions which arc everyw here through
out our land heaped upoi the african race
the societies uith which he acted had been
charged with irrcligion in that they desecra
ted the christian sabbath by discoursing up
on political and other worldly topics and by
the vending of books and tracts on that holy
day against this charge he defended him
self and associates on the ground that they
held the entire seven days of the week to be
holy on no one of which did they feel them
selves at liberty to think or act irreverently
before god he then examined ihe mode of
sabbath keeping by his professed christian
aecusers the law concerning the sabbath
he said required that no work be performed
on that day hy servants or by the cattle yet
where was the christian that would not har
ness his horse and drive him to church w hile
at the same time liis servants were kept em
ployed in his household duties this was a
clear violation of the very letter of the law
hut to proclaim the glad tidings of peace
on earth and good will towards men either
orally or by books and tracts was not contra
ry to the gospel
it was not uncommon forchristian ministers
so called to teach that slavery isa divine in
stitution and the doctor here named a cata
logue of well known jxipular divines who so
i teach and it was no uncommon thing for a
jiious gentleman or ladp to sell into slavery a
man a woman or a child and deposit the
proceeds into the funds of a tract missionary
or bible society the church lie contended
was antichristian
flic people were not free this charge
was ably sustained hy showing de tail politi
cal rights were vested in  slaveholders
of the south he referred to the fact lhat
pennsylvania disfranchised her  free
persons of color at the dictum of a irpinia
bespoke also of marylands demand upon
new jersey and of kentuckys mandate to
ohio c uli of w hich had been implicitly
obeyed then came a thorough review of
texas annexation in which the power of
southern slaveholder and the servility of
northern politicians were held up in strong
light in this view of the texas business
with its terrible and disgraceful consequences
there was administered a most awfully severe
castigation upon the degenerate character of
americans they weie taunted with the
epithet of cowards for refusing to war with
englandafter the i uke of yvellingtons t hreat
ening speech in parliament and immediately
afterward making an attack upon mexico who
was too feeble to offer them even a decent re
sistance he affirmed that the war was in
stigated for the acquisition of slave territory
at the behest of southern slaveholders
he declared himself opposed to such a gov
ernment and religion as he had described
he would in the language of frederick
douglass welcome the bolt whether from
heaven or llcll that shall strike down and
sever a union that is built upon the liberties
of the people
dp the national reformer of this city
seems to be rather piqued that we did not
give a more extended notice of the french
sympathy meeting probably tome of the
reformers particular friends spoke on the
occasion if is so we were not
aware of it or we should probably have en
deavored as far as our mean ability extends
to have given the world notice of the import
ant occurrence the reformer says
the north star says speaking of the
sympathy meeting it was addressed by

exactly this reminds as of notice we

thing like the follow ing

mr jones and his little son were slightly
scalded by the aocideat no other injury
was sustained by the boat or crew if we
except the iact that several horses on board
together w ill two daves belonging to mr j
were scalded to death
if aid greig aid smith ac do not
object to be likened to the slightly scalded
mr jones and little son and those whom
we called some other do not object
to being likened to the more unfortunate
horses and slaves the north star will be the

we hasten to give our leaders some ac
count of the recent anniversary of ge ameri
ca anti ah very society premising however
that we base little hope of imparting to them
any adequate idea of the thrilling grandeur
of the occasion it must be seen to be felt and
appreciated this annual gathering of free
dom a chosen friends is always a season of
gteat interest to os bat we are free to aay
that this last meeting far transcended any
which we hate heretofore attended on en
tering the tast hall of the broadway taber
nacle and gazing for a moment on the ear
nest multitude who had assembled to bear the
boldest blast of freedom out eye was di
rected to the noble address to american
women signed by forty thoosapd of their
scotch sisters calling upon them in the name
of the allmerciful and everliving god to
exert themselves for the peaceful deliverance
from thraldom of the millions who are at this
hour groaning in cruel bondage upon amer
ican s il this address hung in graceful
festoons from pillar to pillar around the vast
hall leaving still a roll of many fathoms rest
ing on a stand beside a pillar going through
the platform at this stand sat henry c
w right with pen in hand noting the pro
ceedings no doubt preparing a communica
tion to those very noble women abroad whose
free spirit seemed hovering over and around
u  on this occasion bidding us to be firm and
fearless in the great cause we had met to
subserve on the platform there sat a galas v
of light and strength such as is seldom wit
nessed in any meeting for any purpose isaac
t hopper the friend of the fugitive whose
venerable appearance gave the idea that he
was the spiritual father of us all was there
william lloyd garrison the pioneer of the
cause and the president of the society wj
there lucretia mott whose earnest wit
tranquil countenance imparts faith and hope
to all around her was there we must
however hfsten on to name them will be
sufficient charde speare and francis jack

theodore parker rev samuel may of lei
cester wm w brown the fugitive slave
edmund quincy esq charles l remond
abby kelly fosterparker pillsburyand rev
john pierpont of troywere all on the plat
form and were the observed of all observers
wc wish every slaveholder in the land could
have caught a glimpse of those facescould
have looked at the men and the women who
have opened their giant intellect to and
directed their energies against this system of
slavery it would be a lesson even to john
c calhoun
the meeting was called to order by the
president william lloyd garrison who an
nounced that truths might be uttered during
the meeting that would cause the heart of
the toilworn bondman to leap up with joy
and that of his tyrant master to quiver with
fear this was said with an emphasis and
solemnity that stripped the words of all ap j
pearance of declamation and gave them a
place in the consideration of the audience a
moment was now given for any person to offer
prayer which was embraced by rev the
odore parker who addressed the throne of
grace in a most solemn and appropriate
prayer a lesson of scripture bearing
directly on the subject was then read by the
rev samuel j may after which the
treasurers report was read by francis jack
son setting forth the receipts and disburse
ments of the society during the past year
which amounted to nine thousand dollars
the report was adopted the president at
once introduced the rev theodore parker to
the meeting who made a most profound and
impressive speech jle spoke like one ac
quainted with the centre not less than the
circle of things he penetrated the inner
temple of our national heart and exposed to
view the fierce contest going on between
moral purity and moral corruption therein
backing up his theory by the startling de
velopments of our age and nation we ill
not however mar this speech by any attempt
at reporting either his words or ideas a
reporter was present catching the words as
they fell from his lips and our readers shall
have them in all their purity and perfection in
due season mr parker spoke nearly an hour
risingwidening and deepening in interest to the
end the attention to his words was per
fect and the appreciation of his speech was
more discernible in the deep stillness of the
audience than by loud demonstrations of ap
plause
the next speaker was lucretia mott the
general buzz which runs round a gvide con
gregation after being held in breathless atten
tion for an hour died away as she gently
advanced towards the front of the platform
so that when she reached the point from
wbieh she intended to speak all was still and
calm her subject was the progress of re
form to all who have any acquaintance
with this noble woman we need not say a
single word of the excellence of her address
it was one of the most calm clear and hope
ful addresses to which we ever listened we
are confident that not a word was lost there
is in the absence of any great strength in
the voice of mrs mott a wonderful clearness
of utterance and a gentleness of manner
which so completely rivets attention that she
was able to be beard distinctly in all parts of
the halt there was one thing connected
with her speech on the occasion which is s
glorious sign of progress mod that was
the complete absence of all noisy excitement
in the audience indicating feeling on account
of a womans speaking every one seemed
to listen with the attention due to a great
mind sad a pure heart without appearing to
think fur s moment of the sex of the speaker
mrs mott spoke nearly three quarters of an
hoar
at the daw of her speech wendell
phillips esq took the platform and was
hailed by the audience with a shoot of ap
plause such as seldom greets s reformer on
an antislavery platform he is the same
majestic wendell who fur s dozen years has
stood in the vanguard of antislavery speak
ers and principlelpved and admired by all
who stand in the fxwu ranks of libertys ad

sickening what have right and wrong to

decided is whether slavery ought or ought
not to exist if it be right it is of very irttfe
consequence what the coustuutimi rays about
it and if it be wrong all the constitutions
and stipulations in the universe cannot fur
one moment throw around it the merest sha
dow of justice the constitution sanctions
many crimes besides slavery but they are
not a whit less criminal because of that
sanction if those who founded this union
founded it on injustice and rubbery as they
allege who say that it sanctions slavery do
not common sense and common honesty lo
say nothing of any higher motive teach
that we should now at once and forever tern
aside from following in their footsteps to
say that wc are bound to maintain the stipula
tions of the constitution after those stipula
tions havo lux n shown to e both irrational
and unjustifiable is an absurdity which even

right and wrong and apparent insensibility to
the difference between justice and injustice

m hi county convention
the county convention met at the court
house u  oclock a m last satuiday to
nominate a delegate to the national conven
tion to ik held in june to settle the import
ant question now involved in uncertainty who
tho faithful may vote for to be the next presi
dent it is well known that a number of per
sons are talked about as probable nominees
distinguished for sluwholding fighting or
some other high qualification which endears
them to the free christian people of our fa
vored land
 went to the court house just before
noon and found it filled with delegates and
spectators croups of men were talking iu
low earnest voices in various parts of the
room and the names of clay scott and tay
lor could occasionally be heard while such
words as the party expedient avail
able and kindred phrases fell new and then
upon the ear
a committee was chosen to draft resolu
tions and a motion made to adjourn until two
oclock the members from the country
wore many of them opposed to adjournment
wishing to finish their business and return to
their homes before night the city members
and a portion from the country moved there
to it may he by thoughts f gotd dinners
and cozy chats over the desert were for the
adjournment at length a member proposed
a compromise this is a magic word with
good whigs for the embodiment is skilful
iu such matters it was that the convention
adjourn until half past one it was carried
after some little discussion but like more
famous compromises that might be named did
but little good to those who fancied them
selves the gainers those who had good
dinners in waiting at home went and ate them
leisurely to promote digestion and deem
ing it perhaps injurious to exercise too active
ly alter the noonday meal returned to the
court jlonse so tardily that nothing was done
before two oclock and of course the poor
countrymen wended their way home to the
distant parts of the county in daikness and
discomfort however it was for the public
good politicians are used to being taken
in by compromises in other w ays as well as in
this matter of dinners they take it quietly
from habit as one of the necessary ills of the
craft
in the afternoon an informal ballot was cast
for a delegatejust a sort of teejur to know
who was and was not wanted so that the
most available one could be united upon no i
one had a majority but the largest vote was
given for jerome fuller of sweden then
came a real balloting to decide the question 
and hon jerome fuller received nearly two
thirds of the votes he was then voted i
unanimously to be the choice of the conven j
turn and called upon to give bis views as to j
the question who shall be president he was 
greeted with cheers and said that in a few i
words he could speak his ferlii g
he was first of all for henry clay
cheer loud and related wem givl fcr
tbi ho believed gen scott to be an
honor to the country he didnt say why
perhaps because he has been eommanderin
chief of the army in mexico to wage a war
which brother vngs have repeatedly dej
dared to be unjust and unconstitutional per
haps because scott has said that a soldier who
has a conscience of h s own must he a little
beside himself and he thought the sanei
should apply to peruzana and the gen
oral if in the whitehouse would see that i
no such troublesome commodity as a eon
scicneo w as about the premisesand that if i
mr clay was not nominated as he trusted
and believed he would ik lie was icady to
jpjort gen fjeott if he was deemed avail j
able something wxs id too about any j
other man of wjuislie whaeii i
did not clesriy understand the remarks
about gen scott were applauded md be
wem a to say that usdar so awtitturea
whatever should be tote for gee taylor
thu was responded to by enthusiastic cbaers
and for a moment i hoped and thought that
the opposition to taylor had something to do
in be wtiml w ith the deeds of the hireling
murderer perhaps it had but sot much i
fear for not a word said of them the
only reason be gere for his detemuoatiou
w asthat gee taylor was willing to be nom
inated by the national convention but if not
nominated would run independently end in
opposition to the regular nominee thai
was the bead ard front of bis ofleodtng and
nothing appeared to show that if old
zark was willing to work in the traces and
would run well be would receive the support
oy the whigs of munroe countyand why
should be not
he says he is opposed to the mexican war
so does mr clay he fights is it mr clay
doc not for it is not his profession but his
sou has with his approbation he has ex j
pressed the wish that he might slay amex j
icaa if need be in his countrys service 
and made a speech against the war when it
was like shutting the stabledoor after the
steed was stolen gen taylor is a slave
holder so is henry clay gen taylor is a
man of less intellect not veined in the craft
of the politician not skilled in specious com
promising but why compare them both
are bad men both enemies to liberty and
right
three cheers were given for the speech
it was in manner commendable there was
an air of openness about the speaker a some
thing which made one see that he had rich j
gifts and grieve tliat they w ere devoted to so
unsuitable an object as the honoring a man
stealer
five cheers loud long and hearty were
given for henry clay and the convention
soon after adjourned in the best humor ap
parently men worthy in the relations of
lifs goou neighbors kind fathers and hus
bands felt happy that their suppoit was
pledged to a slaveholder

at this late day we are asked what
shall we do how shall wc get rid of
the system we see it is an evil and a
great one but it has existed for two hundred
years now how can we get rid of it
tell us that evils are more easily described
and condemned than removed alas so
they are as the disease that has been per
mitted to grow day after day until it pervades
i the whole system at once is seen the be
i clouded eye and dim out of which looks the
restless and chafed spirit wildly inflamed
extremities hectic ard blotched surface or
 cadaverous tell us that within is sickness
j
i the fair and beautiful body that was is at
tacked nature makes an effort to cast out
the disease gathering up all its energies
from the vitals outward it drives the
shock shakes the system alas if that
effort fails back again is driven life to the
vitals weakened by that struggle disease
rushes forward again for fresh conquests
spreading havoc as it advances unless it is
driven out death is inevitable victory or
death in this extremity help now from
any quarter is welcome who will wait un
til reduced to this strait and so of the
nation with as men say half an eve how
plain to sec this nation is diseased from the
vitals outward through to the extremities
the constitution is mortally affected and in
fected a terrible biliiousness is in the
blood no wonder for ever since it was a
child now these two centuries bom amid
revolution in vigor and of vigorous parents
it disdained the ordinary food of a nations
childhood and inherited a lust for human
flesh to appease it flesh was given and
now to feed to satiate the bloody appetite
and unholy not only is one continent well
 nigh depopulated hunted from one side to
the other to procure the flesh of the negro
j man so savory to its horrible taste but pre
miums are offered for raising victims at home
wise and honorable men have en
gaged are engaged in this breeding of
victims and to improve the quality they mix
in their best blood
oh ye shades of jefferson and madison
jan ye look back from your now places and
see your flesh and blood sold iu the shambles
for more than two hundred years upon
such has it fed heavens who can cal
culate the millions on millions of men women
and children that have been destroyed to

and joys that have been blasted the world
of living souls that have been extinguished
and driven hack to him who put them here
into being in ilia purpose of his omniscience
through those two hundred years whata
fearful accumulation of guilt there
is a day of reckoning coming when the
wrongs of those millions before the eternal 
judge who will render unto men according
to their deeds in the presence of the nations
shall be redressed it is a thouglit worthy
to engage the attention of all men
three millions of victims men women and

if god is really what the apologists of au
i i very make him oat to be shelly was not fat
l out of the way when he said
 j hr name of god
j hu fenced about all crimea with hulincm
still orr ins oer the wsrpulluted wuru
m fur dcdukrttoas watrhwrard
 i was forcibly reminded of this a few days
 since when in conversing with a deacon of the
baptist church in this city be made use of the
i following language there are as many
godly slaveholders as there are that do not
bold slaves and there are more abolitionists
that are infidels than any thing eke lest
 i should forget i took a memorandum qf the
t words of this godly man immediately that
 i might not misquote them if this deacon
correctly states the case who would not choose
to be infidel rather than to be identifiers with the
i godly oppressors i would entei into no de
y i fence of infidelity fur the term is a vague in
definite one and applies to so many classes
j of individuals and actions that we should not
know which to begin at i wish now to take
the words of this deacon for and see
ii what a position it leaves his religion in re
j member that it is not an abolitionist that has
 placed christianity in this position but one of
i christianitys defenders an officer in an influ
h ential churcha northern church  slave
i holders are golly men well then god
i i sanctions the greatest iniquity the snn ever
s j shone upon the sum of all villainies aa
another christian has pronounced it but let
us specify  a men are born free conse
quently if one is made a slave it is an act ol
r piracy or kidnapping or both then the dea
cons god is a kidnapper and a pirate or such
things could not be  godly bigamy is a
oommon thing among slaves not only sanc
tioned but enforced by their  godly masters
 this the deacons god must sanction for
  without it the system could not exist adul
 tery is common among slaves for both
master and servant from it the slaveholders
r not only gratiy themselves but make it a
j source of revenue for themselves large
 sums of money are received not only from the
 hire of prostitutes but fiorn the very children
of the masters who have shrewdly made laws
 for the children to follow the condition of the
mother knowing that if they followed thqcou
dition of the father gradual emancipation
would have been far advanced before this late
day this part the deacons god must sano
i tion for it is one of the safeguards of the
 godly institution then what the deacor
thinks can be called godly are piracy ant
kidnapping bigamy and adultery to say noth
ing of the various other  godly crimes ne
 cessary for the preservation of the system
 these arc the beauties of a religion which ht
 presents for me to become converted to and bt
 saved from damnation by nor does he stof
here infidels oppose all these things he
says yet the infidels will be damned for theii
upbolief now here is an aged deacon
 whose head has grown grey in the service oj
i the chinch making these statements to one
whom he wishes to get religion who with one
spark of humanity would not spurn the offers
f of salvation thus held out at the expense of hu
i i inanity  who would not say to himj
 we prefer hells freedom
to much servitude in heaven
really and seriously how many converts
would the church at thi day obtain if she had
many as honest deacons as this and they
would take the trouble to see the import of
his language further the deacon said
j o o
j  there is tills garrison and this drky that
lectured here are as great iufidcls as ever
lived the only answer i gave to this
was in the following conversation between us
are you acquainted with garrison no
did you ever hear him speak  no
 did you ever read any of his writings
no  what do you know about him
 o ive heard about him  do you call
any believer in the bible an infidel yes
did you hear douglass when be was here
no i would not go  did you ever hear
him no did you ever read any of
his writings no  what do know
about him o i hear what every body
says this a deacon who lives in sight of
our great theological seminary and has had
as good a chance as others to receive all the
influence fur good which has emanated from
it for many years i again aak lf this is

american slavery
we have observed of late w ith feel
ings of deep regret a variety of indica
tions not to be mistaken that we are
about to witness in different parts ol
the world a revival of that iniquitous
and revolting traffic iu human beings
which we had hoped had been so far as
this country is concerned abolished
for ever on the appearance of lord
greys letter some time ago respecting
the importation of africans into the
west indies as one of the means for
relieving the planters from their
present difficulties we unsparingly ex
posed the real character of the mea
sure and proved with conclusiveness
of demonstration that by whatever
name it might be called it would be
but slavery after all if the rose by any
other name would smell as sweet the
draught of slavery under whatever
name it is administered will taste as
bitter we saw with sorrow the
silence which our liberal cotemporarics
preserved in reference to that import
ant communication from the colonial
office which virtually sanctioned a re
vival of the slave trade we much fear
that the indifference to the great object
of slavery which this fact betrays so
far as the press is concerned is equally
shared by a large proportion of the pul
lic would that we could stop even
here but we cannot truth com
pells us to add that the feeling of indif
ference on the question of slavery of
which wc complain has infected a very
large proportion even of the religious
public on wliat other ground can we
account for the silence which every
where prevails with respect to the still
unredressed wrongs of the colored race
in various parts of the world judg
ing from the absence of all allusion to
the subject of slavery in our public jour
nals at our religious meetings in our
christian pulpits and in private society
one would be led to suppose that there
was no longer such a being as a slave
on the face of the earth
this is not such a state of things as
ought to exist it is an unnatural an
unfeeling and an unchristian state of
things when wc all know that slavery
is as rampant on the other side of the
atlantic as it ever was in some re
spects indeed it is even more rampant
and what is the most painful and most
fearful fact of alt is the sanction given
to slavery not only by the american
lay members of christian churches
but even by the ministers of the gospel
a minister of the gospel an abettor of
slavery the idea is so dreadful that
did not the ghastly fact stare us in the
face we would not credit its existence
the world contains no instance of an
anomaly half so great it is an enormous
inconsistencythe very culmination of
incompatibility
we almost shudder while we write
it but we must not shrink from the ex
pression of our deeprooted conviction
that but for the aid afforded to ameri
can slavery by its ministers of the goo
pci the accursed institution wmu
long since hare ceased to exist they
have been its great supporterslb
main pillars on which tbe hideous edi
fiee rests the are not mere nepathn
upholders of the system they do not
simply remain passive spectators of its
existence and operation but are roost
active and energetic abettors many
l of their number denounce the abolitioo
ists and their conduct arith vehemence
and heartiness with which they have
i aever denounced satan and his doings
i they are incomparably more earnest
snd eloquent in the advocacy of the
social institutionas they call t
t wlmt a namethan they are in enforc
ing the great truths which constitute the
glory ot the gospel and which make
men wise unto salvation
nor can we except any of the evan
gelical sects from this most terrible con
 demnation episcopalians baptists
independents presbyterians wesley
an methodists are all equally gui uy ol
friendship for slavery and hostility tc
the unhappy slave not lang ago a
baptist minister in the state ot irginia
actually snatched up his gun and shot a
poor slave who was trying to make his
escape was this minister of the gos
pelawful thought that such a man
should appear in so sacred a character
disowned and shunned by his ministeri
al brethren of his own or any other
christian denomination nothing ol
the kind so far from it he was we
doubt net regarded by many of their
number as a hero of the first magnitude
a recent and striking illustration ol
the relentless hostility of the american
clergy to the emancipation of the slaves
has just been brought under our notice
it appears in a communication from
new tork which is published in the
manchester times on the th
of september says the communication
referred to a colored man being at
ripley ohio undertook to get posses
sion of his wife who was held as a
slave by a presbyterian minister in
kentucky this holy man of god
missing his human property on the sab
bath morning and being prevented by
pulpit engagements from going in pur
suit employed a neighbor on
this sabbath service while he gave
himself to the ministry of the word and
prayer the agent acting under the di
rection and authority of the minister
undertook to wrest the mans wife from
him by force of arms and in the ex
change of pistol shots was wounded i
believe mortally thus failing in the
object of his mission and falling a mar
tyr to the cause of slavery in the ser
vice of the church
v r e make no comment on the facts
here recorded they need none they
speak much more forcibly in their una
dorned simplicity than would any lan
guage which we could employ
we have another equally recent ex
ample of the active and earnest support
which slavery with all its revolting
enormities receives in the united
states from persons calling themselves
ministers of the gospel and whom wc
for courtesys sake must wc suppose
call by the same name a mr ar
nold says the communication from
which we have already quoted was
lately expelled from columbia college
washington city for the crime of giv
ing a small sum of money to a man who
was held a slave by the steward of the
college in order to enable him to sue
lor bis freedom mr arnold applied
to the faculty of the baptist college at
watterville maine forwarding a full
account of the whole affair together
with a letter from president brown
stating that the affair of the slave was
the only offence charged and for which
he was expelled to his surprise he
received a letter from president shel
don intimating that the faculty of wat
terville considered themselves bound to
refuse his application
who that reads this statement can
refrain from crying shame shame
such facts as these are so monstrous
so utterly astoundi g that were they
not attested in such a manner as to
compel our belief they could not be
credited and yet ministers of the
gospel in england can carry on a friend
ly correspondence with these clerical
ministers in the united statesay and
can too receive the d ds and
other honorary degrees of their colleges
with abject expressions of gratitude
have those of our english doctors of
divinity who have received their de
gree from the southern states of ame
rica never fancied that they saw in the
liquid with which the communication
was written the blood of the slaves in
stead of the ink usually employed in
writiug if our english ministers of
the gospel had the spirit of men to say
nothing of devoted christian feeling j
they would regard these bloodstained
american degrees as an insult instead 
of an honor and would throw them 
back with scorn and indignation in the
faces of those who sent them thither

j so rapidly is this prediction in course o
fulfilment that it is even now half ac
comptished already mauy of ms
works are swept away into the rubbish
 corners of literaturehind his place in
bibliography has been given m
querard has commenced the process ol
literary embalming as m dumas 
reputation commenced with his dramas
let us begin our examination of its title
with these there is a long list ol
themsomething like fortytiveand
mostly of five acts each had the
written nothing else they would have
argued tolerable fecundity now ac
cording to m querard out of these
fortytive dramas only four are the
production of m dumas this is not
offered as a mere assortion but as a
fact proved beyond dispute by m
querards researches the names of
all the other collaborcaturt are given in
full real names together with peeu
donymes these fortyfive plays all
with or two exceptions announced as
the production of duinas alone and
printed among his worksare traced
by m querard to other owners and
partowners in spite of play bills and
title pages the four dramas which
mdumas has written unassisted by any
other living writer are henri iii
christine charles vi and
don juan de marana the spirit
of collaboration however is of the
essence of his genius and accordingly
he has associated himself w ith the dead
there is something in his appropriation
which is quite regal he takes scenes
characters and incidents wherever he
finds them and whenever they suit him
and in the style of an imperial con
queror annexes them to his own
literary domains this he does with
little attempt at disguise accused of
it by astonished critics he very cava
lierly replies eyery one is a
plagiarist as to complete creation
i pronounce it impossible m du
mas and his friends have energetically
denied that he has had any other liter
ary assistance than that of m auguste
maquet these two men therefore
are the only avow r ed authors of the
incredible number of dramas novels
histories and travels which bear the
name of alexander dumas what
says m querard including some
few r authors such as schiller thierry
chateaubriand and scottfrom whom
dumas has plundered so largely that
they must be counted in the number
m querard makes out a list of serenly

rome to a thousand battle fields but
the eloquence of the hammer has corer

the inspiration of song has kindled up
high hopes and ooble aspirations in the
bosoms of brave knights and gentle
dames but the inspiration of the ham

with the history of art is bring at the
preset time in enropein the tyrol
at n poor cottage in innsprnck being
a stone blind artist who produces busts
and heads of extraordinary merit thu
wonderful geniua is now an old man
seventy years old who at the early age
of five years lost his eyesight his
j peculiar power of touch enabled bin
to feel images for carving with inimit
able dexterity and he was able to pro
duce in wood admirable representa
tions and to tell also whether any
figure shown him possessed the requi
site qualities and proportions of a work
of art he lost both his parents to
childhood and found himself a poor
solitary peasant to grope in darkness
through the world but this did not
discourage him he had to strive for a
living and he manfully commenced the
strife his first efforts were as diffi
cult and painful as they wore abortive
often did a false stroke of the chisel
l or a too vigorous one destroy the
work of many long and laborious days
any one but himself would have been
discouraged by hia repeated failures
into abandoning his stiange design
but after innumerable efforts mere or
less successful kleinhaus attained that
extraordinary firmness and precision of
hand which enabled him to work out
step by step and bit by hit the entire
details of the figure on which he was
employed even to the contour of the
ffmhs and the traits of the counten
ance nay incredible as it may seem
he actually arrived at the power of
first impressing upon his mind by the
touch and then transferring them to
wood the traits of individual counten
ances so as to produce portraits that
are striking likenesses
kleinhavs is the name of this pen
severing but poor artist who has during
his long career executed no less than
three hundred and fifty figures octhe

dred heads of madonnas and saints
in the museum of innspruck there
is a bust of the emperor ferdinand
cut iu wood by the hand of kleinhaus
from a marble bust of a german sculp
tor and which is said to be as good a
likeness as the original bust modelled
from the life there is also in his own
cottage a bust of one of his relations
which is still more extraordinary since
it was produced from merely passing
his hands over the living face of the
individual represented and the likeness
of which is said to be perfect
notwithstanding the industry and
genius of this veteran and unfortunate
artist he is still obliged to carve figures
for a subsistence although he is appre
ciated in his neighborhood and much
visited by strangers but this is some
times the way of the world and unos
tentatious merit during the lifetime of
its possessor meets with but slight

washington april 
i have learned something more ol
the history of some of these poor
slaves who started from this city in the
keeping of slatter the slavedealer
among the number sisters whc
were members of the african metho
dist church they are beautifully
formed handsome and nearly as white
as their master their brother is the
coachman of secretary walker arh
when he learned the horrid fact that
slatter had purchased them and was
designing to take them south he made
efforts to purchase them himself he
had laid aside from his hard earnings
money nearly sufficient to purchase his
own liberty and this with what bene
volent persons gave him he offered
for his sisters and offered also to se
cure the balance but his efforts were
vain the inhuman monster on ac
count of their rare beauty set a heavy
price upon them and demanded cash
down a young southern libertine
before they started offered 
for one of them but slatter demanded
more he was aware that men of this
class would pay almost any price for
them and hence his spurning the offers
and pledges of the brother i have
conversed with this brother and i must
acknowledge that i hardly ever met
with a young man of better natural
talents his countenance is prepos
sessing his manners are extremety
easy his language is correct and
chaste and his high forehead keen
eyes and the peculiar expressions of
his countenance all betoken a high
order of intellect in a person of this
character possessed of warm feelings
and keen sensibilities what must be
his anguish in reflecting upon the fate
of these sisters who were as dear to
him as the apple of his eye you can
imagine in some small degree what his
feelings may be but you cannot know
fully about their reality this the
mild slavery of the city of washing
ton such as is upheld by the sanction
of congress in sight of the american
capitol and within a full knowledge of
the representatives of a free people
yet a large majority of those members j
permit party considerations to triumph
over the most heartrending appeals to
their humanity philanthropy and the
common rights of freemen while we
condemn the atrocities of slavery in
algiers we permit the most abhorrent
forms off slavery in of r own midst that
an algerine would shrink from with
horror john wesley never uttered a
greater truth than when he declared
that tlarery was the tmm of all vil
la met it is not murder adultery
fornication theft merely but the word
slavery expresses the sum of all these
evils tbts slavery church members
upon the ioor of congress will defend
and even threaten aa did the presby
terian venable last week a dissolution
of the union if northern people inter
fered much more with it the char

makes the same threat and contends

letter from geriut smith
peterboro may i 
elixir wright my dear sir
i have been waiting very impatiently
for a right movement in behalf of die
three men who are imprisoned at
washington for helping their poor
brothers and sisters to escape from
slavery i this day see by the chro
notype that there is such a movement
in boston and that there is a com
mittee appointed ef which you are a
member whose duty it is to collect
money and retain counsel for the
defence of said persons and for bring
ing before the supreme court of the
united states the question of the if
 gality of slavery in the district of
columbia
you will need a large fundnot less
 should suppose than ten thousand
dollars as my contribution to it 
herewith send you a draft far oo
 will pay more should more be need
ed from me
my heart bleeds day and night for
the seventyseven who are replunged
into slavery after having escaped from
its horrors oh that is the second
death as for their three friends i
have very little fear that they will be
convicted american slavery could
not long survive their conviction and
punishment to say that slavery is
constitutional in any part of the nation
is quite absurd enough but to say
that it is constitutional in the district
of columbia or any where else where
the jurisdiction of the federal gov
ernment is exclusive is the very height
of absurdity if constitutional in such
circumstances it must he because
congress can make slaves but as
richard davis well said on the door ot
congress congress can no more
make a slave than make a king
to return for a moment to the
three imprisoned men how it swells
my soul with indignation to sec their
merciful and christian conduct stig
matizedand that too in antislavery
high places precious to my whole
heart is the man who braving the
reproach and peril of such an under
taking in this land of mighty and over
awing oppressors helps bis poor bro
ther or poor sister to escape from the
southern prisonhouse let othen
say that he is meanly employed 
will still say that no man on earth is
more honorably employed
with great regard your friend

the colossus of the revolu
tjovthe revolution was with dan
ton an instinct and not a religion he
served as the wind serves the tempest
by elevating the foam and sporting with
its waves he only understood its
movement not its direction he had
its intoxication rather than its love
he represented the masses and net the
superiorities of the epoch he display
ed the agitation force farocity gener
osity all in turns of these masses a
man of temperament rather than of
thought more elemental than intelli
gent hcwas still a statesman beyond
any of those who tried to handle and
manage men and things in those times
of utopianism he was even a great
er statesman than mirabeau if by that
appellation we mean the man who un
derstands the mechanism of govern
ment independently of its ideal he had
political instinct he had drawn from
machiavclli those maxims which teach
all that power or tyranny may effect in
states he knew the vices and weak
nesses of the people but not their vir
tues he understood nothing of what
forms the holiness of governments for
he did not see god in men but merely
chance he was one of the admirers
of ancient fortune who adored in her
the deity of success only he felt his
value as a statesman with the greater
complacency as democracy was further
beneath him he admired himself as a
giant among the dwarfs of the people
he displayed his superiority as a par
venu of genius and was astonished at
himself he crushed others proclaim
ing himself to be the head of the repub
lic after having carressed popularity
he braved it as a wild beast which he
dared to devour him his vice was as
bold as his brow he had pushed po
litical mistrust even to crime in the tol
erated days of september he had
defied remorse but it overcame him
he was beset by him blood followed
his footsteps a secret horror mingled
with the admiration he inspired he
felt this and sought to separate himself
from his past uncultivated in his na
ture he had impulses of humanity as
he had of fury he had low vices but
generous passionsin a word he had a
heart this heart in his latter days re
turned to god through sensibility pity
and love he deserved at the same
time curses and pity he was the co
