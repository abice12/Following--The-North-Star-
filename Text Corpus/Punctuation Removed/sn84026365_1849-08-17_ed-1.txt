mr calhoun
it is a satisfaction now anil then to
see a man in those l nited states
kven a had man is better than none at
all it is encouraging lor it looks as
it there wtre a possibility ot the amer
ican race regaining its stamina and re
covering something ot the rough
strength otcharacter which ii had sixty
or seventy years ago it is a comfort
too to meet with an actual tangible
idea how ever wicked it maybe occaj
jonallv an idea that stands up by it
self in its own natural proportions in
stead of being razeed down to the reg
illation hmensious kven the sight ol

the north star
er to this claw south and xorth
such politicians as day and benton
are perfect godsend they serve as
feather hel twixt cattle wall
and heavy brunt of cannon bail
they furnish a teriium quid a middle
quality equally removed from two ex
tremes of the national problem they
take an idea and split it in two and
triumphantly hold up the moiety as a
proof of the truth of jthe philosophic
paradox of old time that the half is
more than the whole anything that
shifts responsibility that defers action
that puts farther off the evil day of dos

clays adjournment ol the question to
the greek kalends or the next day af
ter never as the children say and
bentons movement to restrict slavery
within its existing boundaries carefully
holding on to his own slaves and letting
his neighbours slaves alone in the
most resolute matiuer both meet a
want in the american market
there isa tine vein of contempt per
vading mr calhouns last address to
the people of the south towards mr
benton which comes from him with a
good grace whatever else he may
he mr calhoun is consistent he
does not reprobate slavery and cleave
to it at the same time he does not
flunk that what is good in south caro
lina will become bad by being trans
ported to california through life he
has been faithful to the peculiar institu
tion nobody could ever mistake bus
position there was never a question
made about that he has never blown
hot and cold upon the mess of potage
which he prizes as his birthright he
has a complete and peifect idea for his
guide mr benton has hut a very
imperfect fraction of one for his sla
very is an absolute good says mr
calhoun and is therefore to he cher
ished and propagated slavery is in
itself an evil virtually says mr ben
ton and therefore should not he per
mitted to curse a country which is now
free from it why not endeavour to
remove it from your own state w hich
already suffers from its blighting influ
ences is the natural and inevitable
question which arises why retain
your properly in your own chattels if
such be the nature and effects of man
ownership if slavery he bad as an
article of exportation it cannot be bet
ter as an ai tide of home consumption
if an embargo should he laid for the
protection of california from slavery
suiely an effort should be made for the
deliverance of missouri from it if
rum and brandy be illassorted with
missionaries in a cargo to heathen
ands they call loudly for extermina
tion in our own admit mr calhouns
premises and hjs conclusions will
beatthe test of the severest logic mr
bentons conclusions on the other hand
trip up the heels of his premises or
rather he has logically nor morally
neither premises nor conclusions to his
reasoning it is a chain loose at both
ends and can serve neither as moorings
for slavery nor liberty
in fact there are hut two ideas in
the united states the one is slavery
and the other is antislavery all
others are but the disjecta membra the
scattered limbs of massacred ideas
tariff and antitariff free trade and
protection bank and subtreasury
yea even free soil itself rest upon no
great principle appeal to no eternal
truth for their sanction the first are
mere schemes of policy about which
men differ according as they affect
their interests present or prospective
their ultimate appeal is to the day
book and ledger to the returns of ex
ports and imports and to the quarter
ly statements of the revenue and
the last carefully abstains from going
to the foundations of things existing
and scrupulous ly protests against being
supposed to intend tj shake them
with slavery within the united states
and as protected by the constitution
it does not pretend to intermeddle it
shudders at the extension of what it is
willing to tolerate this is plainly
hut a very small segment of the great
idea which is to abolish slavery that
idea aims at the entire and utter exter
mination of its antagonist now with
out delay wherever it exist and at
whatever cost of political institutions
or pecuniary interests it takes no
counsel with flesh and blood it sees
the uiiliness of slavery and its inherent
abominations and considers the past
and present consent of the nation as
of no account except as an increas
ed motive for instantly getting rid of it
no oilier idea has vital power and en
ergy enough to meet the necessities of
the case it is this alone that will fi
nally triumph all attempts to do its
wink by employing its fragments must
fail even their success were it a
possible thingwould h imsehiveous as
distracting the general mind from the
real question at issuefrom the solu
tion of the great enigma
the more distinctly the two opposite
ideas can be brought into palpable an
tagonism tiie better the mischief ot
every half measure and imperfect idea
is that it presents or retards their join
ing buttle it is the great strategy of
the best friends of slavery to protract
the day of battle their policy is fa
bian their hope is in delay and
the illadvised schemes of well meaning
persons for the restriction of what
they should destroy helps this policy of
these teneinies of the human race
now mr calhoun is honourably dis
tinguished from all these classes of men
bv the definiteness of ins position the
unmistakableneas of his doctrine aud
the uncompromising consistency of hie
public and private life it is an meati
aable advantage to have an eneni
that you know where to find he u
no proteus that will change his hap
as soon as you grapplt with him i

i will be a fair combat until the dead

frtake allowances for imperfect reach

careful lhat they should never be look

though we have already called atten

the press and the post office in tin
little kingdom we cannot pass it b
without giving in full the document
which illustrate it let it be remcnv
bored that the only crime alleged 
suspected against mr parrott is tlx
dropping into the post office of a cer
tain printed document signed brutus
 this was printed word for word in the
chronotypc of july joth it is noi
an antislavery document as our read
ers know indeed it has not a word
directly condemnatory of slavery an
not one questioning the right of the
planters to own and hog the slaves al
tlieirwill it merely exposes the injus
tice of the large slaveholders towards
the free white laborers and showing
that the constitution of south carolina
is not in fact republican proposes
meetings of the citizens according to
constitutional tight and form to make
it so the whole address is merely a
constitutional discussion of points of
difference between two classes offtec
white men for circulating such a
document the following beautiful pro
ceedings are had against a free citizen
of indiana the private letters picked
out of his pocked do prove to he sure
that lie and his friends proceeded with
some caution and secresy hut it damns
south carolina below all austrian be
low all russian below all turkish
below all cvim tartarean below all
holy inquisition despotism that for
such an object they had any need of
caution and secresy
if there ever was on earth in the
heavens above it or the waters under it
or ever will he any suiollieration of
thought and discussion so cowardly and
completeif there ever was a hand of
slicep thieves or hen roost pirates put
upon a hush more jealous utter and
profound we heg to know it the eu
ropean chokers of the press cannot be
gin to come up to what lias been ac
complished in south carolina why
these precious republican scamps cool
ly taunt with dishonesty the men who
in the exercise of their constitutional
rights in order not to he lynched by
their vigilance committees keep
their own counsels silence they take
as plain proof of mischief
god knows w e are no pharisee and
do not despise our fellow men because
they are either weak foolish or wicked
knowing our own multitudinous infirmi
ties sins and iniquities we can see
and admire goodness in a slaveholder
and even venerate lor many things a

to he a selfevident wrong but the
nabobcracy of south carolina assume
such a kid glove sanctity and unap
proachable holiness at the altar of re
publicanism they affect to he so much
better and braver than anybody else
while human petticoats never yet con
cealed sucli hysterical timidity at any

john m barrett thf abolitionist
this personage has doubtless very
unexpectedly to himself achieved an
unenviable notoriety in a very short
tune what may he tiie penalty of this
notoriety remains to he seen by the
aw ard of the law the charge under
which lie was arrested is punishable by
twelve months imprisonment and lloo
tine but he may he indicted under
the arrest for any crime of which the
states attorney may think himself able
by competent testimony to convict the
prisoner there is more than a possi
bility barrett may he indicted for an
offence the penalty of which is death
without benefit of clergy and assured
fv if convicted all the abolitionists in
the united states cannot save him

every point in the state and charge

me to write to some one there and
get him to deposit in some office with

you should not deliver them to any ol

them in your way it is unnecessary j
for you to know the object he lias in

you will much oblige flic and in
deed i will take it as a great favor itj
von will not give the slightest hint to
any one of this matter and in your
correspondence with your friends here
you need not allude to it at all you
need not even acknowledge that you
have received the package from me
except it he in a letter addressed to

you will therefore excuse me for not
doing so and guess at mine
but the rev dr s f chase who
probably has no affinity with south

he was too hard for dr singar as he

this letter was directed to barrett
at ashville and forwanied from that
place to greenville from there to
spartanburg c h where barrett
took it out of the post office it
seems to us comment is unnecessary to
point the irresistahle conclusion that
dr chase knew he was writingto an 
accredited agent of the abolitionists
whose held of labor was south caroli
na we present our readers with
an extract from the secret correspon
dence of barett honest men in an j
honest business with honest purposes

of concealment and it furnishes n
strong presumption that barrett had his

to unlock the enigma

feessed that even with this key our
friends here have not been able to un
derstand portions of the correspon
dence
we submit to an enlightened public
that the exposition we have made ot
the actings and doings of barrett leaves
no moral doubt of his lull guilt and
that our community stands justified
in the eye of the country in de
manding a legal investigation it is
true we have not given all the evidence
in our power policy forbade that but
we have given enough to satisfy any
reasonable man that our people have
acted neither rashly nor harshly it is
also true that the whole people of the
state are indignant at the numerous
and covert assaults made upon them
and that a few more detections will exas
perate them to a degree wdiich will
render even a jail a very unsafe place

the american of the loili iust publishes
the following report of the committee on
colored schools it is as interesting docu
ment
gentlemenyour committee to
whom was referred the petition of a
number of citizens asking the estab
lishment of a colored school on the
east side of the river and also the
petition praying the removal of the
colored school on north washington
street from that neighborhood would
respectfully report as follows
the questions presented in the two
petitions are so identical and intimate
ly connected that we propose to give
our views upon both in one report
your committee arc well aware ol
the importance as well as the delicacy
of the subject matters involved in the
petitions and as the views herewith
presented may he deemed a departure
from other acts and precedents here
tofore established by the board of edu
cation in this city we think it proper
that the reasons which govern us and
the conclusions we have formed be fully
submitted
the subject of separate schools for
colored children has often been agitated
in our city in january ihii the sub
ject was brought before the common
council by a petition of a colored
man praying to bo relieved from pay
ing taxes for school purposes on the
ground that colored children were not
admitted into the public school the
petition having been referred to the pro
per committee the recorder being
the chairman reported that no legal
provision existed for th education of
colored children separate from other
children and that they have a right to
attend common schools in districts
where they live and arc liable to be
taxed
such was the law as it then existed
colored children then had the same
right to demand and receive the bless
ings of public instruction equally with
white children no inspector of color
had then been placed at the door of our
free schools with power to exclude
those whose only sin was the color of
their skin though more cleanly and bet
ter behaved than scores of their more
fortunate white neighbors
and it is here worthy cf remark that
in the erection of each of our school
houses and all the attendant expenses
those of the colored population owning
property were taxed and paid in pro
portion equally with other citizens
by an act passed april th 
conferring certain powers upon the
board of education in this city it is
provider in sec ir i oat said board
shall have power to establish and cause
to be kept such number of schools
for the instruction ot colored children
as they shall deem expedient
sec is provides that until such
schools for the instruction of colored
children chall be so provided it shall
not be lawful to impose any tax upon
the property of any colored persons
for the support of common schools
sec  provides that when the
board shall determine to establish
schools for the instruction of colored
children they shall divide the city in
to districts and make an estimate ot
the cost of erecting a suitable school
house in each of said districts and oe
termine the sites thereof and report
their doings to the common council
see o provides that the common
council shall have jmwer to raise by
geueral tax on a separate warrant such
sum as shall be necessary to build a
school house in each district or as many
as they ma beem expedient not exceed
ing in the aggregate the sum of 
sec l provides that in case the
common council shall refuse to raise
such tax the board shall have power
to provide suitable rooms or buddings
for the accommodation of such schools
but the annual expenditure for this
purpose shall not exceed five hundred
dollars
by section ist of an amendatory act
passed april llth it is provided
that the board of education in addition
to the powers and duties prescribed by
the act hereby amended shall have
power and it shall be their duty to
pass such bylaws and ordinances for
the regulation government control

such is a brief synopsis of the
on this subject under which the color
ed school is now organized an j under
which another is now sought to be es
tablished on the east side of the river
by the report of the late superin
tendent b r me alpine of sept
 it appears that the whole number
of colored children of school age in
the city on the first of january of that
year was only ho and that ail except
 of them resided on the west aide of
the river that a sc ol had been kept
on north washington street ten
months of the year that the average
attendance was only  that the whole
expense for the ten months was 
so without charging that school
with any part of the sum for superin
tendents salary and contingent expen
ses which was lloo one ltith of which
is properly chargeable

to what extent tlie colored popula

increased since that period is unknown
and there is no certain or official in
formation as to the exact number of
colored children in the city of school
age but from such information as wc
have been able to obtain the whole
number is now only about o and in
the new city directory recently pub
lished we find only h colored house
holders on the cast side of the river
i and less than there were as stuted in
the directory of 
the average attendance at the color
ed school on north w ashington street
the past year as stated by citizens
who have had ample means of informa
tion would not exceed while the
expense of maintaining that school will
amount to the sum of oo ini
which sum if wc add as be
fore the one sixteenth of
superintendents salary
and contingent expenses  
the total amount will then he ob 
or l oj per scholar for the average
attendance a sum entirely dispropor
tionate w hen we consider the expense
on the average attendance of main
taining the free white schools is
less than   per scholar
your committee believe that if the
colored children were allowed free
access to the public schools in etch of
the districts where they reside the
whole numberthat would attend would
not exceed sixty and which would
average four to cacli of the fifteen
white free schools from which they
are now unjustly excluded this would
not in the least increase the expense of
those schools and would save to the
city the cost of maintaining any sepa
rate schools for colored children and
which sum if we should add another
on the east side of the river would
amount to about simh  per year
upon the ground of economy then
we see that this system cannot be up
held nor maintained a moment longer
and it is not believed that a separate
school for the colored children is ad
vantageous to them but on the con
trary they are seriously injured by
such a system the almost utter im
possibility to procure a competent tea
cher of their own color the mortifica
tion they must feel in being forced
from the districts in which many of
them were born and have ever lived
and where the property of their parents
has been taxed to build commodi
ous school houses which they are
not permitted to enter the dis
tance which many of them would be
compelled to go in our city which
covers an area of more than six square
miles many of them living upon the
very borders of the city grouped to
gether in some rented rooms in
darkness and ignorance there to seek
education with all the attending disad
vantages arc objections to the system
of sufficient weight to demand its re
peal provided there were no others
if then as we trust we have shown
that the system of exclusive schools tor
colored children cannot be maintained
upon the ground of economy nor utili
ty upon what ground was the system
first established and why has it beeu
maintained wc answer it was first
conceived and has been maintained
solely m consequence of the prejudice
against color the system was es
tablished in order to gratify a morbid
public sentiment against the colored
race a species yea a relic of the
organic remains of that public opinion
which a lew years ago could stone and
mob those who dated to assemble in a
peaceable and lawful manner and speak
the truth in relation to the bondage
degradation and suffitmg of the color
ed race
but we trust that the enlightened
generous and plulanthrapic portiou of
the citizens of rochester are as will
ing to open the doors of their ire
schools to those whose only impedi
ment is their color as they are and
ever have been to the poor destitute
and degraded of other nations and
climes why shall we close the doors
of our school upon those who can boast
that they c cn crea
ted by the mte overruling providence
children hunger and thirat
for the bleasing of knowledge and
education who have as much natural
eight to enjoy the lenetcent effects of
our free schools as those of a light
er hue
do not the colored population have a 
common interest yes a common country 
are
 not entitled to the common blessing
with us all i then let us no longer ester to
the false and arbitrary distinction of a few or
pretenders if these distinction in
and of themselves are without anv foundation
in reason and juwice as
u true sad pity tis nw
they are
if us havs a right if it j
discriminations as to the complexion v
not the same right d ual
t just fore to make the religious senti
ments ol parenu a rest or the physical for
mation of children in other respect as well
as the color of the skin
yvr committee have searched in vain for
a reason for continuing this barrier to out
school none has been suggested worthy of
the name of reason we have been told that
the colored race are degraded that many of
them are filthythat if they are allowed free
acceas to our schools many of our respecta
ble citizens will withdraw their children and
their encouragement from the schools in an
swer to such objections we can onlysav that it
is a lamentable fact that many children who if
clean could boast of a white skin attend our
schools who are more degraded and more fil
thy than colored children aud we are free to
say from personal observation that the col
ored children of rochester so far as cleanlit
ness it concerned will compare favorably
with an equal number indiscriminately selec
ted from other children and if we compare
ihe number of colored persona charged with
crime in proportion to the numbers of each
we and that they lose nothing by the com
parison taking into consideration their rela
tive advantages if these reasons prevail the
bjectora will be forced by their own argu
ment to withdraw their encouragement froir
the schools for perfect cleanliness and strct
moral deportment with ail even the white
cannot be found in any public school tn this

one of the pominent causesot crime ia ig
norance shall we aid in perpetuating it by
keeping in existence a system which has a di
rect tendency tonvei the chains of ignorance
upon the colored race by lending our sanc
tion to the building up of unjust unnatural
and causeess distinctions and castes in society l
if we sav by our acta to the colored children
we are holier thrui you we creite in them
a feeling at once hostile towards us we de
grade them and we degrade ourselves in
stead of encouraging them to do good we
drive them to evil

mr amsden said that although he con
curred in the general sentiments of the report
he must withhold his assent from the recom
mendation to discontinue the colored school
he thought that such a step would not meet
the approbation of the patrons of the colored
school or of those of the other schools or ol
the citizens generally
he suggested that the sense of the public
in the premises might be tested bv granting
permission to the colored children to attend
the schools in the districts in which they re
side provided ihe trustees of such districts
should concur therein to which end he offeree
an amendment to the report as follows
resolved that the ordinance of tha boart
of education w hich prohibits the attendant
of colored children at any but the colorec

colored schools

on the first page of this weeks paper
will be found a report of the committee on
 colored schools recommending the abolition
of such schools and the admission of colored
children into those of the districts the re 
port is now under the consideration of the
educational committee and may be defeated
we uodeistand that strenuous efforts will be
put forth to compass its defeat and that as
usual the opponents of this just wive and
liberal measure will seek to attain their object j
by means of the colored people themselves
it has been proposed that a petition should j
be circulated among the colored people pray i
ing the committee to continue the colored
school on washington street and notwith
standing the general intelligence of the colored
people of this city it is to be feared that many
will take the side of proscription sign such a
petition and become the instruments of their
own degiadation and that of their children
nothing on earth would better please the
i negro haters of rochester than such a peti
tion it would be the most powerful argu
ment in favor of the blind prejudice and
haughty contempt with which the colored peo
ple arc usually treated in this country
wo should feel the most intense mortifica
i lion if while many ol the most respectable
white people of this city should be in favor of
admitting our children to equal privileges in
the use of our common schools a single col
ored man should be found opposed to the
measure it is very clear to us that the only
way to remove prejudice and to command
the respect of our white fellow citizens is to
repudiate in every form the idea of our in
i feriority by maintaining our right to civil
social and political equality with them if
we are in doubt on this point our despisers
may well be resolved if they can only say
that the colored man himself is impressed
with a sense of his unfitness for equal privi
leges their own prejudices may be plausibly
justified for our own part we are resolved
to battle against all complexional distinctions
among men they are unnatural and work
nought but mischief and oppression in any
community w here they may exist and no
j where may their injurious effects be seen more
j clearly than in the condition of our colored
children they find themselves excluded
from white schools and they early learn that
their complexion is the cause of their exclu
sion tiie consequence is they are induced
to undervalue themselves and to look upon
white children as their oppressors from this
source may be traced hatred combats insults
arid numerous other vices vvhich serve to
keep up a perpetual enmity between the white
and black members of the community there
i is no reason nor can there be any reason why
a colored child should not be taught in the
same schools with white children the fact
that one is black and that the other is white
j makes no difference as to the office of educa
tion both are in need of instruction and
both possess the capacity for it and for one
class to deny to the other any right of educa
tional privilege on complexional grounds is
an insult offered to that god who made of
one blood all the nations of men for to dwell
on all the face of the earth
but w e put this question on another ground
it is evident that colored people will continue
to form a part of this commuity and that
j their influence in it for good or for evil will
be considerable they may either contribute
to its prosperity virtue and happiness or they
may become a serious drawback upon all
these to elevate and improve the colored
people is but contiibuting to the general good
of the whole community and as it is evident
that colored children will be in a much better
position for improvement by sharing the ad
vantages of the whites in the common schools
than they can ire in a separate and proscribed j
establishment no appeals to prejudice and
pride should induce the committee to reject
the report in favor of admitting colored child j
ren into the district schools the abolition of
the colored school on washington street and
the admission of colored children on equal
terms with the w hites iuto the district schools
would be a noble example of justice and liber
ality worthy ot the city of rochester
we are happy to observe that the press of
all parties approve the report and that so
i rtr as ho more respectable of our citizens are
concerned there will be no serious objection
to its adoption  he only sources from which
we have reason to expect opposition are from
a few ignorant colored men themselves and
from that low vulgar herd of whites whose
chief sense of then own consequence is de
rived irom their ability to abuse and insult
w ith impunity those w hom they are pleased to
term niggers
it remains to be seen whether this under
rla of rochester society shall rule the city
on a question which iovolves more or less
the happiness of all f d

tne ladies of the western new york
antislavery society are actively engaged in
preparing for holding a setiea of antislavery
ir m neighboring towns they have
already mai arrangements for two one is
u be held at maced on on saturday next
another on the following tuesday at pal
myra and other are tn tbe

to believe that these assemblages will tend to

holy caune r n
father matthew and slavery
nothing reveal more completely and
mournfully the allprevailing pretence and
power of the spit it of slavery in this land
than the sad facl that scarcely a single for
eigner that venlurres tn onr soil is found
able to withstand its pernicious and seductive
influence man after man has appeared in
our midst from whom in view of hi previous
history vte had reason to eipect a bold and
uncompromising stand against this giant
wrong baa fallen before it and drifted away
m the proslavery tide of public opinion
many names might be montiooed especially
tboee of divines england ireland and
scotland known and distinguished at borne as
the friends of the antislavery cause who
have almost immediately on landing deserted
their principles abandoned the cause and
linked themselves with the oppressors and
haters of liberty finding it much easier to sail
with the popular breeze than to maintain their
integrity it would seem that the foul demon
stands ready upon all our borders to reduce
or overwhelm every man who comes within
his reach
from our acquaintance with father matthew
we had fondly hoped that his would be a
better fate that he would not change his
morality by changing his locality but that he
would nobly avow and stand hard by the
principles he professed to cherish in his own
land we are howevergrieved humbled and
mortified to know that he too has fallen in the
wake of his predecessors and forsaken the
cause of the oppressed by pledging himself
to the oppressor that he will remain dumb on
the subject of slavery during his sojourn in
this country a more melancholy spectacle
cannot well be imagined and though most
painful to us wre should be false to onr high
obligations to liberty did we not expose this
disgraceful apostaev
in the year  theobald matthew signed
an address from the people of ireland to their
countrymen and countrywomen in america
calling their attention to the subject of ame
rican slavery denouncing the system as a
foul blot declaring that our land never
could be glorious  long as its soil is pol
luted by the footstep of a single slave
affirming slavery to be the most tremendous
j invasion of the natural inalienable lights of
man and of some of the noblesi gifts of god
and say what a spectacle does america
present to the people of the earth a land ol
profesaing christian republicans uniting tneii
energies for the oppression and degradation ol
three millions of innocent human beings tha
children of one common father who suffer
i the most grievous wrongs and the utmost de
i gradation for no crime of their own nor ol
their ancestors slavery is a sin against god
and man all who are not for it must be
against it none can be neutral we entreai
you to take the part of justice religion and
liberty we call upon you to unite with the
abolitionists
such was father matthews advice to hia
countrymen in america when he stood under
the shadow of the british monarchy but oh
how different how changed is hi tune when
be treads the soil of this republic within
a few days a train of circumstances has
compelled him to define his position and
j sadly enough he has sought to find for him
self a refuge of which seven years since he
denied the existence none can be neutral
he then said upon this point his mind has
undergone a change he note thinks he has
found neutral ground the circumstances
leading to this development are briefly these
the committee of arrangements appoiuted by
the american antislavery society to make
preparations for celebrating the anniversary
of west india emancipation addressed tc
father matthew a letter respectfully inviting
him to be present and to participate in the
celebration to make assurance doubly
sure a committee was appointed consisting
of w l garrison and dr h i bowditch
to see that father matthew received the said
letter and at this interview father matthew
declared what it appears to us will be his
policy during hia sojourn in this country he
said on that occasion i have as much as i
can do to save men from the slavery of intem
perance without attempting the overthrow
any other kind of slavery besides it would
not be proper for tne to commit myself on a
question like this under present circum
stances i am a catholic pnest but being
here to promote the cause of temperance 
should not be justified in turning aside from
my mission for the purpose of subserving the
cause of catholicism he further said i
am not in favot of slavery  should never
think of advocating it though i dont know
as we can say that there is any specific in
junction against it in the scriptures such
seems to be the present position of father
mathew and it is one of which we have no
doubt his countrymen at home will be heartily
ashamed it is needless for us to expose the
aophisttv by which father matthew seeks to
defend his position the case which he puts
of being a catholic priest is the last which
he should have taken to illustrate the relation
he shall maintain to the antislavery cause in
this country he was a catholic priest in
ireland and a temperance man in ireland and
though pressed on all sides with engagmenta
he found time to express himself fully and
clearly in behali ol the antislavery cause
and it ie not to be believed that what he then
said against american slavery in any deg tee
lessened bis power against the slavery of in
temperance his assumed unwillingness to
turn aside from the temperance cause to
promote catholicism would wear the appear
ance of impartiality if the cases were alike
which they are not every one knows father
matthew to be a roman catholic every one
does not know hin to be an abolitionist on
the one queotioo he is openly committed and
is willing to stand committed on the other
he is entirely opposed to committing himself
he has no occasion to turn aside tn pro
mote catholicism he does promote it and
cannot help promoting it in every good
word that he speaks and in every good deed
that he pet forms be promotes the cause of
roman catholicism while he is openly iden
tified with that system of religion but it is
not so on the subject of slavery the anu
alavery cause derives no influence in its favor
irom a man who declares himself unwilling to
i commit hunseff tn its behalf tbe reader
must remember that our bostoo fi tends made
ne exorbitant or unreasonable demand upon
father matthew s time they assured him
of their unwilling new to divert turn from the
real purpose of hts mission to this country
ami they simply wished bun to attend this
celebration as an appropriate opportunity in
which to make known bis sympathy with the
cause of the oppressed the length of lime
required for this could not exceed ooe dj so
that on this score father matthew is without
exeuse
it is obvious to common sense that the
policy of father matthew will fail ii it
object thank god that it i withn the
power of the antislavery press of tbe country
feeble as a is to make hts treachery to liberty
known throughout tbe land and although he
may luxuriate for awhile in the smiles of
american fleshmongeis and eat the bread
wruhfe out from the sweat and blood of the
bondman the time will come when his treach
ery must recoil upon him god will con
found the wisdom of the crafty and bring
to nought the counsels of the ungodly
but we will not be too severe we hope
that father mathew may yet see hia error
confess his fault and nobly identify himself
with the cause of tbe longdegraded and
deeply injuredbondman before he leaves this
country f d
the union of the oppressed
we hope in a few weeks to be able to
lay before our readers the thoughts words
aud action of our colored brethren in different
parts of the country on the subject of union
as presented by us in last weeks north star
it is to be hoped that the leaders of our peo
ple in their different localities will at once
call the attention of our people to the subject
and obtain their views and opinions with re
spect to it in the fotm of addresses resolu
tions or letters tnere should be a full and
free investigation as to the propriety and
practicability of the scheme suggested and
our people should be well instructed in every
particular connected with the subject
it would be easy for us to anticipate the
objections to the scheme and perhaps as easy
to answer them but we leave the field open
to objectors and they may occupy it if they
please what we w ish is to ascertain the
voice of our brethren on the subject but
whether we are followed by many or by few
if thirty persons can be found in the union
who are willing to form such a league we
shall be heartily in favor of its formation as
we believe that from this m ill beginning an
institution may be erected fraught with untold
i good to ourselves and to posterity but we
wait for the voice of our friends cn the sub
jectf d
rev henry h garnet
i when we penned our portrait of this gen
i ileman three weeks since wo had no idea of
administering to his vanity and are not sur
prised that he should seize on the first oppor
tunity to manifest his spleen towards us on
t account of it the only part of hia speech
delivered at the auburn celebration which
mr ward has allowed to see the light or
i perhaps thought worth reporting is a denun
ciation of us and our esteemed friend c l
 remond mr garnet begins with the fol
j lowing solemn warning to hi hearers be
ware of the baneful and hellborn doctrines
i which are cunningly scattered among you
and that too with an industry worthy of a
better cause i speak plainly and pointedly
because the poison which i am about to ana
lyze emanates from a high and respectable
source so far as talents and influence are con
cerned mr frederick douglass tells us we
have no country lu one sense and in the
sense in which this sentiment was uttered
this is perfectly true we have no country
in making the declaration we meant only to
exhibit forcibly the glaring fact that the col
ored man is denied the rights and privileges of
an american citizen by the american gov
ernment and that in this respect he is an
outlaw in the land this was the meaniug
which we attached to rhat declaration when
we uttered it and no man knew letter at the
time that such was our meaning than mr
garnet yet he has the unfairness to affirm
that the view we take of it is the same taken
by john c calhoun nothing can more
i clearly indicate mr garnets own sense of
i the utter weakness of his cause than a resort
 to palpable falsehood in his defence if any
colored man wants to know whether he has a
counity let him go to charleston south
carolina under the protection of the ameri
can constitution and his country will be lim
ited to a prison that the colored people
have a right to a country here we have ever
affirmed aud mr garnet will never succeed
in trying to make the colored people nor any
other enlightened people believe the con
trary
charge dwe have spoken lightly and
contemptuously of the religious conviction of
the colored people and of their religious
hope we deny the charge and demand
the proof and if the former be not with
drawn or proved its author must rest under
the infamous disgrace of being a reverend
falsewitness
charge dwe were once a preacher in
the methodist church and deserted it this
is very true those who are acquainted
with the character of the methodist church
and have a spark of selfrespect or feel a
single pulsation of sympathy for the down
trodden slave will commend us for our
coarse
charge thwe deny the inspiration of
the bible this is a broad charge and if
well founded mr garnet will of course
produce the proof meanwhile we utterly
disavow that have ma j e suc h a denial
charge sth we are unstable it
might perhaps be better for biut if we were
so he might then expect that at some future
time be would be able to deceive us into tbe
belief that mr garnet ia a man of veracity
and honor no such hope oor expectation
need ever be chetiahed unstable though
we may be we shall ever maintain a consist
ent view of hu character and abape our con
duct towards him accordingly
charge th fa that we ask the colored
people to bow down to the unreasonable
and unnatural dogmas of nonresistance
hat mr garnet term unreasonable and
unnatural dogmas though we have never
insisted upon them before any congregation ot
our people may be found ia that said volume
which ns aflecu to hotter and whjch w an
presumed to alight we should like to bear
a sermon from this reverend man of blood
and pretended disciple of the lard jesus
christ on the following pas of ct p
turn ye bare heard that it bath ben said
an ejra for an ere and a tooth for a tooth
but  say unto you that ye nr ml
but tchowartr shall smvr the on the right
cheek turn to him the other also aod if any
man will sue tbee at the law and take away
thy coat let him bate thy cloak also and
whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go
with him twain will mr garnet denounce
these as unnatural and unreasonable deg
nun  and if so how much respect has he
for christ or the bible we believe that be
has no more recard for the bible than had
abner kneeland or anv other infidel and he
merely follows that pait of it which he deems
roost in accordance with his bloodthirsty dis
position and as a means of putting money in
his purse this reverend gentleman bound
himself under the most solemn obligations to
be present at the buffalo celebration saying
that if life lasted or providence permitted
he would he in buffalo at the appointed tune
he was not there but was pouring out tha
via s of his wrath upon us at auburn
adding to the sin of his breach of faith with
his buffalo brethren bvfabricating falsehoods
against us from such teachers of morality
and religion we say in the language of the
book of common prayer gout lorditc
liver us the whole philippic of mr gar
net delivered against u at auburn mft tis
sue of dishonesty and falsehood from begin
ning to end he tells liiydiparars that we
are opposed to giving the slave the bible but
has not the honesty to say that we are in favo t
of giving bibles to free men he says we
ridicule religion hut has tin much contempt
for truth to say it is the slaveholders religion
he condemns us as a nonresistant and in
the same speech charges us with holding to
the light of selfdefence he charges us
with saying that the bible would make the
slave wretched and basely leaves the infer
ence to e drawn that we think it pernicious
book when our assailant knows that the re
mark was made as an argument in favor of
giving thr slave himself as the only condition
upon which he could realty own a bible
mr garnet next tiies his venomous toffth
on our esteemed friend and colaborer charles
lenox remond he charges him with
draining the wine cupwith descending
from the consecrated desk and repairing to
the ball chamber denounces him as a
sportsman and warns the people against him
jas a dangerous teacher mr remond is
well known he makes no high pretensions

this is a neatly bound volume of more that
 pages and contains as its title imports
the individual experience of its author this
is illustrated by descriptions of his parentage
i bis occupation the religious tenets of hit
parents the scenery suriounding the place ol
his biith the amusements of his childhood
 his schoolboy days his early impression ol
religion his dislike of cruelty to animals
the changes that have taken place in his mind
on various subjects his studying for the min
istry and a great variety of other topics
while the book has little pretension toordei
in its arrangement and is thrown together in
a manner that indicates haste on the part ol
its author it is nevertheless a highly instruct

in bearing this testimony however we can
not withhold an impression which struck us
jon first taking up the book it was a feeling
i of regret that its author had not left the pre
paration and publication of his biography to
other hands mr wright is notan obscure
man his writings and speeches on a variety
of topics have been widely published and
read in this country as well as in europe
one so extensively known and whose public
career has been so marked as las need have
no fears of leaving posterity in datkness
either with respect to his origin or history
he has been the common property of the anti
slavery world during the last sixteen years
and has surrounded himself with a host of
friends who could never have allowed las
memory to slumber in oblivion he would
have been more just to himself if he had
committed this work into other hands but

new york  spruce sr
after waiting several weeks we here re
ceived a copy of this little work why it did
not come to band sooner we do not know
unless iu author felt it proper to serve a
black editor last although we dislike the
principle thus acted upon we arc disposed to
do justice to his book it is certainly one of
the most interesting and thrilling narratives of
slavery ever laid before the american people
the exposure which the author makes ot the j
horrors of slavery the separations the
yrhippings and the accumulated outrages in
flicted on the sdve must stir the blood of
every reader who has the pulsations ot a mao
the description of the slaves longing for
freedomof his deception tricks and strate
gems to escape hts oonditioo is just though
humiliating his narrations of the cruelty of
individual slaveholders is natural and we
doubt not in every essential particular true
we deem the work a most valuable acquisi
tion to the anti slavery cause and we hope
that it may be widely circulated throughout

gray objected that there were many persons
still more deserving amongst the agricultural
poor who would be glsd of the opportunity
the argument is conclusive and goes to show
how wide spread is the destitution amongst
the laboring classes in england and how ne
cessary it is that some liberal and comprehen

their relief the present mayor of london

himself popular by giving entertainments to
the literary men of the metrop lis and the

railways and steamboats have become the
means of very frequent interchange of civili
ties between england and her gallic neighbor
twice every week excursions start from lon
don to the french capital this is a new
feature of the times and must have a very
important bearing upon the relations of those

amity and mutual understanding must be
greatly promoted thereby let this friendly
intercourse continue and extend to other
nations and kings and governments and
those who make a trade of war will find it

the nonconformist has the following remarke
on this subject
time and events have wrought this sig
i nificant change for many a day the char
tists have had to chew over in sient
rumination their past indiscretions physical
force has been discovered to be but a miser
able substitute for moral and peaceful agna
tion events both at home and abroad have
j been reading a continuous and pertinent lecture
upon the folly of linking a great political
question with violence doctrines of this
class have rapidly died out in fact reverses
have wrought a happy internal revolution
mong the chartists deeprooted prejudice
i against the middle class is beginning to give
way and the truth that the union of the two
classes is absolutely necessary to the accom
plishment of a great political change is
making quick march into iheii judgment
i men begin to suspect that there may be a
little wisdom beyond the back parlors and
drawingrooms of the time and strange to
 say even surmise that a man wearing a
seedy coat may be trusted with the franchise
a little longer continuance of this process
and the powers that be will be startled at
a united people in the attitude of a quiet and
peaceful determination to redress their
wrongs

gagging policy ot despotism and of those
whose actions will not bear scrutiny has re

when hook into the multitude of faces before
me the question comes for vvliat purpose
have we here assembled  and  venture to
assert that i speak your sentiments negative
ly when  say that we did not come here to
make an ostentatious show or to give counte
nance to any new theory or doctrine deroga
lory to our interest or the well being of the
human race neither did we come here to
plant the seed of discord nor to injure or
excite bitterness in hearts already too deeply
i wronged not to lay violent hands upon
long cherished customs or usages let them be
clothed in ever so black a garb of injustice
and villainy not to malign the errorsana
lyse the designor ask for retributive justice
for the conduct of others and for which our
hearts bleed but to celebrate an event
lightly as it may now lie esteemed by millions
of the human race unequalled in its accom
plishments ami suceedtng results by any oth
er recorded in ancient or modern history
the immediate and unconditional emancipa
tion ol  human beings from the most
deplorable state of abject servitude to freedom
this event has filled the souls of every phil
anthropist with joy and gladness and every
lover of music has sung it in glad stra ns of
the finest melody
without further preliminaries  shall pro
ceed to notice some of the prominent reason
why we should rejoice on an occasion like
this and make an application ot it to our
own circumstances if we look back but fif
teen years we see nearly one million ot
humau beings inhabiting a small group ot
islands a few days journey on the westward
atlantic coast writhing under all the bar
barity of that pseudochristian refinement
which reduces humanity to a elate of chattlu
ism they were compelled to work from
youth to old age late and early under the
lash of an overseer without remuneration
badly fed c lothed and lodged deprived ot
social enjoyments wile ami husband parents
tnd children friend and relations torn asunder
at will by the lordly tyrant religion and
inoraluy disregarded and despised education
forbidden protection wit wield from the wife
and daughter their tender flesh lacerated by
the whip their persons violated in short
all that can buoy upihe human soul and make
life desirable all that they could grtup m
expectancy yea all ihat reiaied to the bappi
ness ot the parent or children or their child

this is but a faint picture ot the sad condition
of those whose happy redemption we this
day rejoice to celebrate
we have reason to rejoice that from such
a condition the day dawned in light and
erty kindling w thin the flame of hope and
joy of bright prospects and future happiness
an any one with the most vivid imagination
who has never felt the iron of slavery in his
soul portray the first dawn of joy lighting
up the soul of the redeemed slave  through
offering and sorrow oppression and wrong
in earlv life the patent whose locks had
blossomed for the gtave was now consoled at
the prospect of seeing hut progeny redeem

through the dim vista of time he could with
the prophets ye see the final redemption of
his race the affectionate mother with b ri
little loved ones around her awakened from
her lethargy to listen to the decree of justice

that this great event and ita practical reaults
gave a new impelua throughout the world ti
the progressive movement for the tnumpha ol
liberty and equality statesmen were
blind lo history they had torgotien that
man was a progressive being that as the
mind unproved the field of action widened
and what satisfied the last generation tails
far short of satisfying the neat pney might
have seen that the principles upon which they
were acting had laid waaie the fairest por

to look on the present as a type o the past

we have assembled to commemorate this day
proves the folly of thi doctrine  he signs
of progress are bold prominent and visible
to all but the bigoted conservative parties
that have for years been imperturbable upon
the subject of slavery have by it been rent

principles and the age in winch we h ve
there may be some present little accustomed
lo reflect upon the law of equal lights i
will for their fnmeht give you the view o
one or two of those to whom have abeam
alluded on the th day ol march 
general warren in an oration delivered u
v old uutb church boston on the anni
vers ary of the celebalcd boston massacre and
this mas but  hays before bit death on
bunker hill said personal liberty is the
natural right of every man and that proper
ty or an exclusive right to dispose of what
he has honestly acquired by bis ow n labor
necessarily arises therefrom are truths which
common sense has placed beyond the reach of
contradiction and no man or body of men
can without flagrant injustice claim a right
to depose of the persons or acquisitions of
any other man or body of men unless it can
be proved that such a right has arisen from
some compact between the parties in which
it has been explicitly and freely granted
these were the last rushings of an hones
heart a lover of liberty for which his life
pad the foifcit jt us think for a moment
what would be the reflection of our departed
ancestors could they once more be permitted
to review the condition of this countryw hat
wtoum they say in viewr of her dishonor and
disgrace would they not be led to inquire
where and for what purpose were their lives
sacrificed  from whence emanated these
greater evils than those which they rose in
rebellion to oppose  ah raethinks they would
be ashamed f their country that they would
say tar better that she should have retained
hsr former position rather than hold the one
sh now occupies and be guilty of so flagrant
an act of injustice to one sixth portion of her
citizens if on that subsequent monday to
august th  when the pinta connected
with the fleet of columbus broke her rudder
a tornado bad passed over them and con 
signed the whole fleet to a watery graveit
might have averted not only the calamities
which betel the aborigines of the newly dis
overed continent but those which have be
fallen our race lor two centuries the histo
ry of which the man who has a heart to feel j
or human suffering would hiriuk from with j
lorror and disgust one fact alone will give
iou some idea sixty thousand indian fami
ics were reduced in less than six years to four
cen thousand entertaining as they did so
ioble and just a sense of their manhood that
atherthan be enslaved and compelled to work
n the mines those who did not die from
irutal treatment and suffering preferred death
o slavery thousands ended their earthly
ateer by taking poison it might also have
iverted the damning curse of three fourths
if a century of the most spurious repub
licanism and we might have been exempted
rom celebrating the birth day of freedom to
ight hundred thousand of the human race
from abject servitude better had the dis
overies of the spanish and portuguese never
been made and all efforts ceased at the death
of isabella rather than the disastrous con
sequences which have ensued from that
hour when the pinta touched at st salva
dor and those daring mannors of colum
bus fleet fell prostiate and kissed the
newly discovered continent a portent
tous cloud of slavery and death has hung over
the new world and from the fatal battle of
vega heal spanish rapacity and thirst for
conquest have propagated this ungodly sva
tern not satisfied with laying waste this
garden of the new woild and by oppressive
treatment and cruelty exterminating these na
tions by forced labor but this easy conquest j
led them lo ravage other countries and drag into
honess servitude millions of our race this
jisc very nursed and brought into being all
die wotst depravity of the human heart which
irose among the natives to such a height of
n sole lit and heaven daring outrage that noth
ng short of the vengeance from the throne of j
the eternal could arrest its progress but west
india emancipation has rolled back the tide it j
was a death blow to mock republicanism it
applied the antidote and w rought out a change
in the public mind which will sweep awayi
the last veslige of servitude and place all
men upon the equality which the f reator in
tended
you see from this fellow countrymen there
is much depending upon the efforts of re
formers they have had much to do in all
ages of the world in moulding the various
elements of society if they appear at the
dawn of a nations existence they will blend
an untold influence with her lesser light that
will load her unto future glory strengthening
and lightening the effulgence of preceding
ages but let them appeal at the declining
of her glory when thick darkness has gath
ered around all her piospecis and like the
character that john stebbins lee mentions
who filled ihe chief office of state under  be
udoiio the gothic emperor in the former part
of the tth century can only lengthen for
a season the impending danger ere the night
of sleep closes in upon her he tells us afier
the devoted patriotism of cincinnatusc ocletes
and virginia gave way to the sensuality of j
her casars and the land once made so sacred
by human prowess gave way to effeminacy
debauchery and crime boethius arose and
flourished for a short season calmly he con
templates w hile all is desolation around i
like true reformers of the presant age he
was looked upon as an enemy to the race bej
cause he told the iruth and like the philoso
pher of athens fell a victim to those whose
welfare he would promote great and good
men of the lflth century in this our native
land like boethius of old have also filled a mar
tyrs grave for defending the right and
grappling with the tyrant oppressor
it h true as i before remarkedthat slavery
had brought our country to the verge of
turn but the star of her dedination had not
fully set while the hand of retributive
justice was upraised to smite her signs of
redeeming mercy appeared ever since we
have heard of the well garrisoned host send
ing forth their liberty loving appeals to awake
this guilty nauon visible signs also appeared
that all was not lostthat there was sufficient
virtue to stay its pro gross while kingdoms
principalities and poweis in monarchical and
priest ridden lands are shaking off their bur
dens and rending asunder the chains of
oppression slow as may be our advance
march it will be accomplished if rome
can be redeemed after more than twelve
centuries of the most degraded oppressive
and tyrannical misrule by extending equal
rights and privileges to all her subjects what
stronger evidence do we need that we are
onward f blame me fellow countrymen when
i say that if i did not believe ibis  would
teach other doctrine i would recommend oth

insult and abuse  read in the countenances

again let me say to those who claim a
arge share in this reformatory work you
nav designate those to whom  refer by the
trong claim they make to jeffersonian pnnci

dvance of their stronger political opponents
et need a more thorough study of his views

in virginia speaks thus the whole com

petual exercise of the most boisterous pas

art and degrading submission on ihe other
and with what execration should the states

if the other transforms those into despots
nd these into enemies des oys the morals
if one part and the patriotism of the other
le further adds can the liberties of a nation

wrath  indeed i tremble for my country
vhen  remember that god is just and that
lis justice will not always sleep that the
almighty has no attribute which can take

iavc you o wretched mortals condemned
yourselves as it were to the inipes and the

questions w re not such as to compel me to
told views hostile to the majority of my fel
ow countrymen i speak because i feel
hat the hour has arrived when we must not
only see right but act right let action
iction now be ihe watchword
one thought more and i have done there
ire at the present day but few in the north or
rauth but acknowledge the evil of slavery
ind that it ought to ire abolished hut the
propriety of the course pursued in w est in
iia emancipation thousands are ready to de
iy what is the uue history of these islands
line emancipation but uninterrupted peace
rantentment and improvement  out of the

irisen the neatly finished dwelling and the
arge country mansions out of the degraded
slaves have arisen the free and industrious
andholders farmers and mechanics the
irotectors and guardians of all the virtues that
an safely ensure the well being of society
recently read some statistics from the pen
f some demagogue aspirant after fame
drawing as an argument against immediate
mancipation that the exports from the w est
ndies had fallen off since the slaves were
released bui to my mind this is a conclu
dve argument in its favor would it have
een wonderful when those who constituted
he great mass of the population came into full
mssession of all the natural and social ad
antages of the country that their consump
ion had made a home market for even all
heir former exports  had not the act of
emancipation been a stimulant for increased
abor and brought out a greater product from
he soil as also from various other channels
nstead of falling off a small percentage large
importation would have been needed for home
consumption in addition to their former ex
ports but the most significant fact in
relation to it is that instead of a falling
off there was in some places a manifest in
irease it appears by an official statement
that the quarter of the year after emanci
pation exceeded the quartet of the three
years preceding it in leniaiara twenty pel
cent bcrbice  per cent of tho gieal staple
of her exports and on the article of coffee
alone  cent this ha been the happy
effect of emancipation in the west indies
in all the instances of lardy justice done to
the slave not one drop of blood has followed
as the result of the immediate emancipation
in view of these facts and as friends to the

an appeal in behalf of the western
new york antislavery fair
earnestly desiring the abolition of slavery
n this land and being deeply convinced that
his result can only be accomplished by renew
d efforts to change our present corrupt metal j
icntiment the undersigned members and
ttends of the western new york antislavery
society again make their appeal to the
rienda of the slave inbehalf of their annual
bazaar which will be held in rochester in
decembbr next
while we have been cheered and gladdened
y the progress already made and the good
ilready done and while we rejoice to observe
that friends have been raised up to plead the
cause of the bondman among persons and in
juatters where we had least expected them
wc still see the harvest to be great and the
laborers to be few and instead of relaxing
our efforts we are impressed with a sense of
the duty of doubling our diligence anu ap
plying more closely our energy to the means
of advancing this holy causewe appeal lhej
more boldly to our friends because those for
whom we plead cannot plead for themselves
while we are surrounded by our domestic
circle with none to molest or make us afraid i
there are three millions of men and women m 
our own land doomed to abject slavery and
chains robbed of every rightcivilsocial
personaland political remembering those
in bonds as bound with them we desire to
plead their cause as though they were on our
own limbs and the knotted lash were applied
to our own backs
while to obtain means for enlightening the
public mind is the strong motive for holding
our annual fair it is not the only one a
great amount of good may he traced directly
to such occasions many who are now ac
tive workers in behalf of this holy movement
became first interested in it through the in
strumentality of those annual exhibitions of
antislavery industry tact and skill
the present object of the rochester anti
slavery bazaar is for the general enlighten
ment of the public mind on the subject of sla
very recognizing the north starpublished
in ibis city as an efficient anwlavery in
strumentality we propose that the funds
raised by the sale of articles at the bazaar
on behalf of which we here appeal shall be
mainly appropriated to the suppport of that
important paper
we graiefully acknowledge the prompt as
sistance rendered to our last fair by our
friends and coadjutors in various parts of our
own state wisconsin and michigan and we
earnestly solicit their continued cooperation
with us in tho good work that no time may
be lostwe especially recommend to them the
immediate formation of sewing circles in their
various towns with a view to making articles
fur the rochester bazaar wc would also
in this connection render our heartfelt thanks
to our briiish friends for the valuable aid ex
tended by them to our last years fair and
we would again warmly solicit their generous
assistance it is due to our transatlantic
friends to say that for much of the interest felt
in our last bazaar we were indebted to them
and we are persuaded that their continued
cooperation will essentially promote the suc
cess of our approaching december bazaarand
the advancement of the cause of the slave in
our land
we hope that the foregoing appeal will

the fair will be held on christmas week
we extract the following from a new
and interesting work entitled the
canton chinese or an americans so
journ in the celestial empire
the summer dress of the common
orders is simple in the extreme the
eternal jacket is looped almost invaria
bly over the light breast with little
gilded balls and the pantaloons being
made very large at the middle as well
as below they dexterously wreath a
portion around the waist confining it
by folds instead of following the bar
barous custom of wearing suspenders
the dresses are of blue cotton or a
stuff resembling coarse crash
those who are thus attired seldom
wear stockings or shoes but in rainy
weather they invest themselves with
high heeled slippers that clatter on the
pavement like the sabots of the french
peasantry
their enormous summer hats of
strips of bamboo are six feet or more
in circumference forming a striking
feature in the laborers costume
the females of the same rank wear
them also and at a short distance in the
fields it is difficult to distinguish them
from tha men but the dress of the la
borer however common or ugly it may
be resembles little that of tne higher
classes of citizeus or civil officers
the great heat of six months of the
year compels all persons to adopt as
light a garment as possible and this is
no doubt one of the many causes of the
general good health of the chinese
their dresses admitting of a perfect de
velopment of their limbs
a blue or brown silk gown long and
flowing leaving the neck bare short
breeches tied at the knees stockings
and shoes make up the ordinary cos
tume but think not reader that by
stockings are meant those knit and
close fitting articles of german nr eng
lish importation with which we asso
ciate the name of hose oh no those of
a chinese gentleman are of woven
cotton gartered with blue ribbon and
set loosely in a series of green wrinkles
these are introduced not into highly
polished boots but thrust into clumsy
shoes of cloth or batin or variegated
velvet with enormous soles
the fan is indispensable for in sum
mer the caps of the respectable portions
of the community are doffed and their
bare heads would be unsheltered from
the sun were it not for the use of these
graceful articles which are held in the
right hand over the head often it is
elegantly embroidered painted with
figu les and landscapes or inscribed
with a maxim from confucius in the
warin months the grass cloth for which
the chinese are justly celebrated is
also used extensively for dresses and
the light cool material appears to great
advantage on the person of a gentle
man
one of the most elegant of the chi
nese that i ever saw was a tea mer
chant and from the style of his dress
its fineness of texture and the polished
demeanor of the man it was evident to
the mot heedless observer that the
exquisito existed in china as well as
elsewhere
over an under garment of figured
silk flowed this graceful grasscloth
toga looped with gilded balls and ai
the right breast was suspended a flilh
purse inbroidered with pearls a bril
liant fan case hung at the left side and
as a counterpart a watch and worked
pouch appeared upon the right a
grasscloth handkerchief the finest ol
chinas loom was held in the leli
hand which was in itself beautified
by nails of several inches growth the
other waved a gorgeous fun the
stockings were snowy white and the
shoes were black satin
his face was remarkably handsome
and more expressive than the general
countenance of his race the pointed
jet moustaches were the admiration ol
all the foreign clerks of canton and
his fine long tail descending nearly to
his feet was an especial object of envy
to his countrymen
the dresses which we have given a
description of are well adapted for a
burning climate and are worn till quite
late in the autumn
but towards november when in the
square the broad ensign of america
waves in the blast of the northwest
monsoon there is a universal and si
multaneous change in the costumes
the chief officer of the province puts
on a winter dress assumes the skull
cap with its scarlet button and all the
inferior millions follow his example
the appearance of the low orders is
little changed but in the upper the dif
ference is very perceptible
the loose gown is now drawn at the
waist by a sash with fringed ends
hanging down behind and over this is
worn a large cape of figured silk or
cloth but usually of furs
a mantle made from the skin of a
lamb taken from its mother before birth
is very highly prized now it is that
the fan case watch and purse are
seen to the best advantage and the
blue cap and scarlet button give that
finish to the winter garments which
those of the summer require for beauty
none but goverment officers wear hats
during the hot season except those la
borers who are exposed to the sun
the summer habits of the mandarins
are beautiful frequently they wear a
long gown of blue gauze drawn at the
waist black satin boots and the decor
ated appendages before mentioned
which make altogether a very striking
show their hats are then of white
braid conical in shape surmounted
with a ball indicative of rank and
adorned w ith a falling plume of shining
scarlet hair
during the winter their state robes
are stiff with gorgeous embroidery
 hose ol the highest mandarins are
splendid in the extreme being worked
m brilliant hues on superb silks of the
finest texture their shoes are orna
mented also one of the onncipal fig
ures being the imperial dragon
n iie i b ck arul breast of me
dresses is the figure of a bird enclosed
and lhc cklace of one
h  d gb beads
of bright gat qua or
fumed wood ala accompanied a
atate coume the mandarin
cap is utterly different from that of the
summer it is usually or dark blue
velvet fitting close to thebhad with
broad edge turning up all around and
instead of the hair plume it is furnished
with one of scarlet silk
the ball always worn except in case
of mourning is red blue white crystal
or gold according to rank and these
varieties with some other insignia dis
tinguish the nine grades of mandarins
the peacocks feather is an honor
granted for signal merit and it is
worthy of note that such marks of fa
vor are seldom or never bestowed un
less well deserved the privilege of
wearing a state dress may indeed be
purchased for an immense sum but this
confers no rank nor honor the aris
tocracy of talent and not of wealth
bears sway in china
judging from a few specimens of
splendor to be seen in a city so remote
from the court as canton there must
be a vast deal of wealth and magnifi
cence at the capital and the accounts
of old travellers as well as of later em
bassies speak of state and pomp w orthy
of so immense an empire
never was there a country in which
tailors have been so completely sub
dued as in china not one of the
class ventures to originate a fashion
for the costumes of the nation are regu
lated at court by a board of officers
from whose decrees no one dares to
dissent
the common order of the females
dress much like the men but the visitor
who walks from the western factories
towards the western part of canton
passing through retired streets only oc
cupied by the houses of wealthy chi
nese will often see the ladies walking
beautifully attired in rich silks and
with children or servants in company
their dress conceals the person en
tirely the long gown or toga fits close
around the neck and has loose sleeves
enveloping the hands
their heads are uncovered and their
style of coiffure is singular and usually
thought becoming
the front hair of unmarried females
is combed straight hack with the ex
ception of the small portion hanging
over the forehead
the other portion of the hair is
combed and braided into a tail like the
mens but no part of the female head is
shaved
when married or shortly before the
whole hair is combed up and a false
piece set on the back of the head
fastened by clasps and pins of gold oi
other less precious material according
to the wealth of the fair one a beau c
tiful ornament is sometimes worn by
rich women representing a bird with
extended wings which formed of golc
or silver filagree studded with pearls
and supported by light wires trembling
with the slightest motionseems to hovei
over the head of the lady
what need of the long wide panta
loons of the chinese ladies to con
ceal their feet they have none foi
service and hobble along more awk
wardly than a child first learning tc
walk soon as the female ehild is born
its feet are enclosed with shoes anc
bound firmly round and round so that
no growth can ensue nature en
deavoring to have its way can onlj
produce exquisite torture os each
tempt proves useless
how these females ever learn to stunt
or move is strange yet as we have ob
served they may sometimes he seen it
the streets supporting their trembling
limbs with a staff
models in clay of the contracted feet
painted flesh color and set into shoes ol
the same size as those actually worn
are sold in canton as curiosities
the large toe fits into the point oi
the shoe and the others instead of be
ing in their natural positionare jammec
and driven into the side of the foot ap
i pearing one directly behind the other
it is as though the foot was cut off jusi
below the ancle joint and the stuim
sharpened to a point
the custom is exclusively chinese
and is not followed even by the mau
chou tartars who being the last
asiatic conquerors of china have
adopted many of its customsand whose
emperor nuw wields his despotic scep
tre over one half of the human race
the sexes in china jive mostly apart
the women are uneducated generally
some of the courtezans of the cities
are well taught and skilled in luxurious
and fascinating accomplishments and
among others they sing and play upon
musical instruments brothers and sis
ters after a certain age bid good bye
to each other and though they meet of
course in the bosom of the family
they have little social intercourse
the chinese husband goes out into the
world and attends to his business and
amuses himself as lie pleases but the
wife must stay at home and be content
ed to eat separately and attend to her
children or if her husband is rich
dress in fine style and make her female
neighbors cry their eves out with envy
polygamy is sanctioned and yet a
tnan loses caste in some degree for
every additional wife he takes and
should he venture on half a dozen his
friends would cut him
an old compradure was telling me
once about his domestic felicity he
said i hab got one wife one old ting
good lor noting
i t l e j w on vou marr v another

a great point m chinese happiness
is the number ol children the fortunate
man may boast of the principle they
go upon is n the word of shake
peare ibe world must be peopled
a man with half a dozen sin is
wealthy but winhe same number of
daughters ins porerty  a general
subject of pity i peaking of hi off
spring one will sometimes sav that lie
has three children and if you ask f
any are daughters he will answer yes
tour meaning seven in all ihough he
does not consider the girls worth men
tioning
should the wife prove childless he
eagerly seizes the opportunity of putting
her aside and marrying another
the manners of the chinese espe
cially those of the middling and upper
classes are very pleasing to a stran
ger the low laborers are brutish
enough but among the better classes
a gentility of manners is strikingly ap
parent  r
wbeu you meet a chinese gentle
man he folds his hands and shakes them
at you saying chin chin words of the
cantonchineseanglo jargon signify
ing welcome or thank youor farewell
according to the occasion
if your visit is one of ceremony he
is careful to keep his cap on while you
uncover and seat you of course on his
ica hand
he is so courtier like that he will not
touch the hair a moment before you
and if he perceives that he is doing so
he instantly rises a little then per
haps he treats vou to sweetmeats and
tea the tea is always delicious it
is not contaminated by cream and su
gar he would not condescend to such
a barbarous custom there are no
saucers for cups to stand upon but you
will see that they are on the topof the
cup to keep in the aroma ot the clear
amber colored beverage
a man who never saw a
woman
from visits to monasteries in the
levant a very entertaining book of
travels by robert cruzen we make the
following extract
he was a magnificent looking man
of thirtyfive years of age with large
eyes and long black hair and oeard
as we sat together in the evening in
the ancient room by the light of one
dim brazen lamp with deep shades
thrown across his face and figure i
thought he would have made an ad
i mirable study for titian or sebastian
j del piombo in the course of conver
sation i found that he had learned
italian from another monk having nev
er been out of the penisular of mount
athos his parents and most of the
inhabitants of the village where he was
born somewhere in korneiia but its
name or position he did not knowhad
been massacred during some revolt or
disturbance so he had been told but
he remembered nothing about it he
had been educated in a school in this
or one of the other monasteries and
his whole life had been passed on the
hole mountain and this he said was
the case with very many other monks
he did not remember his mother and
did not scein quite sure that he ever
had one he had never seen a woman
nor had he any idea what sort of things
women were or what they looked like
he asked me whether they resembled
the pictures of the panagia the holy
virgin which hang in every church
now those who are conversant with the
representations of the blessed virgin
in the pictures of the greek church
which are all exactly alike stiff hard
and dry without any appearance of life
or emotion will agree with me that
they do not afford a very favorable idea
of the grace or beauty of the fair sex
and that there was a difference of ap
je arance between black women cir
cassians and those of other nations
which was how r ever difficult to describe
to one who had never seen a lady of
any race he listened with great in
terest while i told him that all women
were not exactly like the picture he had
seen hut  did not think it charitable
to carry on the conversation farther
although the poor monk seemed to have
a strong inclination to know more of
that interesting race of beings from
whose society he had been so entirely
debarred i often thought afterwards
of the singular lot of that manlv and
noble looking monk whether he is still
a recluse either in the monastery or in
his mountain farm with its little moss
grown chapel as ancient as the days of
constantine or whether he has gone
out into the world and mingled with
its pleasures and its cares

northampton water cure
electricity a hydropathy
the important principle ofcutaneou electricity
the discovery of which by the undersigned has
opened so w ide a field for scientific and physiological
investigation though ridiculed and opposed at its
first announcement in  by medical and profes
sedly scientific men being now sustained by eminent
men of philosophic and scientific knowledge and by
tlie experience and testimony of thousands who have
tested his theory by examinations in their ow n cases
the undersigned is confident that this principle ol
natural and physiological law needs only to lie un
derstood to lie justly appreciated by an intelligent
and investigating public
sustained by such testimony and more than five
years practiraf experience as a diagnosian and hy
 dropatiiist the undersigned would here repeat the
conulusion at which he has arrived by the sense ol
touch ist that the human body in a healths
condition is iu a positive tuctricnl stair d that
there are electrical emanations from the euticlar
surface indicative of health or the nature and
symptoms of disease d that in all case where
the wrist stomach or lungs are iu  electroposi
tive state however distnrlied there is hope of a
cure but when the parts of the body alluded to ate
in the electronegative state hydropathy can afford
no relief
had not the results of hi practice already con
vinced the public of the truthfulness of the principles
by which the undersigned is governed in detecting
the nature and symptoms of disease the recent pli
losophical and scientific demonstration of their cor
i redness by professor means of georgia and mr
i  lleinmer of england and the facts and corroliora
tive testimony adduced by lr forbes mr smee
and others should i sufficient to convince the most
sceptical
gratefully appreciating the credit so generously
awarded for his success as a diagnostic and hy
dropathic practitioner by a discerning public and
tlie gratitude evinced by those w hom he has had the
pleasure to relieve of their complaints the under
signed will endeavor to merit tlie  of all
who may afford him an opportunity to effect a cure
by his vi rginal and philosophical method of practice
