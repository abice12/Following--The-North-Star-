the american religion pro
slavery
messrs editors my object iri di
recting the attention of your readers tc
the proslavery tendency of the protes
tant religion ol this country is to trace
its effect on the moral intellectual so
cial and civil condition of the colored
optilation with the hope of divorc
ing from their minds the fatal impres
sion that by embracing said religion
abey are espousing the cause of human
freedom if i can successfully demon
strate this truth in my opinion one
of the most formidable obstacles to oui
future advancement will he removed
therefore i assert that the p rotes
tant religion is note and has been cvei
since the days of the reformation op
posed to the religious natural civil ant
social equality of the colored peoplt
with the whites it has assumed tlia
we were by nature nml a law o
providence a distinct and inferior peo
pic that ought to be subject to th
rule and dominion of those wlion
god in ins wisdom had made superior
nd assigned the duty ol a guurdianship
ivcr us and our posterity forever tie
protestant sects have united in proinot
ing this doctrine for upwards ot a cen
tury and it may now be regarded a
inseparable from their creed there
fore every individual that embraces sai
religion and lives in obedience to it
teachings must from the very natur
of his education and theological views
imbibe its spirit and principles
hence i maintain that it ought not t
be a matter of surprise to find the col
red people religiously occupying
proslavery position the kind of ed
ucation and religion we have obtained
has placed us on our present platform
therefore i cannot hurl denuncia
lory anathemas against the colore
churches and clergy as being hypo
critical because they occupy a pro
slavery position on the contrary i
is to my mind a distinguished mark o
loyalty to the church when i see it
members taking sides with our oppres
aors and if the term hypocrite right
fully belongs to any class of our people
it is to those who arc sufficiently en
lightened to see the evil of their position
und still embrace it for the majority
who cling to those ancient laudmarks
i entertain sentiments of regard fo
their welfare whilst my pity for thei
ignorance is boundless because the
know not the evil they do
from the period of the america
revolution to the present hour hist or
asserts that the leaders in every inora
movement for the benefit of the liuinai
family have been denounced as beinj
cither of fanatical temperament or het
rodox in faith the greut ruling idea
that gave birth to the declaration o
american independence was oppose
to the legitimate doctrine of the di
vine right ol kings and would neve
have sprang from the church or beei
nurtured by a spirit of loyalty to eithei
the civil or ecclesiastical government o
the mother country
i he pilgrim lathers crossed the oceai
lor the purpose of establishing a rcli
oon on that would vindicate the ri  ht o
man to govern himself free from thi
restraints of ecclesiastical intolerance
and governmental persecution impel i
cd by the dictates of our common na
tures they directed their course west
ward and after landing on the shore
of this paradiseal eden they form
ed a standard of religion for tliernshvi
and their posterity ami a g neratiot
cradled in the wilderness of the new
world vindicated sanctified and adopt
ed it
the convention of  by adopting
the north star
the bold infidel doctrine that all mei
were created tree and equal iiurlet
the keystone of divinity from the deca
logue of protestantism and with it thorn
magic charms that had for centurici
subjected the people of different nation
to the despotic rule of kings and prin
ces the pilgrim fathers have give
us an illustrious example for gioriou
imitation by repudiating the religion o
their oppressors and adopting one thai
was more congenial to their free spirits
but vindicated their interest and self re
spect and if we ever adopt the princi
ples and practice the spirit of freemen
we will do likewise they
forward to the mother church kjk
modern joshua that would

based their right to life liberty and
the pursuit of happiness on authorities
that had existed antecedent to church
organizationsthe rights of nature that
was imprinted on the heart of man
on the first mooring of his existence
the same in all times and in all
ages this revolution was not ac
complished by a reverential and wor
shipful obedience to the church its pi
oneers were not bishops prelates
laymen or those learned lawyers in
the service of the crown it was per
formed by men professing higher and
holier aspirations for freedom than evei
breathed through the nostrils of the
knights of the gown or garter
it sprang from natures noblemen
the jclfersons the adamss the paines
the franklins and others who were the
infidels of their own times and the or
thodox of coming generations with
them the motto was liberty first now
and forever they made their reli
gion sanctify right to freedom while
ours crucifies it
this faithful adherence to the funda
mental right of man to exist on this
globe brought them into a powerful
collision with the powers that be
and resulted in a prodigal expenditure ol
blood and treasure yet in this instance
 victory perched upon the banner of the
faithful in this conflict protestantism
after losing a portion ol her power
made a base appeal to the avarice and
cupidity of our infant nati n the first
born of the earth from a divine parent
age yet wrapped in swaddling clothes
and dictated a compromise that ought to
have been an insult to her virgin purity
she was successful and loathsome dis
grace and dishonor followed the foul
embrace
the substance of the compromise was
simply this that the divine right of
kings should he abrogated on this con
tinent and the divine l ight of complex

dear douglass when  last saw
you  promised to notice some of the
doings of that notorious wolf in sheeps
clothing kcv j b pinney who has at
intervals for many years passed through
the country doing the dirty work ol
slaverys bidding under the garb ol
philanthropy as agent of the american
colonization society he has finally
made his debut in a series of four lec
tures before an audience of from o to
iou a portion of which were those that
do not sympathise with his darling
scheme the base ingratitude mani
fested towards tlte colored peoplt
throughout his lectures justly mer
its the disapprobation of every honesl
american  would go at length tc
show up his false position were i not
acquainted with the fact that the menu
and demerits of the colonization socie
ty have years since been analysed anc
that it has received its everlasting quie
tus so far as the realization of the end
in view is to be obtained
he introduced himself by a mournful
appeal with uplifted hand to iieaven
to assist the colonization society it
doing something for the down trodden
and abused negro he made but very
little progress in his remarks before he
got off the track of his unbounded be
nevolence by appealing to the prejudi
ces of the people of the impossibility
of the colored mans being elevated in
this country and whether any of the
audience or even the most humble
among the whites would be willing thal
the most intelligent among the colored
men should marry their daughter that
the slave holders could not emancipate
their slaves and suffer them to remain
at the south that as soon as they re
ceived education they would demand
equal political privileges and their
numbers being much greater than thal
of the whites they w ould become the
law makers and the whites subject tc
the blacks that the whites would nev
er submit to black judges black law
yers see c that this government
was not responsibile for slavery eng
land was the guilty culprit in forcing
it upon us and never ceasing their traf
ic until the law was passed breaking up
the slave trade and then they were
loudest in calling for emancipation
then the abolitionists were complained
of for galling the slaveholders thieves
and robbers and that they ought to be
paid for their slaves irginia be said
always deplored the system and in her
early history more than  were
emancipated and were on the eve ol
final emancipation when the abolition
ists commenced which turned back
the tide ol emancipation and compelled
the south to enact laws prohibiting
emancipations on the soil that the law
was just the blacks were a poor de
graded thievish set of beings conse
quently a law that would be considered
barbarous to inflict over an enlightened
people would be a just oue over those
unenlightenedmeaning the colored
people that they were not fit for liber
ty unless educated he also stated
that the colonization society had no
idea ol tending ail the blacks out ol
right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren
i r ic r h
the country that it was a scheme of
the purest benevolence ever started in
world that no white laborers would
settle in a community cursed with slave
labor that the rapid increase of white
emigrants in this country would at
sotne future day so fill up the south that
they would outnumber the blacks and
then they might legislate for their frec
dom he said c m clay the great
abolitionist told him in conversation
last year when he asked him what he
 would do or what would kentucky do j
when her slaves were emancipated
and hit reply was that he had not givj
en that idea of the subject any constd
jeration no doubt said he they would
become so debased and profligate that
vkyddq dfad become extinct
bufbc did not care for that he was for
benefiting the white man the next
hundred years said he without the
carrying out of his scheme of coloni
zation would then be fotind not three
garrisonian abolitionists across mason
and dixons line but already had
the inhabitants of liberia arisen to
equality with the whites citing as proof
president roberts and others recently
in new york and the attention paid
them by the mayor c of that city
i will not quote further these were
some of his prominent positions as ta
ken in his different lectures i will
 now leave you to comment if you deem
it necessary every careful reader can
sec the unreasonableness and entire
contradiction of his own statements
note two or three he never can be
elevated with the whites already on
i an equality with those who arc in afri
ca poor degraded and profligate but
as soon as transported across the ocean
to africa a heathen country the trans
ition produces all that is noble refined i
and cultivated no white laborers
would settle in a country cursed with
slave labor when the emigrants fill 
ed up the south so as to out number 
the blacks then it would answer to leg
islate for freedom this is a sample ol
that mans reasoning who dr baconl
editor of the day book says that he
not only retains but obtained from birth
some of that blood which he despises
but that he can prove him as well as
roberts the president of the republic
of liberia men of no principle dishon
est and much more of what constitutes
bad men  challenged him to a disj
cushion but of course he refused i
leave him to bis own destruction which
he is rapidly working out i purpose
culling a public meeting next week and
review his argument

lution namely to insert the words

j d patterson here obtained the
floor to object to some expressions used
by m r delany in discussing the d
resolution he argued that those whe
were in the editorial chair and others
not in places of survants must not casl
slurs upon those who were in such pla
ces from necessity he said we know
our position and feel it but w r hen he
heard the doctor that he would
rather receive a telegraphic despatch
that his wife and two childrtn had fall
en victims to a loathsome disease then
to hear that they had become the ser
vants of any man he thought that he
must speak
dr delany replied he meant not
nor did the resolution mean to cast a
slur upon any individual and present
ing in a strong light the resolution and
its reasonableness closed with a hope
that his brother patterson bad been
convinced as he took him to be a minis
ter or student for the ministryand
ministers exert great influence
john l watson of cleveland

us but if we became mechanics etc

frederick douglas took the flo w
he thought ha as far as speakers in

the colored people in the united stales
of north america they as a class are
know n to the country and the intelligent
world alone as menials and domestic

whereas it is apparent as th his
tory of the world both ancient and

an equality of attainments attain

rights
it resolved that slavery is the
greatest curse ever inflicted on man
being of hellish origin the legitimate
offspring of the devil and we therefore
pledge ourselves individually to use
all justifiable means for its speedy and
immediate overthrow
 whereas a knowledge of the
real moral social ami political condi

prosecution of measures for our eleva

ingly difficult therefore

wild unsettled territory  found
large and fertile tracts of government
land in kent and other counties but in
ocoaua and mason counties there arc
peculiar facilities which do not present
themselves in any of the other parts of
the state which i have visited oceana
and mason are lake counties with
about sixty miles seaboard t here are
navigable rivers emptying into lake
michigan and affording at their mouths
good harbors delightful sites for cities
and villages also with hydraulic pow
ers of every magnitude plenty of
land ready for the plow at  per
acie valuable timber may be had
here in abuudance grass is now to be
found from knee high to the height of a
man the surface of the meadows is
a deep vegetable mould below which
in many places are lound beds of lime
fruit fish and game in abundance
also salt springs plaster of paris
has been discovered there during the
last spring a constant trade was kept
up between these lands and chicago
milwaukee and the ports on lake
michigan there are four saw mills in
the two counties lumber is wanted

ilized world therefore
resolved that this convention re
commend to the colored freemen of
north america to use every means in
their power to obtain that science so
as to enable them to measure arms with

strumental in the elevation of a people
here is none more effectual than a
veilconducted and efficient newspaper
ind believing the north star published
ind edited by frederick douglass and
l r delany at rochester fulty to
mswer all the ends and purposes of a

ccommcnd to the colored citizens of
he several free states to assemble in
vlass state conventions annually and
ictition the legislatures thereof to re
teal the black laws or all laws mili
ating against the interests of colored

ind participation in the damning sin of
mcncan slavery as well as cruel pre

iitural and wicked ill the sight of god
and wholly unknown io any country
where slaver does not exist

gaged in the elevation of our people
wc claim it to be our duty to inquire of
our public lecturers and agents an ex

ment of funds they may have collected
from time to time for public purposes
 whereas we fully believe in the
equality of the sexes therefore
resolved that we hereby invite fe
males hereafter to take part in our de
liberations
j  whereas a portion of those of
our colored citizens called barbers by
refusing to treat colored men on equali
ty with the whites do encourage preju
dice among the whites of the several
states therefore
resolved that we recommend to
this class of men a change in tbeir
course of action relative to us and if
this change is not immediately made
we consider them base senriles worthy
only of the condemnation censure and
defamation of all lovers of liberty
i equality and right
the north star
rochester september  
correction a report is in circulation
whence originating it is easy enough to con
ceive that several of the scholars at seward
seminary left the school when they heard
that a colored child was about to be admitted
amongst them this report is wholly with
out foundation not one of them left or
thought of leaving on that account the
facts of the case arc as stated by mr doug
lass in last weeks paer namely that the
i pupils instead of objecting were most will
ing that his daughter should be admitted
and that one only one of their parents was
found unchristian enough uncivilized enough
to oppose her admission and that one was
 g warner editor of the rochester
courier and further when it was found j
that she was uot to be admitted three left the
school andthrce more whom it was intended j
to send there were sent to other achools
where the teachers were not under the influ
ence of an ignorant and unreasoning pre
judicej d
cause and effect
it is a law in physics as it is in morals
that every cause is followed by a fixed and i
unvarying effect in the physical world fire
is always hot ice is always cold no one
in his senses ever thinks of going to an ice
house for warmthto a fire for coolness
so in the moral world the effect does not
more certainly follow the cause expose a
man to evil influencesor rather surround
him from youth upwards with all that is
calculated to debase and brutifyand what
else can be expected of him but that he will
be debased and brutal and will so continue
until other motives are placed before him j
until he is surrounded by other and better in
influences it would be a miracle were he j
otherwise inasmuch as such a manifestation
would be contrary to all the known laws
of natures operations all of course are not
alike influenced by surrounding circumstances
some have a greatersome a less affinity to
vice still the rule is sufficiently unvarying j
as stated by the apoatle paulthat otil i
communications corrupt good manners this
is not less certain than it is that fire gives out
warmth and ice coldness yet a single
glance at our mode of proceedure towards a
portion of the people of this country will be
sufficient to show how far we are from a just j
appreciation of this truth
in the southern states of this union there
are three millions of human being whom it is
criminal to instruct no it will not do to
instruct them say their masters if they
get intelligent we cannot hold them in sla
very they say this and they say it with
truth and to keep those three millions from
claiming what but a little instruction will en
able them to discovernamely the inherent
right of every man to himself and the means
of making good that righttheir truly pious
and godly masters close against them as far
as they have the ability all the avenues to
knowledge and intelligence they keep men
ignorant make them debased and then say
they are not fit for freedom most satisfac
tory logic truly the effect of this viola
i lion of moral law of course follows those
who are thus wickedly excluded from the
means of acquiring knowledge are ignorant
coarse and in too many instances vicious
and a universal demoralization and depraved
i state of public sentiment are the retributive
results and who is to blame for this
that the man should be ignorant w bo has not
been permitted to learu is by no means won j
derful neither is it wonderful that he should
lie vicious if exposed to dt basing influences
the color of the skin makes no difference in
this respect the hack african the red
indian and the w hite european arc ail simi i
larlv affected by being placed in such circum 
stances i he crime and the shame of their
ignorance and debasement attach then not
to those who are the victims of this wicked
ness but to those who perpetrate it
j nor does this selfoverreaching injustice of
the dominant class end here in the north
we find colored men degraded and injured
j they are not provided with sufficient means
of education they are rubbed as far as pos
sible of the ability to procure education for
themselves in some places they are admit
ted into the schools only on sufferance and
in others they are altogether excluded the
consequence of tlus is that they are as a class
more ignorant and less useful than the major
ity of their while fellowcitizens and they
are it is probable as vice is the necessary
concomitant of ignorance also more vicious
who again is to blame for this not the i
innocent victims of the inflicted ignorance
but those who inflict this ignorance upon
them it is tidiculousit is cruelly unjust j
first to force i goo ranee upon them and then
to taunt them with mfenurtty first to
them vicious and then to denounce them as
wicked and unfit for political privileges when
oue of tfiptr number is guilty of a crime

rev henry m wilson minhtir of the
immanuel church n y has written a letter
to the editor of the r ms horn in which he
certifies to the good character borne by prior
foster of the woojstock manual labor
institute he says nothing new however
nor does he attempt either on his own or
mr fosteis authority to answer the
charges made in the north star will mr
foster reply to those charges or is he content
to remain under the imputation of dishonesty
the  full convictions of mr wilson or
of any one else are nq proof in favor of
prior foster he cannot now be allowed to
pass muster on such slender grounds until
a full and satisfactory explanation is given
mr foster cannot blame those who think that
he has used money collected by him for other
purposes than those for which it was given
his explanation will with much pleasure be

threatened the life of wendell phillips and
all will be rejoiced to hear that its violence is
abated and his condition now considered safe
if no unfoitunate change takes place he
was spending the summer at the house of
loring moody when he was seized with the
epidemic dysentery which has been so fatal
along the coast and in other places this sea
son for ten day or a fortnight hisease was
of the most critical kind and his danger most
imminent
nothing but the most assiduous care which
strong affection only can produce could have
saved him such care he had and by its
means we trust that a life so valuable and so
dear is to be given yet longer to the hearts of
his friends and to the hopes of humanity

matters that the north has little mare than a
ehadow of a share left in the government of
the nation the nature of slavery jn to en
croach as long as there is anything to be

solve the union what do freemen want
with slavery and slave states they want
no share of either the sin or the shame or
the profit of the abominable system dis
solve the union yes welcome will bo the
day that the dissolution is consummated it is
perhaps not the only nor the best way by
which to accomplish the deliverance of the

senator foote and abolitionism
it would appear from the following epistle
addressed to the editor of the prisoners
friend by the wouldbe hangmansenator
that at all events he is opposed to capital pun
ishments when inflicted where he does not
himself officiate well that is one step in
progress perhaps he will by and by discover
that the title of jack ketch does not add much
to his respectability and be willing to throw
up his commission
senate chamber july  
dear sirwhen i formed my acquaint
ance with you here i was impressed most
favorably by your demeanor and conversation
several weeks ago i think in your second
number received by rue i discovered some
tokens of the abolition spirit which so dis
satisfied me that  wrote you a letter enclos
ing the offensive paper and requested you to
send no other number of the same i reflected
upon the philanthropic object of your paper
and determined to tear up the letter and wait
for fun her developments the nnmbcr just
leceived satisfies me that i cannot longer as
a southern senator continue to take the
prisoners friend i beg leave therefore to
return the numlier now transmitted with the
assurance that my conduct is dictated by no
personal illwill be kind enough to send
your account for the numbers heretofore re
ceived i will pay it promptly

christian slaveholders t
is it possible no it is not the follow
ing extract from the utica christian contrib
utor would give us to understand that a man
may at one and the same time be a christian
and a slaveholder sorry indeed should we
be to entertain such a low estimate of chris
tianity it does not appear to ua more para
doxical or absurd to speak of a pious devil or
an honest rogue than it doe to speak of a
christian slaveholder our present object
however is not to argue this question but
simply to show on the authority of the con
tributor to what an extent slavery is sustained
and practised by the different religious denom
inationsespecially by the methodists bap
tists and presbyterians ichabod
christians and slaverya published
calculation how accurate we do not know
stales that  slaves are held by meth
odists  by baptists and  by
presbyterians add  to all other de
nominations and you have  slaves
held by religious men the average number
to each may be about ten which will give us
 religious men holding slaves what
ought these religious slaveholders to do
some will say immediately and at all haz
ards emancipate their slaves others will
any go to work immediately and with earn
estness as citizens of the country to procure
the rep al of the laws others will cay
commence immediately and sincerely the
work of giving instruction to the slaves to
prepare them for freedom but will any in
telligent christian say that these 
slaveholders are discharging their duty while
eating and wasting ibe earnings of their
slaves aud making no effort in auy way to
give them their freedom
since the above was written we see that
the national era estimates all the riavehold
era in the united states at  which
would give about the same proportion be
tween slaves and slaveholders as the above
calculation think of the immense mischief
which these  slaveholders are doing in
the midst of a population of

fully printed and ably edited paper has been
discontinued for want of palionage wcare
sorry for it was one of our best exchanges
the editor has a long wellwritten valedicj
tory which lie closes with the following pithy
hints to printers
to ail printers i have a word of advice
and it shall be given with aa unction if you
are asked to start a newspaper dont rely on
verbal promises to obtain subscribers calcu
fota all the expenses of the enterprise omit
ting no items that you can think of aud then
multiply the aggregate by two then esti
mate the probable income setting down each
item at the lowest point that may be named
by the most esutious of all your friends di
vide the aggregate by two and if the latter
product equals the first go ahead otherwise
have no inure to do with the project than you 
would with the small pox or the cholera if
my experieoee will enable me to keep others
from burning their fingers i shall not be left

the ehtor of the nnw york day book
has published several articles on liberia and
coloniaanon from which extracts relating to
j the retr j b pinney were made io a recent
number of the north star these articles
also furnish startling evidence of the fact that
the officers and agents of the colony have
been deeply implicated in the slave trade
true it is some time since the occurrence of
the events which he relates but up to the
present day there is no evidence to show that
either the spirit or the practice of those con
cerned in that alfiur are in any material de
gree improved the revelations here made
are neither worse nor better than might have
been expected from a society some of whose
most prominent men are slaveholders says
the editor of the day book
the public will bo impressed with the
fact that a prominent member of the baptist
denomination in liberia was openly engiged
in the slavctrade was in the employ of r dro
i bianco in  and that this business was
frcclv tolerated in liberia without censure or
question from ain body at the very time when
the colonization agents in this country were
demanding money from the deceived benevo
lent public on the ground that the colony of
liberia was the most efficient means for the
suppression of the african slavctrade all
tbw is admitted and if it were denied it could
habmsly proved
mmr of the delegation payne states
thwpß was not engaged in the slave trade at
any me and was not at new sweaters in
 this is probably true and he may be
exonerated from this particular charge but
in correcting the day books crroi why did
he not go on and show that it was his brother
that was in the employ of the siavetraders at
new sesters this mr paynes brother a
little younger than he and very strongly re
sembling hun in appearance did with the
knowledge and approval of his relatives en
gage as an auxiliary to the slavctrade and
was at new sesters at the time specified
his mothers house was the regular stopping
place for the spanish and portuguese slave
traders when they visited monroviawho were
i in fact the principal support of the family
if this mr payne inherited or even received
any money from his mother he must have
partaken of the profits of the slavetrade
the editor of the day book not being suffi
ciently familiar with the initials of the two
paynes had supposed that the brother whom
he knew at new sesters was the person sub
sequently ordained as pastor they were
both very good young men nephews of the
pastor of the baptist church and most of ihe
family were quite religious according to the
liberian standard
but now will mr pavne or any of the
agents of the colonization society who know
anything about the facts venture to say that
church members in liberia did not at that
time freely aid and promote the slavctrade
whenever they could find cmploytne t from
the siavetraders will they contend tint it
was considered immoral or improper to do so
or that there could have been any church cen
sure applied to a communicant who subsisted
entirely upon he money made by him in the
slavetrade there wes never a word of cm
sure uttered by any liberian against those thus
employed the pastor of the baptist church
at that time the rev colin teage uncle of
mr p avne was employed at the same time
j with john n lewis to store cargoes for
i pedro blanco his storehouse was also a
depot for siavetraders and he received plenty
j of money from blanco without hesitation
there were dozens and scores of liberian
christians actively and joyfully engagtd in
the slave trade without any more compunc
tion than they would have felt about the palm
oil trade
it is a notorious fact in africa that the
colony of liberia was for two years an im
portant auxiliary to the slavctrade and that
ihe facilities and conveniencics of the sla
vers were vastly increased by it the span
 ish and portuguese siavetraders were alj
ways heartily welcomed and were ihe most
popular men that ever visited liberia
their company was considered a great
honor and favor and all were eager for their
notice
it should be know n too by ihe people of
this country that the liberian colonists them
selves freely bought and owned slaves at that
time and undoubtedly som them to their span
ish and portuguese visitors when they could
get a goxl price in doubloons for thorn espe
cially in the starving times so often occurring
there of the latter point however the w ri
ter has no posiiive proof of the fact that the
colonists professed christians bought and
held slaves without scruple there can be no
denial by any man of truth who has lived in
liberia and become familiar with the cus
toms morals and habits of the people there
the editor of the day book was advised and
strongly urged by a prominent and most re
spectable and religious liberian high in office
to purchase two slaves for his household on
account of the difficulty of retaining free na
tives for any considerable length of lime in one
steady employment
the dr also accuses president roberts
of having been connected with tho slavetrade
while residing in liberia to this roberts
replies
bacon accuses me of being employed in
 as the agent employee and factor of
pedro blanco the greatest aiavetrader on the
coastand that i was employed by him blanco
to purchase vessels in sierre leone to be used
as slavers
now sir to be short  emphatically do
elare that i never saw or corresponded with
pedro blanco in my life i have never been
employed at any time by him or any other
slaver either directly or indirectly as an
agent employee or factor or in any oihei way
during my residence in africa
to this defence dr bacon thus responds
he says he never corresponded with pe
dro blanco in his life uundouhtedly true
he never saw him if by corresponding he
means that he never wrote a letter to him or
received one from him that rnay be true also
but there arc other ways of corresponding
than by writing it is very evident that a
letter from pedro blanco who knew only the
spanish language could not have been read
by joe roberts who knew no language but
the english and a letter to the latter would
be equally unintelligible the former their
transactions therefore must have been earned
on through some medium which the gov
ernor docs not suppose to be included
under the terra correspondence there
were some very peculiar and forcible rea
sons why he never taw or coneonded with
pedio blanco who never visited any place on
the whole coast except galinhas where was
the center of bis business and where hw power
uas irresistible joe roberts could not nsk
himself at any such place or put mroself in
the power of the spaniards on that coast on
account of a certain affair in which he had
been engaged several years previous to the
lime referred to as will be hereafter explained
still these two worthies became necessary to
each other s advantage and found means to
communicate and traffic without seeing each
other or writing letters
now to be shortin the year 
joseph j roberts alias governor roberts
president roberts went from mon
twvia liberia to sierra leone and there
without money or credit of his own bought a
large schouiu r which had becu captured from
the siavetraders by the british cruizers and
condemned by the mixed commission court as
a slaver pursuant to w hich condemnation the j
xem y wa at auction according to the
provisions of the british treaties for the sup j
prrsstoo of the slavetrade phis same rah
trls went to sierra leone iu company with
john n l ris now secretary f the col
frfiy and now in this city at one of the del
rgation cmm liberia who it is confessed
was an sgrit employee and storekeeper of
pedro blanco the purchased schooner was
christened by the nominal purchasers by the
hopeful appellation of the monrovia out
of compliment to the chief tillage of that
coiooy which was founded and supported by
the amiable colon isationists of the cm ted
states for the purpose amone others of sup
pressing the slavelrade the monrovia lay at
anchor in the roadstead of monrovia for a
few weeks entirely unemployed and utterly
useless to the seeming ownerwho had neither
busioess sufficient to employ a vessel of that
size nor the capital nor the credit to make
business of such an amount hs never pos
sessed in his life money enough to buy half of
such a tessc nor merchandize enough to fill
the half
hut the monrovia did not lay idle tory long
about the beginning of july the brig ivan
hoe brought from galmhas to monrovia t
rodriguez huron heretofore described as the
principal factor and agent of iedro blanco
establishing himself in the house and in the
storehouse of john x lewis he soon took
possession of the schooner monrovia also
with very liitle ceremony and sent her off to
galinhas whence she w as almost immediately
sent to havana crowded with miserable
slaves destined to be worked and whipped to
death on the sugar plantations of cuba of
course to spare the feelings of the coloniaa
uonists and other friends of the slave and
enemies of slavery and the slave trade tho
beautiful but inappropriate name of the mon
rovia w as taken from the schooner wbensho
was taken from the keeping of her nominal
owncr into the service of her real owner of
course the governor or president of
liberia will say that he sold the monrovia to
t r buron undoubtedly that was tho
form of the transaction senor huron told
the writer of this article that ho had bought
her hut the ysung senor was no more able
to buy such a vessel fur himself than tho
governor was he was merely bianco
factor agent and representative so that
there was no danger that the writer would
misunderstand him senor bunn did not
generally make the writer his particular con
tidant in regard to his transactions at monro
via with joseph j huberts and john x lewis
though his business with the latter was no
secret it happened that the captain of tho
brig invanhoe of which t r huron was
acting supercargo at that time was violently
attacked with the african fever on board of
his vessel then at anchor in the port of mon
rovia and the writer of course was called to
attend him professionally which he did taking
along senot buron with him in his boat
after attending to the sick man and leaving
the brig to return to the village the writer
was requested by senor buron to order the
boats crew to pull alongside of schooner
monrovia which lay not far olf as he wished
to give some directions to the captain a mu
latto liberian named cooper and to teprovo
him for the negligent manner in w hich tho
rigging of the vessel was left the writer
readily complied without exactly understand
ing the relations of his spanish companion to
the liberian vessel and tho latter probably
noticing the surprise involuntarily manifested
at once said in explanation she is mine
indeed yesl have bought her
as soon as the boat came w ithin hailing dis
tance tho senor gave his orders to the captain
accompanied with some sharp rebuke for ins
carelessness all which was humbly taken by
ihe liberian and tho orders were submissive
ly obeyed this was the first occasion on
which the writer knew that the transfer of the
vessel front huberts to illanco had aeri ally
taken place though it was afterwards familiar
ly known iii the colony and talked of without
a word of ceusure from anybody
it will he seen what eminent services were
m this way rendered to the s ave traders by
such men as govt rnor roberts him w hat
peculiar facilities for carying oil the slave
trade were furnishd by the colonv of libe
ria y hen the captured slave v sscl wertr
sold in shire leone id ways at a bargain
the spaniards themselves could not go there
to bid for them neither could blancov
english ag lit at scrn ixouc do it without
detection in an offence puntshahle by the
british laws but he c uld furnish the money
to pay for them w hen governor roberts
became the nominal purchaser the vcsaell
could then leave sierte intone under ameri
can or liberian colors and could be transfer
red to the real purchasers in a place then
under the jurisdiction of the american coloni
zation society without rendering any body
liable to punishment or even to exposure un
der ordinary circumstances
hits one instance is enough to show the
relation of governor roberts to the slave
hade when he has made his answer  this
distinct specific ami detailed charge it will
be time to look farther into his commercial
history to expose more completely the dishon
esty of the colonizationists in declaring that
the colony operates for the suppression or
discouragement of the slave trade
so much for liberia and its agents that
man must be mote than usually simple and
credulous who can place any confidence in
nen and measures that have been thus tried
and found wanting as a means as it is po
litely called of improving the condition of
the colored race or inplain terms ridding
the country of africans the scheme it is suf
ficiently evident is utterly abortive thank
heaven that wickedness it is not within the
power of the colonization society to perpe
trate they havo managed as their official
reports state to transport during the last year
just  how many years at that rate
would it take to tiarisport  th
yearly increase is of course many times 
the whole scheme is hollow hypocritical
and valueless it is worse than that it is as
i have before asserted a scheme for the bene
fit of slaveholdersgot op and fostered with
a view expressly to thoir advantage there

the free soil state convention held in
thu town last week was the largest and most
enthusiastic convention that has assembled
hem for years it was emphatically a gath
ering of the people every part of the rep
resentatives hall floor galleries ami all
were crowded to overflowing through the en
ure day it waa a gathering of mentrue
earnest men who felt that great pun
ciple were at stake in the establishment or
overthrow of which arc involved the dearest
interest of their country and of their race
we have attended many state conventions
hut never one breathing a better spirit or made
up of stronger and better men among whom
were not a few who have always heretofore
acted with the old defunct parties w hich now
contain casa and taylor
hon john p hale was called for from all
part of the hall and as he stepped upon the
platform was welcomed with the most enthu
maatic applaud mr hale m reused the
convention fin an hour and a half with even
more than his usual ability and with great ef
txic said he did not come there to speak
to whigs or democrats a such hut
to brn ami women not to politician he
addressd himself to men whom god had
made whigs and democrats being manu
factured bv other hands and elsewhere lie
then took a brief review of the political ques
tion w hich hail formerly occupied the atten
tion of the people the subtreasury the bank
the tariff for instance and demanded to know
how or in what degree the people of he
hampshire had been affected by their sett le
nient the one way or the oilier much
cheering no one could tell what bearing
those former great questions had bad upon
their business or their interest unless it were
the coterie of officeseekers that set which
for thirty years pat m new hampshire had
ever been willing to serve tlie state tor tne
sake of the salaries to them indeed the
question might have been of moment hut
to the people generally they were of none at
all
but there is now mr hale said a question
of vast and surpassing moment before the
whole people a question w hich comes home
to every mans individual responsibility a
question on which every man is called on to
vote within the next sixty days it is the
question whether slavery shall he permitted to
extend itself overall our conquered territories
or whether it shall le confined within its pres
ent limits and we arc now in a strange
state of things everybody in new england
and all the north is now in favor of free soil
and in new hampshire every body of what
ever party pravs for writes for and talks for
free soil hut can they be depended upon 
are they sincere mr hale said he must
confess that he could noi credit both the intel
ligence and the integrity of many of these gen
thmen because while they piotessed to be
wholly devoted to the cause ol  ree ftoil
limr action was diametrically opposed to their
profession
mr hale went on to trace the importance
of this question upon the intcrcls ot the mil
lions who arc to inherit those vast regions of
now unsettled territory and concluded by ex
pressing luk deep sorrow at the delinquency
of the professed church of jod here at the
north on this great sin of human slavery ll
the church would withdraw christian fellow
ship from the slaveludders of the southand
her members in consistency with their pray
ers for the coining of christs kingdom cease

a free soil convention of the eighth
district ol massachusetts ass unbled at ded

rite hon lloaxeii mann was nominated for
reelection the following are the resolutions
passed in reference to that nomination
resolved that this convention entertain
the fullest confidence in the integrity and
ability of the present representative of this
district in congress and as wo believe him
to ire sound and true on the now paramount
question ol the extension ol slavery and have
entire faith in his sagacity to perceive his
courage to oppose and ins eloquence to illus
trate lire enormous moral evils of that institu
tion and the intolerable political encroach
ments ot the slave power  licrefore we
unanimously nominate the hon horace mann
to the voters of the eighth congressional
district as a candidate for reelection
resolved that this free soil convention
doe not select mr mann as the exponent ol
its opinions because of the support awarded
him by the whig party but in spite of it
nor because of his present undefined posiiiou
with reference to the presidential candidates
hut tn spite of it being convinced that hold
ing the principles and sentiments proclaimed
in his recent speech in congress and of hi
more recent letter to bis constituents as well

upoa the constitutionality of abolishing it in
the district of columbia and elsewherehe
must and can only be found heartily coopera

the antagonistic forces ot frccdom and sla
very
resolved that apart from these demon
strations and others which might be enu
merated we may safely deem the fact of a
past life devoted to the highest interests ol
humanity as furnishing no mean pledge ol
the sincerity and earnestness of mr manns
antislavery convictions and that in view ol
all we are left no room to doubt that he is
with us and of us and for us on the

to which we referred in yesterdiys paper
ll will be seen that it was addred to the
nominee of correspondence aod of cmiree
it would have been read before the recent
convention at fnioo hall had it been re
ceived in time coming from such s source
at this extraordinary junctute of political
affairs h will doubtless be perused w ith tn

place it on record a a part of the history of

gentlemen your letter dated the ih of
this month inviting me to he present at a
mass slate convention st union hall in
the citv of baltimore on wednesday next
has been forwarded from my house in
frederick to mv temporary residence in this
county where  have been detained for more
than a month past in attending to private
business
from your letter i learn that the principal
object ofthe pmikjsrd convention will be the
formation of an electoral ticket to be voted
for by the people of maryland favorable to
tire election of van buren for the presidency
 have not particqated in the proceedings of
any political meeting large or small since
my canvass for the chief magistracy of mary
land closed at a public meeting in the town
of cumberland early in uclobor  
am therefore under no obligation express or
implied to support or vote for either one of
the nominees of the national coavcntions
held by the whig and democratic parties rev
pectively br ing free to make choice of a
candidate to be voted for from the three gen
tlemen ho hare been brought before the
public through the agency of others i shall
most certainly if i live and can attend the
i tolls vote for that electoral ticket which
shall stand pledged to vote for mr van buren
for the presidency and mr adams for the
vicepresidency
having neither leisure nor inclination at this
time to elaborate my reasons for this deter
imi nation i shall content myself with saying
that i have great confidence in mr nan
buren as a tried statesman eminently qualified
i fur the duties imposed by the constitution on
our chief magistrates that in my opinion
the whole country owe to him much lor his
distinguished agency in giving proud predom
inance to those great measures of public
policy to the success of yvhich my own po
litical life was in a very small sphere devo
ted and that my preference for him arising
ft out these considerations instead of being
diminished is increased by the pledge he has
given to follow in the footsteps of those
illustrious patriots and philanthropists who
by adopting the federal constitution that
clothed congress with power to prohibit the
african slave trade signified distinctly their
desire to have the farther extension of slavery
arrested and who by adopting the celebrated
ordinance of  forbidding the introduction
of slavery into all the territory then held by
the united states set an example that ought
to have been followed by their posterity
the opinions here indicated i have long
entertaind and know of no reason why 
should not on this occasion give to them
distinct utterance indeed so far from feeling
any wish to conceal my opinions on this sub
j ct  know of no public question to be
 decided in the approaching presidential
election of so much moment as that particu
larly involved in the nominations at huffilo
or better calculated to awaken my decided
preference for the electoral ticket you propose
to have nominated
seeing that  cannot attend the sittings of
the convention to be held on monday next
i mut be content with tendering my best
wishes for success to your commendable
purposes and am very respectfully your

good understanding between the two countries
has continued wnhout the slightest interrup
tion
events of deep importance have disturbed
the internal tranquility of many of tbe slates
of europe tnith in the north and in the south
these events have led to hostilities between
neighboring countries
 am employing ny good offices in concert
with other friendly powers to bring to an
amicable settlement these uilieronces and i
trust that our eiibrts may be successful
 am rejoiced to think that an increasing
seise of the value of peace encourages the
hope that the nations ol europe may con
tinue in the enjoyment of us blessings
amidst these convulsions  have had the
satisfaction ol being able to preserve peace
for my own dominions and to maintain our
domestic tranquility tlte strength of our
institutions having been tried and lias not
been found wanting i have studied to
preserre the people committed to my charge
in the enjoyment of that temperate freedom
which they so justly value my people on
their side feel  snsibly the advantages of
order and security to allow the promoters ol
pillage and confusion any chauce of success
in their w icked designs

years of age was out with a number of other
fellows near the girard college about eight
oclock in the evening when the colored man
approached him and after offering him halt a
dollar if he would go with him to shippen
street which the laal refused seized him and
ran with him to the woods tlhe alarm was
immediately given by the other boys and in
the course of an hour upwards of a hundred
citizens were out in search of the man with
lanterns und after a long search finally dis
covered him about  oclock as he was
making his way to the city near the bushhill
hospital and pressed upon him so closelv
that lie was forced to let the lad escape after
getting into the woods with the boy he had
beaten him repeatedly and severely to prevenl
his making a noise of which his body bore
strong evidence and when he found he wa
pursued he concealed himself pressing his
hand upon the boys mouth to prevent hits

the hydropathic treatment orappli
cation of water ns a powerful and uc
ceasful agent in the cure of many of tht
ills which flesh is heir to seems lo b
daily gaining ground in public conli
dencc it was at first thought to bt
more fanciful than sound hut it liai
wrought io much good that its reputatioi
is well established
there arc row in northampton threi
establishments where the hydropathh
treatment is pursued hut it is to tha
under the care of doctor kuggles a
bcnsonville that these remarks an
confined because this practitioner wai
it is believed the originator of a the
ory connected with hydropathic treat
rurul that at first subjected him to somi
degree of ridicule but which has sinc
been advocated by medical men o
i eminence both in this country and eu
rope dr ruggles does not profess tc
ho any other tiiaa a hydropathic prac
t itioncr arid he uses no agent hut water
he makes no claim to be an educatec
physician and it does not appear to be
conceding him too much to imagine
that having confined his attention to the
application of water as a remedia
agent lie may have at least attained
etjual skill with those who have yielded
to the pressure of public opinion or oth
er impulses and cotnbiucd it with thcii
former system of practice dr ruggles
is so nearly blind as to depend entirely
in his primary examination of those who
seek his aid on the sense of touch and
it is hy that delicate preception of what
he terms the electrical state of the shin
that he forms his opinion whether the
applicant would be benefited by a
course of hydropathic treatment in
the exercise of this mode of enquiry
dr ruggles is most candid and in the
cases of some who were very anxious to
put themselves under his care he has
frankly told them that his treatment was
not calculated to do them good dr
ruggles has maintained his theory for
upwards of four years and has during
that time made it the successful basis oi
his treatment of a great number of in
dividuals his establishment is capa
ble of accomodating between thirty and
forty patients and is at present full in
deed he has been obliged for many
weeks pastalmost daily to to turn away
applicants
the establishment is very pleasantly
situated and comprises all requisite
appliances for the most thorough course
of hydrophatic treatment at about a
mile from the house is a copious stream
of pure water which falls from a con
siderable height and by the aid ol a
needful apparatus forms a douche bath
this is an important feature in the ad
vantages of this establisnmcnt for it is
a privilege not always enjoyed in hydro

the medical gentlemen above alluded
to as having discovered the presence of
positive electricity in the skin within the
past year are dr means of the medical
college of georgia and dr llemmer
of england to the credit of the for
mer it may be mentioned that in his
address before the college at the open
ing of its annual session in august
nov bth hit lie takes honorable no
tice of dr kugglesremarkable and suc
cessful practice
there is a passage in an article in the
british and foreign medical review by
doctor john forbes fellow of the
royal and geological societies that
hears so immediately on this subject
it may lie as well to insert it particular
ly as it contains an admission that med
ical practitioners have not hitherto ad
dressed themselves as much as they
might to the deranged state of the skin
as a prolific source of disease with a
view to remedial treatment
the skin is a part through which
nature has arranged that a large amount
of matter should be removed from the
body during health and a still larger
amount of different u character in the
process of recovery from many diseases
it is well known that a deficient cuta
neous excretion is incompatible with
perfect health perhaps there is scarce
ly am disease in ichieh the function of the
shin is not to some extent deranged b
iciat extent physicians hare not bcstoccd
sufficient pains to learn nor have they
been accustomed to give much attention
to thi part in the practical investigation
of diseases still less has it acquired
an important position in the list ot parts
to which medical treatment is directed
therefore ice possess little information
in medical writers us to the amount or
frequency of cutaneous disturbance in
general disease as to the effect of thera
peutic means in correcting such disturb
ance or as to the value of the correction
in the cure of disease

an effective and innocuous incans of
increasing the excretion from the skin
being thus found  w hich appears to com
dinc with its own peculiar action the
indirect effect of a tonic have w e not
reason to regard it as a promising in
strument of cure in many disordered
states of the system we fully believe
that we have we know the utility of
augmenting the secretion of the mucous
membranes the liver the kidneys we
recognize this in our constant practice
it is by tins means that we combat a
large proportion of chronic as well as
acute maladies should the shin
alone be neglected l physiology teaches
us that it is the vehicle for conveying
out of the system a large amount of
matter as well solid as liquid and
practical experience exhibits it as the
channel through which the maftries inor
hi in many instances and the burthen
of plethora generally find their evil
these facts indicate it as a legitimate
locality tor the same artificial measures
which are found serviceable on other
secreting organs
it is a remarkable circumstance that
the privation of ght should in dr rug
gless case ban led t a more concern
lrated attention to the other faculties

and truly it is so but why should
there be any iodisposition to allow dr
kuggles the met it of his discovery
the color of his skin cannot operate
to his prejudice with the intelligent in
habitants of new england while i
i physician of the slave holding state of
georgia has volunteered him tbe meed
of praisa
those who are disposed to treat dr
rugglos contemptuously or even un
courteously should remember that all
i science is progressive though perhaps
no department of it may owe any portion
of its progress to them but the pio
nerrs in scientific research inay con
sole themselves with the reflection that
some of the most important discoveries
did not procure their authors immediate
fame though their ultimate reward was
immortality there was a time when
the circulation of the blood w as not
known ifarrcy discovered it he was
ridiculed at the first promulgation of
his theory but nobody laughs at him
now there was a periodnot very
remotewhen the law of gravitatiou
was not understood but no man is suf
ficiently prodigal of his reputation as
now to laugh at sir isaac newton
there was an era still nearer our
own time when the power of steam
was not known but every one is now
ambitious to join the chorus in the praise
of fulton tis true that all these men
j had a skin somewhat paler than that of
the discoverer of cutaneous electricity
but let it ho remembered that it was
i out of chaotic darkness god first cre
uled light it is a prominent feature in
i the divine economy that the greatest
i effects are poduced from what appear
to be the smallest causes it is one
of the processes by which the almighty
wisdom has determined to check the
arrogance of mao
persecution for new ideas
harvey who first discovered the cir
culation ofthe blood was styled vaga
bond or quack and persecuted through
life
ambrose parc in the time of fran
cis  introduced the ligature as a sub
stitute for the painful mode of stanching
the blood after the amputation of a limb
namely by applying boiling pitch to
the surface of the stump lie was in
consequence persecuted with the most
remorseless rancor by the faculty of
physic who ridiculed the idea of put
ting the life of a man upon a thread
when boiling pitch had stood the test for
centuries
paracelsus introduced antimony as a
valuable medicine he was persecuted
for the innovation and the french par
liament passed an act making it penal
to prescribe it whereas it is now one
ofthe most important medicines in dai
ly use
the jesuits of peru introduced into
protestant england the peruvian bark
invaluable medicine but being a
remedy used by the jesuits the protes
tant english at once rejected the drug
as the invention ofthe devil
in  dr greenuelt discovered
the curative power of canthurides in
dropsy as soon as his cures began to
be noised abroad he was committed to
newgate by warrant of the president
ofthe college of physicians for pre
scribing eauthai ides internally
lady montague first introduced into
england small pox inoculation having
seen its success in turkey in greatly
mitigating that terrible disease the
faculty all rose in arms against its in
troduction foretelling the most disas
trous consequences yet it was in a
few years generally adopted by the
most eminent members of the profes
sion
jenner who introduced the still
greater discovery of vaccination was
treated with ridicule and contempt per
secuted and oppressed by the royal
college of physicians yet he subse
quently received large pecuniary grants
from government for the benefit he had
conferred on his country by making
known his valuable discovery and at
the present tiino its observance is very
properly enjoined by the whole medical
profession and the legislature

as two gentlemen were erasing
the suspension bridge below the foms
from the ameriean side on frida eve
ning when about two hundred arda
from the canada side the heard a
noise like the falling of a hear bod
over the precipice a few rods above the
bridge and immediately observed a lit
tle girl running toward the bridge
she passed several men who were stand
ing in the vicinity and hastened to the
lower side of the bridge where she de
sccnded a ladder or stairway made by
pins being driven into a large pole 
log placed in an upright position and
reaching from the lower side of the
bridge some  or  feet down the
precipice to a short recess in the cliffs
when she arrived at the bottom o
the latter she climcd with incrcasec
speed along the side of the hill undei
the overhanging rocks to the place fi on
above which she had started and de
scending a few steps she was observe
trying to raise and carry some object
which the gentlemen who had watchc
her movements with increasing interest
soon became satisfied was a child tha
had fallen over the precipice the
hastened to the end of the bridge am
sent dow n some men who had not knowi
of the accident the child a little gir
seven or eight years of age was lashe
to the back of one of the men am
brought up alive although greatly in
jured having one or both of its legs
broken and one eye considerably bruis
ed but it will probably recover tha
the child was not instantly killed is tru
ly astonishing as it must have faller
over  feet perpendicularly without
anything to impede its progress on the
broken stones below
the coolness and intrepidity of the
little girl perhaps ten or eleven years
of age sister of the one who met with
the accident was also astonishing
