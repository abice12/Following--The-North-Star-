it cannot be denied that these are
most eventful times ancient mon
archies iire tottering the throne ol
france has already crackled in the
hontircs of the populace and in almost
every country of europe liberty is
measuring swords with despotism
instead of the lamentations of the ex
iled pole or the halfstifled murmurs of
the italian patriot or the wail of the
captive from the depths of his austrian
dungeon wc hear the shouts of tri
umphant multitudes as one after an
other of the strongholds of absolutism
gives way before them hut the worst
despot of all remains untouched
within twenty days sail of our own
shores and amongst a people with
whom we are more closely connected
than with any nation of fhe continent
there still survives the despotism of the
skin which of all forms of oppression
is the mot hateful and revolting j
throned upon the southern alleghuj
nies and with a sway extending from
the gulf of mexico to the potomacand
from thff atlantic to the great missouri
the tyrant holds three millions of human
beings in a thraldom that would not be
tolerated in europe
negro slavery is the worst despotism under
the sun
the furopean tyrant denies the
liberty of the press the american the
liberty of the person the former
proscribes a certain class of newspa
persthe latter makes it a crime to
teach a slave to read the former
denies to his people a voiefe in the laws
that govern themthe latter makes man
a marketable commodity steals his
child out of the cradle and sells his
wife on the auctionblock to the high
est bidder the former strids an of
fender into banishment or shuts him dp
in prison without a trialthe latter
condemns a man to the life and servi
tude of a brute without a crime as 
much as personal liheity is dearer than
political is the bondage of the negro j
morse than the thraldom of the euro
pean
but wc will allow america to speak
for herself in the language of one of
her principal sons the following
epitome of the system is extracted from 
a book published at new york j
eatkkrd american slavery as it is
testimony of a thousand witnesses
ly theodore weld an able and cousci j
entious advocate of human rights
m ill prove that the slaves in
the united states are treated with bar
barous inhumanity they are over
worked underfed wretchedly dad and
l ave insufficient sleep
that they are often made to mear round
their necks iron collars armed with
prongs to drag heavy chains and
weights at their feet mhile working in 
the fields and to wear yokes and bells
and iron horns that they are often
kept confined in the stocks day and
night for weeks togther made to wear
gags in their mouths for hours or days j
have their front teeth torn out or brol
ken ofl that they may be easily detect j
ed when they run away that they are 
frequently flogged with terrible sever
ty have red pepper rubbed into their
lacerated flesh and hot brine spirits of
turpentine btc poured over the gashes
to increase the torture
that they are often hunted with blood
the north star
hounds and shot down like beasts or
tom in pieces by dogs
all these things and more and worse
we shall prove reader we know
whereof we affirm we have weighed
it well more and worse we will
prove mark these words and read on
vvc will establish these facts by the
testimony of scores and hundreds of
eyewitnesses by the testimony of
slaveholders in all parts of the slave
statesby slavebolding members of
congress and of state
bv ambassadors to foreign courtsby
judges by doctors of divinity and
clergymen of all denominationsbyj
merchants mechanics lawyers and
physiciansby presidents and profess
ors iri colleges and professional semi
naries by planters overseers and
drivers we shall show not merely
that such deeds are committed but that
they are frequent not done in corners
but before the sun not in one of the
slave states but in all of them not
perpetrated by brutal overseers and
drivers merely but by magistrates by
legislators by professors of religion
by preachers of the gospel by govern
ors of states by gentlemen of prop
erty and standing ami by delicate fe
males moving in the highest circles of
society
the pledge thus given by the author
in his introduction is fulfilled with aw
ful accuracy in the chapters which folf
low yve do not suppose that another
book exists in the knglish language
detailing in the compass of two hun
dred pages such a mass of human suf
fering
let it not be supposed that ameri
can slavery is much altered far the bet
ter in the nine years since this book
was published yve could present the
reader with a multitude of extracts
from american newspapers of recent
date detailing similar enormities
they are the natural results of ir
responsible powerwielded by unregen
erate man
to illustrate the present american
jaw a a bearing on the colored popula
tion we quote a paragraph from a ken
tucky paper the louisville examiner
of feb th 
here the freeman may be sold
into slavery forever if he he unable to
pay a trifling fine there it is a crim
inal offence to teach the slave to read
the word of iodthat word which we
are commanded to study and honor
that word which the saviour died to
teach in one state marriages are net j
allowed the law making the offspring
of any union among slaves illegitimate
in none are they legalized
surely these last two facts reveal
ing as they do a feature of the slave
system so unutterably odious ought
to he sufficient to bring down upn iti
the concentrated scorn of christen
dom
v rgro slavery is not maintain dfor its own
sake hut for the sake of profit
this proposition wc think must be
selfevident the lazy and luxurious 
planter would not take the trouble to
train the negroes to his service to drive
them to the field and flog them at the
whippingpost for the mere love of
cruelty nor would he for this submit
to live in continual apprehension of that
vengeance which such treatment can
not fail to engender and which ever
and anon bursts over the heads of the
slaveholders with terrific violence no
the planter loves the slave system be
cause he loves the gold which it brings
into his coffers the love of gold is
the root of the evil it is for the sake
of profit aud not for its own sake that
slavery is maintained
the cultivation of cotton has been the chief
source of profit to the american slavehold
er consequently american slavery denies
its vitality from the cotton troth
the american almanack for 
contains a table of the exports of
the growth produce and manufacture
ot the united states during the two
years ending june th  value
estimated in hollars in this we find
cotton to the amount sf ninetyfour
millions and a half of dollars was ex
ported during those two years besides
seven millions and a half of cotton
goods  he next article of importance
on the list is grain which including
flour biscuits stc presents a total of
twentyfour millions of dollars being
less than onfelbuttb of the value of the
cotton trade in considering these
figures it should also be borne in mind
that thb whole of the cotton is pro
duced in the slave states and u very
large proportion of the grain in the
free
yvb firid by ft reference to statistics
that american slavery has grown up
and behotne fcohsolidated side by side
with the cotton trade yyhile there
was little coiton there were few slaves
and now both slaves and bales of cot
ton count by the million before the
americans were stimulated to injustice
by their cotton gains and previous to
their declaration of independence th
july  a very strong antislavery
feeling appears to have existed amongst
them
but a new era in the agriculture and
commerce of america was approach
ingan era as calamitous to the col
ored population as that of their new
born liberties was beneficial to the
whites little dreamed the ingenious
eli yvbitney when riveting the teeth
on his admirable invention the cotton

foulest of institutions on m frame
work of american society on thii
subject we quote an article m the
friend no  being an abridge men
from the twentyfirat volume of  silli
tnttns journal
negro slavery existed in the uni
ted states jong before the cotiongir
was brought into use yet at the time ol
its invention the market was glutted
w ith all those articles which were suit
ed to the soil and climate of georgia
and it was difficult to find profitable em
ployment for the sieves under thes
circumstances slavery must have lan
guished and the pecuniary value oi
slaves have suffered a great decline
and experience sufficiently proves thal
when the price of slaves is low eman
cipations become frequent but the
invention of the cottongin by opening
a new source of profit from the labor ol
slaves enhanced their value and gave
an impulse to the traffic in their per
sons from the exhausted slave states of
the north to those further south and
west an impulse which continues to the
present day
we learn from the same source that
the invention of the cottongin which
is the machine used in separating the
seed from the fibre took place about
the year  the marvellous impe
tus given to the cotton trade by this
invention may be judged of from the
fact that while in the year immediately
preceding that is in  the total
weight of cotton raised in the united
states was estimated at three millions
of pounds in  it was reported at
thirtyfive millions in  at eighty
five millions in  at one hundred
and sixty millions in  at three
hundred and fifty millions in  at
seven hundred and ninety millions and
in  as per report of the patent
office quoted in the standard at one
thousand and fortyone millions
still more clearly to elucidate the co
temporaneous growth of slavery and
the cottontrade we give two tables

north of scotland gazette and pub
lished in that paper of november th

after considering these statements
who is there that can re sist the conclu
sion that american slavery derives its
vitality from the cotton trade we
now approach a more homecoming
division of the subject and to this we
invite the serious attention of the
reader
england is the principal customer for ameri
can slave cotton therefore england is
the direct upholder of the icurst despotism
under the sun
a very few figures will be sufficient
to prove the fact and we trust the
reader will admit the conclusion based
upon it as fairly borne out by the pre
vious argument we have been kindly
furnished with the following tables
by an eminent cottonbroker in liver
pool
crop of cotton in the united states for
  bales
 
   
  
average crop for
four years g
consumption of u s cotton in great
britain in
  bales
 
 
  
average consumption in great brit
ain for  years  bales
these figures then bring out the
fact that we in this country consume
or manufacture more than half the
whole cotton crop of the united states
in other words that we are better con
sumers to the slaveholders than the
americans themselves and all the oth
er nations of the world put together
it is said that the fastsailing brazilian
steamers now employed in the atro
cious slave trade are accustomed to
dip their colors to the british cruisers
as they leave them in the wake and
surely this ironical salute is well de
served for while we maintain a squad
ron on the coast of africa to intercept
their supply of slaves the brazilians
know well that when once those slaves
are landed we shall be good customers
for the produce of their labor and in
like manner may the american slave
holder laugh in his sleeve at all our
thundering denunciations of slaveryso
long as we give him a premium for its
maintenance so long as he can rely
upon us as the principal purchasers of
his bloodstained boles
american slavery may be overt hr me by a
revolution of the spindki a charter for
the xegro may be mould by a rtf arm i
the cottoet trade
if it be true as we have endeavored
to show that american slavery derives
its lifeblood from the cotton trade it
follows thal if no one would buy slave
cotton the system would fall to the
rochester n y friday june  im
ground b j its own weight we ere
not so sanguine however as to hope
for such a sojation of the question as
it would be to suppose a more gen
eral diffusion of mural principle than
this or perhaps any other community
can boast but if the complete annihi
lation of slavery would be the result ot
a total rejection of its produce it is fair
to conclude that the system would be
weakened in the same proportion as its
produce was disused we may not
succeed in starving the monster to
death but we may reduce his strength
and render him less formidable
if by the strenuous efforts of brit
ish and american philanthropists
such an impression could be produced
upon the cotton market as to depreci
ate the money value of slaves we may
be sure that the planters would have all
the less difficulty in reconciling them
selves to the idea of emancipation
with the assistance of the freegrown
cotton of british india there is good
ground to believe that such a result
may be accomplished the cheapness
of the lattercombined with its gradually
improving quality must shortly enable
it to displace a considerable amount ot
the slavegrown article and the benefit
to our eastern fellowsubjects will be
scarcel j less than that conferred upon
the slaves the british west indies
also produce a considerable quantity
of freelabor cotton of excellent quali
ty it is very desirable however that
our trade should not he entirely with
drawn from the americans recent
inquiries have disclosed the fact that
there existsa set of small cotton planters
scattered up and down the southern
states who raise their crops entirely by
free labor in the very face of the slave
system it is of the highest import
ance to strerifithen the hands of these
honest and humane cultivators the
philadelphia free produce associa
tion is now sending its agents amongst
them each season and it is understood
that many thousand bales of their cot
ton may be secured annually for the
british market where we feel confident
it would meet with a ready sale by
preferring the produce of lree labo
we shall encourage these honest plant
ers who manifest their respect lor the
rights of industry and we shall enable
them the better to compete with their
unscrupulous opponents we shall
also demonstrate to the slaveholders
that there is a principle at work in eng
land w hich knows how to discriminate
between honorable enterprise and the
most grinding of all oppressions and i
which classes the products of stolen
iao in the same category with stolen
goods
the destructive character of planta
tion work at the south will hardly be
credited in this country but according
to the evidence of respectable witness 
es the whole negro population on some
estates is swept otf used up as the l
term is in six seven or eight years
i
no commercial union icilh skn chouhrs j
it is surely high time that a strike
was made against this monster oppres
sion all we ask for its overthrow is
a bloodless revolutiona revolution of
the spindlesa reform in the cotton
trade abolitionists in america who
are in the presence of the enemy have
various inodes for conducting the war
fare their religious bodies have
raised the cry no religious union
with slaveholders their public men
are refusing political unionbut to us
at this distance the most vulnerable
point about the slaveholder is his pock
et our watchword ought to be no
commercial union with slaveholders
depend upon it this would soon begin
to tell
let us picture to ourselves the effect i
of a large order for cotton on a plants
tion in georgia suppose the hard
hearted planter saying to the overseer
here is an order for liverpool tor
another thousand bales be sure you
have it ready in time a few more men
must be dragged away from their
wives and children from their parents
you must keep the gang going briskly
drive the inen a little harder and flog
the women till they faint you must
take two hours otf their nights rest
and use up a few of the old negroes if
necessary for the order must be com
pleted with the least possible delay
vve do not say that this is the literal
working of every additional order for
slavecotton but beyond ail doubt it is
the virtual effect of an extra demand
who then would be a party to such
wickedness who would not rather
patronize the honest cultivator who
employs none but free laborers an
order to the free plantation brings more
wages to the slave plantation more
work to the former it means bless
ings to the latter blows the slaves
themselves must be aware of this for it
is said they arc sometimes overheard
praying that cotton may be low
but it will be asked how are the
people of great britain to obtain arti
cles made from freelabor cotton the t
course is clear ask for them al
ready are these untainted tabrics to be
found in the most respectable shops of
several of our large towns ask for
them alwavs or tern every
where and we shall be much mistaken
if they do not make their appearance
but to be sure they are genuine buy
them of tradesmen on whom you can
relv ask to seethe certificate which j
generally accompanies these goods or
look for the freelabor stamp which
marks their origin remember the
manufacturers will not make them nor
will the shopkeepers keep them unless
there be a demand we would remind
the working population that for this
movement to be effectual it must be
promoted by the masses surely a
halfpenny a yard or a little coarse
ness of feature for a tune ought not to
be considered in esse of life and
death aad may none of ua lose sight 
of the fact for it may serve to animate j
and cheer us on in the struggle that so
long as the british public patronize
slave cottou so long as our manufac
turers give it the preference the spin
ning jennies of manchester with their
everlasting twirl are twisting and
drawing closer the bonds of the negro
and that so soon as the manufacturers
are induced to substitute free grown
cotton for the bloodstained fibre will
every revolution of their machines be
twisting and strengthening that cord
which is destined to bind the monster of
slavery and which with gods bless
ing at no distant time if the friends of
freedom would unite in the effort might
be found even strong enough to drag
the tvrant from bis throne

esteemed friend garrison
mr douglass and myself accepted
an invitation to the printers anniver
sary celebration of franklins birth
day and accordingly at the appointed
hour we wended our w r ny to the irving
house accompanied by mr john dick
and another friend the company had
assembled and were marching into the
hall to the inspiring music of adamss
bugle bund we arrived just in time
to unite with the procession i had
received a slight intimation that some
j objection had been manifested by a
few to the participation of mr doug
lass and myself this however gave
me but little uneasiness believing that 
come what would the result would
prove no detriment to the cause of free
dom
mr douglass had no cause to ap
prehend opposition until we had dei
livered our tickets at the diningroom
door when the host laid an embargo
on our further ingress declaring that
we could not be admitted it was in
vain that we asserted our claim to
equal treatment with others we were
called intruders and told that it was
a violation of the rules of society for
colored people to associate with whites
and were threatened ejectment by the
police by this time our presence at
the door the lookerson in the entry
and the passing of words between par
tics had attracted the attention of the
company just seated we retired to a
drawingroom where the proslavery
point was contended for by the host
who declared that several gentlemen
had expressed a determination not to
allow us a seat with them we were
about entering the hall to test the
question in propria persona intending
that cecision to supersede what the
host had proffered us several of the
company had now gathered some of
whom expressed regret at our treat
ment james vick jr chairman of
the committee of arrangements briefly j
advocated our rights alexander
mann esq editor of the rochester
american one of the vicepresidents
nobly came to the rescue his remarks
being loudly applauded and when the
question was called for by the chair
man almost the entire company an
swered jhje the negative was repre
sented by some six or eight who must
indeed have felt rebuked by this over
whelming vote the host who but a
few moments before manifested such
a hostile and bitter spirit toward us i
now communicated the intelligence
that there was a clean vote in our
favor you may be sure that after
having been the victims of so much
controversy on entering the hall we
were the observed of all observers
it was a painful as well as triumphant
hour for mr douglass and myself for
reasons which abolitionists hardly know
how to appreciate none but the col
ored man the immediate recipient of
american proslavery hate can fully
testify to the emotions excited by such
a development i care not to dwell
upon it let me here state however
that on being seated the host offered
a string of apologies for his conduct
comment is unnecessary after due
attention to the work spread before
them preparations were made for the
feast of reason and the flow of soul
wit and sentiment music and poetry
each lnt a charm to enliven the scene j
during the volunteer remarks mr
douglass was called for and briefly
proposed bis sentiment shortly after
alexander mann esq announced to
the company that he had a sentiment
to offer which he hoped and believed
would be responded to by every gen
tleman present for said he on
occasions of this kind we should
cheerfully lay aside all personal or
political prejudices after speaking
in this vein for a short time in a
handsome and liberal manner the best
calculated to aally any unpleasant feel

tendered the following resolution

mr douglass on rising was warmly
greeted he confessed himself much
embarrassed hv the coincident circum
stances of his present position but
would not conceal his gratitude elicited
by the sentiment just offered and so
heartily responded to by the company
he alluded to the treatment received
by him while in england where men
not color was the passport to the
highest circles but that his feelings of
present satisfaction were of another
character from any previously enjoyed j
he adverted to his connexion with the
press in rochester lo the uniformly
kind notice extended to him by the
gentlemen connected therewith as
also from the citizens generally con

wished to add that whatever he had
i said or done in ielation to slavery he

f ceived with evident attention and with
loud demonstrations of applause

t sided testified his hearty satisfaction

in rebuking by their vote the wicked
prejudice against color mr c is an
old hartford publisher who though
advanced in years is still devoted to
his profession in rochester the anti

years has indeed been prolific in these
exhibitions and as remarkable for a
 succession of victories always the
reward of the faithful and persevering
to compare the present with the past
those dark hours when your buele
blast was first sounded among the lulls
and valleys of new englandwe can
never believe the evidence daily pre
sented of the onward progress of those
mighty principles then proclaimed to
the american nation  he treatment
of the colored man in this country is
a legitimate illustration of hating
those whom we have injured ano
brings to my recollection that chapter
in waverly where fergus mac ivar
replies to his friend when being led to
executionyou see the compliment
they pay to our highland strength and
couiage here we have lain until our
limbs cramped into palsy and now
j they send six soldiers with loaded mus
kets to prevent our taking the castle
by storm the analogy is found in
the omnipotent and omnipresent influ
ence of american proslavery in
crushing every noble and praiseworthy
aspiration of the persecuted colored
man as in nature the smiles ot
summer are made sweeter by the
i frowns of winter the calm of ocean is
made more placid by the tempest that
has preceded it so in this moral battle
these incidental skirmishes will contri

liberty patty mu with a vcw to pew ant
opinion at this time as to it claim of bcuig th
liberty party profier bat only that we mat
he the filter understood the onrcntior
was large but not so numerously attended a
we expected its proceedings were spirited
and in resting throughout the speakers
were ail trone men the chief among then
were grrit smith beitah green henry
highland gcruet ceotge hradhurn e
wright jr and charles o sheppard
the though united ai the main were fat
from h ing so in the details at the com
m necment gerrit smith read a series cl
well drawn icsolutions and two aide address

td states and another to the members cf the
liberty party occupying in the reading a
space of more than two honrs any ordina
ry reader would have wearied the patience at
the audit m e and probably cleared tlio tent
but the addresses h ring from the pen of mr
smith it appeared more like listening to an
extemporaneous speech than a carefully writ
ten address the resolutions were of a strong
and radical character commencing by a com
parison of the proceedings of ihe national
liberty party convention which nominated
jams g birnev fur th presidency with that
held last fall anti w hich nominated john p
hale for that office and denounced the alter
ns a spurious convention and holding none of
the principles in common with the liberty par
ty th y affirm d that th nomination of mr
hale was ihe result of a settled determina
tion on tlr part of certain influential members
who had been secretly manoeuvering for some
time to disband the liberty party the
course in ohio on the part of stanley matth
ews salmon p chase ad others in frater
nizing with a mere vvilmot proviso movement
was declared to be a measure to break down
arr ruin the liberty party
the right of the plundered bondman to es
cape from his chains and the duty of all men
to help luni escape was boldly asserted the
unsuccessful attempt of drayton sayres and
english to deliver the spoiled out of the
hands of the spoiler was strongly commend
ed and i bliley of the national era for his
treatment oltllse noble men and his general
course since connected with that paper was
proclaimed an apostate and traitor to all the
great principles of the lilieity party  a re
solution was aho adopted almost in the same
words and expressing ihe same sentiments as
hu adopted by the american anti slavery
society at its recent anniversary at new
york affirming that slaveholders as sueh can
have no riglitr that they were never created
by god and that they are of monstrous and
diabolical origin w vs read ami adopted bv
this convention the adjres to the free col
ored people of the united states was a most
m tore ting and truthful paper which gave us
credit for our merits hot also ptnnted out our
tshoi comings as a people rebuked our indif

degradation v e were counselled m the ad

as white people for our eireuinstances requir
ed us to be better than they we hope soon
to b able to lay the whole address before our
readers whom we are sure will concur w ith
m in esteeming it an admirable document
the address to the members of the liberty
party was a successful exposure of the apos
lacy of the liberty party in nominating john
p hale for the presidency and the general
lecline of antislavery fidelity in the party
east and west it urged its own claim to
lie regarded as ihe true liberty party plat
form classing th hale men as deserters
with mere wilmot proviso men arid in no
sense to bo called antislavery men the

the points relied og by oar opponent on
tfci subject were the objects of the coiaiitu
l tiou a set fmhh of tb con
stitute n the absence of the trortf slave in
the constitutionthe use of the word person
t instead of dat in that instrumentthe un
poaibiiuy of making out a case of a slaves
owing service ot labor to the slaveholder and
the assumption that all doubt or ambiguity
ajuui the true av aning of any kgal tnsiru
ment is to he taken advantageof in form of
justice and liumanitjr theao points were
argued with tnarh farce and eloquence by
the revetal speakers all of whom appeared to
be quite satisfied with the correctness of their
views
in answer to these points wc said and say
now with as deep a convictioaof the sound
ness of our views as when we funned them
that the constitution of the united slates
was the guilty offspring of slaveholders that
the justice it aimed to establish was a justice
which permitted those who framed it to be the
vilest robbers in the world that the liberty
which tliey meant to secure to themselves
and posterity was a selfish and partial liberty
having reference to white men and not the
remotest regard for tac tights of the perishing
slave who was while the constitution was
being framed driven before the bloody lash of
the very men that framed it without reward
for his toil or redress for his sufferingthat
the framers of that instrument while they
pretended to b democrats had taken special
pains to confer political power on the slave
holders according to tire number of human
beings they might be able to rob and plunder
of all their rights personal civil social and
political to the extent of allowing them three
votes fur every five slaves by which they now
have a large property representation in con
gress that they had pledged the national
arm for the protection of the slavetrade for
twenty years and as much longer as congress
should see fit to couqbuc the infernal traffic
that they had conferred pow er upon the slave
holder to recapture his slaves in any and all
parts of this country that they had solemn
ly pledged the whole military and naval pow
er of the enure nation to suppress servile in
surrections and that this view of the consti
tution was the universal interpretation given
to tire instrument by its framers and those who
adopted it and all the legislatures and politi
cal parties a large wing of the liberty party
included and the overwhelming majority of
the people from the time of its adoption until
now
the meeting on thusrday was deeply in
teresting beriah green made one of the
most profound and able speeches to which we
ever listened he commenced by defining
slavery and such a definition as made ones
hair stand on end to hear it the most of
liis speech was an argument in favor of what
he called government and the qualities which
entitled a man to rule hut to us it was a
sermon filled with glorious truths setting
forth christian virtues in the most clear and
powerful manner the speech was full two
hours long and was listened to with marked
attention throughout he was followed by
henry  garnet and gerrit smith their
speeches closed the morning session the
afternoon session was less interesting the
convention closed by nominating gerrit smith
for president and charles foote of michigan
for vice president
our attendance at this convention while it
has done much to remove prejudice from our
mind respecting some of the prominent men
engaged in it lias also deepened our comic
tion that the only true ground for an ameri
can abolitionist is xo union with jslave

the meeting held in the court house of
this city on sunday evening last by this lady
and distinguished minister of the society of
friends was altogether the most satisfactory
i
reformatory meeting which we have attended
in this city or elsewhere foi a long time
the large room was crowded to overflowing

with an audience that listened to the speaker
for more than two hours w ith the most intense
interest
s la commenced lifr remarks by saying
it there be anything more inspiring lo the
heart of the humble advocate of reform than
another it is that o being greeted by a large
and crowded assembly of people without re
gard to sex color or condition such a
scene points us in the largungc of the poet
to the good time coming the quick hash
ol right and wrong around the world makes
it unnecessary for the millerite to tell ns of
the coming of the miilenium that the king
dom of heaven is now at hard it was
when christ was surrounded by the common
people who heard him gladly that he spoke
with power authority and was most inspired
declaring that  the spirit of the ixrd is upon
me because he hath anointed me to preach
the gospel to the pour he hath scat me to
heal the brokenhearted to reach deliverance
to the captives and recovering of sight to the
blind to set at liberty them that are bruised
it was not when surrounded by unbelievers
who expected the performance of miracles 
that bis mightiest works w ere done but when
the people crowded around him then he was
free and spake the truth and the common
people heard him gladly they always hear
the truth gladly they ever love the truth
thr doctrine of innate love of good i know
conflicts with the very foundation of msny
rtigious creeds not would i speak lightly or
ii reverend of any ones religious belief but
if  believe s  certainly do believe that the
doctrine of depravity is a great error and das
done much evil i am fcorrd to counteract it as
far as i can i know it is said to he in the
scripture that man is prone to evil as sparks
to ty upward ar d i hare searched for it there
but have never yet bon abl to find it i be
hove nan is much more prone to do good
than w do evi and tf thtf was a meeting
suited to such aa jovc  think i could
produce a much ptoof from scripture in sup
port of this view as can bo brought on the
other side what a beautiful illustration of
this truth was the bringing of a little child
and setting it among hi disciples teaching
thsra that they must become hke it in purity
as a condition of entering into the virgdimof
heaven it was tjic pure in heart lb peace

of the whole human familt uticltd that
which was from all eternity in contraditinc
 him from sectarian formality and it was seot
i that crucified him tlkmgh they were ashamed
i to confess that it was for bis good works that
they stoned him it was necessary for them
r to tual ut a ease of blasphemy him
they succeeded in eliciting from him that he
was the of find amf on this pretended
pretext they crucified him it was not how
ever this that ftued them with wrath against
him it was because he called them above
th rciigkxi of the day and insisted upon a
righteonsnees above that of the scribes and
the pharisees he demanded a life of prac
tical righteousness opptisition to all wars all
slavery ati inequality and all oppression
this was the religion taught by jesus of
whom when they hail crucified him they
were compelled to say truly this was a right
eons man a religion w hich w as so offensive
to sectarians of old well it may seem a
great while since these truths were uttered
and that very slow progress has been made
the difficulty has been of lemoving the sec
tarian hierarchy this has ever hindered the
cause of inform and that hierarchy in some
form or other exists in nearly all the sectarian
organizations of our times
here the lamps not being lighted we were
compelled to stop writing fur more than thirtv
minutes which the speaker occupied in a very
able manner defending the equality of the
whole human family and adverting to the
many disadvantages woman has in all ages
had to struggle against she commented at
considerable length upon the scriptural texts
supposed to disallow woman to speak in the
church and showed the popular interpre
tations given to those passages to be both un
reasonable and unscriptural we should have
liked to have had a thousand doctors of divini
ty in that audience they would have ldush
cd for very shame and mortification as they
beheld the intellectual face and heard the sil
very voice of one whose exalted powers have
enabled her to break the iron fetters which
the priesthood have for ages labored to fasten
on her sex mrs mott alluded hopefully to
tfie abandonment of novel reading and what
is called the ladies department in the trashy
papers and periodicals bv the women of the
present day and saw in it the dawn of that
day when woman will esteem herself some
thing more than a mere playthinga mere
appendage to man the improvement in the
education of won an was referred to as a
source of great encouragement there was
not probably a woman in the meeting that
did nd look with a sweeter complacency on
her womanhood after hearing this speech
than she had ever done before we imagined
that they must feel some thing as we did when
we heard the firtt educated colored man speak
to a w hite audioree
after dwelling at much length on this
part iff her subject mrs mott proceeded to
show lhat notwithstanding the spirit of mili
tary glory that scourged the public mind the
carse of pence was onward many of the
early advocates of peace had reserved the
light to appeal to the sword in some cases
and zoirc may do so now but a class of
peace men were coming up lo the work
whose motto was resist net evil and
who would in no case appeal to the sword
thus bearing the standard of p ace slid high
er the speaker said a decided change had
taken place in family government ami in
schoolsthe rad is nut so much us d now as
formerly the old notion about lie necessity
of whipping children is vanishing before a
brighter ard higher principle iersoi s have
feared that they should conflict wiih what
they conceive to be taught in the bible on
ibis subject there need be no such feats
the tenor of the bible is onward it will
accommodate itself to every improvement of
the race and will be adapted to every phase
of progress which the human family can
make in this connection mrs mitt spoke
of the happy influence which had been ex
erted on the public mind of this country and
europe by the olive leaves of eliliu burritt
and the writings of henry c wright the
society of friends too had done much in
promoting this cause to he sure they
stood not now where they ought to stand
many of them had become like the rest of the
world they read of politics with as much
avidity and are as intent upon gaining wealth
as others the love of moneytho root ci
all evilwas rife and they had become like
white sepulchres beautiful without but cor
rupt within stiainirg at gnats and swallowing
camels still they hid done much to pro
mote the cause of peace temperance and
antislavery
the s ibj ictof land reform was also alluded
to as evidence of progress and auguring the
time w hen a phoenix shall arise out of our so
cial ruins encircling undents wmgsthe whole
human fimily the recent struggla for lib
erty in the old wmrld the antislavery move
ment in france the chartist movement ir
england and the repeal movement of inland
were all ha nod as signs of that time when
lie whose right it is to reign shall reign
speaking of the society of friends tht
preacher said that liiey too had their forms
their priesthood and had erected among then
their idoljsilet ce before whom all were ex
prrtcd to bow anticipating at this pom
that some of htt audience w ould not under
stand her faithfulness with he r own society
the gave filth vhat she supposed to be thi
language of their hearts why do yoi
speak against your own society yes wai
the rply weil we dont tluak much o
any one who will speak evil of their own so
enny and ido not think much of suyom
who w  expose the sins of other societies
and conceal the sirrs of his own
the speaker again adverted to the suhjeci
of pncii ul christianity placing it above al
creeds and forms of worship and deploring
the manner in whicii these were callei
above and separated fiuin a lfie of goodness
qeoamg from wiilum feno she said tha

fatsuf t humanly in tho old world in
thih cuafiectton rr own experience eight
years ago while in great britain was
brought in with good eflbct at that lime so
much oppressed and hungry wen the people
that they had placed upon their banners the
terrible motto of bread or blood and so
eager were they for their rights that they
would forget the common decencies of life
they spurned conrenfftroaf right tad usages
overleaping them all they would cuter the
meetings called for other purpose and force
their cause before the people and although
it was annoying to bo thus disturbed looking
at it in the light of a worldwide reformer
mrs mott said she n jotoed in it speaking
of the education of children in england she
dealt with deserved severity on th limited
manner in which girl children were educated
the most of the poorer classes of whom were
merely taught to read the higher branches
being considered above their station in life
and t was said it would not do to instruct
them above their condition still the condi
tn of those poor and degraded as it was
is incomparably better than that of the riave
in our own land with him education in
any form is made next to impossible the
laws prohibiting and utterly forbidding under
severe penalties th j teaching of slaves even
to read the poor of the old world too
cotild tell of their own wrongs they could
mix with the people they could appeal to
tue sympathies and could force themselves
upon attention not so with the slave thcv
are without the right of speech and are not
even allowed to assemble to consider their
wrongs or petition for a redress of their
grievances after dwelling at length upon this
contrast with the spirit ami faith of a proph
etess the preacher sunnrted tip the giant evils
with which the world is afflicted and the dif
ficulties and dangers which lay in the way of
reform and drew a picture of truth and
righteousness gloriously triumphing over them
all
at theclose of the address we were called
upon by a part of the audience for a speech
hut considering the lateness of the hour the
length of lime the meeting had been crowded
together and above all esteeming the impres
sion made by the address much bettar for the
cause than any which we could make or leave
on the minds of the audience thanking the
audience for their kindness we asked to be
excused and at once proposed the adjourn
ment
mr and mrs mott left this city on monday
for cattaraugus where they propose to visit a
while with the indians
they will go from thence into canada
where they mean to visit the slaves who have
sought a refuge from american slavery in that
country may cod bless and prosper them in
 their labors of love and speed them on their
 mission of mercy they will have the bless
ings of those who are ready to perish and
the prayers of the sighing bondman wherever
they may travel and among whomsoever they
i may sojourn
i wc arc happy to learn that it is the inten

their presence on their return

from the buffilo and niagara falls cars on
tuesday the itli insi at buffalo and was
so much bruised about the face and breast
that he was compelled to defer his visit to
canada and to place himself under tho care
of a physician mr garnet and g w
clark the antislavery minstrel are holding
conventions in western new york tho
cause of this brutal outrage we suppose to
be mr garnets complexion the particulars
have not yet however come to our notice
we shall therefore delay any comments which
in other circumstances wc should feel dispos
ed to make bad as is our public sentiment
wo had supposed that such outrages had for
ever ceased out of the land but we wait fur
particulars

among the measures proposed for a con
tinued agnation of public sentiment on the
subject of slavery the one hundred conven
tions received the hearty and unanimous ajc
proval of the meeting and the finance com
mittee with james n buffum as its chair
man were very executive in their appeals to
the pockets of abolitionists to sustain the
movement near  hundred dollars was
 thus obtained the resolution declaring that
it would never be deemed out of order to ask
for money kcjt the ma ting in an excellent
and benevolent humor while the committee
were discussing this order of the day
rev edwin thompson impressed the hot
upon tins meeting that tuamoiiey was not fur
hte aid of those who appealed but would be
appropriated exclusively to advance the
causesto secure the services of those
pioneers who ever had been and were yet
willing to make sacrifices if parker pilhv
bury and others consecrate tim and energy
to the work of eulighteniug the community on
its duties and responsibilities we who an in
terested but cculd nut share with them in tlm
labor should cheerfully bestow of our means
and bid them god speed many of the anti
slavery lecturers could receive rnueh more
money in other departments did they but

i more than an equivalent
samuel may jr appealed to those who
t claimed to be abolitionist and yet for one
long year had not contribute to the cause
i fad they forgot that the slave was yet ia his
chains and that these our measures were cai

the always exciting topicthe pro slave
ry american church and clergyoccupied
i prominent season of debate principally parti
ci paled in by elder martin cheney of rhodi
j stand rev mr fmnm to new hmmp
shire s s foster and parker pillsbury
mr cheney has long actd with the garrisoi
abolitionists ami defended them from many
cilsc charges preferred by proslavery oppo
nents mr fairfield ad aimed tbo faithful
oeas of abokuooists tho guilt of the church
 whose garments were dripping with the
blood of the slave but did not concur o the
hrsh languageput forth by antislavery men
but before the debate ended it was a difficult
matter to decide who condemned slavery in
the strongest language
parker pillsbury presented an incortrovcrt
iblo argument on the evil iuthieucc of the po
litical parties iatl the deceptions practicd
upon the working man the baited support the
parties yielded to southern institutions re
ferring also to the prediction of the liiiera
tor eleven years aro that texas would be
annexed that the warning was unheeded
but that tlte mexican w ar with every other
link in that chain of prediction had been
verified mr pillsbury who confessed hav
ing been both a wiropulled and a wirepuller
among the politicians imparted some of his
experience showing bow the machinery was
made to bear upon the rank and tie lie
read some extracts lrom wuddy thompsons
notes on m xico expressing the contempt of
southern nabobs tor northern and other
workingmen the speaker concluded with a
tribute to that class the bone and sinew of
the nation invoking blessings upon them the
working men gods nobility
no two men have been more aeelous or
effective in the antislavery field then ste
phen s foste and parker pillsbury they
have nobly confronted opposition fur the truths
sake against all the manifestations of a
wicked community have they imparted the
whole gospel that which will erelong melt
the chain from every slave on american soil
during the latuner war in boston a d many
a time before and since stephen sfoster
has been made the victim of ruffianly pro
slavery mobocratie violence and to bis ever
lasting honor be it proclaimed never yet
flinched from iris godlike position a few
weeks since parker pillsbury was lecturing
in essex county mass to a respectful and
attentive audience and lie favored them with
ia reminiscence of a visit of his to the same
place a few years since on a similar mission
j when his reception then was far different
fiom this and that be bail now preserved in
his antislavery cabinet at home some of tiie
brickbats hurled at bis bead on that occasion
these are the trophies of early abolitionists
and proof of a devotion too seldom brought
to mind by abolitionists of recent growth
the efforts of the northern abolitionists
will live in the memory of many a slave now
in the rice swamps or cotton fields whose
children will be taught to lisp in grateful ac
cents the names of those who in the dav of
small things bore a noble and selfdenying
testimony
on the l ist evening session at faneuil hall
hailes lenox keinond submitted the follow
ing resolution in support of which he made
a most brilliant and effective speech
resolved tint we will never throw anv
obstacle however slight in the wav of slaves
obtaining their freedom in the most direct and
summary manner in their power that so far
 from counselling them to be content in their
condition we will spare no effort to make
them the contrary that so far from advising
them to bear in patience the evils of their
condition we will encourage them by every
righteous means in our power to escape from
that condition at their earliest opportunity
mr rcmonj alluded to the indignities
heaped upon ins unoffending brethren in the
 ailed states under the american constitu
tion detisling the various forms of prejudice
and exclusion peculiar to the states several
ly north and south remarking that it was
only by allowance that the colored man ex
isted south of mason and dixons line

he narrated the history of three young
colored tnen ho recently met in western n v
who bad but just made good their escape from
souther slavery  heir persons were lacer
ated by the nun and pierced by the bullet
 hey wo n i g iroai american republi
canism to the ruiecuouol ilntsh monarchy
while syinj liuiiiig with taem he was re
minded of an expression ol henry  garnet
that he had much rather repose in freedom
under the mane of the british lion than be
despoiled of liberty by the claws of vhc ame
rican eagle and how was it he asked with
the uoauauil fiee colord man of thfc north 
why there wen many even at thin late
day inquiring whether tliey were prepared to
receive the boon of equal rights i he com
tended that it wa natural for al to love and
enjoy equal rights and therefore unnatural to
submit to lees tfie colored man had too
long been the fringework of weifty it was
indeed high uinj for him to ascit his rights
hi manhood and in the name of god and
justice to make a hold strike for freedom
lie reminded the men who stood before hun
that a large number of the colored people of
the united states were leeitog more and more
sensitive nde their w rang a iliat they had
borne until forbearance bad ceased to be a
virtue that despite the towering obstacles
before them they hid many of them about
resolved to adopt the peattment of patrick
henry give me liberty or give me death
mr i remarked tffal he po favors but
rights that be was pleadi g for the greatest
as well as for the smallest men lie pled
jor all as an american e mdetxi he was one
tamaalf and these lore united with thetu m
hope for the salvation of hut country he
alluded briefly to the prejudice against cukr
so prevalent in the eomtrrniitr as being un
kind unmanly apd predicated open much
that ia false many who indulged ta this
aruchuhan spirit know but lulu or nothing
of those they thus injured tbee mere
among the colored people aa aspiring mioda
as themselves who only asked feu play that
their merits might be appropriately tested
they had their likes and dislikes reialtve to

jlhe white population it was not confined t
ne race exclusively this prejudice against
dolor was my capri ions her black waa the
bsdge of degradation but in africa when
j mothers wished to frighten their children
they would point to a w hite man railing him
the devil there was nothing arbitrary at
all in the term iet but american slavery
he abohbee ami colorpbohia would soon find
it resting hee as for himself lie waa
proud of hi complexion much preferring to
be the blackest man that ever lived than a
proslavery pile lace who at congress or
otherwise had not the moral courage to ei
t hibtt a son oi h ow q when tho question of
human rights was under discussion
mr rwnqod concluded amid general ap
plause which was much m contrast with his
appearance on fanenil hall platform at the
latimer meeting seme years since where he
was not allowed to speak but the times are
changed since then and they will not retro
grade in this raarrh of reform there are no
footsteps backward
mr garrison disclaimed any belief in the
propriety of physical effort to rid the land of
slavery tot was gratified that the remarks
had boon so well received it was proof that
the audience sympathized in the idea that all

mn editorthe principal topic of in
tetevt here is the nomination of general
i av lor by the whies
if anything were wanting after the quiet
submission with wltich the northern whigs
received the annexation of texas and the
war with me xico to show their cornpleto
subserviency to the south we have it in the
alacrity with which tiny generally respond ta
the nomination of gen taylor the whig
papers of the north have pretended that op
position to the extension of slateiy is one uc
the principles of the party many of thetu
have denounced the mexican war as unjust
outrageous ard unconstitutional yet now
they advocate the election to the presidency
of the military chieftain who commanded the
army of invasion who in his proclamations
to the mexicans after the first bailies justified
the war who has never yet expressed a
political opinion but whose celebrity has
arisen solely from his success in the war who
i one of the largest slaveholders in iwiuisi
aua ard who has yet to express the fust
word in opposition to t lie extension of slavery
not a whig paper in good standing in
massachusetts has refused to support the
nomination the boston whig cf course
opposes taylor but this does not form an
exception for that hightoned journal was
long ago excommunicated from the party
wm s robinson esq the late editor of
the lowell fourier deserves honorable men

retired from the editorial department of tie

stamp which hvc made some pretension to
antislavery feeling have fallen mtothepack
and joined the cry like so many whipped
spaniels ih courier the most liberal and
independent sixpenny in boston has thus
far preserved a noncommittal course bat 
have it from good authority that although t
eld r buckingham firmly rfcm to write a
woid in iaor of the nomination the paper
w ill finally support gen taylor
i he course of the northern whigs during
the last four years shows that they are either
most cowardly poltroons or most miserable
hypocrite th y have been noisy in thin
clamor about northern rights they have
been justly lavish of their denunciations of be
democratic party for it adhesion to slavery
arid yet in the midst of their professions they
go to philadelphia and hasten to oofdo the
dempyrary in devotion to tbeir southern
masters while the democrats nominate a
demagogue and a doughface but still a
northern man who has never held a slave
the whig put up one of the largest slave
holders ta america
 was at s whig ratification meeting in a

because they were not founded on the great
principle of the inalienable rights of aij men
thus men forget that however they might
frame governments and laws for th iiifi ives
resting for support on enslaved millions they
themselves were subject to a higher a divine
government whose decrees ar immutable
patriotism had indeed clung with ardor to liei
institutions as if immortal but experience
has taught the world that iu government can

ried into interminable bondage by christian
americans who noby stood fonh mcvferec
of their rights as freemen ard succeeded in
recapturing the it dividends irom the
grasp of illu cradle rubber and set them at
liberty and during the melee the slaveholder
was very badly injured and died lu a few
weeksconsequently a great many persons
were arrested and thrown into prison after a
final ufa trial judge uepburne sentenced
eleven men to the eastern benin nuary for
three years each committees were formed
throngliout the state and money was raised
to test the legality of the sentence and after
a lapse of nine months or more these eleven
men were discharged by the supreme court
on the ground of illegal sentence so the
 slaveholders and their abettors have been de

perhaps one cause of the comparative
apathy of the bulk of the people of england
with regard to the fate of their enslaved

inability to form a just estimate of their

that no siave could tread hu native soil or

burning plains of unrewarded and unsweet

abysses of human misery aul degradation
and see in each fearful picture instead ol

the customhardened heart is not softened let

in order more fully to appreciate th
depths of its sinfulness we must print if

which it plunges its victimsthe fearful
descendings of that cloud of despair which

attempts at reconstruction she liu not failed
to endure tiiosa convulsive movements w hich
aie incident on all revolutions and which bear
the same relation to the gradual development
of institutions in more favored countries
which the galvanic plunges of a revitalized
body do to the regular function of ordinary
existence she lias however recently de
feated a conspiracy of the utmost danger to
peace andorder and the attituda her gov
eminent assumed on that occasion although
not so firm as it might have been has yet in
spired men with a greater conviction of her
stability titan they have hnueito entertained
she is in the labor question attempting im
possibilities trom which the ruinus results

the question involved in italian independ

of the loabarjo euetian kingdom the

however of the oppressive character it has
assumed in the hands of the austrian the

extract from john vanf burens speech
at monroe county democratic convention june  
the question now arises in regard
to territory west of mississippi ter
j ritory now free which has become s
part of the united states under the de
claration sf the president the ques
tion is u shall slavery go there or
shall freedom go there both can
not go there as i think i shall be able
o show youy it will be recollected
that the whole region ceded from vir
ginia was slave territory that re
gion is now att free thts shows you
the wisdom ofthe policy of jefferson
by which slavey was prohibited from
going there  was told by an in
telligent gentleman the other day that
the ordinance actually set free some
two or three thousand slaves is it
not idle then for gentlemen to deny
the power of congress to prohibit
slaveholders from going into free ter
ritory and planting slavery there if
they do this they expel the white la
borer beyond all question for he will
not go into a county where hs will be
obliged to labor side by side with the
black slave this is a question which
must be met now it is not a question
in regard to a treaty to be formed or
territory that may or may not be ac
quired it is not a future but a pres
ent questionit is now hereupon us
and must be met at once the pre
sident says our government must be
extended over oregon and the people
who have gone into that country have
petitioned for a territorial govern
ment to be established there a bill
for that purpose is now before con
gress and is likely to fail because of
the unwillingness of the southern mem
bers to grant a provision which shall
prohibit slavery it is upon us and
must be decided at the ensuing presi
dential election
what are the objections to the ex
tension of slavery they are in the
first place because it is upon its face a
disgrace and a curse kvcry human
being knows it to be so washington
knew it jefferson knew it and they
declared it boldly patrick henry
james monroe james madison and all
the early fathers of the republic
slaveholders and living in virginia
fully and unqualifiedly asserted that it
was a great social and political evil
and a disgrace to the institutions that
permitted it to exist if there were no
other question presented but the ab
stract question of slavery itself no
northern freeman would hesitate to say
that it ought not to be extended but
there are other considerations connect
ed with it for instance in the south
ern states one man is equal to four
persons at the north the great prin
ciple at the basis of american institu
tions is that taxation and representa
tion should go hand in hand that
principle is openly and signally violated
under the provision which permits this
disparity to exist in regard to the
states where this provision is now al
lowed it is a matter of compromise
and to that extent l am willing to sub
mit to it but when it is proposed to
carry the slave market into the new
and virgin fields of new mexico and
california i must firmly object no
man who claims to be a friend to the
principles of liberty and equality
would hesitate to say that slavery must
stand still where it is what madness
has seized upon the southern people
on this question when they attempt to
force upon us the candidate of a con
vention where one man from south
carolina gives nine votes and seventy
two from new york give none
laughter and applause of all ex
travagant abuses of the theory of re
presentation this seems the most ex
traordinary this commander without
men laughter whom his own state
repudiatesworse off even than the
conservatives for a few people do
pretend to have sent them is allowed
to cast nine votes what har new
york done to the democratic party
new york who from the formation ol
the constitution until now has shoul
dered and carried through with her
triumphant power all great democrat
ic measureswhat evil has she done
that she deserves to be scourged by this
south carolina catoninetails
cheers and laughter
there is one question connected with
this subject which coincs home to ev
ery man in this countrya question
between the capital of the south
and the free labor of tkc north the
capital of the south in the hands o
three hundred thousand slaveholders
and the free labor of the north in th
hands of freemen the question is
whether the territory to be annexe
shall be divided into plantations of tw
or three thousand acres for the occupa
tion of slaveholders or cut up int
small and convenient farms for actua
settlerswhether free labor shall b
forever kept outfor we know that th
white laboring man cannot be drivei
into a country where he will have ti
work beside the black slave slaverj
breaks down and destroys the dignitj
of the laboring man the irish ger
man swiss aud french emigrants comi
to this country to find homes when
thay will be respected and where thej
may enjoy equal social and politica
privileges and where they will find i
government to protect them tht
question is then if this great mass th
annual accumulation of w hich is equa
to the entire slnveholding population
shall be allowed to go into this new
territory to find homes and build u
states which shall take their places bj
j the side of ohio and reflect honoi
upon free institutions throughout tb
world this is to be decided at this
election and how is it presented
both conventions were organized an
proceeded upon this single question
j how is it with mr cass geo rath
bun of auburn has declared an
there has been no denial of it that mr
cass assured him last year that he wai
decidedly in favor of the wilmot pro
viso and that he expressed his rvgrei
at not being able to vote upon it or
account of mr davis of mass speak
tog against time at the close of these
foo he has now published a letter ii
vfctcfc k hs has changed bu
views or tkftt subject asd denies the
power of congress to pass toy law
prohibiting slavery in free territory
h utica convention declared that
while they would not make a test upon
this question they would not support
a man who did daily advrrtiarr
instincts or the blind
a notice of the life and writings of
dr biacklock by mr b b bowen a
a resident of massachusetts contains
the following curious passage respect
ing the ideas which the blind have of
colors
i would state here for the benefit
of the curious r that there is a fancied
resemblance at least between colors
and the tones of the human voice
the lower tones correspond with the
darker shades the medium voice with
the paler colors or the milder shades
and the higher tones or the head
voice with the brightest and most
brilliant colors as a bright red lor ex
ample the female voice whose me
 odious tones can move the heart to
deepest ecstacy is a combination of
the blue the violet and the pink ibe
masculine voice resembles the black
the green and the red  hese are va
riously compounded in different indi
viduals we hear in the deep rich
tones of the hon daniel websters
voice for example the first two or the
black and red or if you please dark
and brilliant in most persons how
ever the medium or green voice pre
dominates those who have what is
called a squeaking voice such as the
celebrated john randolph is said to
have had the red is predominant
the two extremes when rightly com
bined are the most agreeable to the
ear these remarks may seem crude
and to some even silly we have
made them however for what they are
worth it seems to us the only way in
which we can obtain the most remote
idea of colors for it is absurd to sup
pose that they would make use of their
names without attaching to them any
meaningthat they would repeat par
rotlike just as children sometimes do
words without attaching to them any
definite idea it may not generally be
known that the blind attach to almost
all physical objects some moral quality
it of course depends upon the effect
produced by different objects upon the
mind through their other senses or
upon some idea which they have ob
tained from others with the sun is
connected the idea of greatness and
magnificence with the moon amiabili
ty benignity etc
tiie last bell
it was a beautiful morning in the
month of may  i was sitting by
the side of helen harris the only girl
i ever loved and i believe the only
girl that ever loved meany how she
was the only one that ever told me so
we were sitting in the piazza of her
fathers house about a quarter of a mile
from the landing place waiting for the
bell of the steamboat that was to w arn
me of the moment that was to part my
love and me it came to pass in the
course of my history that in order to
accumulate a little of this worlds gear
that i might be the better prepared to
encounter the demands of matrimony
i was destined to cross the blue chesa
peake and seek in the metropolitan city
the wherewith so much desired how
many swains have been compelled like
me to leave home and the girl they
loved in search of gold and good
gracious how many have been disap
pointed but to the piazza
well we were sitting in the piazza
and talking of our love and separation
c we were waiting for the unwel
come sound of the steamboat bell and
you may rely on it we talked fast and
abbreviated our w r ords in such rujrgcd
sentences that nobody but ourselves
could understand them the first hell
rung i sprang to my feet and trembled
ilke an aspen oh georgew ait till the
last bell rings said helen as the big
bright tears came over her blue eyes
do no such thing answered the
hoarse voice of mr harris as he
arose like a spectre from the cellar
where he had been packing away his
cider george never wait for the last
bell i was off like a deer and i
arrived at the steamboat merely in time
to go on board before she w as pushed
off from the wharf
my career in search of pelf has in
a degree been successful but i believe
had not the old farmer told me never
to wait for the last bell i should now
i be as poor as the morning that fare
well shivered from my lips upon the
heart of my lovely helen any per
son who has lived at a hotel even for a
day knows the danger of waiting fot
the last bell i did it once and lost my
dinner the first stroke of the dinnet
bell always found me at table foi
six months i was a clerk andmyncvei
waiting for the last secured for me
the affections of niyjriftployer who of
fered me a partnership which i accept
ed and in every instance when the bell
j rung i was read
i had almost forgotten to tell you
that helen harris is my wife and she
will never repent the morning i took
her father at his word and ran ovei
the field to the boat in time when i
arrived at baltimore i called on some
gentlemen to whom i had introductory
letters and they rcccmmended ine foi
a situation one was soon offered
which had been refused by our young
men who were waiting for the last bell
and which i accepted it was the mak
ing of me haste for the first bell
accept lha first offer and keep it till
you get a better life is short and ik
who puts off until the last bell will a t
father harris predicts come out al
the little end of the horn
i young ladies i have a word for you
in the street where i live there is a
lady who has been seven years ii
choosing a partner for life she ha
had several respectable offers but she
i was waiting for the last bell and she is
now likely to remam to the last a belle
for she is turned of thirty and it ii
more than probable that she must bide
her blessedness forever now i be
seech all of you who may read thii

ages slavery aaade a bile it ited in
its nukiesl from in the state ol
york sons time prior
lutioo ill these states there lived in
the city of scheneckidy a man who
followed the trade of sailing a vessel to
the british possessions in the est
indies called honduras in process ol
time this captain formed an acquaint
ance with a family of coloured persons
in those parts and an intimacy be
tween the parties was the result
facilities for edueation being superior
in the states at that time the parents
of wy si other were induced to entrust
two of their most promising children
a son and a daughter to this seacap
tain to take with him to the states in
order to give them an education afew
years had elapsed and the american
rebellion broke out when this man s
trade was cut off with the v cat indies
and his avaricious heart led him to g l
and take my dear mother and her
brother out of chool and he sold them
as slaves for life the consequence
was she was sold several times to the
most cruel tyrants that could be found
to break what they termed her stubborn
spirit during this time she married
and became the mother of three
children of which i am the second
while the third was in infancy my
mothers elder sister left home in
search of my mother and found her
after searching for three or tour years
in various parts this older siter had
been despatched by the fond parents
of those interesting chilprcn hut
oh witness in imagination the meeting
of those two sisters after a separation
of twenty years it was utterly im
possible to separate them my mother
was immediately bought and paid for by
her sister who refused to take up hea
residence in this slaveholding country
and was unwilling to leave it without
her sister here my poor father was
brought into trying circumstances
being himself a slave lie entreated
that his wife might be permitted to
remain with him but all to no purpose
the sister insisted upon her accompany
ing her home to the west indies at
length my mother consented to go
and for want of sufficient means the
two eldest children had to remain in
slavery my father lived a few years
and negotiated to purchase his free
dom but about the time of its ac
complishment the cruel messenger
death summoned him to appear at the
judgmentseat of christ thus we
were left without parents to the tendei
mercies of american slavery

timber went up hard and on this ac

regular vociferations of heave away

the officer before spoken of stopped

and seeing the timber sometimes scarce

would it revive what a view would

purposes of a literary kind even
might it be rendered subservient to

quite different things now from what
they were sixty or even twenty years

were obliged to strain their wits and
exhaust their means in order to obtain
