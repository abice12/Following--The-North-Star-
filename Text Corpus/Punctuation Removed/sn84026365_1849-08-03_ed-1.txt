yesterday in company with several
friends i made a pilgrimage to mount
vernon so much has been written by
others respecting that venerated spot
that the subject has become in a good
degree hackneyed and yet there is
so much ot national and historical in
terest associated with it that our peo
ple love to read about it and therelore
it is that i have concluded to give the
readers of the atlas my impressions in
relation to it
leaving washington at ten o clock
in the steamer we reached the old
town of alexandria six miles distant
in about an hour the sail down the
potomac was exceedingly pleasant
nature appearad dressed in her most
gorgeous drapery the banks of the
river arc adorned with pleasant tesi
dences and cultivated iields though
these bear a small proportion to tho
vast extent of wood and forest which
stretch as far as the eye can reach in
almost unbroken grandeur on both
shores at alexandria we engaged a
hack to leave us at mount v onion al
exandria is a town worthy ot a more
thorough investigation than we were
able togive it it is as unlike one of
our thriving new england villages as
it could well be the bouses are most
ly of brick and have an ancient dull
conservative appearance  lie streets
which are paved appear as if car
riages and trucks were not permitted
to pollute their surface the grass is
literally growing in the most public
thoroughfares the town appears to be
in the sere and yellow leat as having
been finished a quarter of a century
ago and like a picture by one of the
great masters it only requires age to
mellow andsoften the rough points to
complete the impression of decay
here and there you meet with houses
which command your attention trom
their venerable centennial look and
which bring forcibly to your mind the
days of auld lang syne when men
wore short clothes and powdered hair
in my travels in the old world placet
and scenes like those in alexandria
have fallen athwart my path but nevei
have they before in the new world o
america the effects of them upon
n y mind were similar to those which 
have felt in entering the sacred pre
empts of a ruined monastery or feuda
castle few people were seen in th
streets the silence of the place pene
trated even to the hotel and one itli
unwilling to speak aloud lest lu
should disturb the quiet general repost
which every where prevailed
the hack at length drove to the dooi
of the hotel and wc took our seat
therein the driver was a venerabk
ethiop who bore the appellation o
uncle colover he belonged to the
gentleman who owned the horses anc
hack he was nearly sixty years o
age and is well known to gentlemer
who visit the tomb of washington
wc were told tiiat the roads to mounl
vernon weie very good now ns the
long spell of dry weather had hardened
the surface and dried up the streams
trie distance from alexandria to mounl
vernon is short ot ten miles and h lt
time occupied in making the journey
thereto was two hours after gettinj
fid of the rough pavement of the town
our road lay through a thickly woodet
country at times when wc reuchet
a bohi point in the road broad and ex
tensive valleys of great pictaresqu
beauty presented themselves with hen
and there a wheat or corn field break
i lira monotony of the woody soli
the north star
tude and on n gentle declivity almost
 embowered within the rich folaige ol
ratal pas and shrubbery were to be
seen the white w alls of the home of the
proprietor tho land as a general
j thing appeared to he worn out and ex
hausted and such  believe is the fact
in this part of old v irginia in the
days of washington great attention
was paid to the cultivation of the tobac
co plant but tobacco is a crop which
requires great skill in the cultivation
in order that the land may not become
i exhausted and worthless land can
now be purchased any where in this
region for five dollars an acre the
i land has been so long tilled by dull un
intelligent slave labor that it is hard
ly of any valuo and ninetenths of it
is overgrown with wood and brush
the roads are truly awful and a yan
i kee driver would be astonished to
i witness the skill with which u ncle
colover put his team over them with
out upsetting the carriage
about four miles from mount ver
non our road lay across a fine level
plain a mile at least in extent on
i which were growing some of the finest
 oaks i have ever seen at a compara
tively small expense the underbrush
and smaller trees might be cleared out
and a park made which would compare
i favorably with ths most celebrated in
england but the same poverty ne
 gleet and premature decay marked this
quiet landscape which was visible
everywhere
crossing this plain we came to a
small brook where tho driver stopped
ins horses to give them water the
brook forms the dividing line of the
present washington estate though in
i the days of the great washington the
estate extended beyond and included
the oak plain which i have just referred
to the brook at the point at which
j we crossed is three miles from the old
homestead which as uncle colover
said included the worst part of the
road after a ride of two miles we
entered what even now in its waste
and decay bears the unmistakable
i marks of having been a well wooded
and well taken care of park we
passed between the ruins of what had
j in other days been the porters lodge
the walls remained but the gnte was
gone and the fences which had en
closed the beautiful grounds were no
where visible
after w r e got inside the roads be
came worse than ever and we had to
get out of the carriage and walk in
order to relieve the poor horses whose
i whole strength was taxed to draw the
empty carriage up the steep and broken
acclivities at length we approached
human habitations about a third of a
mile from the venerable mansion they
were the dwellings of the plantation
hands they were decayed and part
 ly in ryins the fences were out of
repairthe old brick wall and con
servatory of washingtons garden
was likewise broken and out of joint
the gates were off the hinges and
nettles and noxious uecds and parasi
tical plants clung to them as if to hide
their deformed nakedness the only
living thing about this cluster of dwel
lings were a few geese and goslings
who amused themselves by wading
through a small stagnant pool near by
it being sabbath the inmates had gone
to alexandria to meeting
we passed on about a hundred
i yards having left the carriage down
a lane which soon brought us in front
of the home of washington a few
outhouses occupied by negroes were
on cither side a short distance from
j the mansion while standing on the
greensward before the mansion or
seated within the shadow of the old
trees which grew thereby i was forci
bly reminded of scotts beautiful des
j cription of tully veolan upon the
return of waverly to that sweet spot
after the wars were over and the
kings troops had broken the fountains
cut down the old oak  and endeavored
to set lire to the dwelling
every thing appeared as if it was
going to ruin decay appeared im
pressed every where and on every
tiling passing across the lawn we
passed by the stables and down a cart
road which led to the river diverg
ing to the right into a small valley
 which was filled with brakes and briars
we scrambled down the sides and in a
t few minutes we stood before the tomb
of washington it is built in the side of
f the hill in looking through the barred
gate two marble sarcophagi are seen
in one of which repose the remains of
george washington and in the other
those of martha his wife
i  cannot describe the feelings which
impressed me when standing thus in
t front of the earthly remains of one
who take him all in all was the best
and the greatest man that ever lived
j one whose name is venerated through
out the world by every lover of liberty
i and order
even the tomb of this great man
fj bore the same evidence of neglect that
impressed every thing around it the
i bricks which supported the marble
f were crumbling and the mortar which
i held them together had fallen from be
tween and left them lose every
thing was wild and rude and neglec
ted and i turned away with a inelan
ii choly frame of mind and sat for hall
an hour by the shore of the palomac
listening to the ripple of the waters
upon the beach and the sighing of the
winds amid the forests that lined its
 banks
no stranger is permitted to visit the
 house on the sabbath and even during
i the week daya only a part of the houst
is open to the public the estate i
c believe now comprises some sixteet
p hundred acres the part that is culli
vated is probably lass than a hundrcc
acres ihcre are enty mmc twenty
right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren
f
five colored persons on the estate
most of whom are stares from one
of w hom a female wc purchased some
hoe cake and milk and from her hus
band we purchased each a hickory walk
ing stick which were cut on the estate
i know of few places upon which a per
son of wealth and taste could better
make an expenditure the location of
the mansion is singularly fine and the
great number of large oaks and other
trees around it many of which were
planted by general washington give
to it a rural beauty and charm which
can bo felt but not fully described
many of the walks arc still distinctly
visible though covered in a good de
gree with a coating of verdure
the present proprietor mr wash
ington is quite a young man and we
have heard that he is vr g to sell the t
old mansion with several hundred
acres of the land to the national gov
ernment he of course will not sell
it to strangers we do not believe
that any person ever visited this hal
lowed spot without going away with
the conviction that the purchase of it
should be made by congress let
the nation own it and fit it up in a
manner worthy of the republic and of
the illustrious dead whose name is our
richest inheritance and whose life was
one uninterrupted flow of the highest
and purest actions that ever marked
the family of man it is disreputable
that it should longer remain in its
present state if we had mount ver
non in old massachusetts if washing
ton had been her son and his body
was lain within her mould how the spot
would be treasured in our hearts and
beautified by our hands the people
of our commonwealth would count it
as their richest treasure and our maid
ens would keep the tomb dressed with
flowers in perennial freshness
the tree democracy
the cleveland true democrat of last week
has some remarks in excellent spirit on the
course which ought to be adopted by the free
democracy the fditor is opposed to union
with either party until the people teach the
leaders of one or both that servility to the
south is infamy and a slavish obedience
to party or power the basest and blackest of
all political sins unusual language this for
the editor of a party paper and commendable
as it is rare in another article in reply to
some strictures by one of his neighbors he
continues the subject thus
wo despisq special pleading it
seems and sounds like a very mockery
to talk of forms and dwell upon dog
mas when a living principle is at stake
it is so and the man or party that
does it will deaden spirit and dwarf
intellect and destroy whatever vital
energy they possesss the herald of
last evening is full of this special
pleading and nothing else while re
plying to us
our objection to its course does not
lie in its declaration that the gentle
men named by it were democrats nor
any thing of the sort we care not
what they were if right now if
forced by public opinion to take a right
position now there is not there cannot
be in the nature ofthings one earnest
man who will not rejoice in the change
in religiondo we cavil at the past life
of the repentant man we hail him
with joy cheer him on stand by him
in moralsdo we abandon the outcast
we clutch him as a brother and cling
to him while there is hope andwhv
because we know that this is the only
true way to reach and reform him so
in politics if a slavish spirit on any
side is awakened to a sense of right
by feeling its own or others degrada
tion we must if true to principle or
the feeling it awakens hail this evi
dence of change with joy and lift it up
and on by our generous aid or hearty
sympathy this is a law of heaven
and as a test tell us and others
whether we are right or wrong whe
i ther we are making a sham or a real
defence in any good cause
i slavery lives or dies by public opin
ionbreath makes and breath will
destroy it we may pile up law upon
i law we may fence it round with statute
upon statute but if the voice of an
united people roused by a quickened
moral sense and a lofty patriotism
shall but touch it it falls what but
this conviction makes nearly the whole
south cry out for nonintervention
what but a knowledge of this fact
causes the ultra to threaten civil war
and disunion the party or people
the man or set of men then that
checks or seeks to check any expres
j sion against slaverythat weakens or
helps to weaken this voice and its
i utterance is a foe to freedom and a
defender of human servitude no mat
ter what professions he may make or
what principles he may proiess
examine this position patiently and
fairlv and by living examples
when the buffalo convention was
called proslavery was in the ascen
dant it ruled triumphantly at wash
ington the leaders there were ultra
domineering exacting in every way
and insulting in every respectthe
result of the appeal to the north was
doubtful if was sneered at in wash
ington and denounced in the free
i states but the day came and with
jt such a gathering and such a spirit
ns had never been witnessed in our
land since the revolution and the fact
sped on the electric wires and wa
borne in letters and by the press ali
over the country and to its national
centre what followed the slave
power was defeated downcast depen
dent the friends of freedom of all
parties were alive with zeal full ol
courage bold successful
j well remembering this result and
i the cauiea which produced it ft lew
rochester n y friday august  
friends of freedom resolved to cele
brate the anniversary of the ordinance
of  and in doing it not to evoke
party action or use it for party ends
but to see if they could not rally the
people and let the country knowlet
the south feelthat they would never
submit to any extension of slavery in
new states or free territories or to a
continuance of the curse in the district
of columbia or yet more to any
governmental influence or action
which was not wholly on the side of
freedom we met on the day appoint
ed with this motive and for this end
and how are w e greeted by the herald
how treated after we had met by j
sneers by attempts to sow jealousy
among our friends by declarations that
the convention was a great failure by
telling the country and the south es
pecially in effect that the might of the
moral power which gathered in the j
hearts of freemen at buffalo had died
out or dwindled away to a corporals
guard
our neighbor may talk about bil
lingsgate and canting and all that
but it will not answer he strikes a
blow against freedom he works for the
south for slavery whatever he may
design whenever he labors in any
way to lessen the weight of the pub
lic voice come from what party it may
uttering itself in behalf of liberty and
humanity it was this conviction
which roused our indignation it was
this startling belief and not any nar
row special pleading or low partizan
zeal or what the herald styles these
truths which impelled us to use to
wards it the strong language we did
from tlie liberator
reformed presbyterian syn
od of tiie u states
the synod of the reformed pres
byterian church met in philadelphia
may d the following were its pro
ceedings on the subject of slavery
they stand in honorable contrast with
those of the old and new school gen
eral associations of the presbyterian
church and their religious bodies it
will be seen tiiat this synod makes
clean work of it both in church and
state practically carrying out the
motto of the american antislavery
societyno union with slaveholders
either religiously or politically
the special committee on memori
als on the subject of slavery reported
report accepted and adopted and is as
follows
thu committee to whom were refer
red certain memorials on the subject of
slavery respectfully report
the petitioners lamenting the pre
valent ignorance of our testimony
against this great evil and the coun
tenance given to it by most christian
denominations in the united states
respectfully ask synod ist to re
assert their position in regard to the
exclusion of slaveholders fromher fel
lowship and her dissent from the united
states constitution on this with other
grounds d they ask that if prac
ticable some more eflicent means may
be adopted for the diffusion of our
doctrines and testimony on this subject
particularly that a remonstrance may
be addressed to the principal slavehold
ing churches
in regard to the first of these peti
tions we remark that the declarations
contained in the historical part of our
testimony published of course by the
presbytery itself furnished ample testi
mony of the position occupied on
slavery by this church we refer to
the following statementthe presby
tery resolved to purge the church of
this dreadful evil they enacted that no
slaveholders should be retained in
their communion the presbytery
required of their connexions a general
emancipation no slaveholder is
since admitted to their communion
see hist test pp   ed 
now while it is true as stated in one
of the memorials that we have not in
our hands the original acts excluding
all slaveholders we have the presby
tery itself as evidence that this was
the purport and design of their actions
this with the uniform practice of the
church for in the language of the tes
timony no slaveholder is since 
admitted to their communion in the
judgment of your committee as com
pletely defines the position of this
church in regard to ecclesiastical fel
lowship with slaveholders as it is pos
sible to do a sight of the original
acts might gratify curiosity but could
not shed any additional light upon that
which is already as clear as noonday j
no slaveholder can have privileges in
the reformed presbyterian church j
we sav the same of our position as a
church in relation to the civil instituj
tions of the country historical j
testimony pp    and
frequent incidental actings since are j
sufficiently explicit on this point cov
enanters have not sworn and do not
swear oaths to the institutions ot the
country among other reasons because
the constitution ot the united states
contains compromises with slavehold
ing interests and guaranties lor the
institution itself protection so ong as it
exists in the slaveholding states w e
have no further action to recommend
on either of these points
d in regard to a remonstrance to
beaddressed to slaveholding churches i
we agree with the petitioners that it is
important that this church take some
i measures to bring her testimony more
directly before the churches and would
recommend that a committee of three
be appointed to prepare a remon
strance of the kind contemplated em
bodying the views and position of this
church on the whole question said
committee to publish the remonstrance
on their own responsibility t 
arguments and expressions htcb tot
may see fit to employ and that they
be authorized to draw upon the liberty
fund for any sum not exceeding ten
dollars to defray the expenses of pub
lication all which is respectfully sub

the glorious fourth
but whether or not the fathers are
entitled to so much credit one thing is
certain it is certain that they were
resolved to submit to no infringement
of tneir freedomanother thing is
equally certain and that is that their
sons are not so resolved and the
two facts show how unworthy are the
latter to celebrate the excellence of the
former the fathers rather than en
dure the imposition of an unjust tax on
their tea rose in bloody rebellion a t
gainst the government that attempted
to impose it but there is hardly a
right which the three million of our
revolutionary fathers valued that a
larger number of the degenerate sons
have not permitted to be struck down in
their own persons not it is true by a
king lords and commous there
were a comparative dignity in suffering
wrong  at such hands but by a con
temptible oligarchy of some 
slaveholders the fathers were men
at least they behaved like such when
their own rights were invaded their
children are slaves ay slaves of
slaves all the oppressions ever
heaped on the former by george the
third and his parliament were but a
sandgrain to the desert or a drop in
the ocean in comparison of those to
which the latter have submited and do
still submit and no villains of the
old feudal times no collared spaniels
even ever submited more unresistingly
to their masters than the sons of our
revolutionary fathers now submit to
theirs twenty columns of the pio
neer would not suffice to exhibit the
villainies to which we unresistingly
submit our letters and papers instead
of being allowed to be circulated in
the public mails supported chiefly by
ourselves are taken from them and
burned our sailors guiltless of crime
are cast into prisons and often sold
into slavery if we send our wise men
to enquire into the lawfulness of such
violations of all law those wise men
are threatened with coats of tar and
feathers and think themselves happy in
getting back to us with unbroken scon
ces our citizens are sometimes kid
napped from their hearth stones if
one of us having a skin somewhat dar
ker than the presidents wishes to vis
it a foreign country and applies to the
state department of the government
of honest old zach for a passport
or protection he is told by mr secre
tary clayton that passports are not
granted by this department to persons
of color and that protections are only
given to them when they are in the
service of diplomatic agents c t of
the united states going abroad we
are denied the right of locomotion re
wards are offered for the heads of some
of us for daring to affirm that the sell
evident truths ofthedeclaration which
americans plume themselves so much
upon ought to be practically regarded
thronghout the land in addition to all
this our pockets are plundered of hun
dreds of millions of our hard earnings
and these indignities these outrages
this enormous plunder why are we
subjected to them solely to bolster
up and perpetuate the negro slavery of
these  southern oligarchists
that is the use made of us and we
seem to be hardly conscious that we
are fit or were ever intenled for any
other indeed it is doubtful if we are
fit for aught else whatever god may
have intended us for
the white slaves of tho old feudal
barons might have found some apology
for their cringing servility in the fact
that they were conquered by their op
pressors we have not the benefit of
even that poor apology w e never
put our oppressors to the trouble of
conquering us they had but to pre
sent the yoke and we eagerly put our
necks into it humbly beseeching our
masters to plunder and oppress us to
any extent ihey might deern necessary
to the support and perpetually of their
negro slavery and yet in execrable
mockery of that was ever before meant
by the name of freedom and as if re
solved to raise a laugh through all the
despotisms of the old world we get to

glorious fourth and burn vast

col benton this gentleman
who has been nominated
cratic papers and meetings in all the
northern states for the presidency
since his famous jefferson city speech
is greatly distracting the democratic
party by his numerous repetitions of
that celebrated expose of the intentions
of mr calhoun and his friends we
take from the st louis union the fol
lowing summary ot the remarks which
col beoton made recently at new
hartford howard co near the resi
dence of claiborne f jackson who in
troduced the slavery extension resolu
tions into the missouri legislature and
made himself ao conspicuous in pro
curing their passage and is also an as
pirant for the seoatorabip to succeed
col benton
he noticed the circumstance that
the two extreme portions if both the
contending parties on the slavery
questjoo the moat violent of the
aboutioniftf and of the southern agi
tators agree in one point in both ur
ging a dissolution of the unionthe
overthrow of the c institution mr
benton said that for his part he was
equally opposed to northern and south
ern fanaticism equally opposed to dis
union whether it came from nullifiers
or abolitionists but justice requires
him to say that in this design upon the
unionthe abolitionists were the least
dangerous for the reason that there
was among them not a single state a
dopting disunion resolutions whereas
the nullifers had four to wit south
carolina virginia florida missouri
he the discussion ot
the question or questions of slavery in
congress and imputed blame to both
the factions for bringing it there it was
the bane of ali legislation and leading i
to disgraceful scenes on the floor of
congress it was brought into every j
measure mixed with every debate and
prevented the passing of the most nec
esary laws it was like the frogs of
egypt which were found in the kneadj
ing troughs on the table and in the
bridal beds poisoning all the enjoyments
of life
mr b spoke also of the pacific
railwayof the advantage it would be
to missouri
he made a very close compari
son of the legislature resolutions with
those of mr calhoun showing their
great similarity and demonstrating
that mr jackson was not as he had
supposed himself the author of the res
olutions also he showed that these
were nullification resolutions his il
lustrations of these points were new and
convincing
father mathew at home
the following short account of a visit to
the residence of the apostle of temperance
is part of a letter by the editor to the liber
ator the letter is dated cork oct 
on the st inst father mathew
the living savior of ireland from the 
curse of intemperance gave a splendid
soiree as a token of his sympathy andj
regard for friend buffum and myself
it was decidedly the brightest and hap
piest company i think i ever saw any
where
nett morning father mathew in
vited us to breakfast with him at his
own housean honor quite unexpec
ted and one for which i felt myself
unprepared i however accepted his
kind invitation and went i found him
living in a very humble dwelling and
in an obscure street as i approaehetl
he came out of his house and met me
about thirty yards from his door and
with uplifted hands in a manner altoge
ther peculiar to himself and with a face
beaming with benevolent expression
he exclaimed welcome welcome
my dear sir to my humble abode at
the same time taking me cordially by j
the hand he conducted me through a
rough uncarpeted passage to a green
door leading to an uncarpeted stair
way on ascending one flight of which
i found myself abruptly ushered into
what appeared to be both drawing and
dining room there was no carpet
on the floor and very little furniture
of any kind in tho room an oldfash
ioned sideboard a few chairs three
or four pictures hung carelessly round
the room the breakfast tabic was
set when i went in a large urn stood
in the middle surrounded by cups
saucers plates knives and forks
spoons ice cc t all of a very plain or
derrather too plain i thought for so
great a man his greatness however
was not dependent on outward show
nor was it obscured from me by his
plainness it showed that he could be
great without the ordinary attractions
with which men of his rank and means
are generally anxious to surround
themselves upon entering the room
father mathew introduced me to mr
william oconnor an invited guest a
gentleman of property and standing
and though not a teetotaler yet an
ardent admirer of father m the
presence of this gentleman at breakfast j
table afforded me an excellent oppor
tunity of witnessing father m s faith
fulness i found him entirely uncom
promising mr oconnor complained
a little ot his severity towards the dis
tillers of cork who had large amounts
invested in distilleries and who could
not be expected to give their business
up to their ruin to which father m
replied that such men had no right to
prosper by the ruin of others
henry a wise has renounced
politics and refused to enter into the
crusade against thomas h benton
hangman foote of mississippi ad
dressed him in a long letter re
cently reviewing senator bentons
great free soil speech and charging
that eminent man with treachery to the
south mr wise was not quite fool
ish enough to respond favorably to this
proslavery epistle
tn reference to mr wise reminds
us of an anecdote in the w inter of
 when congress was agitated by
antislavery petitions and the blood ol
the south was at fever heat mr wise
boarded at ihe same hotei with a north
ern man before whom he was constant
ly uttering the severest denunciaton of
the whole north and the abolitionists
in particular the northerner one day
asked wise what is the matier with
you southern chaps that you arc so
sensitive to the denunciation of abolition
ists true they call you robbers and men
ktealers but what of that if a set of
fanatics down south were to organize
societies to deprive us of our cattleand
denounce us as a set of sheep stealer
and wooden nutmeg pedlers we should
only laugh at their folly why dont
you treat the abolitionist in the same
i way i tell youad the vriuo
archly there te a great difference m
john dick p
whole no 
the two cases the fact is between
you and i that what the abolitionists
say about us is too d d true
perhaps a graver conviction of the
truth thus unwittingly confessed bat
saved mr wise from the folly of com

champion buglt

ders will no doubt be surprised to learn
that the horrible custom of offering hu

portions of india an american mis
sionary mr winslow bas recently de
scribed the practice as it is observed in
the district of hoamsor among the peo
ple called khonds where it is said three
or four hundred victims are annually
torn to pieces as offerings to the earth
goddess the victims are procured by
fraud or kidnapping among the poorer
classes ofhindoes in the low country
and must be bought for a price by the
offerer at the time of offering every
form of gross and abominable excess
is practiced for three days the vic
tim is taken to a consecrated grove and
fastened to a stakeannointed crowned
and almost adored and then taken to
the presented placo as it is required
that the victim should neither be bound
nor resist his legs and arms are bro

an axe when the whole multitude rush
upon him and exclaiming webought
you with a price and no sin resfa on

the presbyterian herald of louisville
referring to the laws of southern state
against teaching slaves to read say
whatever views may be entertained
upon other points wc think all good
men will agree that the christian citi

satisfied until they have done all in their
power to eradicate such laws from their
statute books they are a standing
monument of disgrace to the states
that have enacted them and ought to

farmer who with his boys worked hi
little farm and lived comfortably by
dint of the most persevering and pati
ent industry this woman had been
born and educated in one of the atlan
tic states and she considered the daily
hath of so much importance to health
and comfort that in all her difficulties
it was rarely omitted her log house
was small and inconvenient consisting
only of two rooms and a woodshed
below and three small chambers
above the kitchen as in most farm
houses was the largest room and in
one corner of this she had placed for
the winter a hogshead cut down and
screened from sight when m use by
bed cover hung from the joist above
in the summer it was in the wood
shed and in this primitive kind of
bath she dipped first the children and
then herself every morning while the
men were feeding the stock and the
kettle on the fire preparing for break
fast and certainly a more healthful
merry set of children never rewarded
a mothers care

 began by affirming that tlw slav a man
not threefifths cf a man but a whole mao
as good as precious by binh and destiny
as any other man ever created by god
next i contended that being a man to him

 called for the immediate repeal ot every
proscriptive enactment against petsons of

ty thank god the work has been effectu

such enactment can now be found on her
statute book
 maintained that men were not responsible
for the color of their skin and that it was
equally absurd and outrageous to exclude
from the common privileges of society a ay
class on account of their complexion
mr garrison hero alluded to the wonder
ful change that had been wrought in public
sentiment on this delicate subject within a
few years past and dwelt with special pride
and satisfaction on the fact that in the railroad
ears ard other public conveyances in this
commonwealth from which refined and intel
ligent colored persona were once brutally
elected no complexioual distinction is now
recognized tins was the way in which
their cause had been put back
lie also referred to the auspiciouschanges
which had taken place in religious bodjes
and political parties on the question of
slavery and made special reference to ilie
controversy now going on between calhoun
and benton the southern house was ai
last divided anda house divided against itj
self cannot standwhile at the north we
were growing more united in the cause of
freedom
lie alluded to the slate of the country at
the time the liberator was started and
when scarcely an individual was willing to
avow himself an abolitionist and compared it
with the present in which hundreds of thou
sands are proud of that title and the land
is shaking beneath the tread of the increas
ing hosts of freemen how wonderful the
change how inspiring the retrospect
c proceeded tc disclaim any special merit
for what lie had done he was only one
of many who had labored with equal zeal
fidelity and success and whose cooperation
should not be forgotten in this connection
he gratefully acknowledged the timely aid
which was also early a period tendered to
the liberator by the excellent women al
luded to by his esteemed friend mr hilton
but it was by a steadfast adherence to prin
ciple and a clear and unfaltering annuncia
tion of the truth that the field had been main
tained and the blessing of god secured
as for himself hecould truly sav that he
had endeavored to make the cause of the
i slave his own for that cause he had
sacrificed the respect and esteem of the
friends of other daysreputation in the com
munityhis ardent political attachmentslns
stiong religious predilections and taken his
position outside of the church and state
which were in league with the oppressor
and he had incurred something of bodily
peril and brought down upon himself riie
vials of popular fury what then  for this
was he to challenge praise or of this was he
to boast  far from it he had simply done
his duty and no one could do ltss and be
true to himself or his race
we have livedhe saidto see nearly a
million of slaves emancipated in the british
west india islandsmany millions emanci
pated in india and slavery abolished in the
french swedish and danish colonies in
tunis and other pans of the world i trust
we shall all live to see the day when not a
slave shall be seen on the american soil but
liberty shall be proclaimed throughout all
the land unto all the imhabitants thereof
iu accepting this beautiful gift  do so on
this one condition if at any subsequent

immediate emancipation of the slave then let

the following is an extract
the ordinance ofb estabhshedja compleu
government for the north west territory
by the provision excluding slavery five fret
states have grown up whose joint prosperi
i ty iesources and political consequence havt
tar outstripped any other portion of the union
this ordinance clearly indicates the fixed pol
i icy of the framers of the constitution no mat
in the original congress ever dreamed tha
 slavery would be found in this country today
they looked forward to its total extinction
and did not hesitate to avow their sentiments
and even to legislate to this effect state af
ter state followed this ordinance abolished
slavery within their limits this policy was
established on the presumption contained in
the declaration of independence jthat all
men are created free and equal the practi
cal application ot this doctrine it was never
 feared by our forefathers would result in a dis
solution of the union and not until mr wil
mot introduced this proviso to an appropria
tion looking to the acquirement of new terri
tory did the south discover in its principles
cause lor such a calamity
there have been attempts to cast censure
upon mr wilmot in this affair which are to
tally unjustifiable by the facts mr w a
goung man belonging to the party in power
met liie frown of a slaveholding president
the opusitionof the vice president and secre
taryboth the latter from his own statetht
ire of the whole south by this movement
et he stood firm and unwavering through
out he could have elected gen gass bv
giving him the vote of pensylvania which it
was known six weeks before the election he
held in his hand but notwithstanding the
most pressing solicitations from his old party
friends he stood it out
with mr bentons views in regard tothi
necessity of enforcing the proviso principle by
law we beg lea re to differ he treats tht
question u an abstraction and compass it u
a quarrel about goats wool when gous havt
no wool he says gorgress has power tt
abolish slavery but cannot exercise such pow
er only where it exists and as there is nc
slavery in these there is d
neeesitv of such a law it is strange this faei
has just been discovered thtee years ago
when this proviso hist introduced there
was an overwhelming majority in the house
of representatives w ho thought differently
eleven stales have since passed resolution
affirming the necessity of such a law
and the fate of such men as lianae
gan breese ctmeroa allen arid gass
should admonish politicians that a different

republican with an ordinary share of sense
be told that the chilians the mexicans the
sandwich islanders and patagonians which
hsve flocked to tbst country for gold shall
have the privilege of settling this ques
tion of freedom for a country larger than the
original thirteen states and we who apent
our blood and treasure to acquire it hare
nothing to say about it l no if they are not
disposed to submit to the forms of republi
can government subjugate them to liberty
cheers
but mr benton is opposed to agitation
because it furnishes ammunition to mr
calhoun and other fanatics lam in favor of
furnishing this very k nd of ammunition to
any southern tnan who can make any thing
by the use of it for propagating slavery
mr v b here passed on to notice the ac
tion of states coming in under this ordinance
and consequently free but who incorporated
the prohibitory clause ir all their constitu
tions he also referred to lowa whichunder
the missouri compromise being north of 
deg  min was free still a proviso was con
sidered necessary in her constitution ore
gon also ihe same when at the suggestion
of col benton the proviso was inserted and
is called the benton proviso he thought it
too late to be accused of acting against the pol
icy of governments by introducing provi
sos where no present necessity seemed to de
mand them
mr v b next look a view of the condition
of present political parlies he declared the
national democratic party dissolved and by
the action of the south the test put k fortfi
by southern men in their stat e conventions
and in their southern address absolves all
northern democrats from any farther politi
cal associations with them
he next touched upon compromise and
said it would be the game of this a dmistta
tion attempted to be played at the next ses
rion their airn will be to leave this whole
question to ihe i t s court he did not
wish to trust it to that tribunal if senalois
elected only for six years disregard the wish
es of their constituents with impunity judges
elected for life could certainly do so
a long list of resolves was read for which
we have not room the preamble states that
thomas jefferson in march introduc
ed into the congress of the confederation a
plan for the temporary government of the
western territory the provision of which
embraced all the territory ceded or to be
ceded by the individual states to the united
states and expressly included the states ol
ohio indiana michigan and wisconsin
that prominent amongst its terms was a
proviso that after the year  of the
chiistian era itiere should be neither slavery
nor involuntary servitude in any of the sain
slates otherwise than in the punishment ol
crimes whereof the party shall have been
duly convicted to have been personally guilty
that this plan now ascertained to havr
been drawn and engrossed by thos jefferson
i only failing of enactment by one vote receiv
ing the votes of six states out of the ten presen
in congress but subsequently on the tl
of july  an ordinrnce for the govern
merit of the northwest territory was unani

 involuntary servitude almost in the words o

the resolutions are in conformity w ith iht

narratives ok fugitive slaves b tlie
rev ephraim peabody
we have seen but a single extract from
mr peabodys review the examiner
has never been sent to our office although no
periodical would meet a warmer welcome at
our table from a perusal of a part of this
review we are satisfied that the writer has
attempted a work which he is ill qualified to
perform ilia ihisition as a minister the
circle in which he moves and the subjects
upon w hich he is accustomed to discourse are
all calculated to render him until to criticise
the writings of slaves or the conduct of their
friends the abolitionists we are however
not sorry that mr peabody has made the
attempt and given the world a slight intima
tion of what is passing in bis mind on the
great subject of american slavery as we
ae jiersi add that such a rnind as his has
hut to consider it to come to an enlightened
and benevolent conclusion with revpect to it
we have lung known mr peabody and a
remembrance of his early kindness to us in
duced a hesitation as to vvhethei we should
review the reviewer
it is now nearly eleven years since we es
caped from the terrible condition of an am
erican slave and went to new bedford
mass in two days after our arrival we
were made acquainted with the rev mr
peabody he was at that ume the minister
of the unitarian church in that place he
had only to be informed that we had escaped
irom bondage to bare bis sympathies warm
ly excited in our behalf we were without
money and without home he supplied us
with both and no sentiments or opinions of
his how opposite soever to our own shall
erase from w u r memory the grateful rerollec
tion of the early interest which that gentle
man w as pleaded to take in us w lien the pros
pect was dark and friends were few we
have wig desued an opportunity to refer in a
becoming manner to his deeds of past kind
ness and c vregret that the one now afford
i ed is coupled with circumstances which make
it impossible for us to extend the meed of
humble praise due to mnui unaccompanied
i by remarks which must lessen its force and
jeast a melancholy shade upon its simple
jbeauty
we have said that the circutnaiaoces in
j which mr peabody is placed and the habits
laod customs of bis lie disqualify him for the
office of ciutc upon wie witling and actions
of reformers he is  far ioved from
ibe mnsaes to understand fully fru
of effecting a change eiib in lher opinions
or their practice the refined mod beautiful
diction in which be clothe his sermons before
his part ten lar cong relation in boslon can scar
cely be a model of oratory for ihoee w ho
would arouse this nation to a sense of ita
deep guilt in ihe tastier of slavery the
persons to whom he speaks form a distinct
class in society and are by no means the
class moved earliest in tlie cause of reform
i hey are lietievolent and in many respects a
highly serviceable part of lb community
but their tastes and tendencies thoroughly in
dispose them to engage in the rugged and
difficult work of stemming the popular cur
rent ready at all tiroes to extend ihe hand
of charity in a private wv to individuals
and in some cases even to the fugitive they
ate nevertheless wholly unprepared to min
gle in the common conflict and to openly
grapple with a system of popular iniquity
like that of american slavery from this
class of persons mr peabody has undoubt
edly received a bias and under its influence
written the article extracts of which arp now
before us
mr peabody says there is nowhere
a more settled and bitter detestation of slave
ry than is sometimes met with at the south
this sentence whatever may have been the
object of its author in penning it will do mis
chief since it w ill be received by the south as
a mitigating circumstance and will be re
garded by the north as a reason for leaving
the question of slavery in the hands of those
who mr peabody declares bitterly deles
the evil for our part we can see no founda
tion for the remark and the article itsell gives
us no dala certainly neither the southern
pulpit nor the southern press affords illustra
tions favorable to the conclusion to which mr
peabody has come so far from tins being
the case we believe that a single instance
has yet to be adduced in which persons re
siding in the south have indicated and do
evince a settled and bitter detestation ol
slavery we are however aware that
slaveholders frequently speak of slavery as
an evil and express the wish that they were
rid of their slaves this is fashionable canl
at the southalways indulged in more freely
in the presence of persons from the north
than before the slaves or among themselves
it is quite reasonable that this should be so
and every man going from the north to th
south should feel such to lie the case li
we judge the slaveholder by ins words 
w ill be difficult to convict him of unkiudnesi
to his slaves or to chaigehim with the desin
to continue the relation of slavery but tin
i unmisiakeable language of conduct leaves n
doubt of his guilt in both these points t
detest slavery in words and to cling to it ii
practice is a display of hypocrisy that shouh
deceive no one and it is to he regretted tha
one so kind just and intelligent as the learne
reviewer has allowed himself to be impose
upon by such representations
 mr peabody continues so entangle
is the whole subjectso complicated are tin
relations and powers of the several states
and of the union that though the slave raa
find the most sympathy personally at th
north our main hope of the abolition o
slavery as an institution depends on the ef
forts of the enemies of slavery at the south
this is a singularly constructed sentence anc
though it may seem indelicate to say it th
j conclusion appears to us to have notning tc
do with the piemises what are the en
tanglements and complication of the ielatior
of the several states of the union which
should lead mr peabody to hope for ihe
overthrow of slavery by its enemies at the
south and what ground has he for dispar
aging the labors of antislavery men at the
north this remark of mr peabojv implies
as true a thing which is unphilosophical
i false and absurd it presupposes the ex
 istence and strength of moral influence at the
j south in the midst of slavery superior to
jlhat which is being w ielded at the north
we hold that the rational and unvarying re
sult of slavery in any community where it ex
ists is to corrupt the moiau to pervert the
judgment and to beget a character in all
around it favorable to as own continuance
born and reared tn the midst of slavery ac
customed from childhood upward to hear
men speak of the relation of master and
slave as innocent merciful and even just
and on the other hand being familiar w ith
the ignorauce and degradation of the slave
it cannot be expected that persons thus envi
roned should either deteat slavery or respect
the rights and happiness of ns victims it is
impossible that it should be so utue can
not be nursed in a school of vice tyrants
cannot teach liberty slaveholders are not
the persons to advocate and defend the rights
of the slave wo must therefore look t q
other sources of moral influence to effect the
overthrow of slavery in tins country no
mr peabody it is to the higher standard of
morals and to the keener sensibilities of the
north that we must look as the great means
for the tedeuipuon of the deeply injurej
bondman we must avail ourselves of the
larger admissions in favor of freedom at the
north and press the same into the service ot
the slave in the southern stateseven m
those where most liberality exists the slave
w universally spoken of and treated as the
property of lus claimant his manhood is
scarcely acknowledged and the principles of
justice which are thought to apply to ot her
men are seldom or never applied to hiui
the case is far different at the north here
whether men are abolitionists or not there is
generally an undercurreoi convicliuu that
man cannot rightfully hold property tn man
to embody this conviction snd to express a
through the press pulpit and pohucs of the
north is indispensably necessary to awake
and quicken the paralysed conscience of the
south for the amount of anl slavery
which we now ditnlv discover id several of the
slave states we are under thud indebted to
the efforts which mr peabody treats as im
potent and to the agnation w inch he con
demns there was not at the south the
moral perception to commence nor the moral
energy to prosecute the holy cause of eman
cipation and but for ibe antislavery organ
isations at the north i have good leasoo to
believe that the same apathy and indifference
which pervaded the south on this sobject
would have continued in all its deathhkt
gloom until now the alight glimmer of
hope beginning to be perceived under the
southern borooo arise from torches ht at
the iltar of liberty in the north ard we
believe that there is not an antislaveiy min
at the seuih who does not incerhv desire
abolitionists to persevere at the north abo
litionists at the southif uch there
though sensible that the practical part ef ihe
work such as legislation must be performed
by the southern people themselves know
full well that the incentive to such legislation
must be furnished by the people of the north
mr peabody says those in the slave
states who are desirous of the abolition of
slavery are not heljed bv northern abuse
we aic not aware that any man desirous of
the abolition of slavery has ever received
northern abuse the charge thus in
directly brought is stale and indefinite
every man decides for himself w hat con
stitutes abuse h is something  ke certain
words in common use among slaveholders
such as insolence impertinence and impu
dence these terms are often applied to
slaves for words and deeds which would nev
er call them forth when used and performed
by white persons to call a man who steals
a thief is merely to identify him with his
crime and can no more be termed abuse
than to call a just man honest since in the
one case and the other each man lias his
due we might say much more on this
point but the charge has been answered a
thousand times and needs no other reply
than to request those who prefer it to place
themselves in the situation of the plundered
slave
speaking of the narratives mr peabody
admits they give a just idea of what slave
ry is to the slave but adds they convey
an altogether erroneous idea of ihe charac
ter of the masters here we think mr
peabodys logic at fault what slavery is to
the slave the slaveholder is to the slave
and the character of the slaveholder may be
fairly inferred from ins treatment of the slave
it is not by the courtesy and hospitality which
slaveholders extend to northern clergymen
and travellers whose good opinions they
think desirable that wo are to learn their
irue character here they have an end to
attain but it is their conduct towards those
over whom they have unlimited power by
which they are tube tried ami adjudged in
this relation they act freely and without res
traint in the other ease they act from neces
sity in the same vein mr peabody talks
about the violence and extravagance of those
who assail slavery at the north and oilers a
word of advice to us as to the form of ex
pression best calculated to convince the judg
ment and to mould the feelings of those to
whom we address ourselves this is un
doubtedly well intended and worthy of all
consideration yet we by no means admit
the entire soundness of the ground on winch
it is based mr peabody adds that a few
sober words from a calm w ise discriminating
i mind are after all the ones which are fol
lowed we would that the calm wise
discriminating minds would take upon their
own shoulders the antislavery cause and
give us the sober word which the nation will
so readily follow instead of standing aloof
and displaying their skill in picking flaws in
the antislavery movement let the re
viewer bring his learning refinement and the
power of his intellect to the aid of this cause
and he will do a work far more in accordance
w ith the feelings of hie own benevolent heart
and reap from jt a happiness which he can
ever experience in condemning the abolition

it is not to be expected that father matthew

cannot think that one so benevolent m heart

three miliioos of slaves without lifting up his

deter him from the utterance of ucb a tear

almost a tragedy
the following gross outrage took place on
the banks of the erie anal a few miles west
of palmyra and communicated to us by
a scotch gentleman travelling in this direc
tion by the packetboat ohio of schenectady
the circumstances we think demand in
vestigation
on  uesdav atiernoon a colored man by
the name of peier bell on his way to st
louis ol which city it is understood he is a
resident stepped into the boat a few miles
this side ol palmyra he was well dressed
and highly respectable in his demeanor while
he was tn the cabin his wife an luteresting
and intelligent looking mulatto was with
him and altogether it would appear they
were on a visit ol pleasure to their friends in
this quarter having stepped to the captains
office to settle his fare and the required
amount having been stated to hun he de
murred somewhat at the charge that was
made the captain met his objection by un
ceremoniously saying something to this effect
ou ruggers ate always complaining
bell whose dignity he thought in the scale
of humanity was somewhat lowered by the
opprobrious epithet rugger replied dont
insult me sir by calling me a nigger caii
me if you pleasej a colored man the
captain i suppose guessing that squalls were
about to blow wahout anv more words on the
question refused to have anything more to jo
wuh bell and straightway went to the deek
and ordered some of the boatmen to cast his
trunk off seeing which bell followed in
high dudgeon and requested that his wife
who was at this time in the ladies cabin
might be sent alter him this request not
having been attended to at the time and the
boat straightway going off bell in an ex
presaion of momentary and as  thought un
guarded rage swore that he would cut their
line if they did not send his wife after him
w hether he actually mundd to do so we
doubt very much at any rale the threat wn
no sooner out of tits mouth than one o the
boatmen a strong stalwart looking fellow
caiue up behind and with great force pushed
bun right mio the canal ihe poor man
now struggled in the water for a few tmr
ule but ultimately recovering ht selfpot
mmmoit he swam to the bank all besmeared
over wuh mud tins circumstance excited
ho rage and i wonder not to the highest
pitch his wife having by thus tnn been
landed he went up to her and taking off in
dripping coat gave it to her and producing
lus knile wore that he would be revenged on
ibe man who had so cowardly maltreated
him having pumued the boatman for some
time along the banks the latter ultimately got
on board and ran tow aids a box in which
was deposited twine lathe weapon lhany
thus armed he ran towaids the colored man
who defended himself against his assailant
a bloody encounter now took place being
well armed and a more powerful looking m l
than bell the boatman laid on nwit unmet
cilully on lus head with his weapon which i
perceived was well ironed at ihtf end bed
cned for mercy hut the boatman was unmet
ctful thepoor man seeing this roared out
with all hi might murder murder and
all on board actually thought tlat a murdet
had been perpetrated the boaiinm bavin
satiated me vengeance made fin the boat
but bell ruse and in hat of maddened nj
desperate excitement few after his antagonist
but failed in reaching him the boatman
oon got into the boat bell however notto
be done ran after us swearing vengeance or
die in the attempt he continued to do no for
upward of three miles the expression of
hi countenance at this time was truly horri
ble it was haggard looking and the blood
streaming down from a deep cut which
he ffad received on the temples the boat
man at this time was swearing that if he at
tempted to do anything he would leap out
again and kill lorn right out now  am sorry
 think that this sad affair instead of liemg
viewed with pity by the great majority of the
passengers was entertained with ardent de
light and not one word of sympathy was
spoken for the injured and misguided negro
in fact there was a strong desire expressed
by tome southerners on boardthat this melo
dramatic affair should be at once finished off
by murdering the poor infatuated man who
at this time was crowing byroads and cross
ways to be at us in process of tune this was
accomplished he reached us very exhausted
and broken dow n looking at the next lock
the impression now was that a tragedy was
about to be realized but no poor bell was
done and he could do nothing but rage
swearing that if the lead would spare him
he would have justice on the captain the
captain told him that if he did not get off im
mediately he would commit him to jail
hell without hearing this rushed off again
as before to find a magistrate as we thought
at the next town which was about five miles
distant as we held on our way we saw
poor bell running on the highway at last
we suddenly missed him he had given up
the strife  suspected he had fallen down by
the way through fatigue and loss of blood 
 did not learn his tale it is to be hoped
however that some good samaritan who
regarded all men alike and equally entitled to
his philanthropy bound up his wounds and
assisted him to some place of refuge
comment upon this brutal and bloody out
age is unnecessary the treatment meted
out poor bell is that to which any respectable
and spirited colored man is liable w herever
he may venture to travel and he has very
little means of redress there are ten chauces
to one against him at the law since his color
alone is universally treated as a crime in this

w ill not cease to taunt them with then sham
regard for liberty until the last bondman on the
american soil is released the resolutions
passed at that meeting coining from any peo
ple who practically showed their esteem for
the principle of freedom would have been
excellent coming from americans un
connected with any denunciation of slavery
at home they only showed how very clear
sighted men can be to the sins of their neigh
bors and bow very blind to their own
amongst the resolutions were the following
resolved that while the republic of
rome has given to every citizen as much land
ss two oxen will plow and while kossuth
and the republic of hungary are enfran
chising their serfs and also bestowing upon
them grants of the public domain which they
have so heroically defended that the russian
and austrian generals are acting up to their
best chnvicttons in scourging delicate women
and in shooting and hanging prisoners of war
without quarter
resolved that the idea so speciously put
forth by tyrants w hen they contemplate some
colossal wrong that a people must be pre
pared for liberty before they can be worthy of
it is met by the whole american people
with their plain response that the only pre
paration for the enjoyment of freedom is
freedom itself
resolved that we regret that the french
constitution should have made the term of her
president so long that his acts of tieachety
become irreparable and drive a maddened peo
ple to revolution and that the conduct of
louis napoleon in sending an army of regular
soldiers bearing the name but without the
hearts ol frenchmen against the republic ol

the use of learning
bt t s arthur
tin tired of going to school said
herbert allen to william wheeler the
boy who sat next to him i dont see
any great use for my part in studying
geometry and navigation and survey
ing and mensuration and the dozen
other things that i am expected to learn
theyll never do me any good i
am not going to get my living as a
surveyor or measurer or a sea cap
tain
how are you going to get your liv
ing herbert his young friend asked
in a quiet tone as he looked up in his
face
why im going to learn a trade
or at least father says that i am
andso ami replied w t illiam and
yet my father wishes me to learn every
thing that i can for he assures me that
itll be useful some time or other in my
life
i am sure i cant see what use im
ever going to make as a saddler of
algebra and surveying
still if we cant see it herbert per
haps our fathers can for they are older
and wiser than we are and we should
endeavor to learn simply because they
wish us to even if in everything we
are exepeted to study we do not see
clearly the use
i cant fee so herbert replied
tossing his head and i dont believe
that my father sees any more clearly
than i do the use of all this
you are wrong to talk so his friend
said in a serious tone i would not
think as you do for the world our
fathers know what is best for us and if
we do not confide in them we shall
surely go wrong
i am not afraid responded her
bert closing the book over which he
had been poring reluctantly for half an
hour in the vain attempt to fix a lesson
on his unwilling memory and taking
some marbles from his pocket com
menced amusing himself with them
from the teachers observation
william said no more but turned to
his lesson with an earnest attention
the difference in the character of the
two boys is too plainly indicated in oqt
brief conversation we have recorded to
need further illustration to their
teacher it was evident in numerous
particulars in their conduct their habits
and manners william recited his les
sons correctly while herbert never
learned a task well one was always
punctual at schoolthe other a loiter
er by the way williams books were
well taken care ofherberts soiled
torn disfigured and broken externally
and internally
thus they began life the one
obedient industrious attentive to the
precepts of those who were older and
wiser and willing to be guided by
them the other indolent and inclined
to follow the leadings of his own will
rather than the more experienced
teachings of others

as men at the age of thirtyfive we
will again present them to the reader
mr wheeler is an intelligent mer
chant in an active business while mr
allen is a journeyman mechanic poor
in embarrassed circumstances and pos
sessing but a small share of general
information
how do you do mr allen said
the merchant about this time as the
latter entered the countingroom of the
former the contrast in their appear
ance w t as very great the merchant
was well and had a cheerful look
while the other was poorly clad and
seemed sad and dejected
i cant say that i do very well mr
wheeler the mechanic replied in a
tone of deep despondency work is
very dull and wages low and with so
large a family as i have it is tough
enough to get along under the best cir
cumstances
i am really sorry to hear you say
so mr allen replied the merchant in
a kind tone howmuch can you earn a
week now
lf  had steady work i could earn
nine or ten dollars a week but out
business is very bad the substitution ol
steam engines on railroads for horses
upon turnpikes has broken in serious
ly upon the harness making business
the consequence is that i did not av
erage six dollars a week the year
round
ls it possible that railroads have
wrought such a change in your busi
ness
yesthe harness making branch
of itespecially in large cities like this
where the heavy wagon trade is almosl
entirely broken up
did you say that six dollars a week
were all that you could average
yes sir
how large is your family
i have five children sir
five children and only six dollars
a week
that is all sir but six dollars o
week will not support them and i an
in consequence going behindhand
you ought to try to get into some
other business
but i dont know any other
the merchant mused for a while
and then said perhaps i can aid you
in getting into something better lam
president of a newly projected rail
road and we are about putting on the
line a company of engineers for the
purpose of surveying and engineering
and as you studied these sciences at
school at the same time that i did and
i suppose have still a correct knowl
edge of both if so  will use my influ
ence to have you appointed surveyor
ihe engineer is already chosen and
at my desire will give you all requisite
instructions until you revive your early
knowledge of these mattersthe
salary is one hundred dollars a
month
a shadow still darker than that
which before rested there fell upon the
face of the mechanic
alas sirhe saidl have not the
slightest knowledge it is true i stud
ied it or rather pretended to study it
at schoolbut it made no permanent
impression on my mind i saw no use
in it then and am now as ignorant of
surveying as if i had never taken a les
son on the eubject
i am very aorry mr allen  the
merchant replied in real concern lf
you were a good accountant i might
perhaps get you into a store hat
i your capacity in this respect
i ought to have been a good ac
countant sir for i studied mathemat
ics long enough but  took little inter
est in figures and now although i was
for many months at school and pre
tended to study book keeping i am
utterly incapable of taking charge of a
set of books
such being the case mr allen i
really do not know what  can do with
you but stay i am about sending
out an assorted cargo to buenos ayres
and thence round to callao and want a
roan to go as supercargo who can
speak the spanish language  remem
ber that we studied spanish together
would you be willing to leave yoifr
family and go the wages will be
loo a month
i have forgotten all my spanish
sir i did not see the use of it while
at school and therefore it made no im
pression on my mind
the merchant really concerned for
the poor mechanic again thought of
some way to serve him at length he
said  can think of btit one thing that
you can do mr allen and that will
not be much better than your present
employment it is a service for which
ordinary persons are employedthat
of chain carrying to the surveyor
on the proposed railroad expedi
tion
what are the wages sir
ss a month
and found
certainly
i will acceptit sir thankfully the
man said lt will be better than my
present employment
then make yourself ready at once
for the company will start in a week
i will be ready sir the poor man
replied and then withdrew
in a week the company of engineers
started and mr allen with them a 
chain carrier when had he as a boy
taken the advice of his parents and
friends and stored up in his memory
what they wished him to learn he
might have filled the surveyors office
at more than double the wages paid
him as chain carrier indeed we can
not tell how high a position of useful
ness he might have held had he im
proved all the opportunities afforded
him in youth but he perceived the
use of learning too late
children and youth cannot possibly
know so well as their parents guardi
ans and teachers what is best or
them men who are in active contact
with the world know that the more ex
tensive their knowledge on all subjects
the more useful they can be to others
and the higher and more important use
to society they are fitted to perform
the greater is the return to themselves
in wealth and honor
richard lioodless the
horse swimmer
had the following narrative not ap
peared in a rnagainechamber
edingurgh journal favorably known
for its respectability of character we
should consider it fabulous it is
marvellous to say the least it reminds
one of the fable of neptune driving his
chariot over the sea
we supposed we had heard of all
sorts of heroes but find ourselves to
have been mistaken a hero in humble
life has been made known to us ol
quite a new order this brave man
by name richard hoodless following
the occupation of a farmer near grain
thrope on the coast of lincolnshire
has for many years been devoting him
self to the saving of mariners frorr
drowning and this without any of the
usual apparatus for succoring ships ir
distress unaided by such appliances
and unaccompanied by any living crea
ture but his horse hoodless has beer
the means of saving many unfortunate
sailors from perishing amidst the
waves
cultivating a small piece of ground
which is as it were rescued from the
sea and almost cut off from the adja
cent country by the badness of the
roads this remarkable man may be
said to devote himself to the saving o
human life on the approach o
stormy weather he mounts to an open
mg on the top of his dwelling and there
pointing his telescope to the tumultu
ous ocean watches the approach o
 vessels towards the low and dangerom
shoresby night or by da he ii
equally ready to perform his self im
posed duty a ship is struggling a
midst the terrible convulsion of waters
no human aid seems to be at hand al
on board give themselves up for lost
when something is at length seen t
leave the shore and to be making ai
effort to reach the vessel can it b
possible a man on horseback yes
it is richard hoodless coming to th
rescue seated on his old nag an ani
nal accustomed to these salt water ex
cursions onward the faithful beas
swims and plunges only turning whei
a wave threatens to engulf him in iti
bosom there is something grand it
the struggle of both horse and roan
the spirit of unselfishness eagerly try
ing to do its work success usually
crowns the exertions of the horse ant
his rider the ship is reached hood
less ni udts two or three mariners ei
crovpe and them to dry land
returns for another talment
that a horse could be tra ne t
these unpleasant and hazardous enter
prises may seem somewhat surprising
but it appears that in reality no train
ing is necessary all depends on the
skill and firmness of the rider hood
less declares he could manage the most
unruly horse in the water for as soon
as the animal finds that he has lost his
footing and is obliged to swim he be
comes as obedient to his bridle as a
boat to its helm the same thing is
observed in this sagacious animal when
being hoisted to the deck of a ship he
struggles vehemently at first against
his impending fate but the moment his
feet fairly leave the pier he is calm
and motionless as if knowing that re
sistance would compromise his safety
in the erial passage the only plan
which our hero adopts is this when
meeting a particularly augry surf or
swell to turn his horses head forward
and allow the wave to roll over them
were a horn to face the larger billows
tad attempt to pierce them the water
would enter hit nostrils and render him
breathless by which be would be soon
exhausted
in the year  hoodless signa
lized himself by swimming his horse
through a stormy sea to the wreck of
the hermoine and saving her crew
for which gallant service he afterwards
received a testimonial from the royal
humane society the words of the
resolution passed by the society on
this occasion may be transcribed for
they narrate a circumstance worthy of
being widely known
it was resolved unanimously that
the noble courage and humanity dis
played by r hoodless for the preser
vation of the crew of the hermoine
from drowning when that vessel was
wrecked near donna nook on the
coast of lincolnshire on the st of
august  and the praiseworthy
manner in which he risked his life on
that occasion by swimming his horse
through a heavy sea to the wreck
when it was impossible to launch the
lifeboat has calledforth the lively ad
miration of the institution which is
hereby unanimously adjudged to be
presented to him at the next ensuing
anniversary festival
as it may not be generally under
stood that a horse can be made to per
form the office of a lifeboat when the
vessels of that kind could not with safe
ty be launched the fact of hoodless
performing so many feats in the manner
described cannot be too widely dis
seminated on some occasions we
are informed he swims by himself to
the wreck but more usually he goes
on horseback and is seldom unsuccess
ful in his efforts about two years ago
he saved the captain of a vessel and
and his wife and ten seamen some on
the back of the horse and others hang
ing on by the stirrups should a ves
sel be lying on her beam ends hood
less requires to exercise great caution
in his approach in consequence of the
ropes and rigging concealed in the
water on one occasion he experi
enced much inconvenience on this ac
count he had secured two seamen
and was attempting to leave the vessel
for the shore but the horse could not
move from the spot after various in
effectual plunges hoodless discovered
that the animal was entangled in a rope
under water what was to be done
the sea was in a tumult and to dis
mount was scarcely possible for
tunately he at length picked up the
rope with his foot then instantly pull
ing a knife from his pocket leaned
forward into the water cut the rope
no easy task in a stormy seaand so
got oftwith safety

meeting held in boston for the discus
sion of crime and its remediesrev
charles spear said we quote from the
report in the cronotype
that since the execution of goode
strong doubts had been raised whethei
he was the man who struck harding
there are two menseamen at pres
ent in the city who were not far of
then the deadly blow was struck
they saw the mau who inflicted it bul
supposing at the time that it was s
slight street brawl they did not notice
it any farther than to recognize the mar
as a white man one of these wit
nesses was horrorstricken when he
learned after the executiou that goode
was a black man mr spear had ar
interview with the unfortunate man the
afternoon previous to his execution
he asked him solemnly in view ol

chased by a locomotivethe
following is a hoosiers descrip
tion of his first sight of a locomotive
and his adventures consequent thereon
i came across through the country
and struck your railroad and was ply
ing it about four knots an hour now
i heard tell about locomotives but
never dreamed of seeing one alive and
kicking but about two miles from here
i heard something coming coughing
sneezing and thundering so i looked
aroundsure enough there she
comes down after me pawing the airth
up and splitting the air wide open
with more smoke and fire flying than
orto come out of a hundred burning
mountains there was a dozen wag
ons folerin arter her and to save her
f tarnal black somky noisy neck she
couldnt get clear of them i dont
know whether they scares her up or no
but here she come foaming at the
mouth with her teeth full of burning
red coals and she pitched right straight
at me like a thousand of brick i
couldnt stand it any longer so i
wheeled around and broke down the
road and began to make gravel fly in
every direction uo sooner had i done
that than she split right after me and
every jump i made she squealed like
a thousand wild cats she began to
gain on me cornin up a little hill but
we come round a pint to a straight level
i on the road now thinks i ill gin
you ginger a  im great on a dead
level so i pulled to it and got under
full speed and then she began to yell
and cough and stamd and come on full
chisel and made the hull airth shake
but i kept on before bounding at the
rate of twenty feet at every step till i
got at a turn in the road and i was
under such headway that i couldnt
turn so i turned head over heels down
a bank by a bouse landed cosmolick
into a swill barrel and my feet stuck
out and up in the air dust at
the time the jcomotive found that i
had got away from it ll commenced
spitting hot water iuto me and just iil
erally spattered it all over me i
thought in soul that mount vesuvius
had busted in aome place in the neigh
borhood but do you suppose i stayed
there long no sir i just walked
right through that barrel and came
out ao quick that it really looked a
shamed of itself now here i aim a
real double revolving locomotive snol
ly gloster ready to attack anything
but a combination of thunder and
lightning smoke railroad iron and
hot water
two cold liquids maze a hot one

oil of vitrol with one drachm of cold
