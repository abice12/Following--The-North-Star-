from the independent
shall we compromise
mr clays compromise has beeii vi
olently resisted by the south and but
coldly looked upon in the north it is
not that both sides are infatuated and
refuse a reasonable settlement but
the skill of mr clay has evidently not
touched the seat of disease ho either
has not perceived or has not thought
it expedient to meet the real issue now
before the people of the united states
the struggle is one whose depths lie in
the organization of society in the north
and south respectively whose causes
were planted in tiie constitution
there are two incompatible and mu
tually destructive principles wrought
together in the government of this land
hitherto like esau and jacob they
have atriven together in the womb
now they are born and that feud has
begun which shall drive the one or the
other to the wilderness to attempt
to settle a radical opposition of polity
by easing oft the rub here and there
leaving the great principles in full vig
or as if one should hang fenders and
sandbags along the side of hostile
ships that come crushing together in
stead of putting the helm about and go
ing another tack slavery is right
and slavery is wrong slavery
shall live slavery shall die sla
very shall extend slavery shall nor
extend are these conflicts to be set
tled by any mode of parcelling out cer
tain territories now the battle rages
at one point by and by it will rage
at another these oppugnant ele
ments slavery and liberty inherent
in our poltical system animating our
constitution checkering our public
policy breeding in statesmen opposite
principles of government and making
oar whole wisdom of public legislation
on many of the greatest questions
crosseyed and contradictory elements
are these seeking each others life
one or the other must die
we give mr clay sincere praise
for desiring peace we think it wor
thy of his reputation to have declared
that he would never vote for the exten
tion of slavery if his compromise had
taken that determination as its starting
point he would then have come near
er to our ideas of the leader which our
times and our difficulties demand it
is no sportive joust upon which our na
tion is gazing the shield of the chal
lenger pangs out for no blunted lance
like ivanhoe we should have been
glad had mr clay struck tne shield of
iu bois gilbert with the sharp lance
head importing earnest battle one
straightforward speech against the ex
tension of slavery basednot upon po
litical reasons but on the great princi
ples of humanity and justice one glow
ing appeal to the whole nation to take
the stand which he has personally ta
ken nevtr to volt for the exteneion of
slavery on either tnde if any line this
would have been a noble statesmanship
and crowned the last years of the rev
ered sage of ashland with the bright
est glory of his life
let no roan suppose that the conten
tions which now agitate the land have
sprung from the rash procedure of a
few menthe hotbeads either of the
north or of the south we are in the
midst of a collision not of men but of
principles and poltical institutions
the inevitable course of affairs has
been developing the results for which
 provision was made first in the orga
nization of society and then in the
structure of the constitution no har
vest ever answered more closely to the
husbandmans seed than do our diffi
culties to the original sowing
the north adopting the theory
yf democracy organized all her eml
right is of no sextruth is of no color
and industrial institutions upon that ba
sis every man the lowest the least
the highest and best had one common
platform of rights the south adop
ting the theory of aristocracy made
two platformsthe one for the govern
ed the other for the governors the
one and the other it gan at once to ex
hibit their results in the north labor
was voluntary honorable aad univer
sal in the south it was compulsory
and made disreputable by being fasten
ed upon an abject class of course the
laborer had different values in the
north he was a citizen capable o
any honor framing his own laws ma
king his owh rules and so an integral
element of the state in the south
ha neither voted nor determined he
had no rights he was a slave labor
and laborers are the foundations of a
community the strength the virtue
the civilization of a community must
be measured by the condition of its la
borers and not by the polish on its
surface
the whole structure of society con
formed to these respective foundations
the north put honor upon us labor
ers they were trained in common
schools they became reading and re
flecting men shrewdness penetration
forecast personal independence fertile
resource marked the industrial clas
ses grow as rapidly as the educated
and the wealthy might the distance
between them and the laborer constant
ly diminished there never was a
time when the bottom of society was
so near the top as now
the south making labor a disgrace
ful necessity denying it education
compelling it not by those motives
which are obtained healthfully to de
velop the man but by the overseers
eye and lash and educating only her
wealthy sons has steadily widened th
distance between the top and bottom
of society nothing can be more dis
similar than the tone and sentiment of
societies so diverselyformed liberty
is a universal rightit belongs to men
on the one side it is a privilege and
belongs to a class on the other side
the north binds society together
identifies its interests equalizes and
kneads i causing it to grow alike
throughout and makes it strong by the
strength of its individuals and gives to
individuals the advantage of common
weal there cannot be a common
wealth of slavery it is classwealth
the south hopelessly divides society
puts her honors on oue side of the
cleft her menial offices on the other
the north compacts and the south
stratifies to educate the laborer is
to do the whole stale a benefit in the
north to educate the laborer is to
strike at the foundations of society in
the south we send educators to the
governors chair and to congress
they of the south send them to the
penitentiary and the gibbet
now does any man doubt that here
are the real vital distinguishing ele
ments of two radically different gov
ernmentsan aristocracy and a de
mocracy does any one believe it
possible that these respective tenden
cies should be confined fn the re
spective fields to civil affairs will
they not determine the family institu
tions the usages of society public
opinion yea the whole and very na
ture of communities can the agri
culture of slaves and slavery and the
agriculture of freemen be the same
can the commercial interests be the
same the political economy and the
politics can statesmen bred in such
schools have common sympathies
that the north and south have many
wants and many sympathies in common
it is as trua as that all men the most
opposite oppressor and oppressed
deceiver and dupe have great wants
in common but in their foundation
ideas their political doctrines their
state policies their conceptions of pub
lic measures they are not only dif
ferent but for the most part opposite
and oppugnant states so essentially
different would find harmony rather in
separate existence than in federation
yet our union is composed of these op
j positions
when the constitution was in birth
these things were in the seed yet
even then the repellencies were such
that a common constitution was adop
ted only by compromise now if the
compromises of the constitution in the
matter of slavery were adopted in the
expectation that slavery would soon be
eradicated by the superior vitality ol
liberty we can understand the wisdoix
of the intention at least but if it wai
designed that one instrument should in
close the spirit of two theories of gov
ernment so totally adverse it was the
most extraordinary blindness the mosi
anomalous folly which honest met
were ever smitten with we shoult
as soon look for an agreement by whicl
christ and belial should jointly under
take to govern this world was i
thought possible to serve both libert
and slaverygod and mammon
could the same mouth breaths justice
and injustice could a constitutioi
having any definite nature have twi
hearts one beating for liberty with vi
i talized blood and the other beating fo
slavery with black blood could i
organize courts empowered to esub
lish justice and systematic oppression
courts with one hand to lift up thi
wronged by speedy redress and to baa
down the wronged with the other b
triple blows we believe that thi
compromises of the constitution look
d to the destruction of slavery no
not its establishment
the event justified the judgement
although incidental causes conspire
to give slavery new growth while
our country was swelling and coming
into manbnod yet it soon became ap
parent that both systems could not long
coexist
there are good and easy souls
not perturbed by over deep meditation
posingphat our institutions are the ag
itators our civil polity is the
fanatic whose firebrands inflame the
union this movement of the spirit ol
the age has made the men not the
men it we are its children w t hile
the north and the south inveigh against
each otherand fanatics are loud mouth
ed against fanatics calmer and deeper
men see that both north and south are
drifting and fighting as they drift in a
current whose secret springs lie deepet
than mens volitions whose force god
both ordained and will augment until
old things are passed away and he
whose right it is shall reign why
then should we try to stop the contest
it must come to an issue which spirit
shall animate our constitution the
spirit of bondage and the spirit of l b
erty when both are living spirits can
not dwell together moses rod must
swallow the enchanters or the magi
cians rod must swallow the prophets
the south have found out that slavery
cannot live and stand still liberty
grows the fastest has the best roots
eats out the other and if slavery is
stationary it will be speedily overrun
and smothe en y the rampant vine ol
freedom it must thrust out its roots
it must borrow vigor from fresh soil
southern men are perfectly cons stent
in rejecting a compromise which only
confirms old rights but positively
grants no extension
the south now demands room and
right for extension she asks the
north to be a partner for every free
state she demands one state for slave
ry one dark orb must be swung into
its orbit to groan and travail in pain
for every new orb of liberty over which
the morning stars shall sing for joy
on that question we hold there can
be no compromise the constitution
has come to a period of final construc
tion every years delay will aggra
vate difficulties an earlier day had been
better than this but this is better than
any future day it is time for good
men and true to gird up their loins and
staed forth for god and tor humanity
no compromises can nelp us which
dodge the question certainly none
which settle it for slavery we are
told the question is momentous and be
set with the most serious difficulties
neither in the afiairs of individuals nor
of nations is there any difficulty when
men are willing to do right it is
when right is spun to so fine a thread
that it floats like a gossamer chan
ging to every breath that we lose
sight of it or find it entangled in our
hands there never was a plainer
question for the north it is her duty
openly firmly and forever to refuse to
slavery another inch of territory and
to see to it that it never gets it by fraud
it is her duty to refuse her band or
countenance to slavery where it now
exists it is her duty to declare that
she will uqder noconsiderations be a
party te any further inhumanity and in
justice then the path will be plain and
straight the path of duty though a
steep one and often toilsome is al
ways straight and plain those are the
labyrinthine roads which winding
through sloughs and thickets imboak
ed and dark seek to find a way around
the rocks and steeps and come to the
gate o success without climbiog the
hill of difficulty
mr clays compromise resolutions
demand better provision for the re
covery of fugitive slaves and a bill is
now pending in the united states sen
ate for this purpose we cannot
strongly enough express our profound
regret at the remarks which mr clay
felt it his duty to make on this subject
on this matter our feelings tre so
strong that we confess a liability to in
temperance of expression
if the compromises of the constitu
tion include requisitions which vio
late humanity i will not be bound by
them not even the constitution shall
make me unjust if my patriotic
sires confederate in my behalf that i
should maintain that instrument so i
will to the utmost bounds of right
but who with power which even god
denies to himself shall by compact
foreordain me to the commission of in
humanity and injustice i disown the
act i repudiate the obligation never
while i have breath will  help any of
ficial miscreant in his base errand ol
recapturing a fellow man for bondage
and may my foot palsy and my right
hand forget her cunning if i ever be
come so untrue to mercy and to re
ligion as not by all the means in my
power to give aid and succor to every
man whose courageous flight tells me
that he is worthy of liberty if asked
what then becomes of the constitution
reply by asking what becomes of gods
constitution of humanity if you give
back a slave to the remorseless maw ol
servitude i put constitution against
constitutiongods against roans
where they agree they are doubly sa
cred where they differ my reply to
 all questionersbut especially to all
christian scruples is in the language of
peter whether if be right in the sight
of god to hearken unto you more than
unto god judge ye
ought not christians by all the
i means in their power to preserve the
uniont yee by all means that are
right but dear aa the union is and
i ought to bo whenever it comes bo
rochester n y friday march lj 
tween a christian people and their
christian integrity it becomes a snare
the very value of our union is to be
found in those principles of justice lib
erty aud humanity which inspire it
but if by any infernal joggle these
phftciptes must be yielded up o pre
serve the union then a wrpse only
srffi be left in our arms deflowered
lifeless worthless a union perpetu
ated by giving way to injustice a
union maintained by obedience to the
desires of slaveryis hut a compact
of violence we emphasize these
things because the longcontinued cries
of politicians have produced among so
ber christian men an unquestioned and
undistured conviction that no evil can
be so great ns the dissolution of our
union their are many evils infinite
ly greater the loss of public humanity
is greater the loss of national consci
ence is greater an indifference to the
condition of millions of miserable crea
tures whose degradation vices igno
rance aud animalism plead with our
conscience in their behalf this would
be an unspeakably greater evil so
long as we can maintain the union on
terms which allow us to act with a free
conscience with humanity unviolated
we shall count no sacrifice dear to
maintain it but religion and human
ity are a price too dear to pay even for
the uni
our southern brethren often com
plain that we dont understand their
condition or sympathise with their
real difficulties even so too we
complain that they do not understand
our situation and sympathise with our
difficulties there are hundreds and
thousands of men to whom conscience
is a lawa law notwithstanding the
sneers of those who flout at the idea of
a conscience party but there is a con
science party there is a stern and
growing feeling in the free states
not yet expressed by any distinctive
organization that the time has come
for a stand against any further national
inhumanity we can bear much but
we eannot and will not bear the guilt
of slavery we regard it as epitom
izing every offense which man can
commit against man it takes liberty
from those to whom god gave it as
tho right of all rights it forbids all
food either for the understanding or
the heart it takes ail honesty from
the conscience it takes its defense
from virtue and gives all authority
into the hands of lustful or pecuniary
cupidity it scorns the family and in
vades it whenever desire or the want
of money prevails witli the same cool
ness with which a drover singles out a
heifer or a butcher strikes down a
a bullock these are not the accidents
of slavery they are its legitimate
fruits they are its vitality if you
stop these evils you will destroy the
system let the slave be taught let
him have not a filtered and adulterated
gospel but that gospel which angels
heralded strangely filling the air with
the cry peace on earth and goodwill
toicard men and it will make the slaves
what it made the barbarous briton and
the rude saxonfreemen and refined
christians take from slavery its
rights of merchandise forbid the dis
ruption of families the sale of slaves
from the homestead where they were
born and the system will stink in the
nostrils of planters as it now does in
our own
now we declare that into a fellow
ship with these monstrous evils whose
perpetration around our whole south
ern coast is enough to preoccupy the
heavenly tribunal of mercy and to ex
haust its patience on only this form of
ail the worldwide human suffering we
have been drawn unwittingly we did
not know or did not think that to
swear fealty to the constitution was
to swear preservation fo slavery we
had always understood that the com
promises of the constitution were
agreed upon in the north only that
time might be given for slavery to die
out but if another construction be
made and becomes the settled reading
of that instrument if the north is to
have the guilt and the south the pro
fits of slavery if we are henceforth
to understand that slavery is federal
and national recognised in the allem
bracing constitution then but one
course is left us no earthly consi
deration shall make us partners in this
monstrosity we most solemnly de
clare by our belief in humanity by
our hopes in religion by our faith in
christ that we we will cut every cord
of oppression whose force is derived
from us and if in so doing men
choose to interpose the constitution
upon their heads be the blame pal
sied be that hand and blasted those
lips which shall make our constitution
ordained for freedom the instrument
of bondage and cruelty
we shall study to circumscribe sla
very where it now exists we shall
be hostile to every measure which con
sults its interests we shall not cease
to stand upon the brink of this dismal
abyss and over against its smoke and
wails to pray with agonizing earnest
ness how long o lord how long
a day will comein gods counsels it
is already seen advancing when men
will look backupon this system as we
now look upon the dungeons and tri
bunals of the inquisition in that day
many a man will deny his parentage
and forswear the ancestors who either
forged fetters for the slave or more
meanly blew the bellows for those who
wrought at the anvil of oppression
may my children to the latest genera
tion in looking back to my example
take courage and strike home for li
berty and humanity
god is the father of us all and all men are brethren
with these views no soothsayer is
needed to interpret our views of the
extension of slavery t is not enough
that we do not will it every man
consents to it who docs not exhaust
bis strength in endeavoring to preventit
ner do we misunderstand the cun
ning tty of those wl ask es to tww
the issues or this tfutstlon fn new ter
ritories to chance nowadays chance
has too many wires and wireworkers
to suit our ideas of luck chance is
the merest gambler the dice are
loaded the cards are marked only
the victim dreams that there is fair
play the south is to deal the north
is to take what cards are flirted to its
hand who doubts the issue how
many more games than those already
played are needed before the dupe
shall suspect foul play no by as
much as liberty is dearer to us than
slavery by so much should we be
more active in its behalf than its ad
versaries are in behalf of slavery if
they can toil day and night dig deep
trenches bear burdens cheerfully to
sink the rocky foundations for the
towers of oppression shall we have
no bulwarks and no towers for liberty
whenever and wherever a blow is
struck for slavery then and there must
be a double stroke for liberty
we will compromise any measure
tending to prevent the extension of
slavery we will compromise as to
the particulars of its death laying out
and burial but every compromise
must include the advantage of liberty
and the disadvantage of slavery
compromises dictated by wily politi
cians made to serve a pinch in party
tactics compromises issuing from men
whose ideas ot patriotism are summed
up in giving their adversaries a grip
and downfall to whom spoils are vir
tues and offices religion or those bet
terintended compromises like mr
clays which seek for peace rather
than for humanity from such compro
mises guileless as they seem and gild
ed till they shine like heaven ever
more may we be delivered
we shall abide by the union no
vandal outrage shall our hands com
mit we shall honor it by obedient
lives consecrate it by our prayers
purify it from the dross of injustice
and give to it such foundations of right
as shall hold it steadfast amid all the
revolutionary concussions or our day
if there be those who cannot abide the
union because it is pure and religious
just and humane let them beware of
that tumultuous sea into which they
purpose to leap
bifjt we do not believe that such an
issue awaits us the pliancy of mis
erable scramblers for political prefer
ment has caused these violent gusts
thus hitherto have victories been
gained for slavery thus they are
sought again firmness is the remedy
for threats if good men having good
representatives are but firm the storm
will beat the stout oak and rage like a
demon through its twisted branches
but pass on and spend itself in the wil
derness meanwhile the returning sun
shall find the noble tree unwrecked
and fastrooted
but if our charter oak is to be dis
membered god be thanked that its
roots were planted in the soil of free
dom there they will spread its
trunk and its mightiest branches will
abide the sun and the soil that nour
ished its infancy yet remain to repair
what time and storms may mutilate
beneath its shadow the poor and op
pressed shall find shelter
from the liberator
shall we compromise

a message from the
governor
the following message was trans
mitted by gov briggs to the house of
representatives in connection with
resolutions of tke state of virginia
respecting slavery it breathes a firm
and true spirit and is worthy of com
mendation
to the house of representatives l
have received from the governor of
the state of virginia and herewith
transmit to you the resolutions of the
eneral assembly of that common
wealth on the wilmot proviso and
kindred subjects
the sentiments and tone of these
resolutions coming from the legisla
ture of an ancient and honored sister
commonwealth are well calculated to
fill the mind with sadness the pur
pose avowed by the people of the free
states of arresting the further exten
sion of slavery has produced a high
state of excitement among our fellow
citizens of the slave states they
charge the north with being unfriend
ly to their interest and with making
aggressions upou their rights if the
charge is well founded it is well cal
culated to produce excitement though
other things enter into the contest the
main point in issue is whether slavery
shall be extended into territories be
longing to the united states which are
now free in this unfortunate section
al question it would be well for each
party to consider that the other has
rights the policy of excluding slave
ry from the territories of the union
originated in virginia and was sup
ported by the unanimous vote of four
other southern states now the leg
islature ot virginia more than intimates
that the union cannot survive the re
assertion and continuance of this policy
the south claim the right of going
into any of the public territories with
lhetr property and say that the exclu
sion of slavery will exclude the people
of the slaveholding states from those
territories suppose this to be true
it is equally true that with the opinions
which the people of the free states en
tertain upon the moral and social
character of this institution of slavery
and the incompatibility of free and
slave labor existing together they are
as effectually excluded from the terri
tories and states where this institutison
exists it is a generally conceded his
torical fact that at the time of the
adoption of the constitution when
there were six slave and seven free
states the further extension of slave
ry was not expected hy the people in
any section of the country the ninth
section of the first article of the con
stitution of the united states provides
that the immigration or importation
of such persons as any of the states
now existing shall think proper to ad
mit shall not be prohibited by con
gress prior to the year  whilst
by this article congress had no right
to prohibit the introduction of slaves
from abroad into any f the states
then existing prior to isdb it had the
power to do so as to new states which
might be admitted after the adoption of
the constitution
by the ordinance of two years
before the adoption of the constitu
tion the congress of the confedera
tion had provided for the formation of
not less than three nor more than five
new stntes in the territory northwest
of the ohio from the whole of which
they bad by that ordinance excluded
slavery
since the adoption of the constitu
tion nine new slave states have been
admitted into this union and five of
them formed out of territory which has
been acquired subsequent to that
event mr jefferson and other lead
ing statesmen believed and declared
that there was no constitutional power
in the government to acquire foreign
territory jh
texas and the territory ceded by
mexico have been added to the united
statesagainst the most earnest remon
strances of a great majority of the
people of the free states accompanied
by the declaration that if acquired the
north would never consent to the ex
tension of slavery over any part ol
such territory with aid received
from the north to accomplish their ob
ject the south by congressional ra
john dici print

volutions and by conquest succeeded
in gaining texas and a targe extent of
territory from distracted and bleeding
mexico
with all these facts before the
world the slaveholding states with
language as harsh as the charge is un
jownow nccuik me ifurtn jt me de
liberate purpose of violating their
rights with ten senators in the con
gress of the united states represent
ing live states carved out of newly ac
quired territory they insist upon the
privilege of extending the institution
over other territory which is now free
and failing to do this they threaten to
secede from the union the opinion
as to the constitutionality and proprie
ty of arresting the further extension of
slavery is as nearly unanimous among
the people of the free states as that
upon any other important propoaitipn
which can be named they believe
slavery to be morally wrong and that
such a restriction would be no invasion
oi the rights of any individual or
state but that it is necessary to arrest
an aggressien upon the rights of the
people of the free states which has
been in progress for half a century
the position which massachusetts has
assumedupon this subject she believes
to be impregnable and that carrying it
out would do no wrong to any other
state let her then while she will
obey the constitution of the united
states and observe all its guaranties
in her attitude of opposition to the
further extension of slavery be reso
lute and immoveable
masssachusetts and virginia were
coworkers together in that revolution
which made the thirteen united colo
nies free and independent states they
went hand in hand in framing and
adopting the constitution which ce
mented that glorious union the dif
ference of opinion which now divides
them upon the agitating subject of the
day is deeply to be deplored i trust
that no possible state ofthipgs will lead
the people of the government of mas
achusetts to forget the respect and
courtesy which is due to that of any
other sister commonwealth or to use
towards them language of reproach or
denunciation
one of the resolutions of her legit
tore herewith communicated declares
that no state has done so much to
form the union aa she has done
heaven grant that the future historian
may not be compelled to write that
virginia too by her acts or her influ
ence did more to dash that union to
atoms than any other state mournful
indeed would be the catastophe of dis
solution bat doubly mournful would
it be for the same historian to have to
add that the reason why this ancient
commonwealth the mother of presi
dentslent her aid to break up the
union with her sister states among
whom were the companions
struggles and her triumphs in the
cause of freedom was because those
companions would not consent to ex
tend the area of slaveryan institu
tion the existence of which made her
own jefferson say that he trembled
for his country when he remembered
that god was just
george n briggs
diamond dust the friendships of
the world are often confederacies in

the hyphen between matter and spirit
a breaking wave is the only thing in

moment of its dissolution the fetters
of rhyme are no more than a bracelet
to the true poet as well pass a kalei

during the pest week john c calhoun tot

massachusetts the former representing truly
the slavebolding spirit of his state end the
letter aa truly misrepresenting the antislavery
sentiment of massachusetts have presented
to the senate and the country their views o
the allengrossing subject of slavery and
neither of them in our judgment bea addefc
anything tending towards its final adjustment
 of the two speeches that of mr calhoun
though exceedingly defective is the more
creditable and praiseworthy it is plain
straightforward and consistent and it shows
that the object aimed at infernal though it
be is devoutly wiahed for by its author but
while it possesses these qualities the speech
will doubtless dissppoiut and mortify many
of mr calhouns friends at the south by
the hopelessness of its spirit the tameness
of its tone and the ataleoess of the material
of which it is composed on listening to its
deft very his ultra southern ftienda must
have feltad webster once said under a
light disappointment this is not the en
tertainment to which we were invited
something brilliant and powerful was ex
pected and something dim and weak was
given
the masterspirit of the south the great
champion of human bondage upon whom ai
the present crisis all eyes are turned and in
whose movements the whole nation is pro
foundly interested speaks anj the magic
charm is broken the mighty man of ala
very ia found to be mightier iu his ailencc
than in his eloquence while he could
thro id himself in mystery he seemed i
giant buthis voice heard his views ex
pressed his measures proposedand he ai
once shrinks into a pale feeble and deathly
skeleton so lifeless and powerless has thii
lion become that even hangman foote the
common buffoon of the senate dares t
withstand him to the face we repeat anc
tepeat gratefully the tyrant power of cal
houn in this nation is broken the great ob
ject of his life has been attacked by an over
whelming force and be has no arm to defeat
it amen evenso let it be with all thede
fenders of slavery and oppression
we can do no mote in our present number
than give a synopsis of the most striking
features of this long lopkedfor muchdread
ed but really harmless speech of mr cal
houn
his exordium shows that the speaker had
from the first a clear insight into the natur
of the yvjiole antirlavery movement at th
north and that he clearly foresaw whs
would be its effect upoo the public mind if i
were allowed to proceed it was plain i
him that a thoroughly antislavery consci
ence a deep conviction of the sin of slavery
pould not long rest under the restraints no
long abide b what are called the compre
mises of the constitution it was easy fo
such a mind aa hia to see the ultimate cooeiu
phrn from the premise thea siam is
sin that that granted all things by whici
it is upheld must fall or flourish with it tua
war cannot be made upon slavery withot
also attacking the arrangements that uphoh
it that the demand urged by william
garrison for a dissolution of the union i
simply the legitimate inference from tb
principle that slaveholding is sin
in describing the dicease of oj the eaua
of weakness to the union mr choun i
far more successful than in prescribing a re
medy for iu removal the south is diaeon
tented alarmed and excited religious tie
between the north and the south have beei
broken powerful and influential denofnma
tions which once formed a strong bond o
union between the two sections have beei
riven by the explosive force of antislaver
discussion political ties have yielded to thi
same power the north has rapidly in
creased in population and in political strength
the equilibrium between the north and thi
south which existed at the commencemen
of the government has been seriously dia
turbed and is still further threatened by thi
restless progress of freedom and genera
apprehension and alienation prevail this ii
a brief description of the disease of the bod
politic and which according to mr calhoun
endangers the atability of the union
now tp remedy these evils to allay dia
content to remove unfriendly feeling t
dispel fears aod to produce harmony am
union mr calhcun proposes an amendmen
of the constitution moat lame and impo
tent conclusion he must amend or ralhei
deform the constitution of hupun nature hi
must make wrong equal to right cruelty
equal to kindnessand injustice equal t
justice in loveliness and good report amonj
men before he can itope to establish a per
roanent equilibrium between slavery anc
liberty it ia idle for statesmen to legislate
against the antislavery sentiment god hat
legislated in its favor and in the languagr
of brougham while men loathe rapine am
hate fraud they shall reject with indignatior
the wild and guilty fantasy that man may
hold property in mw no mr calhoun
melancholy aa the truth may be to the deaien
in human flesh no constitutional change nt
legislative enactment no human oontract noi
agreement can save the accursed ayvtem o
human bondage from the decay and death h

od we breathe more freely since we have
ceapklri ft sydney smith on nid that
whatever question might ihr as to the
umfuioess of middle mee u ue letting oat
of estates no one coaid doubt their utility in
standing between jeremy and the
public we think the same tree as re
garda the long speeches of webster and
cass they both need the services of a
faithful friend to abridge and compress their
tedious productions tbs the public may not
be deterred from bestowing upou them the
which they really merit
mr webeter is eloquent mr webster is
grand mr webster is patriotic but neither
bis eloquence bis grandeur nor his patriot
ism can save this speech of liia from the
overwhelming condemnation of all liberal
and highminded men it was not the
speech for the oecasioo an opportunity
was presented for the display of the orators
great powars in a manner which would hare
done essential service to the cause of human
freedom and have carried hit name down
with blessings to posterity but he has oc
cupied his time to no good purpose hh
sketch of the rapid settlement of
and of the manner in which that territory
and new mexico were acquired by tfrls
government are familiar to all end being
like his hiatory of slavery in all countiies
and ages destitute of moral feeling and not
even having the merit of an apparent end or
aim need not be repeated in our columns
his remarks too on the aeparation of the
methodist episcopal church which divided
on the question of slavery show that a man
how largely soever endowed with intellect
mav yet be wholly devoid of that higher
quality moral integrity
upon this subject mr webster presents
us with a specimen of his skill in the art ol
substituting darkness fot light and bitter for
sweet and of the manner in which he can
confound ignorant bigotry with uncorapromis
and intelligent fidelity to principle
the following was doubtless intended as
a thrust at those abolitionists from whom he
has received no small share of honest rebuke
for hia inconsistent and temporising coarse on
the subject of slavery
they deal with morals as with mathema
i tics and they think whatis right may be
distinguished from what la wrong with the
precision of an algebraic equation they
have therefore none too much charity toward
others who differ with them they are apt
r too to think that nothing is good but what is
perfect and that there are no compromises
or modifications to be made in submission to
difference of opinion or in deference  other
mens judgment if their perspicacious via
ion enables them to delect a spot on the face
of the sun they think that a good reason
why the sun should be struck down from
 ifeaven they prefer the chance of running
t into utter darkness to living in heavenly light
t if that heavenly light be not absolutly wiih
out any imperfection there are impatient
menstoo impatient always to give heed to
the admonition of st paul that we are not
to do evil that good may cometoo impa
r tient to wait for the slow progress of moral
causes in the improvement of mankind
r i il lhal raen a y not ascertain with
certainty as to what is right and what is
k the only reason is that they allow
their own fancied interest to warp their judg
meois there is no real difficulty in arriving
at right conclusions in a case so plain as that
i of slavery for with respect to this giant sin
i if a mans eye be single his whole body
may be full of light
s mr webster refers to the state of feeling
which pervaded this country before and at
s the adoption of tho united states constitu
tion but how  or what purpose no
with a view to inspire the present generation
with a similar feeling not to kindle in the
i bosoms of the sons a desire to carry into
practice the views and sentiments of their
ancestors by destroying what they pronounced
f an eyil but sad to fay for the low purpose
of excusing aqd palliating the freedom with
whieh the system of slavery is now denoun
ced in the southern section of the union
instead of summoning the spirits of the de
parted to aid in the defence of liberty he
invokes them merely to propitiate the dark
i embodiment of slavery
mr w ebster reviews the annexation of
texas to the union and the motives which
i prompted its annexation and in order to be
i faithful to the history of that transaction lie
was compelled to charge mr calhoun aa
one of the prominent actors in it with seek
ing in the consummation of that measure to
strengthen the slave interests of the country
the new england orator here complimented
the champion of slavery for hia boldness and
manliness this was a blunder which a man
of mr websters wit and sagacity might
have been expected to avoid since it was
i well calculated to provoke comparisons and
perhaps even to call forfo rebuke that he
honored in qnother the virtue of which he
himself is moat destitute calhoun is open
and candid as we have elsewhere said he
is a statesman of whose position no doubt
need b entertained he uses language to
i declare and not to conceal his sentiments
ami designs fn thif the dark orator of the
north might well learn of calhoun but we
are digressing
on the question of the exclusion of slavery
from the territories acquired from mexico
i mr webster stands practically upon the
 ground of geoetal casa general taylor and
the cabinet the difference between them
r if any exist is merely theoretical the
i former would excuse his unfaithfulness to
liberty and his treachery to the north by
demonstrating the unfitness of those coun
tries for elavery and by solemn assurances
against foe possibility of its introduction into
those territories and the latter would plead
foe same assumption aa an apology to slave
holders and the south for refusing a positive
enactment for its introduction there teems
to have been a general understanding among
foe old politicians on this subjecta regular
combination to defeat the rising spirit of
freedom nothing is heard now in the sen
ate of foe wilraot proviso messrs web

leading men have united in denouncing it

webster has the honor thus far of giving
the last slab to this youthful agent of liberty

from the subject of the wilmot proviso
the speaker passes to the alleged grievances of
the two sections of the union these bow
erer an mainly set down to the account of
the north and the chief of them be attri
butes to the bad faith of the free states ia
their action on the subject of returning fu
gitire slaves to bondage he has the har
dihood and coldblooded rillaony to openly
advocate the return of slaves to bondage as
a duty which the free states are solemnly
and religiously bound to discharge his
views on this subject concur with those of
clay meade and the moat obdurate slave
catcher and mantrapper of the south he
does not even intimate the necessity of
guarding the rights of the free colored citi
aena of his own state but he avows his
intention to vote for the bill of mr meade
with all its horrid peculiarities like clay
he goes beyond the decision of the supreme
ceurt in the case of prigg vs pennsylvania
and would take the work of slavehunting
and siaveeapturing from the general govern
ment and bind it upou the shoulders of the
free states he next considers the griev
cemsulh t at l iebe are abolition
socmumat the north he thinks that they
have not produced anything good or valu
able that they have put back the cause
that they have spent money enough to pur
chase all the slaves in maryland that they
have bound the slaves more firmly sic sic
having denounced the abolition societies
and apologised for the violence of the north
ern press be eulogises the union and ridi
cules the idea of its peaceful dissolution

no union with slaveholders
one good at least will be accomplished by
the present discussion in coogtess and else
where on the subject of slaverythey will
disclose to the entire nation and the world
the teal relation of this government and peo
pie to the siave system mr toombs of
georgia has stated the case with exceeding
clearness and force in a speech delivered
by himin congress onthe th of febuary
we give it below let every man who
would fjee bis soul from the blood guiltiness
of slavery read and ponder this statement
let those who scoff at the men who adopt the
motto of no union with slaveholders and
who yet propose to be genuine abolitionists
learn a lesson irom mr toombs he clear
ly shows the position occupied by william
lloyd garrisonand the american antislavery
society to be the logical and inevitable re
sult from the basis that slaveholding is sin
slaveholder thou he be his rebuke of those
who claim to be soil men and who
yt ulje especial pains to pour their invec
tvoa upon abolitionists is pungent and time
ly it is oleat that nothing short of a disso
lution of the present union can free the north
from the sin and guilt which attach to sla

the old confederation which was found
strong enoughunder a sense of common dan
ger to carry ua triumphantly through the
war of the revolution upon the return of
peace was supposed to be insufficient for the
wants of the country delegates met in

present constitution way the result of their
labors tbs journals and debates of that
convention attest the fact that the delegates
from the slaveholding slates saw the dan
ger of submitting their rights to projierty in
slaves to the hostile legislation of the pro
posed new government they then foresaw
that they would be ia i minority a strong
hostility fo that interest was openly manifest
ed in the convention they were wise enough
not to expect an abatement of that aeniimeni
and therefore they demanded special guaran
tees for its protection the inflexible perti
nacity with which some of tieie guarantees
were insisted upon on more than one occasion
during the deliberations of that assambly
threatened the loss of the whole plan ol
union they were conpeded because tbe
unton could not have been formed without
their concession these special guarantees
were
ist an exception of the african slave
trade from the general power of congress

branch of congress
sd tbe right to demand the delivery up
of fugitives from labor escaping to the non
aiavenolding confederates
th the obligation of the gonetal gov
ernment to suppress insurections
these special securities together with the
reservation of the states respectively or to
the people of the powers not delegated to
the united slates by the constitution nor
prohibited by it to tbe states were suppos
ed by those who granted them and those whe
accepted them to be amply sufficient to pro
tect property in slaves from any hostile action
of this government in this sense was the
constitution received and accepted by the
people of the united states the only de
feet in these guarantees results from the fact
that the execution and faithful observance oi
them depends upon tbe good faith of the gov
ernment in themselves honestly adhered to
they ate full ample sod sufficient
the history of some of them ia curious and
instructing at tbe time of the formation ol
the constitution virginia and maryland hats
prohibited tbe african slave trade north car
olina had laws trampling and restraining it
south carolina and georgia insisted upon
further importations these two ststes bar
gained with new england and a part of the
consideration wan that new england was to
vote for the eootinoanoa of the african slave
trade for twenty georgia and south
carolina were to vote to place the general
commerce of the country under tbe oontro
of a majority of congress instead of two

new york city
we extract the following from the speech
of the lion mr bissetl recently made in
the house of representatives
the power of congress to abolish the
slave trade and slavery at the arsenate forte
and navy yards and in thia district will
hardly be questioned by any of our southern
triends and yet neither the one nor the
other has been abolished to this day in any
of those places even slavedcalers now
drive their occupation in this district at plea
sute could not the north had she chosen
so to do have put so end to slavery and the
slave trade in all these places long ere tins
she has forborne to do so is that forbear
ance any part of the aggression upon
slavery which now justifies rebellion against
he union
now sir let us consider thoee minor
charges so pertinaciously urged against the
tiee states that make up the turn total of
those aggressions which justify these gen
tlemen in dissolving the unioo what ue
these charges why it is charged first
that among the people ot the free state
there is a prevalent and increasing feeling
adverse to slavery thia statement or
charge it it be one i cannot deny but 
atn at a loss to conceive hw that can be re
garded as an aggression upon the south
or a justification lor the act of overthrowing
ihis government is it required of the lieu
stales that they in aggregate shall keep a
supervision over the views and opinions of
their individual citizens on political inotal or
any other subjects is not this a country of
freedom of opinion and do not our south
ern friends even reoognise the principle tbai
error of opinion may be safely tolerated
wheio reason is left free to combat it but
are the people of the free states peculiar in
their views on this subject does not the
aggression come alsofiom another quarter
and with tenfold force how is the feeling
in kentucky where at a receut election
more than ten thousand vole as  am in
formed were cast in favor of complete eman
cipation how is it in other northern slave
states when van buren even at the last
presidential election found warm supporters
and not a few vute now gentlemen
ot the south you cannot prevent these things
this feeling or sentiment or whatever else
you may call iteven among the people of
youi own slaveholding statesman you are
you not asking too much then w hen you fa
quire us of tbe north and west to suppress it
among our people we could not do so if
we would and if we had the power our
refusal to exeicise it would by no meaos tend
to justify the destruction of this republic
again it is made an accusation rgainst
he free states that their ministers of the
gospel make slavery a subject of pulpit dis
quisition thus increasing the hetiiluy already
existing against that institution to some
extent this may be the fact mr chairman
though i confess that so far as my own
knowledge extends such instances are ex
ceedingly rare but what then can w
prevent that ought we to try why on
this point we have the authority of the gen
tleman from mississippi mr brown him
self in favor of the practice you will recol
lect sir that after treating us loan argument
of considerable length designed to shew
that the moral and religious condition of the
negro is improved by his being hed in bond
ageand alter declaring that in his opinion
slavery ia a great moral social po
litical and religious blessinga blessing to
the slave and a blessing to the masterh
drops the auhject by saying it is do pan of
my purpose to discuss this piopositio the
subject in this view of it belongs rather to
the pulpit than to the hall at legislation
surely sir he will now complain no more of
sermons on the subject of slavery and
when he ooroea to draftthe declsraiion for
the southern confederacyl trust that
has not already been done he will cettainly
ft it include this as one of the cause wbten
impel us to the separation
but again it is charged also against the
free states that we tolerate anualavery so
cietiea yes sir we tolerate antislavery
socities native american societies temper
ance societies moral reform societies mis
sionary societies sewing societies six possi
blythough i am not certainother societies
indeed sir we are tolerant tow srds all sorts
of societies we are so because first we
have no right to be intolerant ia reference to
j such matters and secondly because there
is no necessity for meddling with them we
i must hunt for other cause than this sir to
justify a disco ition of the union
another charge against us is that we pgr
noit men to perambulate the countxy lectur
ing on abolitionism thus increasing tbe pre
judice already existing against the institution
of slavery there are such menno doubt
my mind recurs to one just nowono who
in that way has probably exerewed more
influence in the north than all the other
antislavery lecturers put together thin
man is cassius m clay a citizen of the
slaveholding state of kentucky when
our southern friends will agree to seal his
mouth on thst subject or confine his effort
to abolish slavery to the southern states
where be belongs it wjill be time enough for
us of the north to set about devising some
mode of confining itinerant lecturers or pres
cribing subjects for the exercise of their elo
quence i might mention other lecturers of
the same sort for whom the north is in
fobted to the slave stales but it is unnecs
sary
it ia also made a matter of accusation
against tbe free states that aatisiavery
presses are kept up there and that the papers
supplied by them are circulated throughout
he northern states and even into the south
ern and this is one of the principal causes
which render it necessary to establish a
southern confederacy which ahail em
brace jut exactly the fifteen slaveholder
state and no more we cannot deny mr
chairman that such papers do circulate quite
extensively in some portions of the free
states and some of them piobably may bo
found even south of mason an dixons line
i have a paper of that character on my desk
now here it is sir holding it up it
a fairlooking paper mr chairman and 
observe that its at tide are written with great
ower but i assure you sir it is fearfully
severe on slavery and it circulates ex
tensively in the north too the number not
eing less lam told than fo art ecu thousand
weekly besides some thousands which find
their way tafo the siaveholding states now
l can imagine that you suppose this paper to
bo published in yeimont you are mistaken
dr it is not published there nor in matse
husetts nor even north of mason and dix
naline it is published on slave territory
ir right here to sight of this caphol and
almost within sonnd of my voice right here
r upon lb my spot from which tbe gen
tleman from north carotins mr clinouan
is not going to be driven becauee it ie hie
alave territory yee gentlemen of tbe
south from your own midst from the very
ioors of your houses snrrounded by your
slave population do you aond forth aatiasve
ry papers in number more than fourteen
thousand per week to deluge the north sad
manufacture public sentiment there then
ou make the circulation of thoee papers and
ihe prevalence of a sentiment which they
cannot bnt engender a pretext for overthrow
ing this government silence yoar own the
niton presses keep for your own use the
fourteen thousand abolition papers which you
weekly distribute among the people of tbe
north and then claim if vuu will that the
wusttnoe of tboltow jutatt in tf m
ttnin justification to you for dissolving the
 remember also that there was another
amiauftry press in rigorous and very effec
ure operation for come time in kentucky
mr browm we destroyed it
mr bisscll so you did by violence
but by your own laws and the decision of
your own courts you were punished for it
you were competed to make compensation
in damages for your lawless act now i
ask our southern fnends in all good feeling
if they can justily urge as a reason for dissol
ving the union annoyances consequent upon
a state of things in the free states which
tbev cannot prevent at their own doors
we are met by the gentleman from north
carolina with another difficulty fox which he
holds the north responsible he suggests
that the increasing antislavery sentiment in
the north will prevent the president from ap
pointing slaveholders to office for the
present let a single fact allay the gentleman
fears the presidency has been given to the
slaveholding states during fmiveighi of the
last sixty years and this too though the
white populat on of the slaveholding states
has rarely it at any time exceeded onehalf
that of the free states of the foreign mis
sions of all grades mote than a majority
have been given to the south of tlte cabi
net appointments very nearly if not quite
half have been given to the south of the
officers in the army and navy it will lie found
that considering the relative population of
the free and slaveholding states at least
three out of fire have been given to the  outh
how is it at this very moment sir while
these very complaints of outrage in suits
tyranny and loss of office are being otade
why air the presidenta majority f the
cabineta majority of our foreign ministers
a majority of the members of the supreme
court and the presiding officer and clerk of
this houseare southern men and slave
holders does not this satisfy the geiitleman
from north carolina  surely he might on
this subject rest quite easy another diffi
culty gravely set forth in this gentleman
speech  ought perhaps to notice with be
coming seriousness  allude to the refusal
of the new england spinster to take the
southern gentlemans atm that was
wrong unquestionably but then these
yankee girls are very independent and will
do just as they pleaseas some of us have
learned from very painful personal experience
but i do not think that a dissolution of the
union need to follow as a necessary conse
quence it is a proper subject for negotia
tion and as the lady cannot fail to perceive
by this time that she is in danger of becom
ing a second helen she will doubtless he
more yielding
fron the christian enquirer
fugitive slaves
if we read conectly one of the compro
mise resolutions of mr clay calls upon the
north to consent to measures for the certain
restitution of runaway slaves we doubt
as we hopethat the north will yield no
such consent it is pethapa to be feared
that the spirit of trade and the habits of
party to use vague phrases that speak very
intelligible forcesalthough they operating
unconsciously to those whom they direct
may prevent as these and other causes pre
vented at the time of the admission of mis
souri the determined resistance to slavery
extensionthe resolute saying to that pe
culiar institutionyou shall not go onehairs
breadth farther but we more than ques
tion whether any not them earthly policy or
any party allegiance will be able to grasp
and deliver the living breathing chattel
whose locomotive powers have brought htn
to the soil and company of freemen a slave
here is very apt to look so like a human bat
ing that our citizens would be slow to come
under any new obligation to return him as
a thing whence he came indeed even now
they are not let the iniquity be confessed
over anxious lest by winking they should
not see the deserter from the house of bond
age and to ask them to be more sharpbighted
as constables and slavehunters for the south
would be breath wasted at ihisend of the
union there is a sort of common sense
which sharply distinguishes between fugitive
slaves and fugitive criminals so sharply in
deed that box brown and his follow self
emancipators are rather tespected for their
heroic and enduting love of liberty than
searched for as ungrateful creatures feloni
ously endeavoring to own themselves
this is said with none other than the kindest
and most christian feelings towards the
south for though such a sentiment may
be received with contempt in some quarters
we deem the states cursed by slavery as en
during a heavy burthen not of their own as
sumption which forbid any use of taunts or
threats or vituperative phrases half of our j
antislavery feeling at least comes fiomsyin 
pathy with the master and none of that
sympathy is less sincere and dead because as
yet they spurn it and refuse to admit there
is any occasion for it but we refer to this
matter of fugitive slaves because it is best
that the matter should be fairly understood
congress driven to it may possibly pass
more stiingent laws for the restoiation of
runaway property did anybody ever under
take to write a sentence about slavery with
out seeing in the confusions it makes with
his pronouns and the contradictious it re
quires in his rhetoric thst it must be s false
institution since he cannot use good grammar
ami good english in speaking of it but men
cannot he found at the north to execute them
the day has gone by when an escjed slave
can be apprehended and sent back from the
free eastern states by the agency of free
eastern people if that day has not gone
by then we would rather live at the south
generous hospitable and in many respects
manly notwithstanding its one dark evil
thing than call ourselves northern men

from the pennsylvania freeman
we extract the following article from the
pennsylvanianas we are quite willing to give
it the benefit of our circulation it is a pretty
faiy specimen of that journal we are much
obliged to the editors for their advice to some
of the democrats to buy and read the last
number of our paper we should like all
of ihem to do it and thus ascertain how
much truth there is in the assertion that we
have elevated thaddeus stevens into a very
vyilberforce of piety and patriotism and
also that we eloquently applauded the call
for the democratic meeting in favor of the
wilmol proviso which it chooses to desig
nate as a free soil meeting this latter
assertion is paiticularly surprising to ns as
we fancy it will be to onr readers we par
ticularly request hem to refer to the article
on the subject in our lafpaper
a new ally of the free soil parts
we referred briefly on friday and satur
day to the earnest and zealous opposition
of ihe north american to the late demo
cratic union meeting and to the pensylvaniart
and also to the vehement devotion of thad
deus sievens to the cause of free soil and
since then we have noticed the organ of the
abolitionists and diaunionists in this city
the socalled pennsylvania freeman has
taken the same ground it pours out its vi
als of wrath upon the democrats who dared
to attend and the journal that dares to de
fendthe great meeting in favor of the consti
tution and the union we should like some
of those democrats who have been invited tc
take part in the free soil meeting now in
course of incubation under the joint auspices
of van buren disorganize of  and
original taylor men to purchase and per
use a copy of the last weeks pennsylvania
freeman prominent in its editorial columns
will be found a lengthy article is abusive of
the pennsylvanian as anything that hss ever
been written on the same subject by the free
soil organs and quite as denunciatory of the
proceedings and speakers of the late union
democratic meeting as anything that the
north americau has yet produced on the
first and second pages will he found the vul
gar and violent speech of thaddeus stevens
endorsed in a most jubilant editorial in which
that shameless and guiltv demagogue is ele
vated into a very wilberforce of piety and
patriotism then comes on the third page
the copy of the call for the projected free
soil meeting in this city with certain reso
lutions committees and other machinery of
that concern and this is appropriately follow
ed by a copy of the petition for the dissolti j
tion of the union now being signed bv the
w hite and black free suffers at north fifth
st we need not add that both the call lor
the free soil meeting and the petition for
the dissolution of the union are eloquently
applauded by the freeman
what a jubilee it will be to the abolition i
ists if ever the great national democracy is
broken up and destroyed how the dis
unionists of  north fifth street will re
joice in their frequent assemblages of whites
and blacks how garrison thompson j
tappan douglass and the british agitators 
will exult aad how gratefuuhey will be
to the free soil leaders and the free soil
papers who have struck the deadliest blow
at our noble old party
from the pennsylvania freeman
messrs editorsj have noticed in the j
freeman an article on tne subject ofcongress
extending to post masters aud other the
power of geving certificates to the slavehold j
ers or their agents for the return of those j
slaves who escape into the free states and
you ask the quaker post mastsrs and mis
tresses of chester coumy what they think of
becoming kidnappers what answers they
may give to your query i know not hut 
can answer for one post master in yew york
 should be perfectly willing te have that
power conferred on me if i resided in a part
j of the country through which any of those
poor creatures passed in taking the office
i that i hold  affirmed to support the consti
lotion of the united states and the slate of
new york and i shall do it so far as the
duties of a post master ste concerned i did
not pledge myself to go to the field of baitle
j and slaughter my fellow man neither did ij
agree to steal human beings and consign
them to slavery or death and if the power of
granting certificates to the slaveholder was
conferred on me i should interpret the con
stitution of the united states is the same way
that the slaveholders do when a they say it
does not give congress a v power to legis
late on the subject snd i cannot find the
i word slave in that instrument snd as i know
no right by which man can hold his fellow
man as property  should be like a judge i
saw an account of some years since i think
he belonged to massachusetts he would
not acknowledge any such right until the
slaveholder brought a bill of sale from the al
mighty
a whig pcsr master
did our correspondent promise to support
the constitution of the united states only
so far as the duties of a post mister are con
cerned on such anoath or affirmation of
allegiance could be have obtained the office
we assert that in making that promise to
maimain preserve and defend the constitu
tion he did pledge himself to deliver up the
fugitive from service or tabor on the claim of
j the party to whom such service or labor may
i be due under the laws of the state from
which he hss escaped and if he refuse to do
this violate his contract with the south
and breaka his oath or affirmation of office
the judge whose example he quotes and
j proposes to follow would have been a more
honest man had he resigned his seat on the
bench when he fourd that hia obligations of
office conflicted with his duties to his fellow
man and his god he was right in breaking
his oath because ite had sworn to do wicked
ly but by continuing the promise of allegi
ance which he did by remaining io the office
of which the oath was a necessary condition
be prejured himself this may sound harsh
ly to our correspondent but its truth is to us
as clear as sunlight we do not doubt the
benevolence and love of justice snd freedom
which m his cate and that of the judge
prompted the aid given to the fugitive but the
making of promise wul an intention of
breaking them because it would be wrong
to keep them it a very singular way of serv
ing god

tered files of the d indians regiment snd to
have met the mexican fotoes who had rou
ted and were putauing the mississippi reg

that particular spot
the beet answer i can give to your inquiry
is to state what i did saywhich waa this
thatat the time the d indiana regiment
gave wat the mississippi regiment was not
within a mile and a half of the scene of ac

reference to the mississippi regiment  al
so said that the d kentucky the d illinois

of time
having answered your inquiry i deem it
due in justice alike to myself and the miss

mr websters speech
we are not disappointed in the remarks
which mr websters speech is calling forth
in different parts of the country nearly all
the letterwriters in washington are in rap
tures with it the washington union en
dorses it as sound and satisfactory to those
who have for weeks been plotting the dissolu
tion of the republic most of the new
york city journals join in piaising it and
loudest of all is the journal of commerce
always a bitter reviler of any measure for the
restriction of slavery and a most obstqious
panderer to southern demands
mr websters splendid talents snd great
services give to his opinins great weight
the whigs of the noith especially have
honored him and trusted in him on no
question paiticularly one of so momentous
importance as that which formed one of the j
themes of his late speechthe prohibition of
slavery in new mexicocan they differ j
with him without profound and painful regret
it is not a matter of wander therefore that
the papers to which we have referred should 
express a joyful surprise at the new position
that great statesman has taken upon the
slavery question
we do not know what effect the speech
will have upon members of congress but how j
it will be received by the great mass of the
people at the north there can be no doubt i
on the great question which has agitated the
country since the acquisition of territory from i
mexicothe application of the ordinance oi
it is in direct conflict with their wishes
their principles and deliberately formed pur
poses we speak particularly of tne whig
people at the north they cannot pro
foundly as they respect and venerate daniel
webstersustain his position io this respect
the attempt to do so would in our humble
judgment be a disaster to the whig party in
all the free stalesthe only party that has
for yeais offered a steady and consistent op
position to the encroachments snd the spread
of slavery
the boston atlas the leading whig
paper of new england aud an able advocate
of the nomination of mr webster as the
whig candidate for president in  hasj
a review of this speech which we regret that
our limited apace today will not permit us to
copy entire the extracts which follow will
suffice to show the feeling of massachusetts
and new engiaud whigs
it will be seen by a perusal of the speech
itself that the telegraphic report of it which
we published on friday morning and which
caused so deep a sensation we may say dis
satisfaction m this community was substan
tially correct as publisher of a whig
journal we are expected to express our opin
ion in regard it that expectation we shall
not disappoint we know well the weight
which is attached by our people to the opin
ions of mr webster and the influence they
exert in new england and throughout the
countiy we would not disagree with the
views which ono so distinguished entertains
one for whom we have the moat profound
respect and venerationif we could help it
in ihe present instance we cannot agree with
mr webster his sentiments are not our
sentiments they are not we venture to
say the sentiments of the whigs of new
england
we pass by that part of the speech which
relates to the catching of runaway slaves
with a single remark it is no part of the
duties of s state to furnish officers to catch
and jails wherein to hold runaway slaves
congress may do it whether northern men
ought to vote fur such a law ia another
question we would vote for no law impos
ing duties upon freemen which we would not
ourselves be willing to aid in enforcing
how many of our people would be willing to
join in the chaas of an escaped save and be
come his keeper until taken back into bond
age we know not the occupation would
not be reputable in our judgment we have
not seen mr masons bill on this subject
we know not their provisions but be they
what they may we trust before the bill be
come a law that it will be so amended that
south carolina and louisiana will be com
killed to refrain from taking from our
orthern vessels colored seamen massachu
setts citizens and imprisoning them while ihe
vessel remains in port and selling them into
slavery to pay the jail fee unless they are
paid by the owner or consignee of the ves
sel
the most important part of the speech
we mean the part which will receive the
closest scrutinyis that which relates to
texas snd new mexieo mr webster says
what is truethat more slave states cen be
made out of texas and that the treaty of
annexation recognizes this fact these
states are to be made slave states made so
by law human law not gods law mr
webster considers congress is bound to ad
mit these new slave states whenever they
apply properly for admission this point we
shall not st present discuss mr webster
objeots to the application of the ordinance of
 to the territory of new mexico be
cause providence has made it incapable of
sustaining a population of slaves we shall
not ask whether god made texas for a land
of bqndsge we shall not ap hr forget qur
duty as even to surmise that our creator
made any portion of bit heritage fw the
aoduc cf slavery or any portion of our men
for bondmen it is man who made texas
slave country not qod gods law ia free
dom and as man hsa perverted gods law by
his law and dedicated portions of hi earth to
slavery so would we by mans law and the
almighty law and make the earth free in
other words inasmuch as the largest portion
of texas is dedicated to slavery by human
law so we would by human lavy dedicate
every inch of nw mexico and california to
freedom this would he a fair compromise
our people will never be content to leave
ibis to engnee jf we are to ha territori
al government for new mexieo t
contain the ornmm
diiould
vry ordinance and it
iwoum be as wroug to vote against putting it
mto a territorial bill oa the ground that god
did not intend te make that slave territory
as it would be to tote rt out of the cerath

 he say we cannot gite the speech entire in

will gite a lew sample by which oui
readers can judge of the to he makes a
com para tite statement of the influence and
power of slavery as exemplified by the cen

riod the population of the free state ex
ceeded those of the slate states only about
 at the last census the majority was
about  veil tot of it il
the south choose to sustain an institution which
exeictsea such a paralvxing influence over
themhow can they find fault with us in conse
quence very probably if we had the
statistics it would be seen that filty years
ago there was a much larger proportion of
drunkards in the united states than there
ia now hot we are not aware that the per
petuity of the union is endangered by the
progress of the temperauce reform or that
the friends of alcohol are about to dissolve
their connection with the union on account
of the temperance agitation
mr calhoun also complains that the
north havs so ascendency ovurktie sooth to
every department of government will he
be kind enough to give us a list of those
who have held offices under the government
fiom the president down to midshipman and
the salaiies they have received from the pub
lic purse that we may see how large a ma
jority have come from the north and how
much more than half of the public funds
have gone into the pockets of northern men
we confess we had rather see the names
tnd figures than to take the ipse dixit even
of the southern autocrat
mrc also says that the south has no
concessions or suriendet to make shehaa
already surrendered to much that she has
little left to surrender this is almost too
much for our gravity as however it was
uttered with apparent seriousness dont
know but the honorable senator from so
long dwelling on the idea has at last got
to believe that the southern slates have
been very much oppressed and downtrod
den and that every slaveholder may con
himself an injnred indiwidual andmore
sinned against than sinning we are re
minded of the inveterate atoryteller who
after a time puts credence in hia own fab
rications
he concludes by sa ing that if california
is admitted into the union under the consti
tution chosen by her own citizens the south
will regard it as a final decision of the teat
question and ominously adds that they
would be infatuated not to act according
ly
but we ought to ask pardoa of our readers
for devoting so much space to such a speech
we regard it as merely one of the convulsive
throes of an expiring hydravetr york

alleged that he and patrick entered into part
nership for the purpose of digging gold in
california and that the proceeds amounting
to the above sum had been taken possession
of by the said patrick without the slightest
attempt to divide the spoils the gold dust
was at the u s mint and an injunction
was played to prevent the defendant from
taking it from that place the court decid

no ground of injunction and that even il
there was a partnership the plaintiff not
having labored towards that end and the
whole fund having been acquited by the de

he was in his palace weak in health

that the course ef government was

royal friend and about the irreparable
loss to the empire were paraded before
all mens eyes and dinned into the

death was in waiting and some for
whom great labors and deeds were
preparing in life the troublesome
opponent of ministers mr tierney
who was to be found dead in his study
before the next royal funeral and
lord graves who was to die by his
own hand under the provocation of
royal vice or levity and what tasks
lay before those who were yet to live
and work among the six dukes who
bore the pall was he who was to suc
ceed to the highest military office now
thus vacated and wellington himself
uo doubt thought this night that he was
of one mind in the great political ques
tion of the day with the prince whose
pall he boreno doubt he believed
that he should in hts proper place do
what he could to exclude the catholics
and to keep the conscience of the sov
ereign fixed upon the coronation oath
and his duty to protestantism in his
proper place we say because the duke
spurned the idea of a military chief
like himself taking civil office and
openly declared with indignation at aft
unfounded rumer that he should be
mad if he dreamed of the premiership
yet beforo this royal vault should
again be opened wellington was to be
premier and use his office to repeal
the disabilities of catholics tru
ly pledges and prophecies are danger
ous things for statesmen to meddle
with in times of transition and it would
seem to be a feature in the mission of
the honest and resolute wellington
honest and resolute beyond all cavil

the good merchants
the sexton of the old school
who writes in the boston transcript
tells the following touching and delight
ful story
the old standard merchants who
transacted business on the long
wharf boston pier when i was a boy
are dead stelliger almost every
one of them and if all that  have
known and heard of them were fairly
told it would make a very readable
volume highly honorable to many ol
their number and calculated to operate
as a stimulus upon the profession in
every age
one little narrative spreads itself be
fore my memory at this moment which
i received from the oaly surviving son
of the individual to whom it especially
refers a merchant very extensively
engaged in commerce and located
upon the long wharf died feb 
 at the age of  intestate his
eldest son administered upon the es
tate this old gentleman used plea
santly to say that for many years he
had fed a very large number of the
catholics on the shores of the medi
terrranean during lent referring to
his very extensive connexion with the
fishing business in his day he was
certainly well known and to the
present time is well remembered by
some of the old ones down along the
shore from the gurnets nose to
race point among his papers a
package of very considerable size
was found after his death carefully
tied up and labelled as follows
notes duebills and accounts against
sundry persons down along shore
some of these may be got by s ult or
severe dunning but the people are
poor most of them hate had fishermens
luck my children ttill do as they think
best perhaps they will tfiink with me
that it is best to bum this package en

about a monthsaid my informant
after our father died the sons met
together and after some genera
remarks our elder brother the admin
istrator produced this package ol
whose ojfistence we were already ap
prized read the superscription and
asked what course should be taken ip
regard to it another brother a few
years younger than the eldest a man
of strong impulsive temperament un
able at the moment to express his
feeling by words while he brushed
the tears from his eyes with  hand
by a spasmodic jerk of the other to
wards the fire place indicated his wish
to have the package put into the
flames it was suggested by another
of our number that it might be well
first to make a list of the debtors
names and of the dates and amounts
that we might be enabled as the in
tended discharge was for all to inform
such as might offer payment that their
debts were forgiven on the following
day we again assembledthe list had
been preparedand all the notes due
bills and accounts whose amount in
i eluding interest exceeded thirtytwo
thousand dollars wire committed to
the flames
it was about four months after our
fathers death continued my infor
mant in the month of june that as
i was sitting in my eldest brothers
counting room waiting for an oppor
tunity to speak with him there came
in a hardfavored little old man who
looked as if time and rough weather
had been to windward of him for
seventy years he asked if my bro
ther was not the executor he replied
that he was administrator as our lather
died intestate well said the strang
er lve come up from the cape to
pay a debt  owed the old gentleman
my brother continued my informant
requested him to take a seat being at
the moment engaged with other per
sons at the desk
the old man sat down and putting
on his glasses drew out a very ancient
leather pocket book and began to
count over his money when he had
doneand there was quite a parcel of
bank notes as he sat waiting bis
turn slowly twisting his thumbs with
his old grey meditative eyes upon the
floor he sighed and  knew the
money as the phrase runs cape hard
and secretly wished the old mans
name might be found upon the forgiven
list my brother was soon at leisure
and asked him the common question
his name c the original debt was
four hundred and forty dollarsit had
stood a long time and with the in
terest amounted to a sum between
seven and eight hundred my brother
went to bis desk and after examining
the forgiven list attentively a sudden
smile lighted up his countenance and
told me the truth at a glancethe old
mans name was there my brother
quietly took a chair by his side and a
conversation ensued between them
which i never shall forget your
note is outlawed said my brother it
ws dated twelve years ago payable
in two years there is no witness and
no interest has ever been paid you are
not bound to pay this notewe cannot
recover the amount sir said the
old man i wish to pay it it is the
only heavy debt i hare in the world it
may be outlawed here but hare no
child aad my old woman end i hope
we hare made our peace with god
and wish to do so with num i should
like to p itand hit his bank
notes bt tore nay brother requesting
him to coviit them ov er i cannot
take this ratiney  said my brother
the old tram tiefearae alarmed i
have cast simple interest for twelve
years ahd a little over said the old
man i will rerjaay you compound in
terest if you say so the debt ought
to have been paid jong ago but your
father sir was very indulgenthe
knew id been unducky and told me
not to worry about it
my brother then set the whole mat
ter plainly before him and taking the
bank bills returned them to the old
mans pocketbook telling him that
although our father left no formal will
he had recommended to his cihldren to
destroy certain notes duebills and
other evidences of debt and release
those who might be legally bound to
pay them for a moment the worthy
old man appeared to be stupefied
after he had collected himself and
wiped a few tears from his eyes he
stated that from the time he had heard
of our fathers death he had raked and
scraped and pinched and spared to
get the money together for the pay
ment of this debtaboiit ten days
ago said he ihad made up the sum
within twenty dollars my wife knew
how much the payment of this debt lay
on my spirits and advised me to sell a
cow and make up the difference and
get the heavy burthen off my spirits i
did soand now what will my old wo
man say i must get back to the cape
and tell her this good news shell
probably say over the very words she
said when she put her hand on my
shoulder as we partedl have never
seen the righteous man forsaken nor
his seed begging bread after a hearty
shake of the hand and a blessing upon
our old fathers memory he went upon
his way rejoicing
after a short silencetaking his
