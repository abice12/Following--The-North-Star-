argument
of charles sumner esq against the con
stitutionality of separate colored schools
in the case of sarah c roberts vs the
city of boston before the supreme court
of mass dec  
continued
vii the court will declare the by
law of the school committee of boston
making a discrimination of color among
children of the public schools to be
unconstitutional and illegal although
there are no express words of prohibi
tion in the constitution and laws
it is hardly necessary to say any
thing in support of this proposition
slavery was abolished in massachu
setts by virtue of the declaration of
rights in our constitution without any
specific words of abolition in that in
strument or in any subsequent legisla
tion commonwealth vs aves 
pick r  the same words
which are potent to destroy slavery
must be equally potent against any in
stitution founded on inequality or caste
the case of boston vs shaw met
calf  to which reference has been
alcady made where a bylaw of the
city was set aside as unequal and un
reasonable and therefore void affords
another example of the power which 
oow invoke the court to exercise
but authorities are not needed the
words of the constitution are plain
and it will be the duty of the court to
see that these are applied to the dis
crimination of color now in question
la doing this the court might justly
feel great delicacy if they were called
upon to revise a law of the legislature
but it is simply the action of a local
committee that they are to overrule
they may also be encouraged by the
fact that if is only to the schools of
boston that their decision can be appli
cable the other towns throughout
the commonwealth have already vol
untarily banished caste in removing
it from the schools of boston the court
will bring them into muchdesired har
mony with the schools of other towns
and with the whole system of public
schools in massachusetts  am un
willing to suppose that there can be any
hesitation or doubt tn coming to this
conclusion but if any should arise
there is a rule of interpretation which
may be our guide it is according to
familiar practice that every interpreta
tion is made always in favor of life or
liberty so here the court should in
cline in favor of equality that sacred
right which is the companion oi these
other rights in proportion to the im
portance of this right will the court be
solicitous to vindicate it and uphold it
and in proportion to ihe opposition
which it encountres from the predjudi
ces of society will the court brace
themselves iu this task it has been
pointedly remarked by rousseau that
it is precisely because the force
of things tends always to destoy
equality that the force of legislation
ought always to tend to maintain it
central social iiv  chap  in
similar spirit and for the same rea
son the court should always tend to
maintain it
there are other matters not strictly
belonging to the juridical aspect ol the
case ana yet of importance to its clear
comprehension upon which i shall
touch briefly bofore l close
it is sometimes said in extenuation
of the present system in boston that
the separation of the white aud black
children waa originally made at the re
quest of the colored parents this is
substantially true it appears from the
iatefeetiog letter ofdr belknap in re
ply to judge tuckers queries respect
ing slavery in massachusetts written
tithe dose of the last century  masi
hint jcall w  that at that tima n
rtght is of no sextruth is of no color
discrimination on account of color was
made in the public schools of boston
the same provision he says is
made by the public for the education
of the children of the blacks as for
those of the whites in this town the
committee who superintend tho free
schools have given in charge to the
schoolmasters to receive and instruct
black children as well as white dr
belknap adds however that he has
not hoard of more than three or four
who have taken advantage of this priv
ilege though the number of blacks in
boston prooably exceeded one thou
sand it is to he feared that the inhu
man bigotry of castesad relic of the
servitude from which they had just es
capedwas at this time too strong to
allow colored children a kindly wel
come in the free schools and that from
timidity and ignorance they shrank
from taking their places on the same
benches with the white children per
haps the prejudice against them was
so inveterate that they could not ven
ture to assert their rights it appears 
that in  a petition was presented
to the school committee from sixtysix
colored persons praying for the estab
lishment of a school for their benefit
private munificence came to the aid of
the city and the present system of sep
arate schools was brought into be
ing
these facts are interesting in the
history of the boston schools but they
cannot in any way affect the rights of
the colored people or the powers of the
committee these rights and these
powers stand on the constitution and
laws of the commonwealth without
adopting tho suggestion of jefferson
that one generation cannot by legisla
tion bind its successors all must agree
that the assent of a few persons nearly
a century agoat the time when their
rights were imperfectly understood
to an unconstitutional and illegal
course cannot alter the constitution
and the laws and bind their descend
ants forever in the thrall of caste
nor can the committee derive from
this assent or from any lapse of time
powers in derogation of the constitu
tion and of the rights of man
it is clear that the sentiments of the
colored people have now changed
the present case and the deep inter
est which they manifest in it thronging
the court to hang on this discussion
attest the change with increasing
knowledge they have learned to know
their rights and to eel the degradation
to which they have been doomed
their present effort is the token of
manly character which this court will
cherish and respect tb spirit ot
paul now revives in them even as
when he said i am a roman citi
zen
but it is said that these separate
schools are for the mutual benefit of
children of both colors and ofthe pub
lic schools in similar spirit slavery
is sometimes said to be for the mutual
benefit of master and slave and of the
country where it exists in one case
there is a mistake as great as ir the
ather this is clear nothing unjust
nothing ungenerous can be for the ben
efit of any person or anything short
sighted mortals may hope to draw from
some seeming selfish superiority or
from a gratified vanity of class a per
manent good but evenhanded justice
rebukes these efforts and with certain
power redresses the wrong the
whites thernselesjare injured by the
separation who can doubt this
with the law as their monitor they
are taught to regard a portion of the
human family children of god created
in his image coequal in his love as
a separate and degraded classthy
are taught practically to deny that
grand revelation of christianitythe
brotherhood ofmankind their hearts
while yet tender with childhood are
necessarily hardened by this conduct
and their subsequent lives perhaps
bear enduring testimony to this legali
zed uncharitablcness nursed in the
sentiment of caste receiving it with
the earliest food of knowledge they
are unable to eradicate it from their
natures and then weakly and impious
ly charge upon their heavenly father
the prejudice which they have derived
from an unchristian school and which
they continue to embody and perpetu
ate in their institutions their char
acters are debased and they become
less fit for the magnanimous duties of
a good citizen
the helots of sparta were obliged to
intoxicate themselves that they might
teach to the children of their masters
the deformity of intemperance in
thus sacrificing one class to the other
both were degradedthe imperious
spartan and the abased helot but
it is with a similar doubleedged injus
tice tout the school committee of bos
ton have acted in sacrificing the col
ored children to the prejudice or fanci
ed advantage of the while
it is fit that a child should be taught
to shun wickedness and as he is yet
plastic to receive impressions to shun
wicked men horace was right when
speaking of a person morally wrong
false and unjust he called him black
saying
hie niger wt buac ta ronunt cafto
the boston committee adopt the
warning but apply it not to those
black in heart but only black in skin
they forget the admonition addressei
i to the prophet but the lord said on
to samuel look not on hi countenance
for the lord seelh not as man seeth
for man looketh on the outward ap
pearance but the lord looketh at ik

who can say that this dew net io
jure the blacks theirs in its best
estate is an unhappy lot shut out by
a still lingering prejudice from many
social advantages a despised class
they feel this proscription from the
public schools as a peculiar brand
beyond this it deprives them of those
healthful animating influences which
would come from a participation in the
studies of their white brethren it
adds to their discouragements it wi
dens their separation from the rest of
the community and postpones that
great day of reconciliation which is sure
to come
the whole system of public schools
suffers also it is a narrow perception
of their high aim which teaches that
they are merely to furnish to all the
scholars an equal amount in knowledge
and that therefore provided all be
taught it is of little consequence where
and in what company it be done the
law contemplated not only that they
shall all be taught but that they shall
be taught all together tney are not
only to receive equal quantities ol
knowledge but all are to receive it in
the same way all are to approach
together the same common fountain
nor can there be any exclusive scource
for any individual or any class the
school is the little world in which the
child is trained for the larger world of
life it must therefore cherish and
develop the virtues and the sympathies
which are employed in the larger world
and since according to our institutions
all classes meet without distinction of
color in the perfonnrnce of civil duties
so should they all meet without dis
tinction of color in the school begin
ning there those relations of equality
which our constitution and laws prom
ise to all
as the state receives strength from
the unity and solidarity of its citizens
without distinction of class so tho
school receives new strength from the
unity and solidarity of all classes be
neath its root in this way the poor
the humble the neglected share not
only the companionship of their more
favored brethren but enjoy also the
protection of their presence in drawing
towards the school a more watchful su
perintendence a degraded or neg
lected class if left to themselves will
become more degraded or neglected
to him that hath shall be given and
the world true to these words turns
from the poor and outcast to the rich
and fortunate it is the aim of our
system of public schools by the blend
ing of all classes to draw upon the
whole school the attention which is too
apt to be given only to the favored few
and thus secure to the poor their por
tion of the fruitful sunshine but the
colored children placed apart by them
selves are deprived of this blessing
nothing is more clear than that the
welfare of classes as well as of indi
viduals is promoted by mutual ac
quaintance the french and english
or a long time regarded as natural en
emies have at list from amort inti
mats communion found themselves to
be natural friends prejudice is the
child of ignorance it is sure to pre
vail where people do not know each
other society and intercourse are
means established by providence for
human improvement they remove
antipathies promote mutual adaptation
and conciliation and establish relations
of reciprocal regard whoso sets up
barriers there thwarts the ways ol
providence crosses the tendencies of
human nature and directly interferes
with the laws of god
may it please your honors such
are some of the the things which it has
occured to me to say in this important
cause i have occupied much ol vour
time but i nave not yet exhausted the
topics still which way soever we
tt rn we are brought back to one sin
gle proposition the equality of men be
fore the laic this stands as the migh
ty guardian of the rights of the colored
children in this case it is the con
stant everpresent tutelary genius of
this commonwealth frowning upon ev
ery privilege of birth upon every dis
tinction of race upon every institution
ofscaste you cannot slight it or
avoid it you cannot restrain it it
remains that you should welcome it
do this and your words will be a
charter and freehold of rejoicing to
a race which has earned by much
suffering a title to much regard
your judgement will become a sacred
landmark not in jurisprudence only
but in the history of freedom giving
precious encouragement to alt the wea
ry and heavyladen wayfarers in this
great cause massachusetts will then
through you have a fresh title to re
gard and be once more as in times
past an example to the whole land
you have already banished slavery
from this commonwealth i call upon
you now to obliterate the last of its
footprints and to banish the lad
of the hateful spirits in its train thal
can be reached by this court the
law interfering to prohibit marriagei
between blacks and whites has beei
abolished by the legislature th
railroads which imitating the bostoi
schools placed colored people in i
ear by themselves have been compel
led under the influence of an awaden
ed public sentiment to abandon thi
regulation and to allow them to min
gle with other travellers it is only re
cently that i have read that his excel
lency the present govenor of msssa
chusetts food his seat in a car by th
side of a negro it is in the cast
schools of boston that the prejudice
t color has sought its final legal refugt
it is for you to drive it forth you
will when yon rebuke end correct is
rochester n y friday march  
dividual offences but it is a higher of
fice far to rebuke and correct a vicious
institution each individual is limited
in his influence but an institution has
the influence of numbers organized by
law the charity of one man may
counteract or remedy the uncharitable
ness of an established institution
against it private benevolence is pow
erless it is a monster which mast be
hunted down by the public and by it
constituted authorities arid sucvljg
the institution of caste m the rublfc
schools of boston w hich now awaits
its jnst condemnation from a just
court
the civilization of the age joins in
this appeal it is well known that this
prejudice of color is peculiar to our
country you have not forgotten that
two youth of african blood only recent
ly gained the highest honors inthe col
lege at paris and dined on the same
day with the king of france the des
cendant of st louis at the palace ol
the tuilleries and let me add if 
may refer to my own experience that
in paris i have sat for weeks at the
school of law on the same benches
with colored persons listening like
myself to the learned lectures of dt
grando and of rossithe last is ths
eminent minister who has unhappily
fallen beneath the dagger of a roman
assassin nor do i remember observing
in the throng of sensitive young men
by whom they were surrounded any
feeling towards them except of com
panionship and respect in italy at
the convent of pallazuola on the
shores of the alban lake and on the
site of the ancient alba longa i have
seen for several days a native ot
abyssinia only recently conducted
from his torrid home and ignorant of 
the language that was spoken about
him yet mingling with the franciscan
friars whose guest and scholar he was
in delightful and affectionate familial i
ty in these examples may be dis
cerned the christian spirit
and finally it is this spirit that 
invoke where this prevais there is
neither jew nor gentile greek nor
barbarian bond nor free but all are
alike it is from this that we derive
new and solemn assurance of the
equality of mankind as an ordinance
of god the bodies of men may be
unequal in beauty or strength these
mortal clouks of flesh inay differ as
do theg worldly garments theag inj
tellectual faculties may varyfc do
the opportunities of action and trie ad
vantages of position but amidst all
unessential differences there isanesj
sential agreement and equality dives
and lazarus were equal in the sight j
of god they must be equal in the
sight of all just institutions
but this is not all the vaunted
superiority of the white race imposes
upon it corresponding duties the
faculties with which they are endowed
and the advantages which they possess
are to be exercised for the good of all
if the colored people are ignorant de
graded and unhappy then should they
be the especial objects of your care l
from the abundance of your posses
sions you must seek to remedy their
lot and this court which is as a
parent to all the unfortunate children of
the commonwealth will show ftsclf
most truly parental when it reaches
down and with the strong arm of the
law elevates encourages and protects
its colored fellowcitizens

sir ln behalf of the massachusetts
antislavery society composed of the
friends of immediate and unconditional
emancipation the undersigned feel
morally bound to lay before you some
of the reasons why they cannot unite
in any puolic or private manifestatiojis
of pleasure at your presence in the
commonwealth
standing aloof as they do from
every political party in the land they
are not actuated by any partisan spirit
but by the strongest moral convictions
of duty they make no apology for
addressing you as none is needed in
so stronga case they do not wish or
design to give offence or to be lacking
in due respect on the contrary their
aim is to rouse y our conscience aud to
i soften your heart in order that you
i may feel irresistibly impelled to the
performance of an act demanded alike
i by the diotates of nature and the com
i inands of godnamely the liberation
of all your staves
you are the chief magistrate of a
i nation claiming to be free republican
christian the office ceases to de
serve respect when the people dese
crate it by the election of a tyrant to
fill it you do not owe your election
j to any virtues that adorn the human
s character to any merits that give
f lustre to human life to any deeds that
deserve human applauae for your
o victories in a wantonly aggressive war
upon nation equally impotent and
god is the father of us all and all men are brethren
unoffendinga war haring for its prime
object the extension and perpetuation
of human slavery by the conquest an
annexation of new territories foi
these and for nothing else were you
hurried from the camp into the presi
dential chair the real object of that
inglorious and iniquitous war you
knew too well to admit of the slightest
justification for your conduct you
have been the successful perpetrator of
robbery murder and other atrocities
on agigantic scale and your reward
haa been found in the votes and the
applauses of a people laden with ini
quitywhose hands are full of blood
whose hypocrisy and oppression sur
pass all that is recorded of the ancient
jews and who glory in their shame
but aside from your deep participa
tion in a war urifcirpassed for the enor
mity of its object you are holding in
slavery for your sole benefit and as
absolute property men women and
children created in the image of god
and born with an inalienable right to
liberty no language can describe
the cruelty and impiety of such an
act in all its legitimate consequences
where is your justification is it that
you gave a fair pecuniary equivalent
for your victims as marketable com
modities but you knew that they
could rightly belong to no human pos
sessor and that none but god could
truly say those souls are mine
you could not rationally doubt that he
created them like the rest of the hu
man race a little lower than the
angels and crowned them with glory
and honor in one sense only are any
of the humau family legitimately
bought with a price and then only
that they be not the servants of men
and that they may glorify god in their
bodies and spirits which are his which
they cannot do while held in a state of
beastly servitude in vain will you
try to shield yourself from condemna

of theft you are a manstealer
honored flattered caressed and e
toiled it is true but still a mansteal

have reaped down your fields which

ceasingly to heaven
it is said that you are an honest
man this cannot be true as you aie
daily plundering those whom you are
driving to unrequited toil under the
lash of brutal drivers it is said that
you are a brave man but a brave
man never yet struck down every bar
rier of womanly protection and gave
her over to pollution and stripes the
honesty that is current among a dis
honest peoplethe bravery that is ap
plauded by those who tread the weak
and helpless like ashes under their

that you are fatherly in your feelings
and affections if this were so you
could not steal from their cradles the
babes of slave mothers on your planta
tions nor sell those mothers at public
or private vendue it is said that you
are not inflated with pride or vanity
but what is that state of mind which
looks down upon human beings as
only fit to be registered with cattle and

they say
well what if they do it may not be
true a great many talse reports are
circulated and the reputation of a
gltod man may be sadly sullied by a
baseless rumor have you any reason
to better e that what they say concern

should you permit your name to be
included among the they who circu
late a scandal
they say who says is any
person responsible for the assertion
such phrases are frequently used to
conceal the point of a poignard who
thus meanly strikes one whom he dare
not openly assail are you helping
the cowardly attack if they means
nobody then regard the rumor as no
hing
they say why do they say so
is any good purpose secured by the
circulation of the report will it bene
fit the individual to have it known cr
will any interests of society be promo

jrou had better employ time and speech
to some more worthy purpose
they say to whom do they
lay it to those who have no busi
ness with the affair to those who
cannot help it or mend it or prevent
any unpleasant results that certainly
shows a tattling scandalloving spirit
that ought to be rebuked
they say well do they say it

we cheerfully yield our entire apace this
week to the publication of the very able and
manly apeech of gov seward we make
oo apology for pursuing this course being
sore that it would be impossible for us to
preaent our readers with anything more im
portant or interesting upon the great and all
absorbing question of the dsyr d
got sewards speech oh the slavery
question
delivered in the united states senate mar 
mr seward haying the floor rose and
said
mr president four years ago california
cateely inhabited and quite unexplored wa
unknown even to our usually immoderate de
sires except by a harbor capacious and tran
quit which only statesmen then foresaw
would be useful in the oriental commerce oi
a far distant if not merely chimerical future
a year ago california was merely a mill
tary dependency of ou own and we wen
celebrating with enthusiasm and unanimity
its acquisition with its newly discoveied bu
yet untold and untouched mineral wealth at
the most auspicious of many and unparaller
achievements
today california is a state more popu
lous than the least and richer than several o
the greatest of our thirty states the sami
california thus rich and populous is heri
asking admission into the union and finds u
debating the dissolution of the union itself
no wonder if we are perplexed with ever
changing embarrassments no wonder if w
are appalled by everincreasing responsib
lilies no wonder if we are bewildered b
the everaugmenting magnitude and rapidit
of national vicissitudes
shall california be received 
for myself upon my individual judgmei
and conscience i answer yes for mysel
as an instructed representatives of one of th
statesof that one even of the statei
which is soonest and longest to he presse
into commercial and political rivalry by th
new commonwealth  answer yes lt
california come in everv new state whe
ther she comes from the or from th
west coming from whatever part of the cor
tinent she may is always welcome bu
california that comes from the clime wher
the west dies away into the rising east
caiifornia which bounds at once the ernpii
and the continentcalifornia the youthfi
queen of the pacific in her robes of free
dom gorgeously inlaid with gold is doubl
welcome
and now i inquire first why shoul
california be rejected t all the objections ar
founded only in the circumstances of he
coming and in the organic law which sh
piesenls for our confirmation
first california comes unceremoniously
without a preliminary consent of congress
and therefore by usurpation this allega
tion i think is not quite trueat lea
not quite true in spirit california is nc
here of her own pure volition we tor
california violently from her place in th
confederation of mexican states flhd stipu
lated by the treaty of guadalupe hidalgi
that the territory should be admitted by state
into the american union as speedily as po
aible
but the letter of the objection still hold
california did come without a preliminar
eonsent by congress to form a constitution
but michigan and other states presente
themselves in the same unauthorized way
and congress waived the irregularity an
sanctioned the usurpation california plead
these precedents is not the plea sufficient
but it has been said by the honorabli
senator from south carolina mr calhou
that the ordinance of  secured to michi
gan the right to become a state when sh
should have sixty thousand inhabitants ow
jng to some neglect congress delayed to tak
the census and this is said in palliation o
the case of michigan but california a
has been seen had a treaty and congress
instead of giving previous consent and in
stead of giving her the accustomed territoria
government as they did to michigan failei
to do either an thus practically refused both
and so abandoned the new community unde
most unpropitious circumstances to anarchy
california then made a constitution for her
self but not unnecessarily and presumptuous
ly as michigan did she made a constitu
tton for herself and came here under the lav
the paramount law of selfpreservation
thiok she stands justified
indeed california is more than justified
she was a colony a military colony a 
colonies especially military colonies are in
congruous with our political system and the
are equally open to corruption and exposer
to oppression they are therefore not more
unfortunate iu their own proper condition
than fruitful in dangers to the parent demo
cracy california then acted well and
wisely in establishing selfgovernment she
deserves not rebuke but praise and approba
tion
nor does this objection come with good
grace from those who offer it if california
were now content to receive only a territoria
charter we could not agree to grant it with
out an inhibition of slavery which in that
case being a federal act of federal authority
would render the attitude of california as a
territory even more offensive to those whe
bow repel her than she is as a state with
the same inhibition in the constitution of hei
own voluntary choice
the second objection is that california has
assigned her own boundaries without the
previous authority of congress but she
was left to organize heiaelf without any
boundaries fixed by previous law or by pre
scription she was obliged tbeiefore tc
assume boundaries since without boundaries
ahe must have remained unorganized
a third objection is that california is too
large  answer first there is no common
standard of the size of states california
though greater than many is less than one
of the states second califordta if too
large may be divided with her own consent
and that is all the security we have fur re
ducing the magnitude and averting the pre
ponderance of texas thirdly the bound
aries of california seem not at all unnatural
the territory circumscribed is altogether con
tiguous and compact fourth the bound
aries are convenient they embrace only
inhibited portions of the country connected
with the port of san francisco no one has
pretended to offer boundaries more in hai
moy with the physical outlines of the re
gioo concerned or more convenient for civil
admission
but to dw closer to the question what
shall bo the boandaritw of s new state con
cerns first the slate herself and california
of course is content seeoodly adjacent
potmnumues oregon does not complain of
sod there is no o her adjacent
ootmuuu t cma plin thirdly the other
states in die p n th larger the pmcc
states the smaii r wiu relative
power in the senate r states now
mrs are atlantic states ana sttu
and aurelv they may wall indulge california
in the largest liberty of boundaries
thefouith objection to the admission of
california is that no previous census had
been taken and no laws prescribing the qua
lification of suffrage and the apporuontnen
of representatives in convention existed
i answer california was left to act ah tmtio
she must begin sometime without s census
and without such laws ths pilgrim fa
thers began in the same way on board the
mayflower and since it ia objected that some
of the electors of california may have been
aliens i add that all the pilgrim fatheta
were aliens and strangers to the common
wealth of plymouth
again the objection may well be received
if the constitution of california is satisfac
toryfirst to herself and secondly to the
united slates as regards the first of these
not a murmur of discontent baa followed
california to this pbce and as to ourselves
we confine our inquiries about the constitu
tion with a view to four things first the
boundaries assumed and i have considered
that point in this case already second
that the domain in this state ia secured
to ua and it ia admitted that this has
been doneproperly done third that the
constitution should be republican and not
aristocratic or monarchical in this case the
only objection is that the constitution inas
much as it inhibits slavery is altogether too
republican fourth that the representation
claimed shall be just and equal no one i
denies that the population of california is
sufficient to demaod two representatives on
the federal basis and secondly a new
census is at hand and the error if there be
one will be immediately corrected
the fifth objection ia that california comes
under executive influences first in her
coming as a free state and second in her
coming at all the first charge rests on sus
picion onlyis peremptorily denied and the
denial is not controverted by proofs  dis
miss it altogether the second is true to the
extent that the present president advised the
people of california that having been left
without any civil government under the mil
itary government of the executive without
any authority of law whatever the adoption
of a constitution subject to the approval of
congress would be regarded favoiably by
the president
only ft year ago it was complained that
the exercise of the militsry power to main
tain law and order in california was a feaiful
innovation but now the wind has changed
and blows even stronger from the opposite
quarter may this republic never have a
president commit a more serious or more dan
gerous usurpation of power than the act ol
the present eminent chief magistrate in en
deavoring to induce the legislative authorities
to relieve him from the exercise of military
power by establishing civil instituuons regu
lated by law in distant provinces rome
would have been standing this day if she had
had such generals and such magistrates
but the objection whether true in part or
even in the whole is immaterial the ques
tion is not what moved california to impress
any particular feature on her constitution
nor even what induced her to adopt a consti
tution at all but it is whether since she has
adopted a constitution she shall be admit
ted into the union
i have now reviewed all the objections
raised against the admission of california ii
is seen that they have no foundation in law
of nature and of nations nor are they found
in the constitution for it prescribes no four
or manner of ptoceeding in the admission ol
new stales but leaves the whole to the dis
cretion of congress congress may admit
new states the objections are all merel
formal and technical they rest on precedent
which have not always nor even generallj
been observed
but it is said that we ought now to estab
lish a safe precedent for the future i anewei
it is too late to beize this occasion for tha
purpose the irregularity complained of being
unfavorable the caution should have beer
exercised first when texas was annexed
second when we waged war against mexico
third when we ratified the treaty of gauda
lupe hidalgo again we may establish pie
cedents at pleasure our successors will ex
ercise their pleasure about lollowing them
just as we have done in such caves third
states nations and empires are apt to be pe
culiarly capricious nut only as to the time
but even as to the manner of their being bou
and as to their subsequent political changes
they are not accustomed to conform to pre
cedents california sprung from the bead o
the nation not only complete in proportion
and fully armed but ripe for affiliation with m
members
i proceed now to state my reasons for the
opinion that california ought to be admitted
the population of the united states consisti
of natives of caucasian origin and exotics ol
the same derivation the native mass rap
idly assimilates to itself and absorbs the exo
tic and those therefore constitute one homo
genous people the african race bond and
free and the aborigines savage and civili
zed being incapable of such assimiliation
and absorption remain distinct and owing to
their peculiar condition constitute inferior
masses and may be regarded as accidental
if not disturbing political forces
the ruling homogenous family was planted
at first on the atlantic shore and following
an obvious law it seems continually and rap
idly spreading itself westward year by year
subduing the wildernesses and the prairie
and thus extending this gieat political com
munity which as fast as it advances breaks
into distinct states for municipal purposes
only while the whole constitutes one entire
compact nation
well established rules of political arithme
tic enable us to say that the aggregate popu
lation of the nation now is  millions that
 yeais hence it wili be  millions  years
hence  millions  years hence  millions
 years hence  millions  years hence
 millions and  years hence  millions
but the advance of population on the pacific
will far exceed what occurred on the atlantic
coast while emigration even here is out
stripping the calculation on which these eati
tidies are based there are silver and gold
in the mountains and ravines of california
the granite of new eugland is barren
allowing due consideration to the increas
ing density of the population we are safe in
assuming that long before this mass shall
havv attained the maximum of numbers indi
cated the entire width of our potsessionfrom
the atlantic to the pacific ocean will be
covered by it and be brought into social matu
rity and complete political organization
the question now arises shall this one
great people have common origin s com
mon language a common religion common
sentiment interests sympathies snd hopes
remaining one political state one nation
one republic or shall it be broken in two
conflicting snd probably hostile nations or
republics there cannot ultimately be
more than two for the habit of association is
already formed as the interests of mutual in
tercourse are forming and the centtal portions
if they cannot command aoceas to both oceans
will not be obstructed in their approach to
that one which offers the greatest facilities to
their commerce
shall the american people then be divided
before deciding on this question let us con
sider our position our powsr and capabilities
the world contains no seat of empire so
magnificent as this which while it embraces
all the varying climates of the temperate
zone and w traversed by wide expanding
lakes and long branching rivete offers sup
plies on the atlantic ahore to the overcrowd
ed nations of europe while on the pacific
coast it intersects the commerce of the indies
the nation thus situated and enjoying cr
ests mineral and agricultural tecources ms
equalled if they are endowed also with mor
al energies adequate to the achievement of
tr teat enter prises sod favored with ago veto

must command jr r
which slime ii nal empire j
we may claim to have inherited physical and
intellectaa vigor courage invention and en
terprise and the systems of edoeation pre
vailing among us open to all the mores of hu
man science and art
the old world and the past were allotted
by providence to the pupilage of mankind so
rter the violence of human passion the
new world and the future seems to have
been appointed for the maturity of mankind
with the develepment of self government
opening to reason and judgement we have
tried our mortal systems of democratic fede
ral government with its complex yet harmo
nious and effective combinations of distinct lo
cal elective agencies lor the conduct of do
mestic affairs and its common central elec
tive agencies for the regulation of internal in
terest and of intercourse with foreign na
trons and we know that it is a system equal
ly cohesive in its parts and capable of all de
siring expansion and that it it is a system
moreover perfectly adapted to secure domes
tic tranquility while it brings into action all
the elements of national aggrandizement
the atlantic states through their com
mercial social and political affinities and
sympathies are steadily renovating the
governments and the social constitutions of
europe and of africa the pacific states
must necessarily perform the same sublime
and beneficent functions in asia if then
the american people shall remain one indivi
dual nation the ripening civilization of the
west after a separation growing wider fur
 years will in its circuit of the world
meet again and mingle with the declining
civilization of the east on our free soil and
a new and more perfect civilization will arise
to bless the earth under the sway of our owd
cherished and beneficent democratic institu
tions we may then reasonably hope for
greatness felicity and renown excelling
any hitherto attained bv any nation if stand
ing firmly on the continent we loose not our
grasp on the shore of either ocean whe
ther a destiny so magnificent would be only
partially defeated or whether it would be al
together lost by a relaxation of that grasp it
passes our wisdom to determinate and hap
pily is not important to be determined it is
enough if we agree that expectations so
grand yet so reasonable and so just ought
not to be in any degree disappointed
and now it seems to me that the perpetu
al unity of our empire hangs on the decision
of this dav and of this hour california is
already a statea complete and fully ap
pointed stateshe never again can be less
than that she can never again be a pro
vince or a colony nor can she be made to
shrink and shrive into the proportions of a
f federal dependent territory california then
henceforth and forever must be what she it
nowa state the question whether sh
shall be one of the united states of america
has depended on her and on us her elec
tion has been madeour consent alone re
mains suspended and that consent must be
pronounced now or never i aay now or nev
er nothing prevents it now but want ol
agreement among ourselves our harmony
cannot inciease while this question remain
open we shall never agree to admit cali
fornia unless we agree now
nor will california abide delay i do not
say that she contemplates independence but
she does not anticipate rejection do yoti
say that she can have no motive consider
then her attitude if rejected she needs i
capital a legislature and magistrates eh
needs titles to that golden domain of oun
within her borders good titles too and yoc
must give them on your own terms or sh
must take them without vour leave sh
needs a mint a custom house wharves
hospitals and institutions of learning
she needs fortificationsroads and railroads
she needs the protection of an army and i
navy eithci your stars and stripes niusi
wave over her ports and her fleets or slu
must raise aloft a standard for herself sh
needs at least to know whether you ar
fiiends or enemies and anally she needi
what no ameiican community can live with
out sovereignty and independenceeither i
just and equal share of yours or
and independence of her own
will you say that california could not ag
grandize herself by separation would i
then be a mean ambition tb set up within fifty
years on the pacific coast monuments liki
those which we think  years have beei
well spent in establishing on the atlantii
i coast will you say that california has nt
ability to become independent she has thi
same moral ability for enterprise that inherei
in us and that ability implies command of at
i physicel means she has advantages ofpo
i sitton she is practically further removed fron
you than england you cannot reach he
by railioad or by unbroken steamboat naviga
tion you can send no armies over the prai
rie the mountain and the desert nor acroei
the remote and narrow isthmus without t
foreign jurisdiction nor around the cape o
storms you may send a navy there bu
she has ooly to open her mines and she car
reduce your marine and appropriate youi
floating bulwarks to her own defence le
her only seize your domain within her bor
ders and your commerce in her port and sh
will have at once revenue and credit ade
qaate to all her necessities beside are wt
so moderate and has the world become so jus
that we have no rivals and no enemies to len
their sympathies and aid to compass the dis
memberment of our empire try not tht
temper or the fidelity of california at leas
not now not yet cherish her and indulg
her till you have extended your settlement
to her borders aud bound her fast by railroads
canals and telegraphs to your interests unti
her affinities of intercourse are established anc
habits of loyalty are fixed and then she cat
never be disengaged
california would not go alone oregon s
intimately allied to her and as yet so loose
attached to us will go also and then ai
least the entire pacific coast with the wea
tern declivity of the sierra nevada would be
lost it would not depend at all on us not
even on tbe mere forbearance of california
how far eastward the long line across the
temperate zone should be drawn which should
separate the republic of the pacific from the
republic of tho atlantic terminus haa
passed awsy with all the deities of the anci
ent pantheon but hie scepter remains
commerce is the god of boundaries and nc
man now living can foretell his ultimata de
cree
but it is insisted that the admission ol
california shall be attended by a compro
mise of questions which have arisen out ol
slavery i am opposed to any such com
promise in any and all the forms in which it
has been proposed first because while
admitting the purity and the patroitism of all
from whom it it is my misfortune to differ i
think all legislative compromises essentially
and radically wrong and indefensible they
involve the surrender of the exercise of judge
ment and conscience on distinct and separate
questions at distinct and separate times with
the indispensable advantages it affords foi
ascertaining truth they involve a relin
quishment of tbe tight to reconsider in fu
ture the decisions of the present on question
prematurely antioipated and they are an us
urpation as to future questions of the pro
vince of future legislators
sir it seems to me as if slavery had laid
its paralysing hand upon myself tnl the
blood were coursing leas fteely than it wonl
through my veins when i endeavor to sup
pose that such a compromise has been effect
ed and my utterance forever is arrested upon
l the great questions social moral and po
litical arising oat of a subject so important
and as yet so incomprehensible what am 
to receive in this compromise freedom in
california it is well it is e noble acquisi
tion but what am i to give up as on equiva
lent a recognition of the claim to perpetu
ate slavery tn the district of colombia for
bearance toward more stringent laws con
cerning the arrest of persons suspected of be
ing slaves found in tbe free stales for
ueaanoe from the provjeo of freedom in the
chtneis of new tm foot of the
pun of compromise ofierod demand less than
two and most of them insist on ail of these
conditions the equivalent then is some
portion of liberty some portion of homan
rights io one region for liberty in another
region bot california brings gold and com
merce as well as freedom i am then io sur
render some portion of human freedom in the
district of colombia in east california and
new mexico for the mixed consideration of
liberty gold and power of the pacific coast
this view of legislative compromises is
not new it has widely prevailed and many
of the state constitution interdict the intro
duction of more than one subject into one bill
submitted for legislative action
sirlt was of such compromises that burke
said in one of the loftiest bursts of even hiß
majestic psrlimentary eloquence
far fat from the commons of great
britain be all manner or real vice but ten
thousand timet further from them as far as
from pole to pole be the whole tribe of apu
rious affected counterfeit and hypocritical
virtues these are the things which are ten
thousand times mote at war with real duty
than any vice known by its name and distin
guished by ita proper character
far far from ua be that false and affectad
candor that is eternally in treaty with crime
that half virtue which like the ambiguous
animal that plays about in the twilight of a
compromise between day and night is to a
just mans eye an odious and disgusting
thing there is no middle point my lords
in which the commons of great biitain can
meet tyranny and oppression
but sir could  overcome my repugnance
to compromise in general i should object to
this on the ground of the inequality and in
congruity of the interests lo be compromised
why sir according to the views i have sub
mitted california ought to come in and must
come in whether slavery stands or falls in
the district of columbiawhether slavety
stands or falls in new mexico and eastern
californiaand even whether slavery stands
oi falls in the slave statescalifornia ought
to come in and must come in at all events
it is an independent question what then
are these questions arising out of slavery
thus interposedbut collateral questions they
are unnecessary and incongruous and there
fore false issues not introduced designedly
indeed to defend that great policy yet una
voidably tending to the end
jfc but consent on my part to the compromise
would be disingenuous and fraudulent it ii
now avowed b the hon senator from south
catolina mr calhoun that nothing will
satisfy the slave states but a compromise
that will convince them that they can remain
in the union consistently with their honoi
and safety and what arc the concession
which will have the effect here they are in
the words of the senator
thenorth must do justice by concding
to the south an equal right in the acquired
territory and do her duty by causing the
stipulations relative to fugitive slaves to b
faithfully fulfilled cease the agitation of the
slave question and provide for the insertion
of a provision in the constitution by an a
mendment which will restore to the south
in substance the power she possessed of pro
tecting herself before the equilibrium betweer
the sections was destroyed by the action o
this government
these terms amount to thisthat the fret
states having already a majority of popula
tion aid majorities in both houses of con
gress shall concede to the stave states be
mg in a minority in both the unequal advan
lage of as equalitythat is we shall altei
the constitution so as to convert the govern
ment from a national democracy controller
bv a cnnstnutional majority of voices into i
federal alliance in which the minority shal
have a veto against the majority and thus t
return to tha original articles of confedera
tion
i will not stop to protest against the injus
lice and inexpediency of an innovation which
if it were practicable would be so entire
subversive of the principle of democratic in
stitqtions it is enough to say that it is to
tally inpracticable the free states north
ern and western have acquiesced io the huq
and nearly unbroken ascendancy of the slavi
states under the constitution but the
have honor and interests to preserve am
there is nothing in the nature or in the char
acier of the people to induce an expectaior
that they loyal as they are are insensible u
he duty of defending them
but the scheme would still be impractic
able if even this di ficulty were overcome
what is proposed is a political equilibrium
every political equilibrum requires a physica
eqailibrum to rest upon and is valuelesi
without it to constitute a physical equil
ibrim between the slave states and the fret
states required firstan equality of temtoryjoi
some near approximation and thia is alread
i lost but it requires much more than this
it requires an equality in the number ofslave
and freemen and this must be perpetual
but the census of  gives a slave basis
ot only two millions and a half and a free
basis of fourteen millions and a half the
population on the slave basis increases in the
ratio of  per cent for ten years while that
on the free basis advances at the rate of 
per cent the accelerating movement of the
free population now complained of will occu
i py the new territory with pioneers and
i every day increase the difficulty of forcing
and insinuating slavery into regions which
freeman have pieoccupied and if this
were possible the african slave trade ia
prohibited and the domestic increase ia not
sufficient to supply the new slave states
which are expected to maintain the equil
ibrunrr
the theory of a new political equilibrium
claima that it once existed and has been lost
when lost and how it began to be lost in
 when preliminary arrangements were
made to admit five new states in the north
west territory two years before the consti
tion was finally adoptedthat is it began
to be lost two years before it began to exist
sib the equilibrium if restored would be
lost more rapidly than it was before the
progress of the free population ia to be acceler
ated by emigration from europe and asia
while that of the slaves is to be cheeked and
retarded by inevitable partial emancipation
nothing says montesquieu reduces a man
so low as alwsys to see freemen and yet
uot be free persons in that condition are na
tural enemies of the state and their num
bers would be dangerous if increased too high
sir the fugitive alsve colonies in the free
state in canada and liberia are the beat
guarantees south corolina has for the perpe
tuity o slavery
nor would success attend any of the details
of the compromise and first i advert to
the amendment of the law concerning fugitives
from service or labor the constitution con
tains only a compact which rests tor its exe
cution on the statunot content wiih this
the slave states induced legislation by coo
sress and the supreme court of the united
tales have virtually decided that the whole
subject ia within the provinee of congress
and exclusive of state authority nay they
have decided that slave are to be regarded
not merely as persons to be claimed but ss
property and chattels to be seized without any
legal authority or claim whatever
the compact ia thus subverted by the pro
curement of the slave states with what rea
son then can they expect the states ex gra
tia to reasaume the obligation from which
they caused those statu to be diaehaiged
i say then to the slave statu you are en
titled to no more stringent law sod such a
dm would be useless the cause of the in
sufficiency of the present statute is not at all
the leniency of its provisions it i a law
that deprives the alleged refugee from a legal
obligation pot assumed by him but imposed
upon him by law enacted before he was born
of the writ of habtas corpus and of any certain
judical process of examination of he claim
ret up by his pursuerand finally degrades him
into a chat tie which may be seixed and ear
ned away peaceably wherever found eveo

sible the escape of i bondman
we deem its principle therefore unjust un
constitutional and immoral and thua white
patriotism wit bolds ita approbation the con
sciences of our people condemn it you will
roy that these convictions of ours are disloyal
grant it for arguments sake they are sev
en be ess honest and the law is to be exe

convictions of its subjects by force but these
convictions imply no disloyalty we revere

fugitives from justice is not admitted by the
law of nature and of nations but rests on
voluntary compact
only two conjlpßs found in diplomatic his
tory admitted emmition of slaves here ia
one of them it is found in a treaty made
between alexander comnenus the greek
emperor at constantinople and oleg 
king of russia in the year  and ia in
these words
if a russian slave take flight from his
master or if he shall be held under pretence
of having beet bought hia master may pur
sue him and take him wheresoever be may be
found and whosoever shall prevent his mas
ter from taking him shall be guilty of offend
ing this treaty and shall be punished ac
cordingly
this was in the year of grace  in what
is called the dark ages and the contracting
powers were despotisms
and here is the other
no person held to service or labor in one
state under the laws thereof escaping into
another shall in consequence ot any laws or
regulations therein be discharged from such
service or labor but shall be delivered up on
claim of the party to whom such service or
labor is due
this is from the constitution of the united
states in  and the parties were the re
publican states of this union
the law of nations disavows such com
pacts the law of nations written on the
hearts and consciences of freemen repudiates
them armed powers conld not enforce them
because there is no public conscience to sus
tain them i know that there are laws of va
rious sorts that regulate the conduct of men
there are constitutions and statutes laws
mercantile and codes civil but when we are
legislating for states especially when we are
forming stales all these laws must be brot
to the standard of the laws of god and must
be tried by that standard and stand or fall by
it it is of this principle that an eminent po
litical philosopher of england burke said
there is but one law for all namely
that law which governs allthe law of our
creatorthe law of humanity justice equi
ty the law of nature and of nations so
far as any laws tortify this primeval law and
give it more precision more energy more ef
fect by then declarations such laws enter in
to the sanctuary and participate in the sacred
ness of its character but the man who
quotes as precedents the abuses of tyrants
and robbers pollutes the very fountains of
justice destroys the foundations of all law
and therefore removes the only safeguard
against evil men whether governors or gov
erned the guard which prevents governors
from becoming tyrants and the governed
from becoming rebels
there was deep philosophy in the confes
sion of an eminent english judge when he
had condemned a young woman to death un
der the late sanguinary code of his country
for her first petty theft she fell dead at his
feet i seem to myself said he to have
been pronouncing sentence not against the
prisoner but against the law itself
to conclude on this point we are not
slaveholders we cannot in our judgment
be either true christians or real freemen il
we impose on another a chain that we deny
all human power to fasten on ourselves you
believe and think otherwise and doubtless
with equal sincerity we judge you not and
he alone who ordained the conscience of man
and its laws of action can judge us do we
then in this conflict demand of you an unrea
sonable thing in asking that since you will
have property that can and will exercise hu
man power to make ita escape you shall be
your own police and that acting among ue
as such you shall conform to principles in
dispensable to the security of admitted rights
of freemen
another feature in moat of the plans of
compromise is a bill of peace for slavery
in the district of columbia and this bill of
peace we cannot grant we of the free
states are equally with you of the slave
states responsible for the existence of sla
very in tliis districtthe field exclusively of
our common legislation i regret that as yet
i see but little reason to hope that a majority
in favor of emancipation exists here the
legislature of new yorkfrom whom with
great deference i dissentseems willing to
accept now the extinction of the slave trade
and waive emancipation
but we shall assume the whole responsi
bility if we stipulate not to exercise the pow
er heieafter when s majority shall be obtain
ed not will the plea with which you fur
nish us be of any avail if i could under
stand myself  should never be able to ex
plain to the direct understanding of the peo
ple whom i represent how it was that an
absolute and express power to legislate in all
cases over the district of columbia was em
barrassed and defeated by an implied condi
tion not to legislate for the abolition of slave
ry in that district sir i shall vote for that
measure and am willing to appropriate any
means to cany it into execution and if i
shall he aked what i did to embellish the
capitol of my country i will point to her
freedtnen and say these are the monu
ments of my munificence if i was willing
to advance a cause that i deemed sacred by
disingenuous means i would advise you to
adopt these measures of compromise which i
have thus examined the echo is not quick
er in its response than would be that loud and
universal cry of repeal that would not die
away until the habeas corpus was secured to
the alleged fugitive from bondage and the
symmetry of the free institutions of the
capitol was perfected
i apply the same observations to the propo
sition for i waiver of the proviso of freedom
in territotial charters thus far you have
only direct popular action in favor of that
ordinance and there seems even to be a par
tial disposition to await the action of the
people of the new territories as we have
compulsorily waited for it in california but
i must tell you nevertheless in all candor
and in plainness that the spirit of the people
in the free slates ia set upon a spring that
rises with the pressure put upon it that
spring if pressed too hard will give a recoil
that will not leave here one servant who knew
hia masters will and did it not you will say
that this implies violence not at allit im
plies only peaceful lawful constitutional cus
tomary action i cannot too strongly express
toy surprise that those who insist that the
people of the sieve states oanaot be held
back from remedies outside of lije constitu
tion should so far misunderstand us of the
free states as to suppose we would not ex
ercise our constitutions rights to sustain the
policy which we deem just and beneficent
i object ia the next place le ike compro
mise of the boundary between texas and
new mexico ttutt it a judicial question in
ita nature or at team a question of legal right
and title if it is to be compromised at all
it due to the two panics to national digni
ty as well as to justice that it be kept sepa
rate from compromises proceeding on the
vv
ground of expediency and bo nuld by it
elf alone
i take ihia occasion to aa that  do not in
toad to disease the question which hu been
raiaed by the honorable and distinguished
senator from mace mr webeter but i
am compelled to say that i have not the good
fortune to concur with him in the opinions
which he baa expressed in regard to the ad
mimion of new states to be formed out of the
slate of texas there are various qseat ions
involved in that subject which i think this is
not the time to decide and which i wiah to
reserve for future consideration one is
whether the article of annexation does really
deprive congress of the right to express its
voice in regard to the subdivision of the state
of texas  only say that to me it seems by
no means so plain a question as the senator
assumes and therefore wiih me it lemams a
question for future considerationan open
qosslion whether congress is not a party
whose future nceessary to any di
vision of texas
mr websterwill the senator allow me
to ask him one question
mr sewardcertainly air
mr webstersupposing congress to have
the authority to fix the number of states and
the time of election and apportionment ol
representation die the question is whether
if new states are formed out of texas to
come into this union there is not a solemn
pledge by law that they have a right to come
in as slave states
mr sewardthe article ia in effect in
i these words new states not exceeding fout
in number may be framed out of the territory
of texas with the consent of texas and
shall be admitted into the union t with or with
out slavery if they shall choose
mr webster if they chooso they may
come in as slave states
mr sewardl beg pardon of the hon
senator but it is with or without slavery
but  pass the question as the volume is not
at hand and i fear i shall trespass on the
lime of the senate by waiting for it  am
moreover not unconstitutional i find no au
thority in the constitution of the u slates
for the annexation of foteign states by reso
lution what i mean now especially to in
sist upon is that  must have time to delibe
rate until the occasion actually anives before
i consent to any division ot the state of tex
as so as to bring in any new state with a con
stitution maintaining slavery  must have
the point settled that the aiticle of annexa
tion is compulsory upon me and also that it
is constitutional
mr footedid i not rightly understand
the senator to say that he would have voted
to admit california as a slave stave if she
had voluntarily inserted such a provision in
her constitution
mr sewardyes sir under these extra
ordinary circumstances of conquest of a com
pact of abandonment of impossibility to give
a territorial government of a constitution
adopted by the people and of dismemberment
of the empire if she was rejectedunder
these circumstances i would have received
california though she had come to my pro
found regret as a slave slate lam happy
now mr president to understand that 
agree with the hon member from massachu
i setts that it is not compulsory upon cong tess
hereafter to admit four new slave states in
texssthat they have reserved the right to
decide whether any new state shall be form
ed there  shall vote for admitting no more
i slave states unless under circumstances ab
i solutely controlling and compulsory and such
f cannot now be foreseen
mr websterthe senator does not un
i demand me my proposition was that states
hereafter made out of texas with her con
i sent if they choose to come in slave states
i have a right to do so
mr seward my position is that they have
not a right to cotne in if congress shall re
i fuse its consent it is optional with both par
ties congress and texas
mr w ebalerdoes the senator hold that
i we may hereafter decide whether they shall
be slave states or free slates
mr sewardno sit but that congress
may decide that there shall be no slates at ill
formed out of texas
t another objection arises out of the princi
f pie on which the compromise rests that
principle is a classification of the stales as
i northern and southern stales as is express
i ed by the hon senator from south carolina
i mr calhoun but into slave states and free
i stales as more directly expressed by the hon
orable senator from georgia mr berrien
the argument is that the states are several
i ly equal and that these two classes were
equal at the first and that the constitution
i was founded on that equilibrium that the
states being equal and the classes of the
states being equal in rights they are to kb
i regarded as constituting an association in
which each state and each of the classes of
states respectively contribute in due propor
tion tbit the new territories are a common
acquisition and that the people of these sev
eral states and classes of states have an
i equal right to participate in respectively
hat the right of the people of the slave
slates to emigrate to the territories with
their slaves as property is such a participa
tion in their part inasmuch as the people of
the free states emigrate into the same terri
tories with their property and the argu
ment deduces from this right the principle
that if congress exclude slavery from any
part of this new domain it would be only just
to set off a portion of the domain some say
south of   and others south of  which
should be regarded at leaat aa open to slavery
and to be organized into alave states
argument ingenious and subtle declama
tion earnest and bold and persuasive gen
tle and winning as the voiee of the tut tie
dove when it is heard in the land all aitke
and all together have failed to convince me
of the soundness of this principle of the pro
posed compromise or of any one of the pro
positions ou which it is attempted to be es
tablished how is the original equality of
the states proved it testa on a syllogism
as follows
ah men are equal by the law of nature
and of nations but states are only lawful
aggregationa of individual men who individu
ally are equal therefore states are equal
in natural rights
all this is just and sound but assuming
the same premises to wit that all men are
equal by the law of nature and of nations
the right of property in slaves falls to the
ground for one who is equal to another can
not be the owner df property in that other
but you answer that the constitution recog
nizes property in slaves it would be suffi
cient then to reply that this constitutional
recognition must be void because it is re
pugnant to the law of nature and of nations
but i deny that the constitution recognizes
property in man i submit on the other
baud most respectfully that the constitution
not merely does not affirm that principle but
on the contrary altogether excludes it the
constitution does not expressly affirm any
thing on the subject all that it contains is
two incidental allusions to slaves these
are first in the provision establishing a ratio
of representation and taxation second in the
provision relating to fugitives from labor in
both cases the constitution designedly men
tions slaves not as slaves much less as chat
ties but as persons that this recognition
of them as persons was designed is histori
cally known and i think never denied
give only two of the manifold proofs
john jay in the federalist aayn
lei the case of the slaves be considered
as it is in truth a peculiar one let the
sempiomising expedient ot the constitution
be mutually adopted which regards them as
nhabiiantty but aa debased below the equal
evai of free inhabitantsrwhtefa regard the
ilaves as divested of twofiflbs of the mao
ye sir of tofifth but of onlj two
aug  mr butlsr nd mr
pinckney moved to require fugitive slave
tod servants to be delivered up like convict
mr wilaoothis would oblige the
eutive of the stole to do it at public expense
mr sherman saw no more property in the
public seising end surrendering a or a
servant than s horse
mr butler withdrew hie proposition in
order that aome particular pro ision might be
made apart from this article
aug thmr butler moved to invert
alter article is if any petson bound to
seivtce or labor in any oi tne united stolen
aha escape into another stole h sf ahe
shall not be diachergad from saeh service or
labor in of any legoktion sub
sisting in the state to vthich they eeeape
but shall be delivered up to the person justly
claiming their service or labor
after the engrossment sept  article
tv sec  the d paragraph the isrm
legally was struck out and the words un
der the laws thereof inserted after the word
states m compliance with toe wishce of
eoino wbodhought the term legal equivocal
and favoring the idea that slavery was legal
m a moral view
 deem it established then that the consti
tution does not tecognixe property in mao
but leaves that question as between the states
to the law of nature and of nations that
law as expounded by vauel is founded in the
reason of things when god had created
the earth with its wonderful adaptatieos ho
gave dominion over it to manabsolute hu
man dominion the title thus bestowed
would have been incomplete if the lord of all
lenestrial things could hfinsalf have been the
property of his fellow lisa the right to
nave a slave unphea the right in some one to
make the slave that right must be eqoal
and mutual and that would resolve society
into a state of perpetual war but if we
grant the original equality of the states sad
grant also the constimtional recognition of
slaves as property atm the argument we are
considering fails because the states were not
parties to the constitution as states it is the
constitution of the people of the united
btatee but even if the states continued as
states they surrendered their equality as
states and submitted themselves to the away
of ibe numerical majority with qualities lions
or checks first of the representation of stbs
of slaves in the ratio of representation and
taxation and secondly of the equal repre
sentation of slates in the senate
the proposition of an established classifi
cation of states as slave slates and free
stales as asserted by aome and into north
ern and southern as asserted by others
seems to me purely imaginary and of course
the supposed equilibria of those classes a
mere conceit this must be so because
when the constitution was adopted twelve of
the thuteen states were slave states and so
theie was no equtltbrim and so as to the
classification ot states at northern states
and southern stales it is the maintenance
ot slavery by law in a state not parold of
latitude that makes it a southern stale and
the absence of this that makes it a northern
state and so ail the states save one
were southern states and there was no equi
librium but the conlitutioo was made not
only for southern and northern states but
for staves neither one nor the other but
western states their coming in was f or
seen and provided for
it needs little argument to show that uta
idea of a joint stock association or a copart
nership as applicable even by its analogies to
the united states is err neojs with all the
consequence fancifully utuced from it the
united states are a fical slate or organ
zed society whose end is government for
the secuiity welfare and happiness of all
who live under its protection the iheoiy i
am combating reduces the objects of govern
ment to the mere spoils of conquest on the
contrary ot a theory so debasing the pream
ble of the constitution not only asserts the
sovereignty to he not iu the slates but in the
people but also promulgates the objects of
the constitution
we people of the united stale in ordsr
to form a more perfect union establish justice
ensure domestic tranquility provide ibr the
common defense piomote the general welfare
and secure the blessings of liberty do ordain
and establish this constitution
objects sublime and benevolent they
exclude the very idea of conquesle to be
either divided among states or even enjoyed
by them for the purpose of securing not the
blessings of liberty but the evils of slave
ry
theie is a novelty in the principle of this
compromise which condemns it simultane
ously with the establishment of the constitu
tion virginia ceded her domain which then
extended to the mississippi and was even
eiaimed to extend to the pacific congress
accepted it and unanimously devoted the
domain to freedom hi the laqggiage from
which the ordinance now so severely con
demned was borrow five states have
already been organised on mfe domain from
irfl of which iu pursuance of that ordinance
slavery is excluded how jjid it happen
that this theory of the equality of ike state
of the classification of states of the equih
brim of the states of the tpf the states
to common enjoyment of the cfomain pto an
equitable and just partition between them
was neuer promulgated nor even dluniml of
by the slave states which unanimously con
sented to this ordinance r
there is another aspect of the principle of
compromise which deserve consideration it
assumes that slavery if not the only insiitu
tion is in a slave state at least the ruling
institution and that this characteristic was
lecognixed by the constitution but slavery
is only one of many institutions there
freedom is equally an institution there
slavery is only a temporary accidental
partial incongruua one freedom on the
ontxary is a perpetual organic universal
one in harmony with the constitution of the
united states the slaveholder himself
stands under the protection of the letter is
common wtllsll the free citizens of the state
but the principle of the compromise gives
complete ascendancy in the slave states and
in the constitution of the united states to
the suboidinate accidental and incongruous
institution over its antagonist to reduee
this claim for slavery to an absurdity it ia
only necessary to add that there are only twrj
states in which slaves are s majority and
net one in which the slaveholders ar g o i
very disproportionate minority
but there is yet another aspect ia which
this principle must be examitied regards
the domain only as a possession to be enjoyed
either in common or by partition by the citi
zens of the old states it is true indeed that
the national domain is ours true that it was
aeqnired by the powers and wealth of the
whole country but we hold nevertheless do
arbitrary power over it we hold no arbiirs
ry authority over anything whether aeqnired
lawfully or by usurpation the cnastitutien
regulates our stewardship the constitution
devotes the domain to union to justice to
defense to welfaie and liberty but there ie
a higher law than the constitution which
regulates our authority over the domain and
devotes it to the same noble put pose the
territory is a paitno inconsiderable partof
the common heritage of mankind bestowed
upon thme by the creator of the universe
we are hia stewards and must so discharge
our trust as to secure in the highest attain
able degree their happiness how moment

we are an estate and are deliberating for
the commonwealth juat aa our fathera de
liberated in eatabliahing the inatitutiona we
enjoy whatever superiority there ia in our
condition and hopes over those of any other
kingdom or estate is due to the for
tunate circumstance that our ancestors did not
leave things to take their chance but that
they added amplitude and greatness to onr
commonwealth by introducing such ordi
nances constitutions and cuatoms as were
wise
we in our time have aucceeded to the
same responsibilities and we cannot approach
the duty before us wisely or justly except
we raise ouiselves to the great consideration
of how we can most certainly sow greatness
to our posterity and successors and now
the simple bold and awful question which
presents itself to us is this shall we who
are founding institutions social and political
fot countless millionsshall we who know
by experience the wise and ihe just and are
free to choose them and to reject the ereone
oua and the unjustshad we establish humau
bondage or permit it by our sufferance to be
established sir our fathers would not have
hesitated an hour they found slavery ex
isting here and they left it only because they
could not remove it there is not only no
free state which would now establish it bnt
there is no save slate whih if it had but
the free alternative as we now have would
have founded sltvery indeed our revolu
tionary predecessors had precisely the same
question before them in establishing an organ
ic law under which the states of ohio
michigan illinois wisconsin and lowa have
lince come into the union and they solemnly
repudiated and excluded slavery from those
states forever  confess that the most alarm
ing evidence of our degeneracy which has yei
been given is found in the fact that we even
debate such a question
sir there is no chtistian nation that free
to choose as we are would establish slavery
i apeak on due consideration because britain
france and mexico have abolished slavery
and all other european states are preparing
to abolish it as rapidly as they can
we cannot establish slavery because
there are certain elements of the security
welfare and greatness of nations w hich we
all admit or ought to admit and lequire as
essential and these arethe security of
natural rights the diffusion of knowledge
and the freedom of industry slavery is in
compatible with all of these and just in pro
portion to the extent that it prevails and con
trols in anv republican state just to that ex
tent it subverts the principle of derouciacy
and converts the state into an aristocracy or
despotism i will not offend sensibilities by
drawing my proof from the slave states ex
isting among ourselves but i will draw them
from the greatest of the european slave
states the population of russia in europe
in  was  of these were
erfa  the residue nobles clergy
merchants c  the liupenal
government abandons the control over the
attylhree and a half millions to their owners
and the residue included in the  aie
thus a privileged class or aristocracy if ever
the government inteifeies at all with the
aetfs who are the only laboring population
it is by edicts designed to abridge the op
portunities of education and thus continue
their debasement what was the origin of
lhis system conquest in which the captivi
ty of the conqured was made perpetual and
hereditary
this it seems to me is identical with
american shveiy only at one and the same
lime exaggerated by the greater disproportion
between the privileged classes and the slaves
in theii respective numbers and yet relieved
of the unhappiesi featurs of american slave
rytbe distinction of caste what but ibis
renders russia at once the most arbitrary
despotism aud the most barbarous state in
europe and what is its effect but industry
comparatively profitless and sedition not oc
cassional and parmal but chronic and pervad
ing tbe empire with massachusetts and
 lno among us shall we pass by their free
and beneficent examples and select our insti
tutions from the dominions of the czar
 cannot slop to debate jong with those
who maintain that slavery is in itself practi
cally economical and humane i might be
content with saving that there are some
axioms in political scince that a statesmen or
a founder of states may adopt especially in
tbe congress of the united states and that
among these axioms are these
that all men are created equal and have
inalienable rights of life liberty and the
choice of pursuits of happiness
that knowledge promotes virtue and
righteousness exahelh a nation
that freedom is preferable to slavery
and that democratic governments when they
can be maintained by acquiescence without
force are preferable to institutions exercising
arbitrary and irrisponaible power
it remains only to say on this part of the
subject that slavery being incongruous and
repugnant it dangerous to the safety of the
state the conservative principle of the
state is the security of the voluntary acqui
esscoce of tbe people that acquiescence is
obtained by universal suffrage which de
mands of course equality of knowledge and
propeiiy as far as that is practically attaina
ble without injustice or oppression this
argument is sustained by our own experience
there is no danger menacing the union
there never has been any that would have
menaced it had slavery had no shelter be
neatu its protection if slavery confined as
it now is threatens tbe invasion of the con
stitution how can we enlarge us boundaries
and increase its influence with increasing the
danger already existing
whether then i regard merely the wel
fare tf the future inhabitants of the new ter
ritories nr the security and welfare of tbe
whole people of the united stales or the
welfare of the whole family of mankind 
cannot consent t o introduce slavery into any
part of this continent which is now exempt
from what seems to me to be so great an
evil
these are my reasons for declining to com
promise the questions relating to slavery as
a condition of the admission of california
in acting upon an occasion so grave as this
a respectful consideration is due to the argu
ments founded on extraneous considersions
f senators wno eoonsel a course different
from that which  have preferred
tbe first of these arguments is that con
gress has no power to legislate on the sub
ject of slavery within the territories sir
congress has power to admit new states
and since congress may admit it follows that
congress may reject new states the dis
cretion of congress in admitting it absolute
except that when admitted the stale must be
republican state and must be a state
that is it shall have the constitutional powers
uf a state but the greater includes the less
we may impose conditions not inconsistent
with those fundamental powers boundaries
are suck tbe reservation of tbe public domain
is supb tbe right to dtvde is such the ordi
nance excluding slavery is such a condition
tbe organization of territory is auxtiury or
preliminary it is tbe inchoate initiative
cl ef ad mission aud is performed under the
clause gianuog the power necessary to exe
cute tbe express powers of tbe constitution
this power comes from tbe treaty making
power also and  think it is well traced to
tbe power to make needful rules and regula
tions concerning tbe public domain but the
power is here to be exectsed however de
rived and tbe right to regulate property to
administer justice in regard to property is as
anted in every territorial charter if we
have power to legislate concerning property
vt have concerning personal rights free
dom is a personal light the constitution
decs not sanction property in man and con
gress beiag tbe supreme legislature has tbe
asae right in regard to property and rights
ja territories that the states would have if
igsniesd
it is unused further that the inhibition is
i have mfwt the less of abl
and distinguished senators who go with us
for the admission of california especially
do i regret the separation from ua of the able
and distinguished senator from missouri mr
benton when what senator announced
that he should not sustain the proviso of
fieedom  was induced to exclaim
cur in timatrum cato sivsre veaieti
an ideo tantum veneraa ut exies
b it that distinguished senator is crowning a
life of eminent public service by bringing the
first state of the pacific into the union and
grateful to him for that i freely leave to him
to deteimine for himself what weight he will
give to the cause of human freedom in his
action on so gravo an occasion
the argument is that the proviso ia un
necessary  answer then there can be no
error in insisting upon it but why is it un
necessary it is said first by reason of the
climate if this be so why do not the rep
resentatives of the slave states yield to the
proviso  they deny that climate prevents
the introduction of slavery now i will
leave nothing to contingency but in truth
i think that argument is against the proposi
tion is there any climate where slavery
has not existed it has prevailed all over
europe from sunny italy to bleak england
and ia existing now stronger than in any
other land in icebound russia
but it will be replied that this is not african
slavery  rejoin that only makes the case
the stronger if this vigorous saxon race of
ours was reduced to slavery while it retained
the courage of semibarbarism in its own
high northern latitude what security does
climate afford against the transplantation of
the more gentle more docile and already
enslaved and debased african to the genial
cimr of newmexico and california sir
there is no climate uncongenial to slavery
it is true it is less productive than free labor
in many northern countries but so it is les
productive than free while labor in even tropi
cal climates labor is hi quick demand in all
new countries slave labor is cheaper than
free labor and will go firat into new regions
and wherever it goes it brings labor into dis
honor and therefore free white labor avoids
competition with it sir  might rely on cli
mate if i had not been born in a laud w here
slavery existed and that land was all north
of lheoth parallel of latitude and if i did
not know the snuggle that it has cost and
which is yet going on to get complete relief
from the institution and its baleful couse
quences
but sir it is said that slavery ia prevented
by the laws of god from entering into the
territory from which we propose to inhibit
it  will look into that matter a little more
closely i wish then with the utmost res
pect to ask senators whether the ordrnauce
of  was necessary or not that ordi
nance has been the subject of too many eulo
giums to be now prortonneed a vague and
tdle thing that ordinance carried the pro
hibition of slavery quite up to the th deg
of north lal and yet we are now told that
we can trust tbe laws of god without any
ordinance to exclude slavery as far down as
 deg m unfortunately too the ordi
nance of  began on the  h parallel of
north latitude so that there is no part of the
territory which it covered in which slavery
according to the present theory was not ex
cluded by tbe law of god i know no better
authority as to the laws of god on this subi
ject than one from whom  have already had j
occasion to quote wiibsome freedom and
it is the opinion of montesquieu that it is only j
the indolence of mankind and not the climate
which cause the introduction of slavery any
where theie is no climate where slavery
is necessary there is none where it cannot
be established if the customs and laws
permit
 shall dwell only very briefly on the argu
ment derived from the mexican laws the j
proposition that these laws must remain in
torce until altered by laws of our own is
satisfaciory and so is the proposition that
those mexican laws abolished and continue to
prohibit slavery and still  deem an enact
ment by ourselves wise and even necessary
both of the propositions i have stated are
denied with just as much confidence by south
ern statesmen and jurisis as they are affirm
ed by those of the free states the popu
lation of the new territories is rapidly becom
ing an american one to whom the mexican
code w ill seem a foreign one entitled to little
deference or obedience slavery has never
obtained anywhere by express legislative au
thority but always by trampling down laws
higher than any mere municipal lawsthe
law of nature and ot nations there can be
no oppression in upetadding the sanction of
congress to the authority which is so weak
and so vehemently questioned and there is
some possibility if not a probability that the
institution might obtain a foothold surreptiti
ously if it should not be absolutely forbidden
by our own authority
what is insisted upon therefore is not a
mere abstraction or a mete sentiment as is
contended by those who concur with us as to
admitting california hut would waive the
proviso and what is conclusive on the sub
ject is that it is conceded on all hands that the
effect of insisting on it prevents the extension
of slavery into the region to which it is pro
posed to apply it again it is insisted that
the diffusion of slavery does not increase its
evils the argument seems to me merely
specious and quite unsound
and this brings me to the great and all
absorbing argument that the union is in dan
ger of being dissolved and that it can only
be saved by compromise
i do not overlook the fact that the entire
delegation from the slave states although
they differ in the dealtl of compromise pro
posed and perhaps also upon the exact cir
cumstances of the crisis seem to concure in
the momentous warning nor do  doubt at
all the patriotic devotion to the lnion which
iaexpreased by those from whom thia warn
ing proceeds and yet sir although these
warnings have been uttered with impassioned
solemnity in my hearing every dav for near
three months my confidence in the union re
mains unshaken  think they are to be re
ceived with no inconsiderabledialiuat because
they are uttered under the influence of a con
trolling interest to lie secured a paramount
object to be gainedand ibai is an equili
brium of power in the republic i think
they are to be received with even more dis
trust because with the most profound res
pect they are uttered under an obviously
high excitement nor is that excitement tin
unnatural one it is a law of our nature
that tbe passions disturb the reason and judg
ment just in proportion to the importance of
the occasion and the consequent necessity
for calmness and candor i think they are to
be distrusted because there is a diveisity ol
opinion in regard to the natute and operation
of this excitement the senators from some
states say that it has brought all parties in
that region into unanimity thesenatot from
kentucky says that the danger lies in the
violeuce of party spit it and refers us to the
difficulties which attended the organization of
the house of representatives
sir in my humble judgment it ia not die
fierce conflict of parties that we are seeing
and bearing hut on the contrary it ia the
agony of distracted parties a convulsion re
sulting from the too narrow foundations of
both and of all pattiesloundatioos laid in
compromises of natural justice and of human
liberty a questiona moral question
transcending the too narrow creeds of parties
has arisen the public concience expand
with it and the green withes of party asiio
ciations give way and break and tall off root
it no sir it not the state that ia dying
of the fever of party spirit it ia merely a
paialysia of parties premonitory of tbeir
restoration with the new elements of health
and vigor imbibed from that spirit of the age
which ia so justly called progress
nor ia the evil that of unlicensedirregular
and tdrblem faction we are told that 
legislatures are in session burning like fur
naces heating and inflaming the popper
passions but those twenty legislatures are
constitutional frwaeea they aw prorat
ing their customary functions imparting
healthful heart and vitality while within
their constitutional jurisdiction if they rage
beyond its limits the popular passions of
this country are not at all  think in danger
of being inflamed to excess no sir let
none of those fires be extinguished for
ever let them burn and biaie they are
neither ominous meteors nor baleful comets
but planets and bright and intense as their
heat many be it is their native temperature
and they must still obey the law which by
attraction toward the center bolds them in
their spheres
i see nothing of that conflict between the
southern nd the northern states or between
their representative bodies which seems to
be on all aides of me assomed not a word
of menacenot a word of anger aot an in
temperate word hat been uttered in any
northern legislature they firmly but calm
ly assert their convictions but at the same
time they assert their unqualified purpose to
submit to the common arbiter and for weal
or wo abide the fortunes of the union
what if there be leas of moderation in the
legislatures of the south it only indicates
on which aide the balance is inclining and
that the decision of tbe government is netr
at hand  argue with those who say that
there can be no peaceful dissolutionno dis
solution of the union by tbe secession of
states but that disunion dissolution happen
when it may will and must be revolution
i discover no omens of revolution the
predictions of the political astrologers do not
agree as to time or manner in which it is to
occur according to the authority of the
hon senator from alabama mr clemens
the event has already happened and the
union ia now in ruins according to the
horoscope of the hon senator from missis
sippi mr foote it was to take place on a
day already past according to the hon
and distinguished senator from soulhcaro
lina mr calhoun it ia not to be immediate
but to be developed by time
mr foote here interpesed and disowned
the construction which had been put upon
his remarks and made further explanations
mr sewardl am very happy to have
given the senator an opportunity to correct
the erroneous impression which the remark
which i have referred to had made now
the hon senator will do me the justice to
allow that  am at liberty to subtract one pre
diction frem the political almanac and so the
predictions lose so much of impoitance
i see no omens of revolution what ate
the omens to which our attention is directed
 see nothing but a broad difference of opinion
here and the excitemen consequent upon it
i have observed that revolutions which
begin in that palace seldom gs beyond the
palace walls and these affect only the
dynasty whieh reigns there this revolu
tion if i understand it began here in the
senate chamber a year ago when the rep
resentatives irora southern states assembled
here and addressed their constituents on what
was called the aggiesaions of the northern
slates no revolution was designed at that
time and all that lias happened since ia the
return to congiess of legislative resolutions
which seem to me to be conventional respon
ses to the address which emanated from the
capital
sir in any condition ot society there esn ha
no revolution without a cause an adequate
causewhat cause exists here wears
admitting a new state but there is nothing
new in thatwe have already admitted
seventeen before but it is said that the
slave slates are in dinger of losing political
power by the admission of the new slate
well sir is there anything new in that the
slave states have always been losing political
power and they always will be while they j
have any to lose at first twelve of the
thirteen states were slave states now only
fit teen of the thirty are slave states more
over the change is constitutionally made
and the government was constructed so as
to permit changes o the bolanceol power in i
obedience to changes of the forces of the
body politic danton used to say its all
well while the people cry dauton and robes
pierre but woe for me if ever the people
learn to say robespierre and danton that
is all of it sir the people have been
accustomed to say the south and north
they ate beginning now to say the north and
the south
sir thgse who woud alarm us with the
terrors of revolution have not well consideied
the structure of this government and the or j
ganization of its forces it is a democracy
of property and ersons with a fair approxi
mation toward universal education and oper
ating by means of universal suffrage the
constituent members of this democracy are
the only person who could subvert it and
they are not the citizens of a metropolis like
paris or of a region subjected to the influ
ences of a metropolis like france but they j
are husbandmen dispersed over this broad l
land on the mountain and on the plain and i
on the prairie from the ocean to the rocky
mountains and from the great lakes to the j
gulf and this people are now while we
are discussing their imaginary danger at
peace and in their happy homes and as un
concerned and even as uninformed of their
peril as they are of events occurring in tbe
moon nor have the alarmists made due al
lowance in their calculations for the influence
of conservative reactionstrong in any gov
ernment and irresistible in a rural republic
operating by universal suffrage that prin
ciple of reaction ia due to the force of habits
of acquiescence and loyally among the peo
ple no ruau better understood this principle
than machiaveul who has told us in regard
to factions that no safe reliance can be
placed in the force of nature and the bravery
of words except it be corroborated by cus
tom do the alarmists remember that this
government has stood sixty years already
without exacting one drop of blood that this
government baa stood sixty years and trea
son is sn obsolete crime that day  trust
ia lar off when the fountains of popular con
tentment aflaail be broken upbut whenever
it shall come it will bring forth a higher illus
tration than has ever yet been given of tbe
excellence of the democratic system for
then it will be seen how calmly how firmly
how nobly a great people can act in preserv
ing thru constitution when love of couptiy

when the foanders of the new republic
of tbe south come to draw over the face of
this empire along or betweeo its parallels of
latitude or longitude their ominous lines of
to be broadly and deeply
shaded with fraternal blood they may come
to the discovery then if not before that tbe
national and even the political connections of
tbe region embraced forbids such a partition
that us possible divisions are not northern
and southern at all but eastern and west
ern atlantic and pacific and that nature
and commerce have allied indissolubly for
weal and woe the secedera and those from
whom they are to be separated that while
they would rush into a pivij war to restore
an imaginary equilibrium between the north
ern states and the southern states that a
new equilibrium had taken ita place in which
hi those states are pn the one side and the
boundless west waa on the other
sir when the founders of tbe new repub
lic of the south come to trace those fearful
tines they will indicate what portion of the
continent are to be broken off from their con
nection with the atlatfftc through the st
lawrence the hudson the delaware the
potomac and the mississippiwbat portion
of this people are to be dented the use of the
lakes the railroads and tbe canals now con
stituting commoo and cuatgmary avenues of
travel trade and social intercoursewbst
families and kindred are to be separated and
convened into eoemtee and what states are
to be the aoenef of perpetual border warfare
aggravated by interminable horror of inter
miniwf iomfffotisn when thou portent
ous lines shall he drawn they will daadfoee
what portion of tbs modlo ia to ratih tbs
army and the navy and tbe flag of manj
victories and on the other hind whai
portion of this people is to be subjected u
new and tuinous imposts direct taxes and
forced loans and conscriptioos to maintain ao
opposing army and opposing navy d the
new and hateful banner of sedition then
ihe projectors of the new republic ot the
south will meet the questionand wyaa
well prepare now to answer it what is
all this forwhat intolerable wrongwhat
unfi sternal injustice hav tendered these cal
amities unavoidable what gain will thii
unnatural revolution bring to us  the
answer will be all thia is done to secure
the institution of african slavery
and then if not before the question will
be discussedwhat is this institution ol
slavery that it should cause these unparallel
ed sacrifices and these disastrous afflictions
and this will be the answer when the
spaniards few in number discovered the
western indies and the adjacent continental
america the needed labor to draw forth from
its virgin stores some speedy return to the cu
pidity of the court and bankers of madrid
they enslaved the indolent inoffensive and con
fiding patives who perished by thousands and
even by millions under that new and unnatu
ral bondage a humane ecclesiastic advised
the substitution of africans reduced to cap
tivity in their native wars and a pious
princess adopted the suggestion ith a dis
pensation from the head of the church
granted on the ground of the prescriptive
right of the christian to enslave the heathen
to effect his conversion the colonists ol
north america innocent in their uncon
sciousness of wrong encouraged the slays
traffic and thus the labor of subduing theii
territory devolved chiefly upon the african
race a happy conjunction brought on an
awakening of tbe conscience of mankind tc
the injustice of slavery simuhaneasly with
the independence of the colonies massa
chusetts connecticut rhodeisland new
hampshire vermont new york new
jersey and pennsylvania welcomed and em
braced the spirit of universal emancipation
renouncing luxury they secured tnfluencr
and empire but the states of ihe tsouthmis
led by a new and profitable cultivation elec
ted to maintain and perpetuate slavery and
thus choosing luxury they lost power and
empire
when this answer shall be given it will
appear that the question of dissolving the
union is a complex question that it embra
ces the fearful issue whether the union shall
stand and slavery under the steady peace
ful action of moral social and political causei
be removed by gradual voluntary effort and
compensation or whether the union shall
be dissolved and civil wats ensue bringing
on violent but complete and immediate eman
cipation we are now arrived at that stage
of our national progress when that crisis can
be foreseen when we must foresee it it is
directly before us its shadow is upon us
it datkens the legislative halls the temples
of worship and the home and the hearth
every question political civil or ecclesiastical
however foreign to the subjectslavery brings
up slavery is an incident and the incident
supplants the principal question we hear
of nothing but slavery and we can talk of
nothing but slavery and now it seems to me
that all our difficulties embaraaaments and
dangers arise not of unlawful perversions
of ihe question of slavery as some suppose
but out of the want of moral courage to
meet this question of emancipation as we
ought consequently we hear on one side
demands absurd indeed but yet unceasing
for an immediate and unconditional abolition
of slavery as if any power except the people
of the slave states could abolish it and as if
they could be moved to abolish it by merely
sounding the trumpet violently and proclaim
ing emancipation while the institution was
interwoven with all their social and political
interests constitutions and customs
on the other hand our statesmen say that
alvaery has always existed and for aught
they know or can do tt always must exist
god permitting it and he only can indicate
the way to remove it as if the supreme crea
tor after giving us the instructions of his
providence ynd revelation for the illumina
tion of our minds and consciences did not
leave us in all human transactions with due
invocations of his holy spirit to seek out hia
will and execute it for ourselves
here then is the point of my separation
from both of theae parties i feel assured
that slavery will give wayand must give way
to the salutary instructions of economy and
to the ripening influences ot humanity that
emancipation is inevitable and is pearthat
it mav be hastened or hindered and that whe
ther it be peaceful or violent depends upon
the government whether it be hastened or
hinderedthat all measures which justify
slavery ur extend it tend to the consumma
tion of violence all that cheek its extension
and abate its strength tend to its peaceful ex
tirpation but i will adopt now none but
lawful constitutional and peaceful means to
secure even the erd and none auch can i or
will i forego
nor do  know any important or responsible
body that proposes to do inure than ihis no
free slate claims to extend its legislation into
a slave state none claims that congress
shali usurp power to abolish slavery in the
slave states none claims that any violent
unconstitutional or unlawful measures shall
be restored to and on the other hand if we
offtr no scheme or plan for the adoption of the
lave states with the assent and cooperation
of congress it is only because the slave
states are unwilling aa yet to receive auch
suggestion or even to entertain the question
of emancipation in any state
but air i will take this occasion to say
that while  cannot agree with the hon sen
ator from massachusetts in proposing to de
mote  to remove the free colored
population from the states and thus as it
appears to me fortify slaverythere ia to
reasonable limit to which i am not willing to
go in applying the uational treasures to effect
the peaceful voluntary removal of slavery it
self
 have thus endeavored to show that there
is not now and ia not likely to occur any
adequate cause for revolution in regard to
slavery but you reply that mvertiieless
you roust have guarantees and tbe first
one is for tbe surrender of fugitives from lab
or that guarantee you cannot have aa i
have already shown because you cannot roll
back the tide of social progress you must
be content with what you have if you wage
war against us you can at moot only con
quer us and then all you can get will be a
treaty and that you have already but you
ioaiet on a guarantee against the abolition
of slavery in tbe district of columbia or war
well wben you ahall bave declared war a
gainst us wbat shall hinder ua from immed
iately decreeing that slavery ahall eeaae with
in tbe national capital
you say that you will not submit to the
exclusion of slaves from the new territories
what wilt you gain by resistance liberty
follows ihe sword although her away is one
of peace and beneficence can you propa
gate slavery then by the sword
you insist that you cannot submit to the
freedom with which slavery ie diaeussed in
the free states wilj wara war for sla
very crush or even moderate that discussion
no sir that discussion will net cease
war would only inflame it to a greater
heightb it is a part of the eternal oonflict
betweeo truth sod errorbetween mind and
physics fofee the conflict of man against
the obstacles which oppose hit way to an ul
timate and glorious destiny it will go on
until yon sliall terminate in the only way in
which any state or nation has terminated it
by yielding to ityielding in yoor own time
and in your own manner indeed but never
theless yielding to the progress of tsftaaeip
sou will do this sooner or later whaterei
may be your opinion now bootee nation
which wore prudent and humane and wise as
yon sat have dons ao already
smm slave statesh m reason ie tar that
this inevitable change rill go too far or too fast
for their safety or welfare itcanoot well go too
fast or too far if the only alternative is a war
of races
bat itcanoot go  fart slavery has a reli
able and accommodating ally in a party in the
free states which though it claims to be and
doubtless is in many respects a party of prog
ress finds iu eol security for its political por
in the support and aid of slavery in tbs slave
states of course i do not include in that party
tboee who are now co operating in maintaining
the cause of freedom against slavery i am not
of this party of progress in the north which lends
its support to slavery but it is only just and
candid that i should be a witness to their fidelity
to the interest of slavery sis very has more
over a more natural alliance with the aristocra
cy of the north and with the aristocracy of europe
so long as slavery shall possess the cotton
fields the sugar fields and the rice fields of the
world so long will commerce and capital yield
its toleration and sympathy emancipation is a
democratic revolatioo it is capital that arrests
all democratic rsvolutions it was capital that
in a single year rolled back the tide of revolu
tion on the use of the carpathian mountains a
cross the danube and the rhine into the streets
of paris it is capital that is rapidly rolling back
the throne of napoleon into the chambers of the
tniltortss
slavery has a guarantee still stronger than
these in the prejudices of caste and color wbieb
induce eveu lar e majorities in all the free states
to regard sympathy with the slave as ao act of
unmanly humliatioo and self abasement
although philosophy meekly expresses her dis
trust oi the asserted natural superiority of the
white race and confidently denies that such a
superiority if justly claimed could give a title to
oppression there remains one more guarantee
one that has seldom failed you aod will seldom
fail you hereafter new states cling in ch eer re
liance than the olde ones to the federal power
the concentration of the slave power enables you
for long periods to control the federal govern
meot with the aid of the new stater i do noi
know the sentiments of tue representatives oi
california but my word for it if they should be
admitted on this floor today against your most
obstinate opposition they wouldon all questions
really affecting your interests be found at your
side with these allies and aids to break the
force of emancipation there will be no disunion
and no secession j do not say that there may
no be disturbance though i do not apprehend
even that absolute regularity and order in ad
ministration have not yet been established in any
government and unbroken popular tranquility
baa not yet been attained in even the most ad
vanced cordition of human society the machi
oery of our system is necessarily complex a
pivot may fall out herea lever may be displac
ed theretut the machinery will soon recover
its regularity and move on just as before with
even better adaptation aod adjustment to over
come new obstructions
there are many well disposed persons who are
alarmed at the occurrence ot any such disturbance
the future of a legislative body to organise is
to their apprehension a feariul omen and an ex
tra constitutional assemblage to consult upon
public affairs is with them cause for desperation
even senators speak of the union as if it exited
only by consent and as it seems to be implied
by the assent of tee legislatures of the states
on the contrary the union was pot founded in
voluntary choice nor does it exist by voluntary
consent
a union was proposed to the colonies by
frskklin and others in  but uch was their
aversion to an abridgment of their own importance
respectively that it was rejected even under the
pressure of a disastrous invasion by fraoce
a union of choice was proposed to the colonies
in  but so strong was their oppositiouthat
they went through the war of independence
without having established more than a mere
council of confederation
but with independence came enlarged interests
of agriculture absolutely new interests of manu
factures interests of commerce of fisheries of
navigation of a common domain common debts
of common revenues and taxation of tbe admiuis
tration of justice of public defense of public hoo
or in short interests of common nationality and
sovereignty interests which at last compelled the
adoption of a more perfect uniona national
government
the genius talent and learning of hamilton
of jat of madison surpassing perhaps the intel
lectual power ever excited before for the estab
lishment of a government combined with the
serene but mighty influence of w ashinqton were
only sufficient to secure the reluctant adoption of
the constitution that is now the object of all our
affections and of the hopes of mankind no
wonder that ths conflicts in which that constitu
tion was born and the almost desponding solem
nity of was ling ton in bis farewell address im
pressed his countrymen and mankind with a
profound distrust of its perpetuity no wonder
that while tbe murmurs of that day are yet ring
ing iu our ears we have cherished that distrust
with pious reverence as a national and patriotic
sentiment
but it is time to prevent abases of that senti
ment it is time to shako off t tat fear for fear
is always weakness it is time to remember
that government even when it arises by chance
or accident and is administered capriciously and
oppressively is ever tbe strongest of all human
institutions surviving many social and ecclesias
tical changes and consuls ons and that this gov
ernment of ours has all the inherent strength
common to governments and added to them is
ths solidity aod firmness derived from broader
and deeper foundations in natural justice and
from a better civil adaptation to promote the
welfare and happiness of mankind
ths union the creation of necessities physical
moral social and political endures by virtue of
the same necessities and these necessities are
stronger than when it was produced and by tbe
greater amplitude of territory now covered by
itstronger by tbe sixfold increase of tbe soci
ety living under its benificent protectionstron
ger by the augmentation ten thousand times of
the fields the work shops tbe mines and the ships
of that society of its productions of the sea of
ths plow of tbs loom aod of ths aovil in their
coastaot circle of internal and international ex

unknown when the constitution wee adopted
stronger in the freedom and in the growing em
pire of the stronger iu the element of na
tional honor i all lands and stronger than all in
ths now settled habits of veneration and affec
tion for institutions so stupendous and useful
the union then is net because merely that
men choose that it shall be bat because some
government must exist here aod no other gov
ernment than this can if it should be dashed to
itoms by the whirlwind tbe lightning or the earth
quake to day it would rise again in all itsjust and
magnificent proportions to morrow

the january number of the chris
tian parlor magazine contains a valu
able article upon the religious charac
ter of lord bacon by the rev albert
barnes from which we select the fol
lowing beautiful and truthful para
ghaphs christian times
it is not easy to form an estimate of
bacons religious character we are
favored with so few and imperfect de
tails of his private habits we have so
little that tells us the true biography of
the manhis feelings his usual de
portment his private modes of action
we are let so littfe into the interior ar
rangements of his life that we cannot
easily pronounce on his personal char
acter charity would lead us to hepe
notwithstanding his fondness for pre
ferment and the great error of his
life that he may have exemplified in
his private life the principles which he
has so ably and so constantly inculca
ted on the subject of his religious
opinions he has left us no room to
doubt there is scarcely to be found
in any language or in any writer so
constant a reference to the great religi
ous interest of man as in the writings
of bacon there is no where to be
found a more profound defence to the
authority of the bible there is per
haps no where more caution displayed
lest the profoundness variety com
pass and originality of investigation
should lead the mind astray than in
his investigations it was one of his
recorded sentimentsone of the results
of his investigations which he has ex
pressed without hesitancy or qualifica
tion that a little philosophy inclineth
a man to atheism but depth in philoso
phy bringeth mans minds about to re
ligion for while the mind of man look
eth upon second causes scattered it
may sometimes rest in them and go no
further but when it beholdeth the chain
of them confederate and linked togeth
er it must deeds fly to providence and
deity his belief he has left us in a
wellwritten confession of his faith
embracing the usual articles of the
christian religion his prayers which
are preserved breathe a spirit of true
devotion in a style and form which are
not surpassed by any compositions of
that period in our language it would
be easy to transcribe page after page
of his recorded sentiments and we
might trace at every step of his life his
profound deference for the theology of
the bible
we do not believe that the christian
religion depends for its evidence on
the suffrage of any one philosopher or
on the bright constellation of names
which have expressed their profound
regard for the truths of revelation
still a christian cannot but look with
deep interest on the fact that such men
as bacon and boyle and newton
bowed their mighty intellects to the au
thority of revelation came and brought
all the rich and varied treasures of
their profound investigation and laid
them at the foot of the cross and spent
their lives increasingly impressed with
the belief that the god of nature is al
so the god of the bible while we do
not claim that on their authority the
scriptures should be accredited as the
word of god we do claim that they
should be allowed to rebuke the flip
pancy of youthful aad unfledged infi
delity that they should be permitted to
summon men to inquire before they
pronounce we claim that their authori
ty is sufficient to call on the youthful
skeptic to pause and to suspect that
possibly he may be wrong when
i mighty minds like those have left their
recorded assent to the truths of the
i christian scheme it is not too much
jto ask of minds of far lees power to
sit down and inquire at least whether
christianity may not have come from
god when newton after having
surveyed world on world and measured
the heavens and placed himself for
profound inquiry at the head of man
kind sat down in the full maturity of
his days and passed the vigor of his
life and the serene evening of his
honored age in the contemplation of
the new testament when bacon after
having rescued science from the accu
mulated darkness and rubbish of two
thousand years after having given
lessons to all mankind about the just
mode of investigating nature and after
having traversed the circle of the sci
ences and gained all that past genera
tions had to teach and having carried
forward the inquiry far into nature
bowed at every step to the authorityof
the bible when hale learned in the
law not only believed christianity to
be true but adorned the christian pro
fession by a most humble life when
boerhave perfectly acquainted with
the human frame and skilled in the
healing art sat with the simplicity of a
child at the feet of jesus christ when
locke gave the testimony of his power
ful mind to the truth of the christian
religion when davy first of chemists
came on this subject to the same results
as the analyzerof light the inventer
of fluxious and the demonstrator of the
theory of gravitation as the author of
the novum organum and the writer
of the treatise on the human under
standing when each science has thus
contributed its founder its ornament
and its head as a witness to the truth
of the christian religion if is not too
much to conclude it may be something
different from priestcraft and impos
ture when we turn from these lights
of menthese broad stars that spread
their beams over all the firmament of
science and seek after the wandering
and dim luminaries of infidelitywhen
we make a sober estimate of what the
high priests of unbelief have done for
the advancement of science and the
welfare of mao we are struck with
the prodigious advance we have made
into chilly and tenebrated regions we
have passed amid spirits of another
order we wander in climes as re
mote almost from science as from
christianity we should know where
we are as readily by their superficial
but pompous pretensions by dark but
most confident scientific claims by er
roneous wandering but most flippant
demands in science as we do by their
infuriated and bitter raging against the
claims of the christian religion who

horrible scene in a creek
church in jerusalem
in curzons visit to the monasteries
of the levant the following instance
of gross deception and mummery on
the part of the patriarchs of the greek
church is related which was attended
with the most tragic consequences
mr curzon in company with ibrahim
pasha at that time in full sway over
all syria proceeded to church to see
the portent of the holy fire as soon
as the great turk was comfortuble in
the gallery which had been reserved
for him the two patriarchs who once
in the year condescended to act in the
same piece performed the miracle and
the church was instantly the scene of
the most hideous tumult hundreds of
the pilgrims from every quarter
greek armenian copt and abyssi
anianrushing pell mell to light their
lamps with which all come provided
at the holy flame just descended from
heaven at the prayer of those reverend
personages the two miracle mongers
had not been above a minute in the
holy sepulchre when the glimmering
of the holy fire was seen or imagined
to appear and surely bedlam never
displayed such au unruly transport as
was produced in the mob at that sight
but though there always is great dis
turbance and serious accidents have
often occurred the miracle of 
was followed by horrors on a scale
wholly unaxampled and it is fortunate
that for a scene so monstrous we have
the complete and living evidence of an
english gentleman
soon you saw the lights increasing
in all directions every one having lit
his candle from the holy flame the
chapels the galleries and every cor
ner where a candle could possibly be
displayed immediately appeared to be
in a blaze the people in their fren
zy pu the bunches of lighted tapers
to their faces hand and breasts to
purify themselves from their sins
the patriarch was carried out of the
sepulchre in triumph on the shoulders
of the people he had deceived amid
the cries and exclamations of joy which
resounded from every nook of the im
mense pile of buildings as he ap
peared in a hunting state i supposed
that he was ill but i found that it is
the uniform custom on these occasions
to feign insensibility that the pilgrims
may imagine that he is overcome with
the glory of the almighty from whose
immediate presence they believe him
to have returned
in a short time the smoke of the con
dles obscured everything in the place
and i could see it rolling in great vol
umes out of the aperture at the top of
the dome the smell was terrible
and three unhappy wretches overcome
by heat and bad air fell from the up
per range of galleries and were dash
ed to pieces on the heads of the people
below one poor armenian lady
seventeen years of age died where shs
sat of heat thirst and fatigue
after a while when he had seen all
that was to be seen ibrahim pasha
got up and went away his numerous
guards making a line for him by main
force throuth the dense mass of people
which filled the body of the church
as the crowd was so immense w
waited for a little whileand then set out
all together to return to our convent
i went first and my friends followed
me the soldiers making way for us
icross the church i got as far as the
place where the virgin is said to have
stood during the crucifixion when i
law a number of people lying on one
mother all about this part ofthe church
and as far as i could see towards the
cloor i made my way between them
t well as i could till they were so
thick that there was actually a great
lieap of bodies upon which trod it
then suddenly struck me that they
were all dead i had not perceived
this at first for i thought they were
only very much fatigued with the cere
monies and had tain down to rest
themselves tjiere but when i came to
so great a heap of bodies i looked
down at them and saw that sharp
hard appearance of the face which is
nover to be mistakenmany of them
were quite black with suffocation and
farther on were others all bloody and
covered with the brains and entrails of
those who bad been trodden to pieces
by the crowd
at this time there was no crowd in
this part of the church butlittle far
ther on round the corner toward the
great doer the people who were quite
panicstruck continued to press for
ward and every one was doing the
utmost to escape the guards outside
frightened at the rush from within
thought that the christians wished to
attack them and the confusion soon
grew into a battle the soldiers with
their bayonets killed numbers of faint
ing wretches and the walls were spat
tered with blood and brains of men
who had been felled like oxen with
the buttends of the soldiers muskets
every one struggled to defend himself
or to get away and all who fell were
immediately trampled to death by the
rest so desperate and savage did
the fight become that even the panic
struck pilgrims appeared at last to have
been more intent upon the destruction
of each other than desirous to save
themselves
for my part as soon as i perceived
the danger i had cried out to my
companions to turn back which they
had done but i myself was carried on
by the press till l came near the door
where all were fighting for their lives
here seeing certain destruction be
fore me i made every endeavor to get
back an officer of the pashas who
by his star was a colonel or bin
bashee equally alarmed with myself
was also trying to return he caught
hold of my cloak or bournous and
pulled me down on the body of an old
man who was breathing out his last
sigh as the officer was pressing me
to the ground we wrestled together
among the dying and the dead with
the energy of despair i struggled
with this man till  pulled him down
and happily got again upon my legs
l afterwards found that he never rose
againand scrambling oyer a pile of
corpses i made my way back into the
body of the church where i found my
friends and we succeeded in reaching
the sacristy of the catholics and thence
the room which had been assigned to
us by the monks
the dead were lying in heaps even
upon the stone of unction and i saw
full four hundred wretched people
dead and living heaped promiscuously
one upon another in some places
above five feet high ibrahim pasha
had left the churchonly a few minutes
before me and very narrowly escaped
with his life he was so pressed upon
by the crowd on all sides and it was
said attacked by several of them that
it was only by the greatest exertions ol
his suite several ot whom were killed
that he gained the outer court he
fainted more than once in the struggle
and  was told that some of his atten
dants at last had to cut a way for him
with their swords through the dense
ranks of the frantic pilgrims he re
mained outside giving orders for the
removal of the corpses and making
his men drag out the bodies of those
who appeared to be still alive from
the heaps of the dead he sent word
to us to remain in the convent till all
the bodies had been removed and that
when we could come out in safety he
would again send to us
we stayed in our room two hours
before we ventured to make another
attempt to escape from this scene oi
horror and then walking close toge
ther with all our servants round us
we made a bold push and got out oi
the church by this time most of the
bodies were removed but twenty or
thirty were still lying in distorted atti
tudes at the foot of mount calvary
and fragments of clothes turbans
shoes and handkerchief clotted with
blood and dirt were strewed all over
the pavement
in the court in the front of the church
the sight was pitiablemothers weep
ing over their children the sons
bending over the dead bodies of their
fathersand one poor woman was
clinging to the hand of her husband
whose body was fearfully mangled
most of the sufferers were pilgrims and
strangers the pasha was greatly
moved by the scene of woe and he
again and again commanded his offi
cers to give the poor people every as
sistance in their power and very
many by his humane efforts were res
cued from death
i was much struck by the sight of
two old men with white beards who
had beeu seeking for each other among
the dead they met as i was passing
by and it was affecting to see them
kiss and shake hands and congratulate
each other on having escaped from
death
when the bodies were removed
many were discovered standing upright
quito dead and near the church door
one of the soldiers was found thus
standing with bis musket shouldered
among the bodies which reached near
ly as high as his head this was in a
corner near the great door on the right
side as you come in it seems that
this door had been shut so that many
who stood near it were suffocated in
the crowd and when it was opened
the rush was so great that numbers
were thrown down and never rose
gain being trampled to death by the
press behind them the whole court
before the entrance of the church was
covered with bodies laid in rows by the
pashas ordders so that their friends
might find them and carry them away
as we walked home we saw numbers
of people carried out some dead and
some horribly wounded and in a dying
state for they had fought with their
heavy silver inkstands and daggers
fashionable manners there is a
set of people whom i cannot bearthe
pinks of fashionable proprietywhose
every word is precise and whose every
movement is unexceptionable but
who though versed in all the catego
ries of polite behavior have not a
particle of soul or of cordiality about
them we allow that their manners
may be abundantly correct there
my be elegance in every gestureand
gracefulness in every position not a
smile out of place and not a step that
would not bear the measurement of
the severest scrutiny this is all very
fine but what i want is the heart and
the gaiety of social intercoursethe
frankness that spreads ease and ani
matiou around itthe eye that speaks
affability to all that chases timidity
from every bosom and tells every man
in the company to be confident and
happy this is what i conceive to be
the virtue of the text be courteous
and not the sickening formality of those
who walk by rule and would reduce
the whole of human life to a wire
bound system of misery and constraint
