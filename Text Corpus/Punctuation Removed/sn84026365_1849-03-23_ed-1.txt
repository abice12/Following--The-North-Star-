meeting at columbus
pursuant to notice many of the col
ored people of this city and vicinity as
sembled in public meeting in the sec
ond baptist church and organized by
calling l l tavlor to the chair and
appointing j m cordoyo secretary
the chairman having briefly stated
the object of the meeting mr d jenj
kins submitted a series of resolutions
for consideration
e s hamlin being called for 
arose and gave an interesting exposi
tion of the many inconveniences to i
which colored people are subjected by
the black laws and some of the bene
fits resulting to them from a partial re
peal
wm washington in behalf of the j
chair presented other resolutions j
which with those of jenkins were
unanimously adopted
resolved that we a portion of the
downtrodden colored people of ohio
feel highly gratified that a partial repeal
of the black laws has been effected
resolved that the repeal is not an
act of grace but of justice and right
and evinces a return to the principles
of i and to the bill of rights of this
state
resolved that we congratulate the
people of ohio and of the west on
the advancing march of freedom and
pledge ourselves never to be found
wanting in furthering its progress till
every man enjoys equally the privileges
of citizenship
resolved that our friends to whose
exertions we are indebted for the re
peal need entertain no apprehension ofi
the verification of the predictions of our
enemies respecting what our conduct
will be in the future for as there was
before so shall there be after the re
peal a perfect exemplification of our
entire fitness to enjoy every right which
iod has vouchsafed us of which we
are now by mans injustice plundered
resolved that the repeal has added i
new strength to our arms fresh inspira
tion to our minds to struggle on and
ever till the shades pf hades shall
have become the receptacle for the last
vestige of the abominable spirit of com
plexional caste which now invests our
country and the colored people with
the whites enjoy all their godgiven
rights
resolved that to liberty of speech
right of petition an untrammeled press j
free states free soil and free men we
earnestly devote ourselves as doctrines i
paramount to all others sufficient if
faithfully preached and insisted upon
to wrk the annihilation of all heathen
ish prejudices proscription and chains
in this boasted republic making it all
that its fathers contemplated in its or
ganization or the friends of humanity
at the present day could wish
n hereas the declaration of inde
pendence ot the original thirteen states
ot tins l nion distinctly proclaims these
sublime truths that all men are
created equal that they ureendowedi
by their reator with certain unalieua
ble rights among which are life lib
erty and tile pursuit of happiness
and whereas the constitution oi ohio
not only reaffirms but explicitly adopts
the same in these words all men
are born equally free and independent
and have certain natural and inherent
and unalienable rights among which
are the enjoying and defending life and
liberty acquiring possessing and pro j
looting property and pursuing and obi
taming happiness and safety
resolved that  our opinion so
much of ohio law as contravenes these
heuveuborn truths arc a nonentity
the north star
resolved that we give a grand ju
bilee supper and that a committee ol
nine be appointed to make necessary
arrangements in regard thereto
resolved that there be a committee
of three appointed to select speakers
for the occasion and lo notify the public
as to the time and place we will as
semble
resolved that the north star

from tlie islington observer and reporter
letter of hon henry clay
new orleans feb it j 
dear sir prior to my departure
j from home in december last in behalf
 of yourself and other friends you ob
 tained from me a promise to make a
public exposition of my views and opin
ions upon a grave and important ques
tion which it was thus anticipated
would be much debated and considered
by the people of kentucky during this
year in consequence of the approach
ing convention summoned to amend
the present constitution i was not
even truly well when i left home and
owing to that cause and my confine
ment several weeks during my sojourn
in this city from the effects of an acci
dent which befel me i have delayed in
the fulfilment of iny promise which  
now propose to execute
the question to which i allude is
whether african slavery as it now ex
ists in kentucky shall be left to a per
petual or indefinite continuance or
some provision shall be made in the
constitution for its gradual and ulti
mate extinction
a few general observations will suf
fice my present purpose without enter
ing on the whole subject of slavery j
under all its bearings and in every j
aspect of it i am aware that there
i are respectable persons who believe
that slavery is a blessing that the in
stitution ought to exist in every well
organized society and that it is even
favorable to the preservation of liberty
happily the number who entertain
these extravagant opinions is not very
great and the time would be uselessly
occupied in an elaborate refutation of
them i would however remark that
if slavery be fraught with these al
leged benefits the principle on which
it is maintained would require that one
portion of the white race should be re
duced to bondage to serve another por
tion of the same race when black sub
jects of slavery could not be obtained
and that in africa where they may en
tertain as great a preference for their
color as we do for ours they would be
justified in reducing the white race to
slavery in order to secure the blessings
which that state is said to diffuse
an argument in support of reducing
the african race to slavery is some
times derived from their alleged infe
riority to the white faces but if this
argument be founded in fact as it may i
be but which i shall not now examine
it would prove entirely too much it
would prove that every white nation
which had made greater advances in
civilization knowledge and wisdom
than another white nation would have
the right to reduce the latter to a state
of bondage nay further if the prin
ciple of subjugation founded upon in 
tellectual superiority be true and be
applicable to races and to nationswhat
is to pi event its being applied to indi
viduals and then the wisest man in
the world would have a right to make
slaves of all the rest of mankind
if indeed we possess this intel
lectual superiority profoundly grateful
and thankful to him who has bestowed
it we ought to fulfil all the duties and
obligations which it imposes and these
would require us not to subjugate or
deal unjustly by jur fellowmen who
are less blessed than w t e are but to
instruct to improve and to enlighten
them
a vast majority of the people of the
united states i believe regret the in
troduction of slavery into the colonies
lament that a single slave treads our
soil deplore the necessity of the con
tinuance of slavery in any of the states
regard the institution as a great evil to
both races and would rejoice in the
adoption of any safe just and practi
cable plan for the removal of all slaves
from among us hitherto no such
satisfactory plan has been presented
when on the occasion ot the forma
tion of our present constitution of ken
tucky in  the question of the
gradual emancipation of slavery in the
state was agitated its friends had to
encounter a great obstacle in the fact
that there then existed no established
colony to which they could be trans
ported now by the successful estab
lishment of flourishing colonies on the
western coast ot africa the difficulty
has been obviated and i confess that
without indulging in any undue feelings
of superstition it does seem to me that
it may have been among the dispensa
tions of providence to permit the
wrongs under which africa has suffer
ed to be inflicted that her children
might be returned to their original home
civilized and imbued with the henigu
spirit of christianity and prepared ul
timately to redeem that great continent
from barbarism and idolatry
without undertaking to judge for
any other state it was my opinion in
 that kentucky was in a condition
to admit of the gradual emancipation of
her slaves and how deeply do i la
ment that a syatem with that object
right is of no sextruth is of no color god is the father of us all and all we are brethren
had not been established if it bad
j been be state would now be rid of all
t slaves my opinion has never changed
and i have frequently publicly express
ed it i should be tnost happy if what
was impracticable at that epoch could
now be accomplished
after full and deliberate considera
tion of the subject it appears to me
three principles should regulate the
establishment of a system of gradual
emancipation the first is that it
should be slow in its operation can
tious and gradual so as to occasion no
convulsion nor any rash nor sudden
disturbance in the existing habits of
society second that as an indispen
sable condition the emancipated slaves
i should w removed front the state to
some colony and thirdly that the
expenses of their transportation to such
colony including on outfit for  months
after arrival should be defrayed by a
fund to be raised from the labor of each
freed slave
nothing could be more unwise than
the immediate liberation of all the
slaves in the state comprehending both
sexes and all ages from that of tender
infancy to extreme old age it would
lead to the most frightful and fatal con
sequences any great change in the
condition of society should be marked
by extreme care and circumspection
the introduction of slavery into the
colonies was an operation of many
yearsduration and the work of their
removal from the united states can only
be effected after the lapse of a great
length of time
i think that a period should be fixed
when all born after it should be free at
a specified age all born before it re
maining slaves for life that period i
would suggest should be  or even
i  for on this and other arrange
ments of the system if adopted i in
cline to a liberal margin so as to obvi
ate as many objections and to unite as
many opinions as possible whether
the commencement of the operation of
the system be a little earlier or later is
not so important as that a day should
he permanently fixed from which we
could look forward with confidence to
the final termination of slavery within
the limits of the commonwealth
whatever may be the day fixed
whether  or  or any other
day all born after it i suggest should
he free at the age of twentyfive hut
be liable afterwards to he hired out
under the authority of the state for a
term not exceeding three years in or
der to raise a sum sufficient to pay the
expenses of their transportation to the
colony and to provide them at outfit
for six months aftey their arrival there
if descendants of those who are
themselves to be free at the age of 
were also to he considered as slaves
until they attained the same age and
this rule were continued indefinitely as
to time it is manifest that slavery would
he perpetuated instead of being termil
nated to guard against this consel
quence provision might be made that
the offspring of those who are to be
free at twentyfive should be free from
their birth hnt upon the condition that
they should be apprenticed until they j
were twentyone and be also after
wards liable to be hired out for a pe j
riod not exceeding three years for the
purpose of raising money to meet the
expenses of the colony and their sub
sistence for the first six months
the pensylvania act of emancipation
fixed the period of twentyeight for the
liberation of the slaves and provided
or her courts have since interpreted the
system to mean that the issue of all
who were to be free at the limited age
were from their births free the penn
sylvania system made no provision for
colonization
until the commencement of the sys
tem which i am endeavoring to sketch
i think all the legal rights of the pro
prietors of slaves in their fullest ex
tent ought to remain unimpaired and
unrestricted consequently they would
have the right to sell devise or re
move them from the state and in
the latter case without their offspring
being entitled to the benefit of emanci
pation for which the system provides
the colonization of the free
blacks as they successively arrive from
year to year at the age entitling them
to freedom  consider a condition ab
solutely indispensible without it i
should be utterly opposed to any scheme
of emancipation one hundred and
ninety odd thousand of blacks com
posing about onefourth of the popula
iation of the state with their descend
ants could never live in peace har
mony and equality with the residue of
the population the color passions
and prejudices would forever prevent
the two races from living together in a
state or cordial union sucial moral
and political degradation would be the
inevitable lot of the colored race even
in the free states  use te terms free
and slave states not in any sense de
rogatory from one class or implying
any superiority in the other but for the
sake of brevity that is their present
condition in some ot those free states
the penal legislation against the people
of color is quite as severe if not
harsher than it is in some of the slave
states as no where in the united
states are amalgamation and equality
between the two races possible it is
better that there should he a separa
tion and that the african descendants
should he returned to the native land of
their fathers
it will have been seen that the plan
i have suggested proposes the annual
transportation of all born after a speci
fied day upon their arrival at the pre
scribed age to the colony which may
he selected for their destination and
that this process of transportation is to
be continued until the separation of the
two races is completed if the eroan
rochester n y friday march  
cipatcd slaves were to remain in ken
lucky until they attained the age of 
it would be about  years before the
first annual transportation would be
begun if the system commenced in
 and about  years if its opera
tion began in 
what the number thus to be annually
transported would be cannot be pre
cisely ascertained i observe it stated
by the auditor that the increase of
slaves in kentucky last year was be
tween three and four thousand but as
that statement was made upon a com
parison of the aggregate number of all
the slaves of the state without regard
to births it does not i presume ex
hibit truly the natural increase
which was probably larger tba ag
gregate was affected by the introduc
tion and still more by the exportation 
of slaves  suppose that there would
not be less probably more than five
thousand to be transported the first
year ol the operation of the system
but afier it was in progress some years
theft would be a constant diminution of
the number
would it be practicable annually to
transport  persons from kentucky
there cannot be a doubt of it or even
a much larger iumber we receive
from europe annually emigrants to an
amount exceeding  at a cost
for the passage of about lo per head
and they embark at european ports
more distant from the united states
than the western coast of africa it
is true that the commercial marine em
ployed between europe and the united
states affords facilities in the trans
portation of emigrants at that low rate
which that engaged in the commerce
between liberia and this country does
not now supply but that commerce is
increasing and by the time the pro
posed system if adopted would go into
operation it will have greatly aug
mented if there were a certainty of
the annual transportation of not less
than  persons to africa it would
create a demand for transports and the
spirit of competition would i have no
doubt greatly diminish the present cost
of the passage that cost has been
stated upon good authority to be at
present o per head including the
passage and six months outfit after the
arrival of the emigrant in africa
whatever may be the cost and what
ever the number to be transported the
fund to be raised by the hire of the lib
erated slave for a period not exceeding
three years will he amply sufficient
the annual hire in the average may be
estimated at o or lo for the whole
term
colonization will be attended with
the painful effect of the separation of
the colonists from their parents and in
some instances from their children but
from the latter it will be only temporary
as they will follow and be again re
united their separation from their
parents will not be until after they have
attained a mature age nor greater than
voluntarily takes place with emigrants
from europe who leave their parents
behind it will be far less distressing
than what frequently occurs in the state
of slavery and will be attended with
the animating encouragement that the
colonists are transferred from a land of
bondage and degradation for them to
a land of liberty and equality
and d the expense of transporting
the liberated slave to the colony and
of maintaining him there for  months
i think ought to be provided for by a
fund derived from his labor in the man
ner already indicated he is the party
most benefited by emancipation it
would not be right to subject the non
slaveholder to any part of that expense
and the slaveholder will have made suf
ficient sacrifices without being exclu
sively burthened w ith taxes to raise that
fund the emancipated slaves could
be hired out for the time proposed by
the sheriff or other agent in each coun
ty who should be subject to strict ac
countability and it would be requi
site that there should be kept a register
of all the births of all children of color
alter the day fixed for the commence
ment of the system enforced by appro
propriate sanctiqns it would be a very
desirable regulation of law to have
births deaths and marriages of the
whole population of the state registered
and preserved as is done in most well
governed states
among other considerations which
unite in recommending to the state of
kentucky a system tor the gradual
abolition of slavery is that arising out
of her exposed conditionaffording great
facilities to the escape of her slaves
into the free states and into canada
she does not enjoy the security which
some of the slave states have by being
covered in depth by two or three slave
states intervening between them and
free states she has a greater length
of border on free states than any other
slave state in the union that border
is the ohio river extending from the
mouth of big sandy to the mouth of
the ohio a distance of near six hun
dred miles separating her from the
already powerful and growing states of
ohio indiana and illinois vast num
bers of slaves have fled from most of
the counties in kentucky from the
mouth of the big ssndy to the mouth of
the miami and the evil has increased
is increasing attempts to recover the
fugitives lead to most painful and irri
tating collisions hitherto counte
nance and assistance to the fugitives
has been chiefly effected by persons in
the state of ohio but it to be ap
prehended from the progressive opposi
tion to slavery that in process of time
similar facilities to the escape of slaves
would be found in the states of indiana
and illinois by means of railroads
canada can be reached from cin
cinnati in a little more than twenty
four hours

in tbe event of a civil war breaking
out or in the more direful event of a
dissolution of the union in consequence
of the existence of slavery kentucky
would become the theatre and bear the
brunt of the war she would doubtless
defend herself with her known valor
and gallantry but the superiority of
tbe numbers by which she would be
opposed would lay waste and devastate
her air fields her sister slave states
would fiy to her succor but even if
they should be successful in the une
qual conflict she never could ohtnin
any iudemnity for the inevitable rav
ages of the war
it may be urged that we ought not
by the gradual abolition of slavery to
separate ourselves from the other slave
states but continue to share with them
in all their future fortune the power
of each slave state within its limits
over the institution of slavery is abso
lute supreme and exclusiveexclu
sive of that of congress or of that of
any other state the government of
each slave state is bound by the highest
and most solemn obligations to dispose
of the question of slavery so as best to
promote the peace happiness and pros
perity of the people of the stateken
tucky being essentially a farming state
slave labor is less profitable if in
most of the other slave states they
find that labor more profitable in the
culture of the staples of cotton and
sugar they may perceive a reason in
that feeling of continuing slaverywhich
cannot be expected should control the
judgment of kentucky as to what may
be fitting and proper for her interests
if she should abolish slavery it would
be her duty and i trust that she would
be as ready as she now is to defend the
slave slates in the enjoyment of ail
their lawful and constitutional rights
her power politically and physically
would be greatly increased for the
one hundred and ninety odd thousand
slaves and their descendants would
be gradually superseded by an equal
number of white inhabitants who
would be estimated per capita and not
by the federal rule of threefifths pre
scribed for the colored race in the con
stitution of the united states
i have thus without reserve freely
expressed my opinion and presented
my views the interesting subject of
which i have treated would have ad
mitted of much enlargement but i
have desired to consult brevity but
the plan which i have proposed will
hardly be accused of being too early in
its commencement or too rapid in its
operation it will be more likely to
meet with contrary reproaches if it is
adopted it is to begin thirtyfour or
thirtynine years from the time of its
adoption as the one period or the other
shall be selected for its commence
ment how long a time it will take to
remove all the colored race from the
state by the annual transportation of
each years natural increase cannot be
exactly ascertained after the system
had been in operation some years i
think it probable from the manifest
blessings that would flow from it from
the diminished value of slave laborand
from the humanity and benevolence of
private individuals prompting a libera j
tion of their slaves and their transpor
tation a general disposition would exist
to accelerate and complete the work of
colonization
that the system will be attended with
some sacrifices on the part of slave
holders which arc to be regretted
need not be denied what great and
beueficiai enterprise was ever accom
plished without risk and sacrifice but
these sacrifices are distant contingent
and inconsiderable assuming the year
 for the commencement of the sys
tem all slaves born prior to that time
would remain such during their lives
and the personal loss of the slaveholder
would be only the difference in value of
a female slave whose offspring if she
had any born after the first day of
january  should be free at the
age of  or should be slaves for life
in the meantime if the right to remove
or sell the slave out of the state should
be exercised that trifling loss would not
be incurred the slaveholder after
the commencement of the system
would lose the difference in value be
tween slaves for life and slaves until
the age of twentyfive he might also
incur some inconsiderable expense in
rearing from their birth the issue of
those who were to be free at twenty
five until they were old enough to be
apprenticed out but as it is probable
that they would be most generally
bound to him be would receive some
indemnity for their services until they
attaioed their majority
most of the evils losses and misfor
tunes of human life have some corn
pensatton or alleviatioo the slave
holder is generally a landholder and i
am persuaded that ke would find in the
augmented productiveness of his lands
some if not fall indemity for losses
arising ta km from emancipation and
colonization he would also liberally
bare in aaeral benefits accruing
to the whole state from the extraction
of slavery these have been so often
and no fully stated that  will not nor
is it necessary to dwell upon them ex
tensively they may be summed up in
a few words we shall remove from
among os the contaminating influence
of a servile and degraded race of dif
ferent eolor we shall enjoy the proud
and cooscmhm satisfaction of placing
that race where they can enjoy the
great blessings of liberty and civil
political and social equality we shall
acquire the advantage of the diligence
tbe fidelity and the consistency of free
labor instead of the eareleasoeas the
infidelity and the unsteadiness of slave
iabor we shall elevata the character of
white labor and elevate the social con
dition of the white laborer augment
the value of our lauds improve the
agriculture of the state attract capital
from abroad to ail the pursuits of com
r merer manufacture and agriculture
redressingas far and as fast as we pru
i dently can any wrongs which the de
sceodants of africa have suffered at 
f our bands and we should demonstrate
the sincerity with which we pay
criminate homage to the great cause fj
the liberty of the human race
kentucky eujoys high respect and
honorable considerations throughout 
the union and throughout the civilized
world but in my humble opinion no
title which she has to the esteem and
admiration of mankind and i may
say no deeds of her former glorv
would equal in greatness and grandeur
that of lhwpioaecr in removing
from her soil every trace of human sla
very and in establishing the descend
ants of africa within her jurisdiction
in the native lands of their forefathers j
i have thus executed the promise i
made alluded to in the commencement
of this letter and i hope i have done it
calmly free from intemperance and so
 as to wound the sensibilities of none
i sincerely hope that the question may
be considered and decided without the
influence of party or passion  should
be most happy to have the good fortune
of coinciding in opinion with a majority
of the people of kentucky but ifthere
be a majority opposed to all gradual
schemes of emancipation however
much i may regret it my duty will be
to bow in subjection to their will if it
be perfectly certain and manifest that
such a majority exists i should think it
better not to agitate the question at all
since in that case it would bo useless
and might exercise a pernicious col
lateral influence upon the fair consid
eration of other amendments which
may be proposed to our constitution
if there be a majority of the people of
kentucky at this time adverse to touch
ing the institution of slavery as it now
exists we who had thought and wished
otherwise can only indulge the hope
that at some future time under better
auspices and with the blessings of
providence the cause which we have
so much at heart may be attended with
better success
in any event i shall have the satis
faction of having lerformcd a duty to
the state to the subject ana to myself
by placing my sentiments permanently
upon record
with great regard i am your friend

mr bemen was speaking there were j
cries of question question
mr berrien  who cries question 
a long pause ensued mr bemen looking
all around and repeating indignantly who
ones question
mr cameron i was so indignant at
hearing a gentleman of such standing as the
senator from georgia take the course he did
on the subject of slavery that i cried ques
tion
mr berrien after a long pause were
t not for the scorn  feel i should indulge in
something more than contempt at the source
from whence this interruption comes
mr cameron does the senator from
georgia apply his words  scorn and contempt
to me r
mr foote interrupting if he dofs
not i do and i am responsible for any scorn
and contempt a general laughter
mr berrien went on with his argument
mr foote with arms akimbo and in
ludicrous attitudes promenaded and fidgetted
about the chamber sometime after mr ber
riens argument he went near mr cameron
and said
you have no right here your timeisout
mr cs term expires march th
mr cameron struck at and hit mr foote
a lively blow
a senator near by held mr cameron
back and mr foote retired in a dignified
flareup
the senate was not called upon by any
member to notice the act and the general
disorder wa so great that it was observed
but by few

three fights

went on in a ludicrous ranting vein utterly
indescribable and utterly disgraceful to the

a whole cataract of words

for the honor of his country or the dignity of

while the walker amendment was under

the ieraoatic side of the house and spoke
lo a democratic free soiler and while in
conversation and exchanging humorous re
marks with him the gentleman in question
said that southern members had threatened
them with violence should they persist in their
efforts to defeat the bill meade of virginia
immediately stepped up and shaking his fist

violence to do right it there is no othet

said oh no  guess you will not hurl

meade then advanced and grabbed mr g
by the collar shook his fist in his face and
uttered a volley of oaths his face was white
and distorted with rage but mr giddings
was perfectly cool unruffled and collected
and even laughed outright in his face which
seemed the more to increase his fury
mr llenly of indiana who is about hall
the size of meade took him by the collar be
fore he had fully made up his mind to strike
mr giddings and sent him whirling about
two rods into the hands of the sergeant at
arms who kept him in custody until his rage
was softened down to the right temperature
the bill alluded to was finally amended
thanks to the noble daring of a gallant band
of free sellers as to substantially include

all over this country should have maintained

rochester march  
henry clay
the letter of this gentleman on the subject
of emancipation in the state of kentucky
which we have placed on the outside of this
weeks paper has very properly become the
subject of extensive remark by the newspaper
presses and the public generally both north
and south the longstanding and highly
influential positu n of mi clay as a states
man and politician and his unwearied hos
tility to the antislavery movement from its
commencement and the peculiar circum
stances in which the letter appears at this
time gives to it an importance which very
few papers emanating from any source on
any other subject could possess mr clay
has spoken at the right time to receive a gen
eral hearing he speaks at a time when
there is a general awakening north and
south and w hile his words will not receive
the unqualified approbation of the people ol
either section of the union his letter will dc
one great good in swelling the tide of dis
cussion on this subject in any event the
cause of freedom must gain by discussion
this letter comes almost providentially sue
ceeding as it does the recent address to the
i southern states the interest manifested ir
that address subsiding and straightway there
comes this letter though written in anothei
tone and devoted to another object is still
well calculated to keep up the common inter
est in the subject of slavery
the letter before us reveals perhaps raor
i fully and truthfully the real state of the mint
 and heart of its author than anything that
has emanated from him on this subject at an
previous time his speech in the united
i states senate delivered just ten years and
ten days before writing the present letter wa
made in circumstances which gave it the
coloring of party rather than that of the man
at that time the golden bauble of the presi
dents chair floated brightly before his excited
vision and the pathway of his mighty ambi
tion was thought to lie over the shattered
ruins of the youthful antislavery movement
to storm blast and destroy that movement
seemed indispensible to the grand attainment
sought for accordingly the desperate wori
was attempted armed for the conflict he
rushed forth in front of our antislaver
ranks throwing himself into the imminent
and deadly breach and in the wildness of a
reckless fanaticism vainly thinking to staj
the hand of god he exclaimed lam op
posed to emancipation either gradual or im
nudiatt he might as well have exclaimed
i am opposed to the sun rising in the morn
ing or the stats shining in the evening the
power that moves forward the cause of free
dom is far beyond the puny arm of mr clay
his speech in reply to mr mendenhall wai
made too in circumstances unfavorable tc
getting the most complete view of mr clay
real character construing an honest effbrl
on the part of mr mendenhall for the freedom
of the slave as designed to insult him and
stung to the quick by the awkward position
into which it placed him aroused all the
worst elements of his nature selfesteem
combativeness and destructiveness became
highly excited and he spoke out his bitterest
emotions telling mr mendenhall to gc
home and mind vour his own business
and that my his slaves are fat and sleek
with many other unguarded and ungentle
manlv remarks in both these cases mr
clay spoke under influences well calculated tc
lead him to disguise his real state of mind
the first speech was made in the light of the
presidency and was a desperate effort th
second under feelings of wounded pride in
dignation and wrath neither of these cause
seems to have operated in th
last flickering hope of reaching the presi
dential chair must have long since vanished
md age with tta many infirmities ha
overtaken him while yet far from the long
desired goal four yean must pass over him
before there is a tide that leads to the presi
dency insanity could not indulge hope
against such facts unbiasedthen by ehbet
influence named we assume the present let
ter of mr clay to be a air transcript of hi
heart and a complete illustration of lu char
acter and what a characterwhat a bean
m here revealed oi the ohotrmet qoeebooof
horaan rights his mind seems as dear aa that
of a chritaoa or a wilberfbcee regarding

when contemplating tbe many wrong of the
atare hia heart overflow with comp ton

money which eaianipaiiua may eaoaa to the
slaveholder his heart become as eom aa
iron read one paragraph and yon fee
cheered and gladdened with tbs joat and ho
aune sentiments it so welt expresses read
farther on and yoa are chilled to the aery
booes by the coldblooded sod heartleas man
ncr in which the subject is treated the
oretically the letter parpotls to advocate tbe
abolition of slavery practically it aims at
tbe expatriation of the colored people from
tbe state of kentucky in certain parts it
seems intended to hasten emancipation as a
whole it seems intended to retard and pot hi
away that happy event the whole letter is
a compound of opposite principleseloquent
but wrong and inconsistenta mending of
good and evila mixture of honesty and ras
cality of piety and blasphemy of wisdom
and folly
in reviewing tbe letter before us we would
be just and even generous to its tangoffending
author he is a mao though a wicked man
and one who has done as much probably aa
any other parson ia this country to degrade
and oppress the downtrodden and deeply in
jured people to whom we belong and with
whom we are classed gifted with powers of
speech and personal address to an extent at
tained by few and excelled perhaps by uooe
in this country he has again brought out
the tremendous influence which he wields to
blast the hopes and cover with the darkneat
of utter despair the bruised hearts of en
slaved millions wedded to that old atro
cious persecutor of the colored inhabitants ol
this landthe american colonization society
be has been held up by its agents as i
model philanthropist and christian and hia
means for evil have increased accordingly
representing the religious seatiment of the
nation being a member of the church he hu
pressed into the service of slavery and preju
dice the overwhelming force of our spuriouf
theology and yet we would not heat hire
as one wholly bad in whom there is nosparl
of goodness on the contrary we observe it
him traits of character evidences of feel
ings which prove him to be a man of i
generosity far above the average class o
slaveholders in this couotry and this ver
circumstance makes him all the more danger
ous and powerful for evil for it serves as th
soft veiduie of the field to conceal th
hideous folds of the viper ready to leap fortl
and destroy the unsuspecting
but we must now come to a more dost
and particular examination of this letter fo
though it contains nothing especially new am
presents no strong points which have not beei
a thousand times met and refuted the sourci
from which it emanates and the general in
terest which is taken in the subject may jus
vify a somewhat careful examination and refu
tat ion of those which it presents against th
just and speedy termination of slavery be
fore attending to the points about which w
differ we must thank mr clay for tbe fev
good things contained in this leter byi
very few strokes of the pen he has laid bar
the malignant doctiines of john c calhoun
 that slavery is a good institutionthat i
ought to be perpetuated for exposing thi
infernal heresy we thank mr clay wi
thank him for admitting that this doctrin
would enslave a white as readily and properl
as a black race we thank him that he doe
not fully endorse that wicked doctrine of th
natural inferiority of the colored race bu
above all we thank him for laying down
platform for himself and the people of thi
united states generallya broad and gloriou
platform worthy the head and heart of i
garrison or a gerrit smith this platforn
is in the following language
if indeed we possess this intellectun
superiority profoundly grateful and thankfu
to him who has bestowed it we ought to ful
fil all the duties and obligations which it im
poses and these would require us not to sub
jugate or deal unjustly by our fellow men wh
are less blessed than we are but to instruct t
improve and to enlighten them
these are great wordsa plain simple
yet beautiful declaration of sentiments
would to heaveu they were backed up by the
life of the man who put them forth but
alas words are but words sound or holloa
according to the character of him who utten
them in the light however of these wotds
let us examine this letter for they contain
the light of a high moral sense a deeply re
ligious sentimentin a word they are a
transcript of the mind of christ as shown
forth in the new testament granting that
the while people then are mentally and
morally superior to those of a darker hue
mr clay says that tbe assumption imposes
the duty and obligation on the former to
instruct to improve and to enlighten the
latter now how does mi clay propose tc
discharge these high duties and obligations 
by establishing schoolsby ceasing to en
slave and plunder these people  no bat by
setting a day some thirty years hence when
they ah all be peremptorily and legislatively
driven from their homes friends and relations
into a far distant land far beyond the  in
structig improving and enlightening influ
ences of this superior race instead of seek
ing to instruct to improve and enlighten the
colored people of kentucky be seeks to gel
them beyond the reach of bis influencetc
get rid of them altogether how unutterably
inconsistent unjust and mean is this treat
ment if as a general principle is ia the
duty of races of superior endowments or at
tainments  to instruct to improve and en
lighten those less fsvoted in theae reaper ts
how much more ia it the duty of the white
people of kentucky to perform this chrialiaa
office for the colored people of that state
their ignorance and degradation and poverty
aa men aside from any other consideration
would naturally suggest the discharge of this
duty but a stronger appeal ia made whan
it ia remembered that much if net ao the
ignorance debasement and poverty of the
mack in that state has been forced open
them by this very white nee that now boast
and thanks god for ha superior endowments
in this view of the ease the doties alleged
become positive and solemn
kentucky it is trne does net present to
the world so prosperous an sport aa many of
the fra states bet to whom is she indebted
to what f fnr weal aod wf wily
whack has thm fe r steaded her while pop
letioa what hand has slaia her wee deso
late flitmi and spread oat to fee light
at tha mo vast region drainnd fertilized and
ear idled but the hand of this cable race
theae hare labosed and the whites have re
ceived the reward theae have toiled that
othera might tire in eaae then poverty hat
become the riches of their creel enslavers
their hard earning instead of being appro
priated to the instreetion improvement and
enlightenment of their children have been
devoted to the instruction improvement aud
enlightenment of the children of their white
oppressors for theae they have labored
under a horning sen and a stinging lash
without wages and without hope under no
other incentive to industry than the tetror in
spired by the bloody lash
for all this mr clay would compensate
them by setting a time beyond the avenge
length of homan life when all children born
after  shall be free how freeto
stay in the land of their birth and enjoy a
monel of the fruit of their toil and that of
their ancestors no but to be driven out
of the state out of the country without in
slruction without improvement and without
enlightenment twentyfive years according
to mr clays plan they must be subjected to
all the cruel exactions of the slave code and
subjected to all the liabilities of other chattels
to be bought and told mortgaged and deeded
away like bones sheep and swine consoled
by the reflection that when they have attained
the age of twentyfive yean they are to be
hired out under the authority af the state
three years at fifty dollars ajrear to raise
money to pay rta their own expatriation
could anything be more cruel and monstrous
than this yet this is mr clays mode of
doing justice instructing improving and en
lightening the poor slaves of the state ol
kentucky a more insulting and villanoua
mode of treating the colored people of that
state could not well be devised the authoi
of it seems to have pressed every humane
sentiment for the time being from his heart
and to have set down to his work with all the
cool calculating malignity of a bloodthirst y
pirate not content with placing the hope
of freedom far beyond the reach of the pres
ent generation and onehalf of the next he
provides that these destined to enjoy it shal
be colonized expatriated and that they shal
furnish the means for their own expatriation
thus showing that it is not for emancipatior
that mr clay is contending but banishment
it is not for the freedom of the slave but the
freedom of kentucky it is not to benefit the
slave but the slaveholder in this plan foi
emancipation there is every provision for the
slaveholders advantage and none for the
slave thirtyfour years are to elapse before
the first crop of slaves is to be effected
thirtyfour years is a sufficient space ir
which to provide against all the losses whicl
might otherwise ensue mr clay virtually
exhorts the slaveholders of kentucky as the
best means of promoting their interest t
commence at once to sell off their slaves t
the far south to crowd the new orleans
market with their human chattels come
brother slaveholders the cause of freedon
demands that you fill up your empty coffer
with bloodstained gold you can do so nov
in a manner which shall be as honorable as i
is profitable you may sell off your slaves
and call it emancipation here is a chance o
freeing the state without freeing the slave
you may now revive the slavetrade with al
its hellish enormities in the name of freedon
and humanity if the market be not goo
now remember that you have thirtyfou
years before you wait until prices are higher
indeed you may keep your fiist crop unti
they arc in their twentyfifth year and just ai
they are making up their minds and layinj
out plans for improvement and happiness ii
liberia you can sell them off in louisiana
and thus will our beloved state of kentucki
be tree from slavery and be distinguished fo
benevolence and philanthropy while in ver
truth you will not lose a farthing this w
affirm to be a fair reading the very pith o
mr clays reasoning on this point and iti
gross fraud deception and injustice is to
palpable to need a single word of comment
one word further about colonization w
hold it to be downright impudence for mr
clay or any one else to propose the removal
of any member of the human family to anj
quarter of the habitable globe and the very
climax of injustice and tyranny for any class
of persons to force such removal upon an
other class how dare henry clay or any
one else undertake to decide where an equal
brother man shall live he has just as much
right to murder the slaves where they are as
to force them to leave this country where they
are free the wrong in the oae ease only
differs in extent not in quality humble as
we are degraded imbruted and enslaved as
we have been if henry clay or any one else
should propose to remove us he would have
his insolence rebuked and if he should force
us it would be fotce against force if we
could speak to the colored people of ken
tucky we would counsel them not to dream
of leaving kentucky but would entreat them
to stand by their homes and firesidesto pre
fer death in kentucky rather than be driven
to liberia or elsewhere but we think there
very little if any probability that this alter
native will be presented the colored people
of kentucky arc too useful as laborers and
the sagacious land owners are too much dis
posed to consult their own inleiest even to
urge the colored laborer to leave the state
extinguish slavery and the veiy elements
upon which colonization has a name to live in
the south is destroyed no one sooth
would ever bare thought of colonising the
free blacks of the south bat that the presence
of the free spread discontent among the slave
population bnt how will colonization exist
when the foundation upon which h rests
ball cease to exist the one will go down
with the other
but let us bear me clay on un mediate
emancipation
nothing could have been more on wise than
the immediate liberation of all the state com
ptehendiag both aexas and all ages from that
of tender lafeacy to extreme old age it
would lead to tha moat frightful and fatal con

where else they exist only in his own
wicked imagination the wicked flee where
no man pursocth
bat of what ie mr clay afraid is it that
the emancipated slate would make war
spun the slaveholder because of his emanci
pation does he suppose that the slave would
be so enraged with his benevolent master for
ceasing to enslave him that be would take
veugeoce upon him for that act or does be
imagine that the slaveholders themselves and
the white people generally ot the state of
kentucky are so barbarous and tyrannical
that they would make war upon the freed
slavesimply because be free and attempt
to exterminate him or does be suppose that
the slaves are so feeble and helpless that they
could not take care of themselves if any
one or all of these consequences be really
apprehended by mr clay he is ftainly
more ignorant of human nature than he has
generally been supposed to be
in our judgment there is not the slightest
reason to apprehend unhappy differences be
tween the white people of kentucky and the
freed slaves it is not to be supposed that
the slave il bound up to the foil stature of
a freeman the moment his fetters fall from
his limbs or that he will swell up into a
very high estimate of his own dignity all at
once no the transition from slavery to
freedom will be long and slow even after the
slave is legally emancipated a sense ol
gratitude always strong in the oppressed
would lead them to respect and reverence
their former owners while the good sense
of the latter would always enable them tc
cultivate this feeling by doing just whai
henry clay says to do instruct
ing improving and enlightening them
it was long after we came to the north er
we ever thought ourselves on an equality
with white persons we long treated then
perhaps we do now as our superiors
no one not even  slaveholder could exac
more politeness than we were disposed t
render every respectable white person wit
whom we had any business judging fron
our own experience then we feel warrantei
in saying that no danger need be appre
hended from immediate emancipation on tha
score to suppose that the act of emancipa
tion would at once change the passive slavi
into a proud and revengeful freeman is t
suppose an absurdity gross and palpable
no mr clay the change will be gradua
enough when the great point of eraanci
pation shall have been gained long and darl
will be the years through which the free
bondman will have to pass ere he shall b
folly clear of the badge of servitude sunkei
deep into his mental constitution by th
bondage of ages no fears of haste of in

possible with him in their new vocation by
seeking first the kingdom of heaven
that is to follow him and in their walks
through life they would find means adequate
to their wants and demands all this may
have been necessary for those first called to
promote the doctrines of eternal truth in that
early period of the worlds dark history and
portion of the semiheathen nations of the
earth but that it applied to none but the
disciples and is not now necessary it has
not been since the days of the seventytwo
apostles restricted nor verified
it is then clear that so far as we are con
cerned we labor under the most egregious
the most shameful error this however is
but the result of oppression and degradation
a legitimate offspring an unerring compliance
with the hellorigiuated mandates of slavery
the slaveholder iand proslavery mandebas
ing hypocrites of the country have so taught
our fathers and they unfortuately in turn
have taught them to us
the devices of the oppressor are never
failing they are almost omnipotent they
possess a charm over the oppressed almost
like magic art like the great national policy
of the slaveholders of the south holding
most prominently before the eyes of the north
the subjects of banks and tariff about which
to scramble and dispute us the sine que non
of their national existence in order to hold

the greater power so have both north and
south united in holding ou in bold projec
tion before the eves of the colored people of
this country the hope of heaven as alone
sufficient to obtain every earthly and temporal
desire nothing else in this world being worth j
living for who while they are dejected cast
down spiritless and sighing in hope of aj
better world are concocting the most suc
cessful schemes to keep them in submission
and bondage this is the object of the
oppressor in teaching such doctrines to col
ored people
this earth and its fullness were created for
high and holy purposesthe special benefit of
man man as the first command given him
after shown the works of creation was to
have dominion over the earth to possess its
productions and enjoy them to enjoy them
aright would be to appropriate a portion of
them in works of goodness thereby rendering
assistance to his fellows man must first
possess before he can contribute or appro
priate
w e were commanded to do unto others as
we would they should do unto usassist the
poor and needy c but how can we who
oppose every effort to obtain the good things
of this world even as christians comply with
this divine command we cannot having
nothing to give there can from us be nothing
relieved we sre therefore naught but pau
pers and beggars upon the face of the earth
a pest and cumbrance to society as christ
himself though with much commiseration
in his allusion compares the beggar to the
thief o the dunghill we must become
sensibly awakened and alarmingiy aroused
to our real condition compared with those by
whom we are surrounded the favored class
the white man is the rulerthe colored
man the subject the white man is ambitious
for the mastery the colored man submits to
be the servant the white man will not live
without a country though he must gain it by
usurpation and blood the colored man is
content to sojourn a it were denied of every
right and privilege tending to make him equal
to his fellows the white man and woman
are not satisfied without a large portion of this
worlds goods and the fullness of their en
joyment but the colored man and woman
are perfectly satisfied contented and happy
in the language of the slaveholder to live in
the service of god and eventually die and get
to heaven ihe white man possesses all
the earth with a fair prospect of heaven
the colored man has nothing of this earth
with only the same prospect of the white
man mans mission is an earthly one and
god intended that we should take an equal
part in the discharge of its various dulies
to do this we mnst have means and to ob
tain them we the colored people must pur
sue the same course in the various depart
ments of life that others do
we must be willing because it is as con
trary to nature as the blending of light and
darkness to cease looking to providence to do
that fur us which god has given us the ability
and means to do for ourselves god works
by means and not by miracles he has placed
within our reach means for the accomplish
ment of certain ends the application of these
means will attain the end aimed at or desired
v e must therefore become a business money
making people prayer and praises only fill
ones soul with emotion but can never fill his
month with bread nor his pocket with money
whilst colored people are hofino the white
man is doing we most also do if we desire
the same enjoyments and possessions of this
life we must learn how to gain a living to
make out bread the first lesson of which has
not yet been taught u we have not yet
lost the feeling common to master and serv
ant and anttl this is the case we are only fit
for slaves colored people most cease their
servile occupations and get into business re
spectable occupations and thereby cease to be
boys and girls taking their places
among men and women in soeiety
we shall next show the laws by which
god governs the destinies of man the possi
bility and impossibility of mans attaining
certain ends and that all men may attain the
same end by the applies ion of certain means
hence it is possible for colored people to at
tain all that the whites have attained

northern proslavery vents its volunteer
malignity upon those whose complexion iden

southern cupidity and tyranny and to what
ever department or enterprise a colored man

aside to such an extent has this unholy
proscription been applied that it is now an
axiom among abolitionists that when a col

his own his native land it is by chance
and not intent
the recent rejection of william h topp
from the albany young mens association
as set forth in the correspondence published
in last weeks paper adds one more fact ti
the infamous catalogue of insults heaped upor

mr topp is a gentleman proverbial for al

star it before me i am surprised to see my
letter in it it would hare been written more
carefully had  supposed that you would
print it
you admit that the constitution of the

only in the light of its letter is not a pro
slavery instrument this admission is fatal
to your argument you must tetract it or
you cannot prove your argument you must
as the lawyers say get leave to amend
your declaration
if the constitution is capable of being
construed in the light of its letter it is utterly
conttary to the law of interpretation to at
tempt to prove it in any other light or by any
other aid
you allude  to the opinions of the men
who framed and adopted it and tot lie practice
under it but nothing of all this can be
ycsortcd to to discover iu meaning if us
meaning can he discerned through its letter
 wait for you toreiract your admission and
to take a new position will the new posi
tion be that it is doubtful whether the letter
of the constitution is for or against slavery  j
then shall  claim the benefit of your doubts
for liberty and that you pronounce the con
stitution antislavery v ill your new posi
tion be that the letter of the constitution is
proslayery then will  ask you to prove
it and to prove not merely that in its im
puted form and threefifths persons and fugi
tives from services slaves to for
if you could prove all this the material thing
would nevertheless remain unproved the
material thing for you to prove is that the
federal government lias not power under
the federal constitution to abolish every
part of american slavery for if it has
this power then clearly it is not wrong asj
you hold it is to vote under it that it has
power  need not now say whether through

colored citiseiship in ohio
it may be thought by many abroad that
when the ohio legislature repealed the
black laws it thereby removed all the
disabilities that colored persons have labored
under for the last forty years in this state
the only real practical benefit however re
sulting from that action is a simple recogni
tion of the right tu admit the testimony of
colored and white persons in all matters of
law upon the same footing
the portion of those laws requiring the
forcible expulsion of all black or mulatto
persons who had emigrated to the state
with a view to a permanent settlement in
every case where they had not complied with
the law that demanded them to enter into
bonds and security within twenty days after
their arrival and making it a penal crime for
a w hite to give any such persons employment
until they have done so had from the periods
of their several enactments been looked on as
utterly at variance with justice impracticable
and inconsistent in their operations and in
the main so utterly abortive in reaching the
evils sought to be remedied that they were
allowed with one or two exceptions to re
main upon the statutes unenforced
we readily award the tribute of thanks
and gratitude to those who voted for repeal
with the prospect of ameliorating the condi
tion of their colored fellowcitizens every
one however who cooperated with the ma
jority and helped to bring about a result
which at heart they were opposed to declar
ing that they were impelled from considera
tions of party interests only ridiculing abus
ing and besmearing us with slime from their
filthy tongues on every occasion deserves
contempt and contempt only
as a choice i had sooner dwell in the
depths of obscurity and be the passive object
of political persecution than to know the
humiliating fact that we are indebted to such
a pandering set of graceless demagogues for
this mock equality so recently bestowed
the work though well begun remains
unfinished it is true the black laws are
repealed but then as i have just said they
have never had as a whole a practical exist
ence other than to foster and keep alive a
prejudice seriously injurious to our interest
therefore in our many petitions to the legis
lature we begged to have them and all other
law s imposing distinctions on account of color
repealed to settle these clamorous demands
constantly pouring in from all parts of the
state and to give the vexed question its qui
etus the black code was expunged other
laws however still remain branding the col
ored man with infeiiority and sinking him
below the level of a common equality by
them he is regardless of intelligence or ca
pacity debarred the privilege of a seat as a
juror even in litigating upon the rights of
other colored persons the public funds for
the benefit of the poor are not for colored
paupeis they are shut out of the poorhouses
and left to die of want in the streets
the new school law is founded upon the
j basis of distinction on account of color
inasmuch as it provides for the separate estab
lishment of schools for the education of col
ored children these are sustained by a dis
tinct fund from levies made on jhe taxable
property of colored persons alone
the state of ohio has long boasted of her
eomnion school system because it gives the
child of the poorest man in the common
i wealth an equal chance with the rich tax
payer in the attainment of a popular educa
tion no such advantages are held out t
large numbers of children of colored persons
j they are virtually excluded from the benefits
of common schools unless they constitute
themselves communities sufficiently large and
wealthy to sustain them to illustrate this
in the county where i at present reside the
colored population will scarcely number one
hundred the most of whom are poor farmers
living on rented lands the children of these
would possibly amount to enough to require
the establishment of one district school th
inconvenience and expense of attending this
to persons living in remote parts of the county
can be easily understood and what is still
worse if the tax on their property is insuf
ficient to keep it up they cannot have any
tor the reason that monies from the general
school fund are not allowed for its sustenance
this new law then making liberal provisions
for the purpose of educating colored children
j fails in attaining the ends for which it was
said to be created those difficulties will
always continue to exist and many others so
long as partial legislation predominates de
nying the doctrine of the equality of all men
and making invidious distinctions on account
either of caste or color sect or condition

it you think worthy
tbe picture he drew sir of thirty thou

intellectual debasement portrayed is true to
the life hoar in w f everything can it
jbe otherwise we bring beery charge
i against the church and people of this country
which they themselves eaa hardly deny but
hare we not been and are we not still add
j ing fuel to the flameor do our efforu to
i the coatrary succeed aa we hare reason to
expect we are not satisfied with the resell
to erery waymay be we hare reason for not
being with others  hare for some time
doubted the efficiency of the means for the
end do you not think air that we ahoald
direct our attention more to the fanning inter
eat than hitherto i suggest this as con
corning the entire people the estimation in
which we woold be held by those in power
would be quite different were we producers
sod not merely as now consumers he air
proposed a conrention without distinction of
caete a proposition which no doubt will be
acceptable because by exchanging news with
those who hare erery advantage we are ma
terially benefitted persons likely to associate
with our people in such manner are generally
educated people ard possessed of depth of
sentiment their influence on tie should not
be lightly considered vi e hare been holding
conreotions fur years hare been assembling
together and whining orer our difficulties and
afflictions passing resolutions on resolutions
to any extent but it does really seem that we
hare made but little progress considering our
resolves we hare put forth few practical
efforts to an end i as one of the people
see no need for our distinctive meetings if
we do not do something we should do
more and talk less what intellectually we
most need and the absence of which we most
feel is the knowledge of the white man a
great amount of which by intercourse in
public meetings c we could glean and no
possible opportunity to seize upon which
should be allowed to escape should not the
importance of his literature upon us and
everything tending to add to his influence be
forcibly impressed and we be directed to that
course the great fault of our people is in
imitating his follies individual enterpriseand
selfreliance are not sufficiently insisted upon
the influence of a corrupt clergy among us
sapping our every means and as a compen
sation inculcating ignorance as a duty super
stition as true religionin short hanging like
millstones about our necks should be faith
fully proclaimed lam willing to be con
vinced to the contrary if possible but it does
really seem to me that our distinctive churches
and the frightfully wretched instruction of our
ministerstheir gross ignorance and insolent
bearing together with the sanctimonious
garb and by virtue of their calling a charac
ter for mystery they assume is attributable
more of the downright degradation of the free
colored people of ihe north than from the
effect of corrupt public opinion for sir not
withstanding the cry of prejudice against
color some think it will vanish by a change
of condition and that we can despite this
prejudice change that condition the min
isters assume to be instructors in every mat
tet a thing we would not object to provided
they taught even in accordance with the age
but in our literature they hang tenaciously to
exploded customs as if we were not crea
tures of progress as well as others as they
do in everything else the course of some
of our high priests makes your humble ser
vant and many others think money and not
the good of the people is at the bottom
the gieat aim of these gentlemen now is
secrecy in all affairs where our spiritual wel
fare is being considered our conferences
they say are too public the openstated
people and laymen learn as they should not
the transactions in conference and sessions of
these men of god depend upon it sir
menlove darkness rather than lightbecause
their deeds are evil one thing is clear
this hiding the light under a bushel is not to
those who dare think very satisfactory their
teaching tends to inculcate submission to them
in all things pay no attention to your
perishing bodies children but get your souls
converted prepare for heaven the elective
franchise would not profit you a desire for
such things indicates worldly mindedness
thus any effort to a change of condition by
our people is replied to and a shrinking
priestrid people are prevented from seeing
clearly the possibility of final success
when using proper means the means to be
used the possibility of bringing about the de
sired end ourselves and not waiting for the
whites of the country to do so should be im
pressed on the people by those teachers as
they assume to be the only true ones or at
least there should be no hindrance to their
seeing for themselves

from the tribune
virginia m ohio
about three years ago a slave of samuel
b brown of augusta co virginia ran away
from his master and as the latter alleges
stole and carried off sundry articles of value
to the state of ohio in january last the
governor of virginia made a requisition upon
the governor of ohio tor said slave as a fu
gitive from justice gov ford refused to
comply with the demand on the ground that
the alleged latceny was committed nearly
three years since and that no indictqient in
most cases the best evidence has been found
though there has been ample tune for it the
affidavit of the complaint moreover the
governor of ohio says is not signed by the
applicant as is usual in such cases and is

question has recently been raised at the u s
department of state which will probably
give rise to much discussion in its broadest
form the question is thishas the fedeial
government a legal right to deny to any cit
izen of a sovereign state of this confederacy
the character and privileges of a citizen of the
united states the question arose on an
application in due form to the slate depart
ment for passports for certain citizens ofnew
york who chanced to be born with dark skins
and who had their complexions been white
would have unquestionably been entitled to
and furnished with passports the gruff
answer from the passport clerk of the depart
ment is that passpoits are never granted under
such circumstances and that the applicant
ought to have known better than to apply tor
them that is to say an undoubted citizen
ofnewyork or massachusetts whose an
cestors were stolen from africa is no citizen
of the united states and not entitled to the
protection of the federal government

the very centre of the subject the

those longdrawn sentences with pa

literary men seldom find their opin
ions of each other improved after be
coming personally acquainted one
cause is that they in common with the
general w orld when hey do not per
sonally know an author are apt to
consider him more than he really is
either in intellect conversation looks
or manners or all of these because
there is a species of halo which mag
nifies and mystifies all the sons of mind
and tame and which even they cannot
pierce save by the divining rod of
personal acquaintance the natural
result of this is a reversion of judgment
to the opposite extreme by near ap
proach they see blemisnes in the man
and involuntarily associate them with
his intellect imagination before made
them exaggerate his deficiencies for
there is in the world little of that true
philosophy which is not in a degree

therefore we are displeased and un
i reasonably disappointed when we find
it coupled with manners or looks less
impressive the more we admire the
intellect the greater our chagrin at
the blemishes associated with it in the

erally find that the greatest men are

with more than proper daring and stub

have their own opinions as their mas

a ship among icebemgs
i
it is impossible to convey a correct 
idem of the beauty the magnificence of
the scenes in the arctic seas thou
sands of the most grotesque fanciful
and beautiful icebergs and icefields j
surrounded us on all sidesintersected
by numerous serpentine canals which
glittered in jhe sun for the weather
was fine all the time we were in the
straits like threads of silver twining
round ruined palaces of crystal the
masses assumed every variety of form
and size and many of them bore such
a striking resemblance to cathedrals
churches columns arches and spires
that i could almost fancy we had been
transported to one of the floating cities
of fairyland the rapid motion too
of our ship in what appeared a dead
calm added to the magical effect of the
scene a light but steady breeze urged
her along with considerable velocity
through a maze of ponds and canals
which from the immense quantity of
ice that surrounded them were calm
and unruffled as the surface of a mill
pond not a sound disturbed the de
lightful stillness of nature save the
gentle rippling of the vessels bow as
she sped on her way or the occasional
puffing of a lazy whale awakened from
a nap by our unceremonious intrusion
iof his domains now and then how
j ever iny reveries were disagreeably
interrupted by the ship coming into
sudden contact with huge lumps of ice
this happened occasionaly when we
arrived at the termination of one of
those natural canals through which we
i passed and found it necessary to force
our way into the next these con
cussions were very severe and even
made the ships bell ring but we heed
ed this little as the vessel was provided
with huge blocks of timber on her bows
called icepieces and was besdes built
expressly for sailing in the northern
seas it only became annoying at
i mealtimes when a spoonful of soup
would sometimes make a little private
excursion of its own over the shoulder
of the owner instead of into his mouth
as we proceeded the ice became more
closely packed and at last compelled
umo bore through it the ship how
ever was never altogether detained
 though much retarded i recollect
while thus surrounded filling a bucket
with water from a pool on the ice to
see whether it was fresh or not as i
had been rather sceptical upon this
point it was excellent and might
almost compete with the water from the
famous spring of crawleyballan

the return ln conversation with
a friend ot the legal profession a few
days since we heard an anecdote re
lated wich was one of the most for
cible lessons on the general subject of
war with which we have ever met the
son of aged parents went to the wars
and left them to wait for his return
their watch was a long and anxious
one and the night of their lonesome
ness seemed to be continually growing
darker they trembled at every sound
of joy and turned pale at every roar of
cannon lest it might herald some nev
victory and consequent mourning
month after month passed by with
more of actual suffering to those old
hearts than many warmakers bear in
all their lives they read with anxi
ety the papers every day and took a
terrible interest in the extras which
others bought with avidity and read
with exclamations of joy worn out
with painful expectation the old man
died and the mother waited now alone
the return of her son or the news of
his fall
we have always believed the boast
ed fortitude of roman mothers to have
been fabulous it was at least un
natural that any woman should rejoice
in the unnoticed fall of her nameless
son and comfort herself with the
thoughts that he died for his country
if they were so callous or shall we say
patriotic and were ready to see their
sons brought home dead on their shield
or hear that they were left to slumber
on fields where they had perished we
can only say that the days of such
sacrifices have passed and mothers
are more womanly now
this mother waited long and had the
mournful joy of receiving at length the
battered and useless body of her son
with but a remnant ef life in it and
what glory he unknown among his
thousand comrades brought back from
mexico tending him with careful
affection for the few weeks that he
survived she at length gave him up to
god she is now alone and her lone
liness her long days and sorrowful
nights must preach powerful sermons
to men who know her history against
the unrighteousness of war journal

street for twelve years but the flower
was evidently inthe stone when quar
ried perhaps it had been from time
whereof the memory of man runneth
not to ihe contrary aye for aught we
know it is an antedeluvian flower mr
s s young says the flower resembles
the hibiscus species but the leaf is
more neaily the rose hut it is not like
any flower a native of this country nor
todeed like any exotic cultivated here
he adds i it most probably grew in
