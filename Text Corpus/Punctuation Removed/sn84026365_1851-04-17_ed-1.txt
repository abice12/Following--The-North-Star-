speech of geo thompson in toronto
citizens of toronto the adver
tisements which have convened this
meeting have already informed you
that i appear in this hall tonight to de
liver a lecture upon the evils of sla
very idoso on the invitation of the
antislavery society of canada i re
joice over the formation of that body
and that its head quarters are to be in
this beautiful improving and important
city it was called into existence as i
learn from its constitution to cry
loud to your neighbors beyond the
line to stay their hands from prosecu
i ig a sys em of iniquity and to invite
and urge them by every consideration
arising from our common christianity
to put a stop to it forever by the abo
lition of slavery  am glad to find
that this duty is to be performed in the
spirit of those who entertain the feelings
of brethren and friends toward the in
habitants ofihe neighboring slates and
that you disclaim any desire to inter
meddle ofliciousy with the internal af
fair of lhil great glowing mid mighty
people from whom you are separated
by so short a distance the work you
have purposed to yourselves is worthy
of you and the pirit in which you pro
pose to prosecute it is worthy of you
aud of those with whom you purpose to
conperate as of those also to whom
your christian remonstrances and
brotherly rebukes will be directed i
am rejoiced to find also that you hear
tily bid godspeed to the noble and
everincreasing band of christians and
patriots in the united states who pub
licly plead without fear or favor the
cause ol their enslaved fellowcitizens
in this you do well the true aboli
tionists ol the united states are emi
nently worthy of your admiration your
encouragement and gd speed the
world does not contain a nobler band
of men and women in proportion as
you learn to know them you will
leayn to love them and to regard
them as that part of the popula
tion of the great american union who
are doing most for the diffusion of those
divine principles which lie at the foun
dation of the great doctrine of the uni
versal brotherhood of man and of the
equal regard of our common parent for
all the children of the human family
at a british subject i feel peculiarly
happy in being with you on this occa i
ion lam increasingly happy to find
myself upon the same platform in the
new world with those who have been
my fellowlaborers in the cause of
emancipation in the old worldto find
them still alive active and vigorous in
the cause in which we labored and tri
umphed on the shores of our native
cou try to find too that they have
faith in the power and universality ol
the truths which were successfully aj
plied to our own colonial system of ne
gro bondage this is as it should be
wc won the victory over west indian
bondagenot because we were brit
ons hut because the truths we
preached were divine universal and
ternal tins is no question of lati
tude and longitudeit is a human
auestion i ask not is the slave my
fellowsubject but is he a man i ask
not do  stand upon british or amer
ican soil but am i still in gods domin
ions am i still under the law of the
supreme ruler and are the great
pruciples of morality and justice still
tat same if my brother is held in un
just bondage my message is the same
whether it be to my own or any other
human government thus saith the
lord break every yoke and let the
oppressed go free i have come
anongst you to ciscuss the question on
no low or narrow grounds in my
wind it ftiks itself indissolubly with
very topic within the entire range of
religion and human duty it ascends
to the very being of god and has to do
with his character his attributes and
hi moral government of the world it
entwinos itself around the spiritual na
ture hopes fears joys sorrowsthe
present condition and future destinies
of man it must be understood before

if we would know who is our neighbor
and what is our duty towards him or
to what extent we are authorized in ap
plying the principles of the everlasting
ffosnel end the truths at i
the affairs of the world as far as i
have been connected with the great
question of slavery it has been with me
a question of politics it is transcend
encyit is infinitely above all human
politics if there be a principle at the
bottom of this questionor in other
words if there be any truth in the doc
trine that there is a godthat he is the
creator and governor of the world
that he is the sole proprieior of man
and that man belongs of right to him
self and is responsible only to the su
preme ruler lor his actions then sla
very is not an institution to be
regulated but a crime to be abol
ishednot a condition to be mod
ified but a wrong to be redrcssed
i then religiou and morality demand that
he evil doer return to the allegiance he
owes to god and the slave be instantly
restored to his rights as a man this
whole subject revolves itself into the
question can man hold property in
man if this question be answered in
the affirmative then we have no ground
to stand upon then ve are impel ti
nent intermeddles whether we speak
against slavery on english canadian
or american soil but if it be an
swered in the negative then our feet
are placed upon a rock and our com
mission is go ye into all the world
and wherever ye find the divine crea
tor and sole proprietor of man de
throned by the usurpation of his pre
rogative denounce the daring impiety
and that god be restored ro his rightful
dominion by the restoration of liberty
to that subject of his government who
who is now held in chattel bond
age giant that inan may hold prop
erty in man and you are a trespass i
on the plantation and an invader of le

ject of the king of kuigsthe vindica

government aye and the savior ot
the slaveholder himself go foith in
the strong belief that man cannot have
property in man and you are at once
a coworker with god you aie ai
once in harmony with universal truth
your doctrine finds an eclio in every
human heartthe consciences of all
meft are on your sideyou have at
once enlisted the affections agonies
exaltations and hopes of humanity on
your side can man hold property in
inan can man become a god on the
one hand can man become a beast on
he other can the master be man
and god in the same person or can
t ie slave be man and beast in the same
person can a creature own an equal
tellowcreature can the potsherd say
unto the potsherd thou art miner
can the sinner be god over his fellow
or can another man formed like him
be at once free to serve god and
doomed to serve a man be a rational
immortal and accountable soul in his
relation to god a marketable degra
ded beast who may be manacled
scourged branded hunted and shot
like a wild animal in his relation to
man has the master a soul so has
the slave is the master responsible
so is the slave has the master affec
tions so has the slave does the
master hope fear rejoice so does the
slave must the master be free that
he may fulfil the purposes for which he
was born and glorify god in the use of
his faculties so equally must the
man he calls his property would the
master if he were made a slave re
gard his doom as worse than death and
lose the crown of glory irom his brow
it is even so with the slave away for
ever then with the doctrine that has
tilled the world with woe that inan
whose breath is in his nostrils can have
property in his fellow man if these
views be admitted to be correct with
what feelings must that system be re
garded which makes merchandize ol
three millions of the human race or
one hundred and twenty times as many
as the entire population of the city ol
toronto a system too which entails
slavery upon the posterity of these
three millions to the very latest gene
ration yet such is the system which
at this moment sheds its balelul influ
ence over every part of the great re
public co which you are so near neigh
bors i hree millions of tmbrued men
women and children the chattels ol
 tyrannical and sordid menthe
disgrace us they are the curse ot their
species a moneymaking confedera
tion to which the stock is in human
hearts and human souls while other
men call themselves rich in flocks and
herds and fields and farms these men
count their riches according to the
number of souls that tremble at their
glance and the capacity of their hu
man cattle to increase and multiply
they rear children as you would rear
sheep or calvesthey put beauty and
lovliness and youth and purity and in
telligence and piety up at auction and
sell them to the highest bidder they
sell their own children without remorse
and are filling the shambles of america

those in america who ask whether
slavery is not a religious and divine irsti
tution and lor what is rnan enslaved
what great purpose is accomplished
by this robbery of godthe sacrilege
ot manthe wreck of soulthis anni
hilation of intellectthis wringing ot
the heartstrings of humanity this deg
radation of tho loftiest being in tin
world to the lowest condition of which
a tamed brute is capable is there
some grand object of stupendous mag
nitude which cannot be accomplished
unless this be done and which make
it expedient if not right that one portion
of the human race should be sacrificed
that the rest may be saved it is that
a few may be idle themselves and yet
sell rice tobacco sugar and cotton and
it is asked is slavery religious no
man need k whether slavery be irre
ligious can that be religious which
dethrones god and puts man in hif
place can that be religious which
strikes at the root at once of the free
dom responsibility dignity and happi
ness of man can that he religious
which makes one man a tyrant and an
other a slavel and creates a gulph be
tween them wide as that between tin
burning seraph near the throne ol
god and the reptile that lives upon
the vapor of a dungeon ask not
whether it can be religious lor your
own heart tells you it is not human
you shoot without remorse the wild
beast that comes into your fold and
steals the lambs of your flock sla
vfciy waits till the agony of the mother
is over to plunder her of the fruit of
her womb and to write beast upon that
brow which was intended to wear the
stamp of intelligence and the crown
of immortality how appalling is the
state ol america when viewed in con
nection with the prostration of politics
literature commerce social intercourse
and religion before the spirit of sla
very to the man who looks through
lorms ceremonies professions and
creeds to the actual and pervading
spirit of a nation america seems to
have no actuating principle but slavery
no god but slavery at the south the
soil is monopolized by it it over

a community must be it needs no sta

we know however from the records
of every day as well as from the de

south in regard to morals we know
that superadded to the vices ofthe fret
states there are crimes and immoral
ities peculiar to the region of slavery
we know that human lusts are with
out a check or restrain we know
that all that is precious to one of the
sexes is the sport of those who live to
fcratify their passions we know that
mariiage as an indissoluble tie as a
legal contract as protected by law as
giving the husband the right to defend
the wife is utterly unknown amongsi
the three millions of the south we
know that a bear in the forest has a
better chance of rearing unmolested bet
whelps and of keeping them when she
has reared them than the human
mother who suckles slaves we know
that symmetry and beauty are the cur
ses of their owners and mark them out
for infamy and perdition we know
that religion is made to coalesce vitn
this slate of things that the ministers
of religion are slaveholders slave
breeders graziers in human cattle

partners and coplunderers with the

of the south when on the track ol the

american will deny that i have drawn
a true picture of the state of his
country
no american will deny that the pro
slavery sentiment is the paramount sen
timent of tbe united states slavery
in america is superior to all law for it
is the controlling spirit of the country
there is no higher code than the
bloody enactments of slavery the
great religious controversy at this mo
ment in the united states is upon the
question whether there is any higher
law than the fugitive slave law and
the majoritythe vast majority of the
divines go for the superior authority of
the congress and preach openly to
their congregations that thus saith
millard fillmore is more binding than
thus saith the lord and that a letter
signed daniel webster is infinitely
more worthy of attention than the ser
mon on the mount if anything more
than another crn prove the horrid in
fluence and dominion of slavery in the
united states it is the fact that because
the demon hates tbe bible the chris
tian denominations of that country have
consented to withhold it from the three
millions of southern slaves yet if
any portion of the human race need
the bible heaven knows it is the
slaves this has always appeared to
me the fact which above all others
proved the demoralizing influence and
atheistical character of slaverythat
men who profess to regard tbe bible as
the word of god aud tbe revelation of
his will to tho children of non should
deliberate oonoeot to see it withhold
from their fellow immortal beings and
enter no protest against laws whicli
punish the second offence of teaching
the bible with the penalty of death
christians of toronto of all sects j
summon you tonight to the rescue o

dishonor cast upon it by slavery in the

rect hitherto since the formation of the

in the broadway tabernacle so absolute
however is the sway of the slave power in
that city and such the fear of mobocratic ex
cess stimulated by the union committee on
the one hand and the lawless rynders and
his crew on the other that no meetinghouse
or hall in that great city can be procured
either for the love of liberty or for gold for
the accommodation of the society neither
in the adjacent city of brooklyn can any
suitable building be obtained for this purpose

thomas simms claiifned to slavery
let the heavens weep and let hell be
merry slavery hii triumphed daniel
webster has at last obtained from boston
tue cradle ofliberty a living escrifice to ap
pease the slave god of the american union
a man guilty of no crime and charged with
none has been seized at the point of the
bayonet and doomed to a lot more terrible
than death from the heights of freedom
he has been hurled into the depths of slavery
to gratify three of the most infernal propensi
ties of mans malicious heart pride avarice
and revenge yes we say retenge blood
thirsty murderous revenge had not this
been the actuating motive the victim might
have been ransomed money could have sat
isfied avarice success might have soothed
wounded pride nothing can appease a slave
holders revenge but the torn back and warm
blood of his helpless victim
thomas is to be made an example of to
deter slaves from escaping the hateful house
of bondage he is to be tortured for the
amusement of his tormentois and to strike
terror to the hearts of his trembling compan
ions in bondage it is boston civilized re
fined christian and humane boston that has
furnished this sacrifice great god wil
thou not visit for these things wilt thou
not be avenged on such a nation as this
amid the deep distress and anguish which
this sad occunence has brought us there are
points of consolation connected with it which
while they do not help the man now on the
jiu slavery serve to mitigate the
disheartening effect of his surrender he
was carried off to slavery yet not with ease
he was overcome yet not without a strug
gle both on his own part and on the part of
his friends as soon as he found himself m
the hands of a legalized kidnapper he drew
out hia knife and stabbed the villain al
though not fatally overcome by superior
force he was imprisoned in the courthouse
to prevent a rescue onthe part of his friends
the temple of justice was literally surrounded
by chains and bayonets
the horrid menhunters only escaped a
deserved death by the precaution oi never
allowing themselves io walk forth in broad
daylight unprotected by an armed police and
the government strong and mighty as it is
did not even venture to confront the burning
indignation of the travelling public of new
england by taking the innocent man in fet
ters by the usual travelling conveyances
through the land but under cover of night
like a band of piiatea on the coast of africa
they hurried their victim oil to the lonely sea
sunounded by hired ruffians armed to the
teeth and lest daylight should find them in
the haibor of boston they were towed away
from the sight of humanity by a steamer pio
vided for the purpose
these and many other circumstances
which we have not space to natrate more than
slightly relieve the dark transaction of its dis
heartening effect upon those who had fondly
hoped that boston at least would escape the
damning infamy of returning a man to sla
very under the horrible provisions of the new
fugitive slave law
for our part shocked and sorrow stricken
as we are at the recapture of thomas
simms we can confess to no surprise nor
disappointment at this result from the
first we believed and we declared that be
lief even when the fugitive slave bill was
first intioduced into the senate by mr ma
son of virginia that the law if once en
acted would never want villains to execute
it if we are surprised at alt it is that so
strong a demonstration was made in boston
against its execution it is gratifying to be
lieve that nothing but the utter fruitlesness of
any attempt to rescue thomas simms pre
vented bis friends from rushing through the
bristliug bayonets of his captors to liberate
him
the government however had their plans
too well adjusted to make any such onset
successful the sole hope that we have of
defeating the execution of the fugitive slave
law while it remains a law is grounded
in the belief that there are a few fugitives still
remaining to be recaptuied whose regard for
their own lives and the lives of others wilj
not be bo strong as to hinder their shooting
dead any legalized robber who shall lay hand
upon them
the work to be done successfully must be
done instantly there must be no parleying
as soon as a man knows that there is a war
rant out for him he should place himself with
in his castle and perish in his own defence it
need be in these troublous times no colored
man should be without arms in his house if
not upon his person the having of weapons
is of some consequence and will inspire the
disposition to use them when the time comes
ia law that cannot be executed but by expo
sing the officers authorized to execute it to
deadly peril cannot long standr u

our readers another interesting letter from w
wells brown we rejoice to find our friend
still persevering in the pursuit of knowledge
and slill more do we rejoice to find such
maiked evidence of his tapid progress as his
several letters afford but a few years ago
he was a despised degraded whipscarred
slave knowing nothing of letters and now
we find him writing accounts of his travels in
a distant land of which a man reared under
the most favorable educational advantages
might be proud would to god that the
noble example of william wells brown were
more widely copied among tbose who escape
from slavery his noble aim his untiring
industry hia unquenchable zeal and his
manly fortitude under afflicting trials are
worthy of all imitation we have many pri
vate assurances from england of the value of
mr browns labors in the cause of freedom
and humanity and are most happy to find

for his destruction have not prevailed there

meeting with prayer
the rev mr may said
ladies and gentlemen of torontomy
position on this platform may seem at firal
sight an awkward perhaps an unbecoming
one  stand here in the presence of the
people of another nation to speak of the
great unrighteousness of my own and to
aak of you assistance to overthrow one of
the institutions of my country but i am a
minister of the christian religion and i
presume that all whom i have the pleasure
to see before me profess and feel respect
for the doctrines commandments example of
jesus christ you will not i trust deny his
authority he teaches us that humanity is more
to be regarded thannoionay indeed in
fidels have cast it at him as a reproach that
he does not inculcate patriotism tis tiue
his commandment is not thou shalt love thy
countryman better than any one else but
thou shalt love every manthy neighbor
as thyself when asked who is my neigh
bur he points the jewish inquirer to a sa
maritan a man belonging to a nation of all
others abhorient to the jews thus the
anointed of god the savior of the world
ptonounces his condemnation of all reserve
jimt aliamtiaii al fufitch ottuuic ol their
national or religious differences surely then
there should be none of this alienation or re
serve between us englishmen and ameri
cans who like kindred drops can so easily
mingle into one there should be no reserve
between us who have the same ancestry
who speak the same language read the same
books have the same bible worship the
same god especially between us canadians
and americans should there be no reserve
on a subject affecting our common humanity
and our common inheritance in the westein
world we who have joint possession ol
tho same continent who live in juxtaposition
separated from each only by an invisible
line drawn upon the evermoving waters
we who use hourly the same river and lakes as
a common thoroughfare and are daily crossing
and recrossing them in the ttansaclions of
business and the interchanges of social life
cheers we surely ought to be free frank
faithful and friendly in the the expression of
our opinions on a subject regarding the in
alienable rights ot man and should be ex
pected to cooperate heartily for the common
good of humanity we may live as long as
we please under separate governments but
we cannot please to have entirely separate in
terests nor separate our interests if we should
please the new postage arrangements are
mutually convenient to you and to us
cheers if the welland canal shall be
closed to us we alone shall not be the suf
ferers cheers reciprocal free trade is
as desirable to you canadians as it is to us
americans and if our infernal fugitive
slave law shall be enforced your shores
will be inundated by penniless men women
and children who must fly to you for pro
tection and for bread nor can you prevent
their coming nor can you refuse to take the
strangers in unless you choose rather to de
ny christ to repudiate your humanity and
throw open these fair realms of the british
queen to be also the hunting ground of
southern isavecatchers hear hear
canadians you cannot if your would avoid
being implicated with us either in opposing
or else in favoring the fugitive slave law
choose then this day whom you will serve
god or the devil already has the proposal
been made that you should strike hands with
our slaveholding oligarchy a recent to
ronto paper stales that it has recived a letter
from chatham complaining that the coun
try ia that vicinity is being inundated with
negroes from the united states and mak
ing the following significant suggestion
might not a further influx of negroes be
prevented and reciprocal free trade be obtained
by our agreeing to give up fugitive slaves l
undoubtedly the good that writer desires
might be easily obtained undoubtedly the
evil which that writer deprecates might be
averted on the conditions named but are you
ready to comply with those conditions  hear
me ye men ye britons ye christians of
canada are you ready to agree that you will
give up fugitives from slavery no are
you ready to renounce the most glorious
distinction of your mother land t to say that
yours shall not be like english soil no
that slaves may breathe in canada that though
they touch your country their shackles shall
not fall no no are you ready thus to
renounce the glory of englishmen to tarnish
the fair fame of britains queen to disown
your allegiance to the noblest principle of your
royal government no no that would
be a separation from the british empire to be
indeed deplored that would be annexation
to the united siates with a vengeanceyes
with the vengeance of insulted heaven but
it is for you to choosechrist or belial
the freedom of england or the despotism of
america hear heat
i there must be some perhaps many in this
province ready for the bargain diaboli
cal though it be newspapers are pretty
good thermometers of the public warmth or
coldness editors do not often advocate whal
they know will be offensive to their patrons
already then are you contaminated by yout
social ecclesiastical and commercial inter
course with my country hear how an ame
rican editor comments upon the piopoeet
annexation of canada to the slaveholding in
teresu of the united states so it seemi
after all says the rochester republican o
aprid that these boasted british lover o
liberty equality and philanthropy are read
to be exchanged for trade in cotton and breai
stuffs the white population of canada
he continues will soon become aware o
their theoretical philanhropy when they fim
themselves likely to be equalled or outnum
bered by a race whose nature habits anc
character are so little congenial to their own
their loye of the negro will vanish with tha
distance which gives enchantment to th
view
la it not time for you canadians to con
aider your danger and your duty the lep
rosy of slavery ia seen to be among you i
will spread throughout your body politic i
timely measures be not taken to eradicate it
but say you the abolitionists of americt
have come here and aak us to take part wit
them in overthrowing a peculiar institution
of their country that ia true and tbs
slaveholders or thtir emissaries cotne here
and demand that you shall help them to up
hold that peculiarinstitution now which
will you do yosr interference is invoked
on the one hand as well as on the other you
cannot long remain passive and neutral
choose yos must this day or on day
not far distant a nd can it be a matter of
indifference to you on which side you throw
your mflumce with which party you co
operate will it be equally well think you
in the sight of god whether you decide in
favor of the oppressor or in favor of the op
pressed will it be equally honorable to
your humanity and your religion whether
you insist that your country shall still and
forever be the refoge of the fugitive or the
hunting ground ot his pursuer answer this
question nowfor you are more likely to
answer it as you ought to day than you will
be if you tamper with it and parley about it
a year hear hw
slavery is a monster of so frightful mien
that to he hated needs but to be seen
yet seentoo oft familiar with her face
we first endure then pity then embrace
so it has been with us on the other side
of the nairow firth that divides us so it
will be wife you for ye r are men of like
passions of like infirmities with ourselves
our northern political parlies have made one
compromise after another with the slave
power until at last they have agreed that
o strait tjecornt tnimers ol menaye blood
hounds if our masters please they have
effected their devilish purpose proffering us
certain advantages in return for our subser
viency and they now are plying you with
the aame tempting bribea be not too sure
that you are proof against them you have
much to do with new york merchants and
they have pined hands with slaveholders
some time ago while i was in attendance
upon a meetng of the american antislavery
society in new york a prominent merchant
of that city slid to me i will not question
the good inteitions sf you abolitionists sla
very is a goat evil and the principles you
announce imf all be abstractly right enough
but sir we diall not allow you abolitionisls
to succeed in your undertaking why there
are millions f dollars that are due to the
merchants of new york from southern men
our security br the payment of which rests
ultimately tn mortgages on slaves
shame shane well sir was my re
ply if that hands in the way we shall not
care if you losi it all you deserve to lose
it all for so implicating yourselves with the
oppressors ot men applause never
theless this has been and is a serious bar
rier to the progress of our cause
it is obvious that a reciprocal free trade
would be even more advantageous to you than
to us and therefore you were the first to
propose bui it never will be allowed much
as you and ail iku people on our frontier de
sire u so long as the slavehoming power has
the ascendancy in our republic unless you
will come to taeir terms and agree to give
up their fugitie slaves you cannot foresee
how soon nor how far they will bring you to
acquiesce unless you now set your face as a
flint against tie base proposal with yon
then now is the accepted time now is
the day of your salvation from this great ini
quity now declare and let the sentiment
go forth throughout the province that free
trade or no trade with america the foot of the
manhunter shall lever track our soil im
mense applause
time waswe can look back and and see
when we might with comparative ease have
settled the question of slavery in favor of hu
manity twelve years after the united
states had confederated they formed our pres
ent constitution there our fathers might
have insisted on some provision for the aboli
tion of slavery the struggle with two or
three of the southern states might have been
severe but it could not have lasted long for
a more perfect union was essential to the
wellbeing of them all but the northern
members consented to a compromise implied
if not expressed and through that loop hole
all our subsequent troubles have crept in in
 the vas territory of louisiana was pur
chased and annexed without any proviso
against the perpetuity of slavery
in  the great controversy arose on the
admission of mwsouii but it resulted in the
fatal compromise proposed and carried by the
influence of hnry clay let him have the
glory and the shame then followed at al
most regular intervals successive steps down
ward into that depth of perdition where we
are now walfiwing the war with the
florida indians because they harbored runa
way slaves wal carried on at great expense
for several years and was brought to such a
close as the slaveholders desired in 
the annexation of texas was next perpe
trated that brought on the war and con
quest of mexico and the climax of our ini
quity was capped by the enactment of the
fugitive slave law the very men who
have been active in proci ring the passage of
that most wickrsd billand are now exerting
themselves without sparing of time or money
to enforce its requirements upon ussome of
those very men were foremost in their opposi
tion to the admission of missouri as a slave
state and to the annexation of texas yes
daniel webster who was the leader of our
antislavery host in  did more than any
other man to procure the enactment of the fu
gitive slave law in  and is as much en
titled to the gloty of that act as henry clay
is to the honor of being the father of the mis
souri compromise learn from our sad ex
perience to withstand the beginning of evil
hear hear if you yield now to the de
mands of the slaeholders power if you
make any corapromiae of the right if for
the sake of free trade and a more piofitable
commercial intercourse with america you
consent to exclude the fugitives from youi
holes there is no depth in this iniquity intc
which you may not fall as we have done in
deed this very first step which you are called
upon to take will be into the lowest deep
for if you consent to send back the fugilivf
into the hell of american slavery i know noi
what else you will need to do to make yot
as bad as we have become hear hear
hear
and if you do not consent to this you raaj
beas the writer from chatham apprehends
you may be overrun by the poor victims oi
our republican despotism thousands whe
have been livißg in security iu the free states
are now turning their eyes to canals as the
only place of refuge it is not unlikely that
they may come io upon you in each numbers
that with all your hospitality you cannot en
teitain them with all your abundance you
cannot supply their wants with all your un
cultivated lands you cannot find them employ
ment
it behooves you then now to uniteindeed
it is a matter of necessity that you should
unite with the antislavery men and women
of america in withstarding the operation of
a i aw and the institution from which it ema
nates that threatens you with an inundation
of the poor and the needy for whom you can
not provideor else will persuade you to
foreswear your anlis avery principles re
nounce your humanity deny your savior
and defy the almighty hear hear oh
canadians let me entieat you to stand firm
in the trial hour let it be your pride and
joy that you are englishmenthe subjects ol
a government that will not tolerate slavery
slaves cannot breathe in england their lungs
receive your air that moment they re free
tliey touch your country d th e r shackles all
tliats noble ami bespeaks a nation proud
and jealous of the blessing spread it then
and let it circulate through every vein
of all your empirethat where britains power
is felt maukind may feel her mercy too
dut some of you canadians  fear have
learnt so much of the proslavery logic of my
countrymen that you are ready to say lo me
ah your american union was based and it
now stands upon compromise fidelity to
which demand yu k
cursed law y t ou have entered into the com
pact and you are bound to keep it come
not here then and ask us to help you to do
what you yourselves ought not to do are
you satisfied of the soundness of the summary
reasoning which is supposed to force upon us
this hoirible conclusion  do you believe
that men can be bound by any agreement
they may make lo do wrong  if men enter
into a bargain to rob their fellowbeings of all
their rights to outrage all the feelings and
affections of humanity and lo trample upon
the laws of a just god are they not under
a higher obligation to break them than to
keep the compact surely sounless man
has a right and power withal to dethrone the
almighty much less thencan the men of
our generation make a covenant with death
and an agreement with hell and impose
upon their posterity the obligations to fulfil it
but i affirm the fathers of our republic
never meant to perpetuate slayery the lan
guage of the constitution does not require
such an interpretation though  confess with
shame it lias generally received that interpre
tation those who heard me last evening
were informed what out fathers did and with
what expectation they did it far be from
them the suspicion of having intended to make
our great republic the most shameless des
potism in the middle of the th century
the disastrous consequences of the conces
sions to slavery which they did make are a
solemnly emphatic admonition to all men
never even in appearance to compromise the
right hear hear hear i would that i
had time to give you the history of our amer
ican constitution but  am as impatient
as you are to hear my noble friend mr
thompson whose surpassing eloquence ik
the delight of all who listen to itand whose
unsparing selfsacrificing devotion to all the
humanities of the age entitle him to the ad
miration of the world which he may not re
ceive while he lives for men seldom find out
their greatest benefactors until they are dead
but will secure to him that commendation from
the eternal judge mote to be desired than
the praise of all mankind well done good
and faithful servant enter thou into the joy of
thy lord
i will detain you therefore but a few min
utes moreonly long enough to answer an
other objection to the action of the abolition
ists often urged on the other side of ontario
and which some people on this side of our
beautiful lake regard as having weight
it is said that if the abolitionists had not in
terfered the oppressions of the enslaved
would have been lighter and his final deliv
erance nearer at hand this statement is in
every particular untrue i shall expose
its falsity only in one respect the people of
the north of the free stalesdid not move
in the cause of the enslaved until their atten
tion was called to them by the slaveholders
themselves
iu  was formed the colonization so
ciety its earliest members were principally
slaveholders its prominent officers were
slaveholders its most zealous advocates were
slaveholders henry clay of kentucky was
among its founders and soon became its
president and continues to be so at this day
that societythe real design of which was
to increase the security of slaveholding by
removing to africa the free people of color
commended itself to the favor and cooperation
of the people of the northern states by re
presenting its tendencies to improve the con
dition of the enslaved and ultimately emanci
pate them eloquent agents were sent
amongst us who kept out ot sight the real
intentions of the society and plied us only
with such appeals as were adapted to wake
up our sympathies for the bondmen the
horrors of slavery were depicted to us with
no neutral tints the coloring was often as
high as the picture would bear thousands
who now are abolitionists were col jnizationists
first i joined that society at an early period
and was the principal agont in the forma
tion of an auxiliaiy in the county where i re
sided
william lloyd garrison that man whose
name is hereafter to be honored so long as a
page of american history is extant became a
member in  and soon distinguished him
self by his ability and zeal in the cause in
 he delivered before the massachusetts
auxiliary their annual address to as large an
audience as could convene in park street
church boston then one of the most capa
cious rooms in that city he was admired
for his ability loved for his enthusiastic be
nevolence and urged forward in his labors for
the relief of our suffering countrymen by
the hearty sympathy that was expressed by
those who hesid him he was then the ed
itor of a paper in vermont soon after he
was invited by benjamin lundy of whom 
wish i bad time to speak a devoted self sac
rificing man to assist him in conducting an
antislavery paper which he had succeeded
by his indomitable perseverance in establish
ing in baltimore the paper was called the
genius of universal emancipation a sou
like mr garrisons could not withhold itself
from such a call of duty he went to balti
more still a member of the colonization so
ciety tupponogbe was going to labor iu it
behalf soon the productions of his fervid pen
attracted the attention and disturbed ote re
poee of the slaveholding community about
him when in consequence of an article in
his paper exposing and condemning without
stint the conduct of a northern captain who
had taken on board his ship a cargo of slaves
from the new orleans inaiket mr gar
rison was arrested as a disturber of the peace
tried condemned and thrown into prison
till he should pay z heavy fine wholly be
yond his means there he remained thirteen
weeks when mr arthur tappan of new
york one of the most bountiful givers our
country or the world ever knew came for
ward paid his fine of looo and sundry costs
amounting to hundreds more snd set the no
ble prisoner free his way back to bos
ton he was cordially greeted and encouraged
in his work by several gentlemen of new
york and especially by daniel webster who
happened to be there the captain of the
steamboat in which he took passage for
providence counted it an honor lo have the
young philanthropist on board and remitted
his passage money thus encouraged and
strengthened he came back to new england
to report to the people what he had seen and
learnt of slavery and of the piospect of its
leimination during his brief sojourn at the
south he had seen enough of slavery to
hariow up his soul from its deepest depths
ka founj awt wuwy that flie ovlvni
tion society so far from tending to the sub
verson of that system of iniquity was in
tended to ensure its more quiet continuance
now will you tell me he should have kept
back the communication of the feelings of his
gieat heart that he ought to have sup
pressed what he had discovered to be the teal
design of that southern society which was
drawing into its treasury large contributions
from the people of the free states because it
had represented itself to them as the friend of
the slave  know you will not tell me so
he did what i am sure you would have hitn
do he went about trying to undeceive
those who had been beguiied into that pro
ject for the expatriation of the free colored
people and doing all he could to give a
right direction to the labors of those who
really desired to break the yoke of opptes
sion and set the capiive fiee on the ist ot
january  he began the publication of
his libeiator and then commenced that agi
tation of this question which has spread
throughout out vast republic and we trust
in god it will never cease until the enslaved
throughout the land are redeemed disen
thralled arid established in the enjoyment of
the rights and the exercise of the prerogatives
of freemen cheers
you see ihen that we of the north are
not responsible for the commencement of
northern interference with southern slave
holding we were invited by southern men
urged by them to give our thoughts to the
claims of the coloied population of our land
and to aid in the prosecution of a project
which we were assured was to result in theii
entire emancipation and our only fault is
that we have looked into the matter farther
than the colonizationisls intended we should
have come to feel more sincerely and dpeply
for the slaves than they expected and have
determined in good faith to accomplish a
most desireable end w hich they held out to
us as the great inducement to cooperate
with them in the prosecution of measures
w hich we discovered would defer emancipa
tion to a day too far distant to be descried by
mortal foresight
but here you will tell me that the conflict
in my country has become so fearful that a
dissolution of the union seems to you inevit
able if we abolitionists do not desist give
back and allow the slaveholders and their
abettors to have their own way and what
let me ask will be the consequences if we do
throw down the weapons of our moral war
fare and give up the millions that are en
slaved to hopeless bondage i will answer
the question for you and i will answer it
in the words of another one of the greatest
men of our country the third president of our
republic the man who adopted the declara
tion of our independence in his notes on
virginia president jefferson said the
day of emancipation must come if it come
not by the generous energies of our own
minds it will come through the awful pro
cesses of st domingo servile and civil
war  quote the passage from memory
slavery cannot will not be endured forever
one hour of such oppression outweighs whole
ages of that from which our fathers levelled
it must be abolished by peaceful or by vio
lent means the hour will come and when
it comes the almighty has not the attribute
that can take part with us in such a conflict
i tremble for my country he adds i tremble
for my country when i reflect that god is
just and that his justice cannot sleep forever
the membeia of the american antisla
very society are the truest friends of our
republic the best friends of the union it it
can be made what its founders declared it
should be our oppressors indeed continu
ally tell us that the union will be dissolved
if we insist upon the abolition pf slavery
and we as continually reply then let it be
dissolved fiat justitia ruat ccelum
let justice be done though the heavens
fall this was said ages agosaid by a
heathen and it has always been quoted as
the highest expression of a lofty morality
if a heathen then could say let justice be
dona though the heavens fall sorely an
american christian should not fear to say
let justice be done though the union fall
nor should he be reproached for saying so
except by atheists and ungodly men whose
reproach is praise great cheering
got union now exists but in name no men
have thb freedom of our country who are not
friends of slavery any one who is even sus
pected of leaning to the side of impartial lib
erty is unsafe in one half of our republic
aa well would it be fur the miner lo descend
into the etnh into the midst of the fire
damp without the wire gauze about his
lamp as for a friend of humanity to go into
our slavebolding states without a padlock on
hit lips many men have been lynched
there only on the suspicion of abolitionism
what is that union to us which we cannot
enjoy only by tenouncing our humanity 
tbe opposers of oppression and unright
eousness are the only true friends of a union
of our american states for they alone would
extirpate that which has been from the first
working oui dissolution it is slavery that
has eaten out the cement of the american
union and it is idle to talk of there being
any union between liberty and slavery if
my country cannot stand but upon the necks
of three millions of our fellowmen it ought
not to stand it will not stand  have often
aid this on the other side of the lake and i
am not afraid to say it here i have boon
called traitor for uttering the thought the
only answer i can care to make to this accu
sation is if it be treason lo bate and op
pose slavery lam a traitor i mean to be a
traitor to my country if she can become the
ruthless tyrant which a general obedience to
the fugitive slave law would make her
the abolitionists tis true have under
taken to revolutionize america and they
earnestly call on you to help them but it is
a revolution to be effected by moral means
our principles lead us lo reject and to entreat
the oppressed to reject the use of all car
nal weapons for deliverance from bondage
relying upon those which are spiritual and
mighty through god ts the pulling down of the
strongholds of satan we mean to oae
only the sword of truth if ever we resort to
any other measures it will be because we
have not faith and coutage enough to adhere
to our avowed principles hitherto all that
we have done in tbe cause oflibeity has been
effected by faithful exposures of the abomina
tions of our southern prison houses earnest
expostulations with all who are making mer
chandize of men and treating them as if they
were domesticated brutes unsparing rebukes
of those at the north who because of their
mercantile and ecclesiastical connections with
the south are apologizing for slaveholders
upholding them in their wickedness misrep
resenting and persecuting the men who are
laboring only to bring them to repentance
affectionate entreaties to those who unin
tentionally and perhaps unconsciously are
strengthening the hands of oppressors and
solemn warnings to all who directly or indi
rectly ate giving support to slavery which
outrages humanity and sets god at defiance
if it is with these weapons we have fought
hitherto have roused the slumbering
pricked the consciences of many who had sup
posed themselves to be among the righteous
routed hosts of the apologists ard retainers
of slaveholders goaded to nudness the un
principled who were at ease iu their illgotten
possessions brought the political parties into
new alliancesnow with usnow with each
other so that few know where they belong
and tbeir strength is weakened by divisions
and by distrust of their own we have so
battered the ecclesiastical bulwarks behind
which slaveholders had entrenched themselves
that these enemies of man feel no longer se
cure there where used to be their strong
hold lastly we have assailed the legislatures
of our states and the congress of the union
making the halls of each the fields of many a
hardfought battle cheers so that now
the whole power of our nation is combined
against us and in the madness of those who
are destined to destruction the leaders of the
public policy have committed themselves to
a measure the fugitive slave lawwhich
must bring to our aid the moral indignation e
the civilized world great applause
these have been the weapons of our war
fare and these ate some of the effects wa
have already produced surely we may in
vite you canadians to take part with us iiw
such a warfare even against our own country
and you may accept our invitation and dt
great execution in the service without show
ing yourselves to be enemies but friends ra
ther of americahe loves my country
who would make her free
we have not come here to ask your red
coats to assist us let them stay where they
are and our prayer shall ever be that they
may never be called to any more actual ser
vice than to parade your streets and keep up
the show of protection hear hear
we want your black coats to help u  ere
summon them to our aid we call u p on them
all the more earnestly because so many ol the
ministers of religion in out country have de
serted the standard of the crosshave sbowff
themselves traitors to christ most of the
pulpits in america have been and still are
silent in the cause of the slave many of
them have turned their artillery against it
few have done the execution that they mighti
and ought to have done othen ministers of
christ incanada help us pray for the slave
that god would raise up many to espouse
his cause preach in his behalfexpose the
enormity of the wrong that he suffers who
is held and treated as a piece of property
and plead for his deliverance show your
hearers what they may and ought to do foe
those who are in bonds any whete especially
for those in a country allied to you by so
many ties social and ecclesiastial and placed
so near that your interests and ouro are al

you who do not occupy the pulpit may
often send or carry the truth on this subject
where the preacher does not go in your
continual intercourse with the people of my
country in matters of business or pleasure
you may often have opportunities lo speak
with effect in hehalf of liberty and right im
prove those opportunities and you will be
helping to form that public sentiment whicho
is the powet that rules america
you who wield the pen for the newspapers
of canada give to it a point and directive
that it shall reach what other weapor   f
state cannot touch the consciences of rry coun
trymen many of my countrymen once were
yours but alas they left their antislavery
zeal behind them o then we pray you do
what you may to revive tbeir former faith in
the righttheir former love of the slave let
every mail that leaves your shores bear some
message of admonition or remonstrance to
the many you must know in america and
who will beed your words as tbe counsels
of old friends especially let your churches
earnestly solemnly call on kindred churches
in our land to be obedient unto him whom
they profeta to revere as their great head

letter fri in william w brown
adxi phi hotel york march g
df ar dour lass i closed my last letter
in the ancient town of melrose on the banks
of the tweed and within a stones throw of
the celebrate d ruins from which the town
derives its nat ne the valley in which mel
rose is situat ed and the surrounding hills
together wilt the monastery have so often
been made t theme for the scottish bards
that this has become the most interesting part
of scotland of the many gifted writers who
have taken u p the pen none have done more
to bring the i hldon hills and melrose abbey
into note tht n the author of waverly but
one cannot r jad his writings without a regret
that he shou id have so woven fact and fiction
together th it it is almost impossible to dis
criminate bv tween the one and the other
we arriv ed at melrose in the evening and
proceeded to the chapel where our meeting
was to bfe held and where our friends the
crafts were warmly greeted on reluming
irom the meeting we passed close by the
ruins of melrose and very fortunately it
was a moonlight night there is considerable
difference of opinion among the inhabitants of
the place as regads the best time to view the
abbey the autho of he lay of the
last minstrel says
if thou wouldst view fair melrose aright
jo visit it by lite pale mooibgbt
for the gay beams of lighiaoite day
gild but to flout the ruins gray
in consequence of this admonition i was
informed that many persons remain in town
to see the ruins by moonlight awaje that
the moon did not send its rays upon the old
building every night in the year  asked the
keeper what he did on dark nights he re
tplied that he had a large lantern which he
jput upon the end of a long pole and with
this lie succeeded in lighting up the ruins
this good man labored hard to convince ne
that his invention was nearly if not quite as
good as natuies own moon but having no
need of an application of his invention to the
abbey  had no opportunity of judging of
its effect i thought however that he had
made a moon to some purpose when he in
forme  me that some nights with his pole
and lantern he earned his fout or five shil
lings not being content vith a view by
moonlight alone  was up the next morn
ing before the sun and paid my respects to
the abbey i was too early for the keeper
and he handed me the key through the win
dow and  entered the rooms alone it is
one labyrinth of gigantic arches and dilapi
dated halls the ivy growing and clinging
wherever it can fasten its roots and the w hole
as fine a picture of decay as imagination
could create this was the favorite resort of
sir walter scott and furnished him much
matter for the lay of the last minstiel
he could not have selected a more fitting
place for solilaty thought than this ancient
abode of monks and priests in passing
through the cloisters i could but remark the
carvings of leaves and flowers wrought in
atone in the most exquisite manner looking
as fiesh as if they were just from the hands
af the aitist the lapse of centuries seems
not to have made any impression upon them
or changed their appearance in the least 
sat down among the ruins of the abbey
the gtound about was piled up with magnifi
cent fragments of stone representing various
texts of scripture and the quaint ideas of the
priests and monks of that age scene after
acene swept through my fancy as  looked
upon the surrounding objects i could almost
imagine  saw the bearded monks going from
hall to hall and from cell to cel in visiting
these dark cells the mind becomes oppressed
by a sense of the utter helplessness of the
victim who once passed over the threshhold
and entered one of these religious prisons
there was no help or hope hut in the will
that ordered their fate how painful it is to
gaze upon those walls and to think how
many tears have been shed by their inmstes
when this old monastery was in its glory 
hi ended to the top of the ruin by a circuitous
stairv v y hose stone steps were worn deep
from a ma y of whom like myself had
titiieg tlx at o gratify a curiosity from the
lop of the bbey i bad a splendid view of
the avjnourimg hills and the beautiful valley
through wbieh the gaia water and
tweed this is unquestionably the most
splendid specimen of gothic architectural ruin
in scotlaud but any description of mine
eonveys but a poor idea to the fancy tj be
realized it must be seen
during the day we paid a visit to abbots
ford the splendid mansion of the late sir
walter scott bart this beautiful seat is
situated on the banks of the tweed just be
low its junction with the gala water it is
a drenry looking spot and the house from the
opposite side of the river has the appearance
of a small low castle in a single days ride
through england one may see half a dozen
cottages larger than abbotsford house i
was much disappointed in finding the premises
undergoing repairs and alterations and that
all the trees between the house and the river
had been cut down this is to be regretted
the more bectuse they were planted nearly
every one of them by the same hand that
waved its wand of enchantment over the
world the fountain had been removed from
where it had been placed by the hands of the
poet to the centre of the yard and even a
small stone that had been placed over the fa
vorite dog peroy had been taken up and
thrown among some loose stone one visits
abbotsford because of the genius of the man
that once presided over it everything
connected with the great poet is of interest to
his tdmireis and anything altered or removed
tends to diminish that interest we entered
the house and weie conducted through the
great hall which is hung all round with mas
sive armor of all descriptions and other me
morials of ancient times the floor is of
white and black marble in passing through
the hall we entered a narrow arched room
stretching quite across the building having a
window at each end this little or rather
nairow room is filled with all kinds of armor
which is arranged with great taste we
weie next shown into the diningroom whose
roof is of black oak richly carved in this
room is a painting of the headof queen
mary in a charger taken the day after tbs
execution many other interesting portraits
grace the walla of this room but by far tho
finest apartment in the building is the drawing
room with a lofty ceiling and furnished with
antique ebony furnituie after passing thro
the library with its twenty thousand volumes
we found ourselves in the study and i sai
down in the same chair where once sal the
poet while before me was the table upon
which was written the lady of the lake
waverly and other productions of this
gifted writer the clothes last worn by th
poet were shown to us there was the
broad skirted blue coat with its large buttons
the plaid trousers the heavy shoes the black
vest and white hat these were all in a glass
case and all looked the poet and novelist
but the inside of the buildings had undergone
alterations as well as the outside in passing
through the library we saw a granddaughter
of the poet she was from london and was
only on a visit of a few days she looked
pale and dejected and seemed as if she
longed to leave this secluded spot and return
to the metropolis she looked for all the
world like a hothouse plant i dont think
the scotch could do better than to purchase
abbotsford while it has some imprint of
the great magician and secure its preser
vation for i am sure that a hundred years
hence no place will be more frequently visited
in scotland than the home of the late sir
walter scott after saunteting three hours
about the premises i left but not without
feeling that i had been well paid for my
trouble in visiting abbotsford
in the afternoon of the same day in com
pany wilh the crafts  took a drive to dry
burgh abbey it is a ruin of little interest
except as its being the burial place of scott
the poet lies buried in st marys aisle
his grave is in the left transept of the cross
j and close to where the high altar formerly
i stood sir walter scott chose his own
grave and he could not have selected a sun
nier spot if he had roamed the wide world
over a shaded window breaks the sun as it
falls upon his grave the ivy is creeping
and clinging wherever it can as if it would
shelter tho poets grave ftom the weather
the author lies between his wife and eldest
son and there is only room euough for one
grave more and the sons wife has the choice
of being buried here
the four oclock train took us to harwick
and after a pleasant visit in this place and the
people registering their names against amer
ican slavery and the fugitive bill in particu
lar we set out for carlisle paying through
the antique town of long holm after leav
ing the latter place we had to travel by
coach but no matter how one travels here
he travels at a more rapid rate than in amer
ica the distance from longholme to car
lisle twenty miles occupied only two and a
half hours in the journey it was a cold day
and  had to ride on the outside as the inside
had been taken up we changed horses
and took in and put out passengers with a
rapidity which seems almost incredible the
road was as smooth as a mirrior
we bid farewell to scotland as we reached
the little town ot gretna green this town
being on the line between england and scot
land is noted as the place where a little
crosseyed redfaced blacksmith by the name
of priestly first set up his own altar to hy
men and married all who came to him with
out regard to rank or station and at prices to
suit all it was worth a ride through this
pait of the country if for no other purpose
than to see the town where more clandestine
marriages have taken place than in any other
port in the world a ride of eight or nine
miles brought us in sight of the eden wind
ing its way slowly through a beautiful valley
with farms on either side covered with sheep
and cattle there are four very tpll chim
neys sending forth dense columns of black
smoke announcing to us that we were near
carlisle  was really glad of this for
ulysses was never more tiled of the shores of
llion than  of the top of that coach
we remained over night at carlisle par
taking of the hospitality of the prince of
bakers and left the next day for the lakes
wheie we bad a standing invitation to pay a
visit to a distinguished iterary lady a cold
ride of about fifty miles brought os to the
foot of lake windermere a beautiful aheet
of water surrounded by mountains that
seemedrto vie with each other which should
approach nearest the sky the msrgin of the
lake is carved out and built up into terrace
above terraee until the slopes and windings
bt e lost ia the snowcapped pealu of the
mottotaine it if not apprising that such
i men as southey coleridge wordsworth and
others resorted to this region for inspiration
 after a coach ride of five miles passing on
our journey the doves nest home of the
late mrs heman we were put down at the
door of the salutation hotel ambleside and
r a few minutes after found ourselves under the
s roof of the authoress of society in amer
ica  know not how it is with others but
for my own part i always form an opinion of
an author whose writings i am at all familiar
with or a statesman whose speeches i have
read  had pictured in my own mind a tall
statelylooking lady of about sixty years as
the authoress of travels in the east and
for once i was right with the single excep
tion that i had added on too many years by
twelve the evening was spent in talking
about the united states snd william craft
had to go through the narrative of his escape
from slavery when i retired for the night
i found it almost impossible to sleep the
idea that i was under the roof of the author
es of the hour and the man and that
was on the banks of the sweetest lake in
great britain within half a mile of the resi
dence of the late aoet wordsworth drove sleep
from my pillow but  must leave an account
ot my visit to the lakes for a future letter
when  look around and see the happiness
here even among the poorer classes and that
 in a country where the soil is not at all to
be cotnpareu with our own  mourn fur our
downtrodden countrymen who are plundered
oppressed and made chattels of to enable an
ostentatious aristocracy to vie with each other
in splendid extiavagance
 am holding meetings in company with the
ciafts on the fugitive slave law and we
also hope to get up an interest against the
slaveholders who may make their appearance
at the great exhibition but of this more in
my next until then belive me to be
yours right truly
wm w brown
horace manns speech
we are indebted to lion horace mann for
a copy of his speech on the fugitive slave
law delivered in the house on february
 l thi following account of the pas
sage of the bill should be held in remem
brance
when several of those measures were
passed and particularly when one of the
most obnoxious and criminal of them all was
eassed i mean the fugiiive slave billthis
ouse was not a deliberative body delibera
tion was silenced those who knew they
could not meet our arguments choked their
utterance the previous question which was
originally devised to curb the abuse of too
much debate was perverted to stop all debate
the floor was assigned to a known friend of
the bill who after a brief speech in palliation
of its enormities moved the previous question
and thus we were silenced by force instead of
being oveicome by argument for sir j
aver without fear of contradiction that the
bill never could have become a law had its
opponents been allowed to debate it or to
propose amendments to it
the right to discuss the bill he claims on
this wise
 feel none the less inclined to discuss
this question because an order has gone forth
that it shall not be discused discussion
has been denounced as agitation and then it
has been dictatorilly proclaimed that agita
tion must be put down sir humble as i
am  submit to no such dictation come from
what quarter or from what numbers it may
if such a prohibition is intended to be laid
upon me personally i repel it if intended
to silence me as the representative of the
convictions and feelings of my constituents i
repel it all the mote vehemently in lhi
government it is not tolerable for any man
however high or for any body of men how
ever large to prescribe w hat subjects may
be agitated and what may not be agitated
such prescription is at best but a species of
lynch law against free speech it is as hate
ful as any other form of that execrable code
and i do but express the common sentiment
of all generous minds w hen i say that for
one i am all the more disposed to use my
privilege of speech when imperious men and
the sycophants of imperious men attempt to
ban or constrain me in italy the pope de
cides what books may he read in austria
the emperor decides what books may be writ
ten but we are more degraded that the sub
jects of pontiff or caisar if we are to be told
what topics we may discuss
his notions of the citizens obligation to
obey this law may be gathered from tho con
clusion
in hookers sublime description of law
when understood in its generic sense he
says
of law theie can be no less acknowledged
than that her seat is the bosom of god her
voice the harmony of the world all things in
heaven and earth do her homage the very
least as feeling her care and the greatest as
not exempted from her powets both angels
and men and creatures of what condition
soever though each in different sort and man
ner yet all with uniform consent admiring
her as the mother of their peace and joy
now sir with these glorious attributes of
law  say the fugitive slave law of the
last session possesses not one quality in com
mon nor in similitude to say that the seat
of such a law isin the bosom of god is the
intensest blasphemy to say that it is the
harmony of the world is to declare that the
world is a spheie of übiquitous and omnipo
tent wrong uncheckered by any thought of
justice and devoid of any emotion of love
to say that all tilings in heaven do hom
age to such a law is to affirm of the realms
of light what is true only of the realms of
darkness the least do not feel its care
but tremble and wail beneath its cruelty
while the greatest and the strongest are
exempt from its power for they made it
not for themselves but fot otheis to no class
of creatuies rational or irrational human
or divine can u prove to be the mother of
peace and joy but wherever it extends and
as long as it exists it w ii continue to be an
overflowing marah of bilerness and strife
as the great name of hooker has been
profanely cried in behalf of this law i will
close by quoting his distinction between those
laws of haman governments which ought to
be obeyed and those which ought not
which laws says he we must
obey unleu there be reason shewed which may
necessarily enforce that the law or reason
or or god doth enjoin the contrary
the higher law a scrap of
history
a vary remarkable a fair occurred in the
year  a legion of soldiers containing
 called the theban ltgion were quar
tered in the east awaiting the orders of their
emperor to march against the rebels of
burgundy about this time the emperor
ordered a general sacrifice to ba made at
which the whole army were commanded to
be present and assist at which time also
he commanded that all the soldieia should
bind themselves with an oath to b faithful
in him in the contemplated expedition and
wonld personally aid him in the destruction
of the gaelic christiana against whom he
held the greatest antipathies
shocked by tbs cruelty of these orders
each individual of tho theban legion abso
lutely refused either to sacrifice or to taka the
oaths prescribed
this so enraged the emperor that he
ordered every tenth imii in the legion to be
put to the sword those who remained after
this cruel order had beets executed were still
inflexible and a second order was given that
 every tenth man of the remainder of the le
gion should be put to the sword but this act
of cruelty made no more impression than the
first the soldiers preserved their fortitude
and their principles and under the counsel of
their officers diew op a remonstrance to the
emperot in which they told him
we are your subjects and soldiers but at
the same lima we are the subjects of a higher
power and we cannot disobey the almighty
ruler we receive our pay from you but
we have received our existence from god
whenever your commands are not contra
dictoiy to those of our common master we
shall always be ready to obey them as we
have been hitherto but when the orders of
out prince and those of the almighty differ
we must always obey the latter our arms
are devoted to the emperors use and shall
be directed against his enemies but we cannot
submit to stain our hands with the effusion of
hrislian blood and how indeed could you
 emperor be sure of our allegiance should
we violate our obligation to a higher power
in whose service wo engaged before we en
tered your army you commanded us to
search out and destroy the christians it is
not necessary to look further for we are our
a ives chriaiians and we gloiy in the name
we saw our companions die without a mur
mur and thought them happy in being per
mitted to die for christ we will not lift our
hand against our sovereign we had rather
die wrongfully and preserve our innocence
than incur the guilt of obeying our sov
ereigns command whatever you command
we are ready to auffer
any one but a tyrant would have been
melted under such anappeal but the con
trary effect was he commanded
the whole legion be put ti death and even
sent a like order to italy in respect to a de
tachment which had been drafted from them
the cruel order was executed on the d of
september  by the other troops who by
command of the emperor fell upon them
unresisted and cut them to pieces with their
swords
who will sav that they were not heroic
men or that they did not well in obeying god

in reply to an interrogatory from m schlei
cher representative of guadaloupe as the
enrollment of men of color general la hitte
the french minister replied the position
of the french republic has been changed by
the abolition of slavery and permuted us to
speak with greater right we have taken
in regard to the united states all possible
steps in order to surmount laws which m
schoelcher has styled with reason barbar
ous neither france nor england have been
able to persuade the government of the
united states to enter into the ways of civil

to march in and to endeavor to make the

the einperor alexander had imme
dately sent a guard of honor to protec
from all intrusion hundred
of thousands of soldiers were swarm

was filled with terror and detraction
one melancholy incident we will re

frantic and shrinking victim the gal
lant englishman sword in hand
forward for her deliverance from hi
barbarian allies he succeeded i
rescuing her and in the confusion c
the battle still raging ordered a dra
goon to take her to his own quarters til
she could be provided with suitabl
protection the dragoon took the lady
dead wtth terror upon his horsi
behind him and was galloping with lie
to a place of safety when onolher ru

pierced his body with their sabers am
seized again the unhappy victim shi
was never heard of more the em
peror alexander was greatly distress
ed at her t r e and made the utmost
though untvji ing efforts to discove
what had become of her the revela
tions of the last day alone can divulgi
the horrors of this awful tragedy
tne grief of josephine in these dayi
of anxiety was intense in the extreme
she passed her whole time in talking
about napoleon or in reading the let
ters she had received from him h
wrote frequently as he escaped frou
place to place but many of bis letter
were intercepted by the bands o
soldiers traversing every road th
last she had received from him wat
dated at brienne it gave an account
of a desperate engagement in whief
the little band of napoleon had beei
overwhelmed by numbers and wa
concluded with the fullowing affecting
words on beholding those scene
where i had passed my boyhood and
comparing my peaceful condition then
wth the agitation and terror which
i now experience  several times said
in my own mind i have sought to meet
death in many coufiicts i can no longer
fear it to ine death would now be a
blessing but i would once more see
josephine
notwithstanding the desperate state
of affairs josephine still cherished the
hope that his commanding genius would
yet enable hiui to retrieve his fortunes
all them hopes were however
dispelled on the receipt of the following
letter

tilities still continued and possibly ii
may have been intercepted at present

pl expect to hear from you at
elba i am not very well
upon reading these tidings of eo
terrible an overthrow joeephiae was
overwhelmed with grief and for a time
wept bitterly soon however recover
ing her seif possession she exclaimed
f must not reraaiu here my presence
f necessary to the einperor that
duty iff indeed more maria louisas
than mine but the emperor iff alone
forsaken well i a least will not
abandon him i might be dispensed
with while he was happy now  am
sure that he expects me after a
pause of a few moments in which she
seemed absorbed in her own thoughts
he addressed her chamberlain saying
i may however interfere with his
arrangements ou will remain here
with ine till intelligence be re
ceired from the allied sovereigns they
will respect her who was the wife of
napoleon
she was indeed remembered by
them the magnanimity of her con
duct under the deep wrongs of the
divorce had filled europe with admira
tion the allied sovereigns sent her
assurances of their most friendly re
gards they entreated her to return
to malmaison and provided her with
an ample guard for her protection jlei
court was ever crowded with the most
illustrious rnonarchs and nobles whe
sought a presentation to do homage
to her virtues emperor alexandu
was one of the first to visit her ht
said to her on that occasion madam
l burned with the desire of beholding
you since i entered france i havt
never heard your name pronounced bui
with benedictions in the cottage ant
in the palace i have collected account
of your angelic goodness and i do my
self a pleasure in thus presenting tc
your majesty the universal homage o
which i am the bearer
maria louisa thinking only of sell
declined accompanying napoleon tc
his humble retreat josephine noi
knowing her decision wrjte to tht
emperor now only can i calculate
the whole extent of the misfortune o
having beheld my union with you dis
solved by law now do  indeed la
inent being no more than your friend
who can but mourn over a misfortune
great as it is unexpected ah sire
why can i not fly to you why can i
not give you the assuance that exii
 has no terrors save for vulgar minds
i and that far from diminishing a smeert
attachment misfortune imparts to it t
new force i have been upon the poiu
of quiting france to follow your foot
j steps and to consecrate to you the re
mainder of an existence which you s
long embellished a single motive re
t strained me and that you may divine
if i learn that i am the only one whi
will fulfil her duty nothing shall detail
t me and i will go to the only plac
where henceforth there can be happi
ness for me since i shall be able t
console you when you are there isolate
and unfortunate sa but the word
f depart adieu sir whatever i woult
add would still be  little it is m
 longer by words that my sentiments fo
you are to be proved and for action
i your consent is necessary
a few days after this letter was writ
 ten the emperor alexander with t
number of illustrious guests dined witl
josephine at malmaison in the even
ing twilight the party went out upoi
the beautiful lawn in front of the housi
i for recreation josephine whose healtl
had become exceedingly precariuu
through care and sorrow being regard
i less of herself in devotion to hei
r friends took a violent cold the nex
day she was worse without any verj
definite form of disease she day aflei
i day grew more faint and feeble unti
it was evident that her final change was
near at hand eugene and hortense
her most affectionate children wer
with her by day and by night thej
communicated to her the judgment o
her physician that death was near
she heard the tidings with perfect com
posure and called for a clergyman tc
administer to her the last rites of re
ligion
just after this solemnity the emperoi
alexander eutered the room eugent
and hortense oathed in tears were
kneeling at their mothers side jose
phine beckoned to the emperor to ap
proach her and said to him and hei
children  have always desired the
jtdppihess of france i did all in my
power to contribute to it and l can
say with truth to all of you now pres
ent at my last moments that the first
wife ofnapoleon never caused a single
tear to flow
she called for the portrait of the em
peror she gazed upon it long and
tenderly and then fervently pressing it
in her clasped hands to her bosom
faintly articulated the following pruyer
o god watch over napoleon while
he remains in the desert of this w orld
alas though he hath committed great
iults hath he not expiated them by
great sufferings just god thou hast
looked into his heart and hast seen by
how ardent a desire for useful arid dura
ble improvements he was animated
deign to approve my last petition and
may this image of my husband bear
ine witness that my latest wish and my
latest prayer were for him and my
children
il was the tw of may  a
tranquil summers day was fading away
into a cloudless serene and beautiful
evening the rays of the setting sun
struggling through the foliage of the
open window shone cheerfully upon
ihe bed where the empress was dying
the vesper songs of the birds which
tilled the groves of malmaison floated
sweetly upon the ear and the gentle
spirit of josephine lulled to repose by
these sweet anthems sank into its last
sleep gazing upon the portrait ot the
emperor she exclaimed li lisle
delbe napoleon and died
alexander as he gazed upon her
lifeless remains burst into tears and
uttered the following affecting yet just
tribute of respect to her memory
she is no m ire that woman whom
france named the beneficent that
angel of goodness is no more those
who have known josehine can never
forget her she dies regretted by her
offspring her friends and her contem
poraries
for four days her body remained
shrouded in state for its burial dur
ing this time more than twenty thou
sand of the people of france visited
her beloved remains on the ud of
june at midday the funeral proces
sion moved from malmaison to ruel
where the body was deposited in a tomb
of the village church the funeral
services were conducted with tbs
greatest magnificence as the sove
reigns of the allied armies united with
the french in doing honor to ler me

 on register  average attendance
there is a public school on staten
island taught by mr prince love
rijge
there is no certain data for ascer
taining the number of children between
the age of  and  years at present
nor will there be until the publication
of the census in either of the places
spoken of in this statement but it is
well known that a large number are
out of school who ought to be in it
this is proved from ocular demonstra
tion
the schools are open to all free as
the air we breathe and their advan
tages ought not to be neglected and
cannot be without suicidal criminality
our children must have the advant
ages of the common schools to th
fullest extent and some sacrifices must
be made to provide them proper situa
tions of employment when they leave
school and t these ends our attention
ought to be directed
in view of the facts here presented
as well as other which might be named
your committee beg leave to recom
mend
that an association of ladies and
gentlemen be formed consisting of at
least  ladies and  gentlemen which
shall lake upon itself the duty of secur
ing a more full attendance of children
at school and of providing for them
when they leave school suitable places
o employment where they may obtain
a knowledge of the mechanical branch
es cither in or out of the city or any
branch of business that shall promise
steady employment as well as to de
velope their physical social and menta
capacity
 that this association perform its
duty by visiting parents who do noi
send their children to school regularly
and urge upon them the importance l
making the necessary sacrifices to en
able their children to attend school
 by attending to the wants of such
children as are deprived of the privi
leges of the school by a need of the
necessary clothing
 by holding a fair once a year or
by making public appeals for funds to
accomplish the end designed or by
adopting such measures as in the better
judgment of the association shall best
promote the object in view
your committee further recommend
that this association be formed immedi
ately with power to increase ther num
ber to any necessary extent and that
similar associations be formed in
brooklyn williamsburgh and staten
island
that in each place the names and
places of business of mechanics who
r willing to take colored apprentice
be taken and proper apprentices re
commended pledging to them all the
support we can command while they
are instructing such apprentices when
they have learned their trades
your committee are of opinion that
should the association be conducted
with energy it will tend to inspire
greater confidence in your youth a
better selfrespect and in connection
with other enterprizes to shorten the
days of oppression in this land to in
cite higher purposes and to fix the fact
in the minds of all that as americans
we are one people and have a com
mon destiny a s standard
the sweetness of home
he who has no home has not the
sweet pleasure of life he feels not the
thousand endearments that cluster
r around that hallowed spot to fill the
void of his aching helrt und while away
his leisure moments in the sweetest ol
lifes joys is misfortune your lot
you will find a friendly welcome from
hearts beating true to your own the
chosen partner of your toil has a smile
of approbation when others have de
scried a hand to help when all others
refuse and a heart to feel your sorrows
as her own perhaps a smiling cherub
with prattling glee and joyous laugh
will drive ail sorrow from your care
worn brow and enclose it in the
wreaths of domestic bliss
no matter how humble the home
tpay be how destitute its stores r
fcovv poorly its inmates are clad if true
hearts dwell there it is yet a home
a cheerful piuderit wife obedient and
affectionate children will give ther
possessor more real joy than bags 
gold and windy honor
tiie home of a temperate industri
ous honest man will be his greatest
joy ho comes to it weary am
worn but the merry laugh and happy
voice of childhood cheers him a
plain but healthy meal awaits him
envy ambition and strife have n
place there and with a clear con
science he lays his weary limbs dowi
to rest in the bosom of his family and
under the protecting care of the poor
mans friend and help
