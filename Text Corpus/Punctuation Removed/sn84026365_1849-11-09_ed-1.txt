to thf editorit may be said
when i shall not be here to contradict
t that i have given up the principles
by which the liberty party was chara
cterized in  and become a mem
ber or an avowed adherent of the free
soil party  judge so because ju
niors relating to myself equally
groundless but thought to suit the
purposes of u party have been once
set afloat because of late j have
received letters written probably on
that suppositionand because an un
usual number ot kree soil newspapers
and other documents have been sent to
me
wishing to be fully understood on
this subject  am free to declare that
rate much higher what  suppose
was the object of the free soil party
at its formation than w hat i am almost
sure is the common object of the
democratic and whig panics now
not expecting that my views will in
fluence many nor that they wilt add
much to the stock of information al
ready possessed i desire to record in
an enduring form this syllabus tor i
regard it as nothing else as furnishing
at all times a decisive answer to the
notion that i have relinquished at least
for the time being opinions w hich i
embraced with the most cautious and
considerate reflection and which 
shall in all probability continue to
think true but as  hold myself always
open to conviction and as i value one
truth higher than any number of false
hoods i shall consider myself indebted
to any one who will show me bv rea
sonable argument and inference that
rny opinions are wrong or that there
is unsoundness enough m any position
 have taken to vary the conclusion to
which i have come but let it he re
membered that  discuss the constitu
tion and not any vicious practice ot
which it is made the cover
i the object of all government no
matter how constituted whether by the
social compact or by any less fanci
ful mode is to preserve and not to des
troy rights
 here is an obligation resting on
every person to conform to the laws of
the country m winch he lives as long
as those laws are not incompatible with
a higher lawthe divine law as he
understands it but no oneso fur as
 knowsays there is any obligation on
the slave to conform to laws that in
stead of preserving and protecting his
rights purposely destroy and annihilate
them
j the punctual uud certain pay
ment ol the public debt first suggested
the convention of  hut the con
ventionuts had full power to form it
government for the whole country ol
this we have evidence in the union then
effected aud which with some addi
tions made to the constitution in the
mode pointed out by that instrument it
self we yet have
 ihe constitution makes no differ
ence between the territories he they
north or south it there was or is in
them any institution hohtile to the con
stituiton as air order of nobility or an
established religion t goea
out at once on our getting possession
such should have been the case with
slavery tor nothing is more adverse to
our professions and nothin shows
more undeniably that it u a s the maste
ry over us our getting of
a country in any way ought to haw
been a godsend to the slave who was m
it establishing slavery because it
iu a country or territory when we g i
possession of it shows that the con
stitution yields to slavery
g freedom is the natural the un
constrained condition of man slave
 an artificial and constrained one
the north star
rverv government toutided as our is
i has a right to know that none of hei
principlesespecially her fundamenta
onesare violated and that all wh
owe her allegiance are in their nat
ural unconstrained condition th
late president polk tells us in his mes
sage to congress of july  
see eekly national intelligencer o
july   s that where there ii
no protection or allegiance or sever
eingnty there can be no just claim tc
obedience it un one not coming
within the territory of a state is chargee
with committing murder or larceny ot
any other offence lie is tried by the
la w s of the state which he has violated
it mr polk avs what is trueand 
have no doubt he does on whal
ground do we demand allegiance when
we give no protection nor otter any
but so lar from it sutler one un
charged with crime to be taken out
from our jurisdiction when we well
know too that he will not be granted
even the form oftrial but lie consigned
ti slavery as long as be lives
ti the states that sent delegates tc
tin convention were at a verv early
day distinguished from the states thal
should be afterwards formed and ad
mitted into the union as original
slates  hey then constituted the
whole government and if any light
existed to establish slavery they had
it nothing was done about abolish
ing slavery the constitution gives
the power to congress to admit new
states to the union so hateful was
slavery then that it was not supposed
another slave state would ever be ad
mitted and because it was thought
that slavery could not be entirely put
away at that time it was to be con
fined to the states who were parties tc
the contract where from various
causes it would soon die out how far
they were mistakan in the effect of the
cultivation of cotton and sugar staples
to w inch slave labor could be applied
thvi present number of slave states ad
mitted into the union will testify
 laws concurrent with the consti
tution of the united states are supreme
and the executive and judicial officers
those of the united states of course
and those ot the several states are
bound by oath or affiliation to support
it
 the constitutional provision for the
delivery of persons charged with be
ing slaves is immoral therefore void
no obligation of the kind would be en
forced in any intelligent court in the
free states as between individuals
s jum i be told that although the
word slave or slavery is not in the
section above referred tonor indeed
in any pail of the constitution yet
that the section was undoubtedly
meant to apply to slaves i freely ad
mit the inference jt is my own infer
ence but it does not embrace slavery
on ils lace and the history of this pro
vision drives us back to that time
 when the slaveholders ought
to have begun their efforts to get rid of
slavery instead of using them as they
have for a long time done and as
they all are now doing to extend and
confirm it they seem to regard the
provision in question such is their
faithnot as temporary hut as per
petual
i lie state ot missouri e g was
not in the union when the constitution
was made ot course she was not one
of the original states yet the slave
holder in her name goes into any of
the north western states and exer
cises the right of sovereigntyand a
very important one it is too by tak
ing from its territory one whom he
chooses to call his slave although they
have never in any way consented to it
j he popular opinion in this country
is that under the constitution con
gress cannot establish slavery that is
make it right if this he the case
how then can congress by ratifying u
constitution for a state which its own
law lias authorized and raising one of
its own territories to a higher rank
give it any power to hold slaves can
congress authorize another to do w hat
it cannot do itselfor can it confer a
power that it does not itself possess
i fthe facts conveyed in these interroga
tions he true the slave states derive
no support from congress and i see
not it a slave were to sue out a habeas
corpus before a judge of the united
states or of one of the states how
he could he otherwise than liberated if
lie judge took for his guide the consti
tution and his oath it might be proved
that he was a slavethat his parents
and ancestors from time immemorial
had been slaves this is all that could
he proved and this perhaps he would
state in his petition but what would it
avail when pul in opposition to the
selfevident truths published by us
long ago that all men were created
equal that they are endowed by their
creator with certain inalienable rights
that among these are life liberty and
the pursuit of happiness if these
truths are selfevident ones then
the opposite of them must he false no
court no nation any more than an
individual ought to do w hat it knows
to ik false  hen would we he driven
to the last position  assume that
 there n no power on earth and
none in heaven with due reverence i
speak itlor the empire of mind is
similar everywherethat can establish
slavery or make it lf you prove
bz any kind of sophistryfor it must
he by sophiatry if proved at allthat
iod has established slavery you at the
same time prove him according to the
apprehensions he himself has given us
unjust if some should he elected
to be slaveholders which relation has
no tendency to make the temper even

slave trials in michigan
some of the recent slave trials at
st joseph have excited much interest
on the night of the th of september
a party of eight or ten kentuckians led
by one norris broke into the house of
a mr powell in ass co while he
was absent drew their pistols and
kpives dragged mrs powell and three
childieu from their beds bound them
with cords put them in covered wag
onsand started post haste for kentucky
alarm was soon given and the kidnap
pers were overtaken near st joseph
a writ of habeas corpus was obtained
for the colored prisoners and the ken
tuckians were arrested the powells
were discharged after a full and fair
hearing the register says
no sooner was the decision pro
nounced than the keutuckians gather
ed around them w ith their pistols and
bowie knives drawn and held them by
force the court house was crowd
ed and the people of course became
very much excited at such proceedings
in a court ofcjbstice for some time
it seemed as though a bloody fight was
inevitable but at last at the request of
norris the sheriff took the powells and
locked them up la jail it was now dis
covered that while the suit was pen
ding on the habeas corpus norris bad
obtained a writ of the clerk of the
rochester n y friday november  
circuit court under our state lnu
relative to fugitives from labor ant
claimed the right to hold them undei
that
as they still remained in the custo
dy of the sheriff where norris had pla
ced them a new writ of habeas corpus
tfas obtained directed to the sheriff
as also one directed io norrisreturn
able before the same judge on mon
day morning october ist norris was
duly informed of the tune and place 
trial but refused to appear though in
townlt was satisfactorily shown to
the court that tht united states su
preme court in the case of prigg vs
pennsylvania had decided that all state
laws relative to fugitives from labor are
unconstitutional and void and it follow
ed of course that the writ issued by tiie
j clerk was null and voidand could au
thorize no person to hold them in cus
tody they were accordingly dischar
ged and quietly departed with their
friends and neighbors
an opportunity was afforded norris
to introduce on the trial any evidence
he might have to show that the pow
ells were his slaves but lie did not
avail himself of the offer the ken
tuckians doubtless returned home a lit
tie wiser from their visit to the tree
states for two civil suits for false im
prisonment were commenced against
them by the powells and they were
held to bail in looo in each case

did you ever see a slave timid crin

that hesitating to stand upright step
firmly and speak straight forward
more than half in doubt whether he has
a soul much more whether tiiat soul
is his own
such is too often arrd has been too

against it

the movement woeth
another southern convention was
held at jackson mississippi at which
judge w l sharkey presided and an
address and resolutions upon the subject 
of southern rights were adopted
these were reported by a committee ov
twenty among whom were the gover
nor of the state the hon messrs j i
gcar t h williams e c wj
kinson mad g winchester general
t n waul g winchester and other
gentlemen the object of the conven
tion as stated in this address was to
deliberate on the means to prevent
the unfounded pretensions that con
gress has power to legislate on the sub
j l  slavery and to prohibit its in
i reduction and existence in the territo
ries of the united states
the address and resolutions takethr
ultra southern ground and are in fact
hut an echo of the address of the south
i era members of congress they de
clare that the interference of congress
with slavery is dangerous to the rights
and safety of the south and ought to be
resisted that the passage of anv law
abolishing slavery iuthe district of co
lumbia or to prohibit the slave trade
t between the several states or slavery
in the territories would be a dangerous
violation o the constitution and be evi
dence of a fixed design to interfere with
slavery in the spates that they the
pple ot mississippi will not submit to
such political degradation but will
regard the nonslaveholding states as
enemies that in view of the crisis
which these resclutionists thus conjure
up they convoke a convent ion of ai the
slaveholding states to meet at nash
i ville tenn on the first monday in
dune next that associations be formed

i worthy of notice
 iiat we recommend to the legisla
ture of this state that at its next ses

duty of the governor of the state by

tion ot the state and to issue writs of

the company of golddiggers w hich
i have the honor to command arrived
here on tiie st inst and judge our
feelings when after some twelve hun
dredmiles of travel through on uncul
tivated desert and the last one hundred
miles ot the distance through and among
lofty mounains arid narrow and difficult
ravines we found ourselves suddenly
and almost unexpectedly in a compara
tive paradise
w e descended the last mountain by
a passage excessively steep and abrupt
and continued our gradual descent
through a narrow canon for five or six
miles when suddenly emerging from
the pass an extensive und cultivated
valley opened before us at the same
instant that we caught t glimpse of the
distant bosom of the great salt lake
which lay expanded before us to the
westward at the distance of some
twenty miles
descending the table land which bor
dered the valley extensive herds of
cattle horses and sheep were grazing
in every direction reminding us of that
home and civilization from which we
had so widely departedfor as vet the
fields and houses were in the distance
passing over some miles of pasture
land we at length found ourselves in a
broad fenced street extending westward
in a straight line for several miles
houses of wood or sundried brick were
thickly clustered m the vale below us
some thousands m number and occupy
ing a spot about as large as the city ofi
new york they were mostly small
one story high and perhaps not more
than one occupying an are of land
the whole space for units excepting
the streets aud houses was m a high
state of cultivation fields of yellow
wheat stood waiting tr the harvest and
indian corn potatoes oats flax and i
all kinds of garden vegetables were
growing in profusion and seemed about
iu the same state of forwardness as in
the same latitude in the states
at first sight ot all ihee signs of cul
tivation iu the wilderness we were
transported with wonder and pleasure
some wept some gave three cheers
some laughed and some ran and fairly
danced for joyw hile ail felt inexpres
sibly happy to find themselves once
more amid scenes wmcb mark the pro
gress of advancing civilization we
passed on amid scenes like these ex
pecting every moment to come to some
commercial centre some business point
in this great metropolis of the moun
tain but we were disappointed no
hotel igcput cake and betr shop
barber pole market house grocery
provision dry goods or hardware store
distinguished one part of the town from
another not even a bakery or mechan
ics sign was anywhere discernible

v  j
physical industry al first i thought ii
was an experimentan order of thing
established ptirposeiv to carry out the
principles ot socialism or mar
monism in short i thought it very
much like owenism personified how
ever on inquiry i found that a cortibi
nation of seemingly unavoidable cir
cumstances had produced this singular
state of affairs there w ere no hotels
because there had been no travel no
barbers because every one chose to
shave himself and no one had time to
shave ins neighbor no stores because
they had no goods to sell uor time to
traffic no center of business because
all were too bjsy to make a center
i here was abundance of mechanic
shops ot dressmakers rnillitnys and
tailors c but they needed no sign
nor had they time to paint or erect one
tor they were crowded with business
hciioo their several trades all must
cultivate the land or die for the land
vas new and no cultivation but their
owa within a thousand miles every
one had his lot and built on it every
one cultivated it and perhaps a small
farm in the distance
and the strangest of ail was that this
great city extending over several
square miles hnd been erected and
eve y house and fence made within
nine or ten months of the time of oui
arrivalwhile at the same time good
bridges were erected over the principal
streams and the country settlements
extended nearly ih miles up and down
the valley
i his territory state or as some
term it mormon empire may justly
bo considered one of the greatest prod
igies ot the age and in comparison
with its age the most gigantic of all
republics in existence being only ir
its second year since the first seed oi
cultivation was planted or the first civ
ilized habitation commenced it these
people were such thieves and robbers
as their enemies represented them in
the states i must think they have
greatly reformed in point of industry
since corning to the mountains
i tiiis day attended worship with them
in the open air some thousands of
well dressed intelligent looking people
assembled some on foot some in car
nages and on horseback many were
neatly and even fashionably clad
the beauty and neatness of the ladies
reminded me of some of our best con
gregations in new york they had a
choir ot both sexes who performed ex
tremely well accompanied by a hand
who played well on almost every instru
ment of modern invention teals of
the most sweet sacred and solumn mu
i sic filled the air after which a solemn
prayer was ottered by rev mr grant

inga call lor a meeting of the kid
lquorum  the seventy and a meeting
of the officers of the id cohort of the
military legion fee ftc
after this came a lengthy discourse
irom mr brigham young president of
the societypartaking somewhat of
politics much of religion and philoso
phy and a little on the subject of gold
showing the wealth strength and glory
of england growing out of her coal
mines iron and industryand the
weakness corruption and degradation
ot spanish america spain ice grow
ing out of her gold silver ice and her
idle habits
every one seemed interested and
pleased with bis remarks and all ap
peared to be contented to stay at heme
and pursue a persevering industry al
though mountains of gold were near
them ihe able speaker painted in
lively colors the ruin which would he
brought upon the united states by gold
and boldly predicted that they would he
overthrown because they had killed the
prophets stoned and rejected those
who were sent to call them to repent
ance and finally plundered and driven
the church of the saints from their
moist and burned and desolated their
city and temple tie said god hud a
reckoning with that people and gold
would be the instrument of their over
throw the constitutions aud laws
were good in fact the best in the
world but the administrators were cor
rupt and the laws and coiihtitutions
were not carried out therefore they
muit lab he further observed that
the people here would petition to be
organized into a territory under the
tame governmentnotwithstanding its
abesesand that it granted they would
itam by the constitution and laws of
the united states while at tue same
unit he denounced their corruption and
abuses
but said the speaker we ask no odds
of them whether they grant us our pe
tition or not v e never will ask any
odds ot a nation who has driven us from
our homes if they grant us our rights
wellif not well they can do no more
than they have dune they and our

may it please you my lord to comrmi

the governor of unhappy hungary alter

the tepose of the grave and the inexpressible

my than to cause any difficulties to the turk
ish government whose situation l well knew
how to appreciate and therefore did not in
trude on the turkish territories without pre
viously inquiring whether i and my compan

to us
we received the assurance that we were
welcome guests and should enjoy the ful
protection of his majesty the padisha who
would rather sacrifice  men of lire own
subjects than allow one hair of our heads io
be injured
it was only upon this assurance that we
passed into the turkish teirilorv and accor

ceived and tended on our journey received in
widdin as the sultans guests and treated
hospitably during four weeks whilst waiting
from constantinople further orders au to the
continuation of our sad journey to some dis
tant shore
even the ambassadors of england and
france to whom  ventured in the name ol
humanity to appeal were so kind as to assuie
me of their full sympathy
his majesty the sultan was also ta
ious  to give a decided negative to the in
human pretensions of oui extradition demand
ed by russia and austria
but a fresh letter from hi majesty the
czar arrived in constantinople and ns con

express messenger of the turkish govern

report of the committee of vigilance
the committee who were instructed to
prepare an addiess to the people of tbe dis
trict beg leave to submit the following
through their chairman
to the people of spartanburg district
fellowcitizens being appointed a
committee ol vigilance and safety for spar
tanburg district we deem u our duty to lay
before you the causes w hich made a necessary
to constitute such a committee and the course
we shall pursue to carry out the objects for
which we are appointed
vou will all remember that a few years
since a set of fanatics at the north contemp
tible in numbers with no political power
commenced a crusade against our rights and
institutions under the name of abolitionists
i or a long time the south took no notice of
it and the northern people treated them as
disturbers of the public peace but a material
change has occurred in their prospects in a
few year by assuming a variety of shapes
adopting different names and uniting with
one political party after another they have
gathered strength and power to be heard in
congressthey are like the fabled ass in the
lions hide covering a portion of the animal
yet leaving exposed some of the distinctive
features by which it is well known from
a small rill they have increased to a mighty
torrent threatening to sweep before them all
the barriers of the constitution take from us
our rights and liberties and degrade us to a
social and political equality with our slaves
it is tmnecessary to recapitulate all the
movements of this fanatical horde it is
sufficient tn stale that alter attempting to
abolish slavery in the district of columbia
refusing to deliver our fugitive slaves murder
ing our citizens when endeavoring to recover
their property and endeavoring to cheat us
out of our rights in the territory of new
mexico and california they have now thrown
in our midst their agents and spies to insti
gate our slaves to revolt and disseminate
their incendiary writings for the purpose ol ar
raying one portion of our people against
another knowing that as long as we are a
united people their hellish schemes will be
frustrated
under this state of things this committee
lias been organized and it has always been
the case among civilized nations when any
radical change of their institutions or form
ot government is attempted to organize such
committees as this no matter by what
name they are called whose powers rose
superior to the law and whose duty it was to
protect peaceable citizens in their rights and
property and their persons from violence in
any form and iroin any quarter
in carrying out these views of what we
conceive to be our duty our object will be to
prevent by ait means in our power the spread
of these abolition writings among our people
it harsh means be necessary we will not
hesitate to use them and any incendiary
hereafter caughunay expect rough treatment
by this committee
ve also expect tg introduce some plan
whereby slaves will be kept in proper sub
jection preventing so far as in our power
lies tlie giving or selling of spirituous liquors
to them and exercising that kind of sur
veillance ov t r them which we think essential
to keep them in proper submission and under
reasonable discipline
we will use all vigilance in detecting and
punishing all persons interfering with or cor
rupting our slaves or in any way attempting
to inteifere or endanger the relations which
now exist between master and slave our
intentions are io protect the citizens of this
district and of the state from all interference
with their rights and institutions
in carrying out our views of the duties im
posed on us wo may in some instances have
to rice above the law but where the law will
apply the remedy we will resort to legal pro
ceedings and exercise that sound discre
tion which is necessary under our peculiar
circumstances
in carrying out the views of the committee
we need ihe cooperation and support of the
citizens generally and hope that all persons
will feel called upon to give all the informa
tion ill their power to aid the committee in
their operations

class of people for crimes other than murder j
tlie penally of exportation or being sold again
into bondage i tlmik t is worthy of inquiry
and it strikes roe if it has no other effect it

rochester november  
government and its subjects
it has long been tegarded as the dictate of
wisdom by sagacious legislators that a gov
ernment should conciliate as far as possible
every class of its subjects it is always deem
ed unpardonable folly and flagrant wicked
ness for any government needlessly to atflici
and insult a portion of its people govern
ments are either exceedingly strong or ex
ceedingly weak and that government is
strongest which has the fewest foes this is
peculiarly true of our own it of all others
should make friends with its subjects and
with every class of its subjects for the day
may come when it will need them all it is
not to be disguised that in the matter of slave
holding our nation stands before the world
preeminent in infamy that the existence of
slavery in this country is looked upon hy
other nations as the peculiar weakness as
well as the crime of the american people
and it is quite easy to perceive that in the
event of a conflict between this and any euro
pean power this vulnerable point would be
the first to be attacked the colored people
of this country would be counted as the natu
ral allies of any power which should inscribe
on its banners liberty for the black as veil as
for the white man
but with these truths so obvious to common
sense before them our legislators appear to
rake the utmost pleasure in wantonly display
ing their contempt for the rights and feelings
of the growing colored population of the uni
ted states it would be impossible for a gov
ernment to devise a policy bettet calculated to
make itself the object of hatred than that
adopted by our government towards its free
colored people to make us detest the land of
our birthto abhor the government under
which we uveand to welcome the approach
of an invading enemy as our only salvation
would seem to be the animating spirit and
purpose of all the legislative enactments of
the country with respect to us with all its
boasted wisdom and dignity it does not hesi
tate to use every opportunity of persecuting
insulting and assailing the weakest and most
defenceless part of its subjects or citizens it
acts towards us as though the highest crime
we could commit is that of patriotism and all
manner of insult neglect and contempt are
necessary to prevent the commission of this
crime on our part oui thoughts have been
turned in this direction by the contemptible
meanness of our present secretary of state tn
refusing to gram to william w brown the
usual passport granted to citizens about to
travel in foreign countries mr brown re
marks in  recent letter to mr garrison
that one of his fellow passengers to earope
was accompanied by a colored servant and
that this servant had with him a regular pass
port signed by the secretary of state mr
buchanan
thta fact presents the american govern
ment in its true light it has no objection
whatever to extend its protection to colored
servants but it is resolved on no occasion to
grant protection to coloied gentlemen a
colored man who travels for the benefit of a
white man will have thrown over him the
shield and panoply of the united states but
if he travels for his own profit or pleasure he
forfeits all the immunities of an american cit
izen the government in this particular
faiil reflects the lights and shades of the
whole american mind as appendages to
wfiue men we arc universally esteemed a
i independent and iexpansible men we ate uni
j versally despised
in keeping with ilu spirit and in puisn
anoe of this policy the colored man is not
permuted to carry a united slates mail bag
cross the street nor hand it from a stage
driver to a postmaster in the navy no mat
ter how great may be his talents skill and ac
quirementsno matter how daring heroic
jaaff patriotic he may be hs is forbidden by
the government to rise above the office of a
cook or a steward under the flag of the uni
ted states

confined tothelowly and nninffuential those
who are lifted above the common herd of
mankind and who hold the reins of place and

human suffering and little indignation to
spend on tyrianny and tyrants it was not
the priest nor the ievite that succored t the
man who fell among thieves but the hum
ble samaritan who could boat no sacre
dotal robes or othei badges of office the
i rule of benevolence is with the pobr and the
humble and not with the high and rich it
is adopted by the latter only ocaaionally
and it is always a cause of deep gratification
to the lovers of mankind when so adopted
an instance of the latter desenption on the
part of the sultan of turkey is now claim
ing the attention and admiration of the civili
zed world this mohammedan prince be
ing apprized that within the borders of bis
dominions the hungarian patriots have
sought a refuge from the fury of the russian
czarand he is called upon by this christian
potentate to surrender these refugees into
his hands the noble sultan and follower of
the false prophet rejects with indignation the
barbarous demand of the christian superior
and at the peril of bringing upon himself and
people the gigantic power of russia combi
ned with that of austria extends the arm
of generous protection to thgse helpless refu
gees the sultanhas based his conduct up
on his sacred book the koran aud in so do
ing lias shown himself to be more christiike
than very many who brand him and his na
tion with upholding the religion of the pit
the christian may well learn humanity and
magnanimity at the feet of the humane sultan
by this one act of bis he has placed himself
his country and his religion in a command
ing attitude before the world and he will un
doubtedly in the emergency threatened by
russia receive the sympathy and assistance
of all but despots and tyrants on the othet
side of the atlantic
but we have no tears that war will result
from this refusal public opinion is not with
out its influence even upon the autocrat of
russia the voice of ixndon is nrtt without
weight even in his e mncils to be autocrat
of all the russias is not to be aatocrat of all
the world and the unlimited despot will
have his limits he cannot with impunity 
disregard the hurgane voice of the civilized i
world we are rendered more hopeful of
peace between russia and turkey by the
decided and spirited manner in which the
sultan has been sustained by the press and
governments of england and france pub
lic meetings have been held in london of a

steam navigation railroads and electric tele

power of intelligence to quarters hitherto in

at a period which may be regarded aa the dawn
of that day when the pen ahall super
cede the sword and when mind shall be di
rected by intelligence and not crushed and
cramped by the iron hoofs of war and slavery
at such a period when words may save the
use of bullets it becomes every man to speak
out plainly in vindication of the weak and de

expressed at vauous limes and under a diver

zfrma church school
we recorded our protest last week against
huddling the colored children of this city into
the miserable cellar of zion church the
colored citizens ol this city par aa freely for
the support of schools as any othei class and
their children are as much entitled to school
privileges aa are the sons of the wealthiest of
this community and there can be no reason
founded in justice why they should be shut
out of the fine airy schoolhouses of the dis
tricts and driven into the dull damp dark
and badly ventilated cellar of zion church
it is a disgrace to the city of rochester that
snch an act of fiagiant injustice and cruelty
can be perpetrated against any class of its cit
izens the board of education have not only
stained themselves with the sin of partiality
and proscription but have degraded them
selves by duping the stupid crature vv ho of
ficiate aa trustees in zion church if the
colored people of this city must be driven into
a separate achool one wonld think that such
a degradation would be sufficient to satisfy the
negro haters without adding to it the cruel
ty of crowding them into a cellar we hope
that our brethren in this city will show them
selves in earnest about this matter and will
continue to agitate the question of out chil
drens admission into the district schools
we must not tamely submit to this violation
of our educational rights this is just now
the question of questions for the colored peo
ple of this place if we yield willingly to this
encroachment perhaps the next demand will
require us to live in a certain part of the city
ourchildien are to go to a particular school
colored people are to attend their own meet
ing and it may by and bye follow that we
are to occupy a given place in the town for
one we say most distinctly to the board of
education that in no emergency will we send
a child of ours to the miserable cellar under

edinburgh ladies antislavery society
we are indebted to the secretary of this
association foi a copy of its last annual re
port the society appears to have been as
usual actively engaged in efforts to promote
the cause during the year besides their own
home expenditures they sent a box to the
boston bazaar worth seven hundred and fifty
dollars the report takes a favorable view of
the free labor cause and pays a merited
compliment to the unwearied zeal and steady
perseverance of our esteemed friend anna
richardson as evinced in her labors in this
particular department the report copies
in terms of approbation the resolutions adopt
ed by a congregational church in brookfield
mass withholding christian fellowship from
slaveholders the conduct of the american
board of commissioners for foreign missions
is deeply deplored and pointedly rebuked
notice is taken ot the cases of drayton sears
thomas garrett and others expressing
sympathy for them in their suffering and ap
probation of their conduct in assisting the fu
gitive this society has been applied to for
assistance by the managers of the philadelphia

new york state convention
the national antislavery standard has
proposed the holding of a new york state
antislaveiy convention and urges that the
first of winter will be a suitable time for the
demonstration and that syracuse will be the
most appropriate place for the same the
proposition to hold such a convention is a
good one and deserves to meet the united
support of the antislavery forces ol this
state to little attention has been given of
late to this quarter of the field ohio and
massachusetts have been cared for to the
neglect if not at lhe expense of this the most
important state of the union the conse
quence is our ranks are scattered and are in
absolute disorder inviting rather than repel
ling the attacks of the enemy we want a
certain sound from our antislavery war trum
pet that we may prepare ourselves for the
battle the standard should have issued
its call for this convention at once and not
have left the question for holding it open to
controversy the convention is neededit
ought to be heldand we are suie it would be
largely attended there are hearts in all
quarters of this state panting for an opportu
nity of meeting the radical friends of freedom
in a grand convention for forwarding the anti
slavery cause
we reserve however comments of this na
ture until the call for the convention is duly
issued the north star will then be
found shining in the firmament to guide the
hosts of freedom in the right directionf o
a voice from ithaca iu flavor of the
national league
we have received a letter from our friend
r w johnson on the subject of the nation
al leagueexpressing his hearty approbation
of the proposed organization but fearing thai
the people of this state are unprepared for it
his plan for preparation is more unwieldy ie
our opinion than the formation of the league
itself would be it is not to be expected that
a rery large body of persona would compose
the league at its commencement we rely
upon the intelligent sad earnest few to sei
this union in operation twenty soundhead
ed and clearbeaded men would be sufficient
to commence the work the league would
then soon make its own way and increase iu
numbers it would be none the leas ana
tiomai league because composed but of few
it would be national in its objects and suns
and open to the entire colored population ot
the country let no one hesitate to uoite in

preparation as the old articles are nearly all
disposed of and this year we must have an
entire new stock we hope there are already
many sewing circles formed in different parts
who are zealously engaged in making up the
rtat variety of useful and beautiful articles
hat are usually presented at our fair we
isk every abolitionist and every friend of the
ause in this stale especially as w r ell a 
iiends in every other state to feel themselves
bound to be represented either personally or
by donation at the rochester fair let none
feel themselves excused from laboring earnest
y to make this antislavery fair worthy of

some of our warm hearted european
friends have already prepared and forwarded
r box of articles to aid us iu this movement
truly their disinterestedness and devotedness
rught to tinge every slaveholders cheek with
ihainestir every northern abettors bean
with remorse ajid stimulate every abolitionist
to double zeal the north star we intend to
lustain and we ask the zealous eooperatioi
of our friends in so doing lectures are much
eeded and in this section of the state there
is a wide field for profitable exertion
seed diligently sown will yield a hundred
or a thousand fold and the bread of truth east
upon the waters will return after many days
the personal attendance of antislavery friendf
at the fair is earnestly solicited and confident

able to make it more woithy the patronage o

near the close of its second year and finds it
self in debt its selfsacrificing editor ha
struggled on by day and by night at boon
and abroad to sustain it and the cause it ad
vocates without drawing anything from th
pioceeds of the paper for his own support
he cannot make the paper what it would be
ifheeould be constantly at his post necessity
has compelled him to be much from home ii
order to extend its circulation many of yoi
may not be awaie of the expense k incident t
the publication of a paper and many havi
supposed that the north star was sustaining
itself and making its owner a profilabh
business but  can assure you it is far other
wise and that few refmm papers can be sus
tained by their subscription lists at least a
their commencement and thy do not have i
long advertising patronage as most of th
political papers have now i would ask thi
friends of the slave and the friends of fred
enck douglass if it is tight foi ns to suffe
him thus to struggle on single handed in th
cause for which we all profess to feel so much
for one i feel that it is not right and as out
means of aiding him and bis paper  would
propose ihai each subscriber send on the

dear feiesu dovsuw i ro wjouming
in tbit liron i wat goiug to say iron
hearted city lot the present perbape
tbe latter adjective would be ihepgat appro
priate as well as the most significant for the
mate of the people here are at ironhearted
as the iron they manufacture so far aa any
sympathy for humanity or reform is concern
ed indeed it cannot be wondered and per
haps they ought not to be blamed that such is
the case lor life to them is but a battle for
money and bread the rattle of dtajs and
wagonsthe uproar and tumultthe borry
mg to and fro w hich are to be seen and heard
on all sides are but so many discordant notes
of muss to this ceaseless war of trade and
traffic tis true there aie a few good spirits
here a few whose souls are sadly out of
place and out of harmony in this mighty
struggle they feel that whatever may be
the professions of a people thus grasping thus
engaged and absorbed their practices
sre of the earth earthly that to them
truth goodness righteousness and free
dom are matters of incidental importance are
mere abstractions which are very pretty to
talk about but impossible to practice
there has occasionally been a momentary
interest excited here in behall of the great
question of freedomin interest which man
ifests considerable earnestness for a timebut
soon the subject is forgotten and the cry of
perishing myriads is dtowned by the uproar
and clatter of moneygetting so lung as so
ciety is now organized perhaps it will be ne
cessary to make accumulation the paramount
objectthe chief end ol man it is truly
demeaning to make this the highest object ol
life to cultivate that faculty so much to he
neglect f the higher and nobler attnbutes ot
the soul but the people must have bread
and while the few infernal graboerals and mo
nopolists have all the bread and money of
course the many must work and suffei and
toil or surtender and die few are disposed
to do the latter and therefore submit to the
crushing blinding stultifying influences that
surround them
it is not extenuating the matter to say there
are upwards of one hundred churches m this
city indeed this is perhaps the saddest
shade in the picture it goes to show the ut
ter inhumanity of a religion so extensively
preachedso widely professed such a reli
gion adapts itself very readily to the times
and is very profitable and convenient to the
priesthood but humanity must tide over ii
and its temples before she can be free re
formers will ever find the most virulent oppo
sition the greatest amount of calumny and
odium coming from this source let human
jtv rejoice then whenever there are indications
ol the fall and failure of the churches for
when they are superseded hei redemption

feel that the church of god must be aroused
to take hold of the question of freedom
with more earnestness and energy than it has
ever vet done or the great wheels of the

ohio is not a favorable position for exerting
an influence favorable to ibis object i am l
willing to make the experiment the friends
of the congregation who go with me are con j
tribuling liberally according to their ability

an appeal in behalf ol the western
new vork autislavpry fair
earnestly desiring the abolition of slavery
hi this land and being deeply convinced that
this result can only be accomplished by renew
ed efforts to change our present corrupt moral
sentiment the undersigned members and
friends of the western new vork antislavery
society again make their appeal to the
friends of the slave in behalf of their annual
bazaar ahirh will he held in rochester on
the ihth of january lfciio
while we have been cheered and gladdened
by the progress already made and the good
alteadv done and while we rejoice to observe
that friends have been raised up to plead the
cause of the hondmaii among persons and in
quarters w here we had least expected them
we still see the harvest to bo great and the
laborers to be few and instead of relaxing
our efforts we are impressed with a sense of
the duty of doubling our diligence and ap
plying more closely our energy to the means
of advancing this holy causewe appeal the
more boldly to our friends because those for
whom we plead cannot dead for themselves
while we are surrounded by our domestic
circle with none to molest or make us afraid i
tlmre are three millions of men and women in
our own land doomed to abject slavery and
chains robbed of every rightcivilsocial
personaland political remembering those
in bonds as bound with them we desire to j
plead their cause as though they were on our
ow n limbs and the knotted lash were applied
to our own backs
while to obtain means tor enlightening the
public mind is the strong motive for holding
our annual fair it is not the only one a
great amount of good may be traced directly
to such occasions many who are now ac
tive workers in behalf of this holy movement
became first interested in it through the in 
strumeiitality of those annual exhibitions of
antislavery industry tact and skill
the present object of the rochester anti
slavery bazaar is for the general enlighten
ment of the public mind on the subject ofsla
very recognizing the north star published
in this city as an efficient antislavery in
strumentality we propose that the funds raised
by the sale of articles at the bazaar on
behalf of which we here appeal shall be 
mainly appropriated to the support of that j
important paper
we gatefully acknowledge the prompt as
sistance rendered to our last hair by our
friends anil coadjutors in various parts of our
own state wisconsin and michigan and we
earnestly solicit their continued cooperation
with us in the good wotk  hat no time may
be lost we especially recommend to them the
immediate formation of sewing circles in their
various towns with a view to making aiticies
for the rochester bazaar we would also
in this connection render our heartfelt thanks
to our british friends for the valuable aid ex
i tended by them to our last years fair arid
i we would again warmly solicit their generous
assistance it is due to our transatlantic
friends to say that for much of the interest felt
in our last bazaar we were indebted to them
and we are persuaded that their continued
cooperation will essentially piomote the suc
cess of our approaching december bazaar
and the advancement of the cause of the slave
in our land
we hope that the foregoing appeal will
commend itself to out philanthropic friends on
both sides of the atlantic and that they will
cordially unite with us in the effott here pro
posed

an evening at home
not going to the ball v said mrs lindleywith
a look and tone of surprise what has come ovei
the girlt
f dont know but she says she is not go
ing
doesnt her ball dress fit
yes beautifully
what is the matter then
indeed ma i cannot tell you had better g
up and see her it is the strangest notion in thi
world why you couldnt hire me to stay a
home
mrs lindley went up stairs and entering hei
daughters room found her sitting on the side o
the bed with her beautiful ball dress in hei
hand
it isnt possible helen that you are not going
to this ball v she said
helen looked up with a half serioushalf smiling
expression on her face
ive been trying for the last half hour sh
replied to decide whether  ought to go or eta
at home  think perhaps  ought to remain a
home
but what earthly reason can youhave for do
ing so  dont you like your dress
o yes very much  think it beautiful
doesnt it fit you
as well as any dress i ever had
are you rot well
very well
then why not go to the ball it will be the
largest and most fashionable of the season you
know your father and mysolfare both going we
shall want to see you there of course your father
will require some very good reason for your ab
sence
helen looked perplexed at her mothers last re
mark
do you think father will be displeased if  re
main at home she aaed
i thiuk he will unless you can satisfy him that
your reason for so doing is a very good oue nor
shall  feel that you are doing right i wish all my
children to act under the government of sound
judgement impulse or reason not to be spoken
of freely to their parents should in no case influ
ence their actions
helen eat thoughtful lor more than a min
ute and then eaid her eyea growing dim as she
spoke
i wish to stay at home for edwards sake
and why for hie my dear
he does not go to the ball you know
because he is too young and backward you
couldnt hire him to go there but that is nc
reason why you should remain at home you
would never partake of any social amusement
were uua always to influence you let him spend
hie evenings in reading he must not expect hit
sisters to deny themselves all recreation in which
he cannot or will not participate
he does not  know he would not hear tc
such a thing as my staying at home on his ac
count
then why stay
because i feel ihst i ought to do so this ia
the way i have felt all day whenever  have
thought of going if l were to go i know that
 would not have a moments enjovment he
ueed not know why remain at home to tell
him tbit  did not wish to go will satisfy hii
mind
 shall not urge the matter helen mrs
lindley euid after e silence of some momenta
you are old enough to judge in a matter of thia
kind for yourself but  must say  think you
rather foolish you will uol find edward disposed
to sacrifice so much for you
of that ido not think mother of that 
ought not to think
perhaps not well you may do as you like
but  do not know what your father will say
mrs lindley then left the room
edward lindley was at the critical age of eigh
teen that period when many young menepe
ciuly thoee who have been bieseed with a ktui
would have highly enjoyed a ball but edwanj
was shy buahlal and timid iu company nn
could hardly ever be induced to go out to partiei
with his sisters still he was intelligent for hit
years and companionable his many good qua
iues endeared him to hie family and drew forth
from his sister toward him a very tender regard
among hie male friends was several about hit
own age members of families with whom hn
owa was on friendly terms with these he associat
ed frequently and with two or three others quite
intimately for a month or two helen noticed
that oue and another of these young friends called
every now and then for edwsrd and that he went
out with them end stayed till bed time out un
less bis meter went ftom home he never went out
of hie own accord the tact of hie betug oat had
from the first troubled helen though the reason
of her feeling troubled she could not tell edward
had good principles and she could not bring her
self to entertain ears of any clearly defined eril
bull a sensation of uueaua was always pro
duced when hu was away in the evening
iter knowing that edward would ge out after
they had all left was the reason why helen did
mi wish to attend the bail the first thought of
thw produced an uupleaeent sensation in her mind
which increased the longer eke debited the ques
tion of going away  remaining at home iinafty
he decided that she would not go the decision
took place after the interview with her mother
which wmonly half an hour from the ume of
fterting
edward knew nothing of tho intentions of his
sister hs was in his room dressing to go oat
and aoppoaed when he hoard the carriage drive
fcpm the door that helen had gone with the other
members of the family on descending to the
parlor he wea surprised to find her setting at the
center table with a book in her hand
helen la this you i thought you had gone
to the ball are you not well t he said quickly
and with surprise coming up to her side
 am very well brother she replied looking
into his face with a smile of sisterly regard but
 have concluded to stay at home this evening
im going to keep vou company
are you indeed nghtglad am lof it though
i am eorry vou have deprived yourself of the pleas
ure of this ball which i believe to be a very bril
liant one i was just going out because it is so
dull at home when you are all away
i am not particularly desirous of going to ths
ballso little so hat thd thoughts of your being
left here ail alone had sufficient influence over me
ukeep me away
indeed vell i must say that you are kind
edward returned with feeling the selfsacrific
ing act of his sister had touched him sensibly
both helen and her brother played well she
upon the hup and piano and he upon the flute
and violin both were fond of music and prac
ticed and played frequently together part of the
evening was spent in this way much to the satis
faction of each then an hour passed in reading
and conversation after which music was again
retorted to thus passed the time pleasantly un
til the hour for retiring came when they separat
ed both with an internal feeling of pleasure much
more delightful than they had experienced for a
long time
time passed on edward lindley grew up
and became a man of sound principlea blessing
to his family and society he saw his sister well
married and himself led to the alter by a lovely
maiden she made him a truly happy husband i
on the night of the wedding as he sat beside
helen he paused for tome time in the midst of
a pleasant conversation thoughtfully at last he
staid
do you remember sister the night you staid
at home from the ball to keep me company
that was many years ago yes  remember
it well now you have recalled it to my mind
 have often since thought helen he said
with a serious air that by the simple act of thus
remaining at home for my sake you were the
means of saving me from destruction
how so v asked the sister
 was just then beginning to form an intimate
association with young men of my own agenearly
all of whom have turned out badly i did not care
a great deal about their company still i liked
society and used to be with them frequentlyes
pecially when you and mary were out in the even
ing on the night of the ball to which you were
going these young men were to have a supper
and i was to have been with them i did not wish
particularly to join them but preferred doing so
to remaining at home alone to find youas  did
so unexpectedly in the parlor was an agreeable
anrprise indeed i staid at home with a new pleas
ure which was heightened by the thought that it
was your love for me that made you deny vour
self for snv gratification
wo read together on that evening we played to
gether and talked of many things in your mind 
iiad never seen so much to inspire my own with
high and pure thoughts i remembered the conver
sation of the young men with whom  had been as
sociated and in which i had taken pleasure with
something like disgust it was lowsensual and
too much of it demoralizing never from that
hour did  join them their way even in the
early stage of lifes journey  saw to be down
ward and downward it haß ever since been tend
ing how often since have i thought of that point
in time so fully fraught with good and evil influ
ences those few hours spent with you seemed
to take scales from my eyes i saw with a new
vision i thought and felt differently had you
gone to the ball and i to meet those young men
no oue can tell what might have beou the conse
quences sensual indulgences carried to excess
amid songs and sentiments calculated to awaken
evil instead of good feelings might have stamped
upon my young and delicate mind a bias to low
affections that never would have been eradicated
that was the starting point in life the period when
 was coming into a state of rationality and
freedom the good prevailed over the evil and
j by tho agyncy of my sister as an angel sent by the
author of all benefits to save me
trades and professions
there is good sense and profitable instruction
in the following article from the philadelphia in
quirer t
a correspondent in the interior of the state
informs us that he has a son who is very anx
ious to become a merchant a lawyer or a mem
ber of some other polished and elevated profes
sion but adds the father niy boy while quite
as intelligent as lads generally is not remarkably
so and inasmuch as  havo but one son and am
in a fair business myselfa country storekeeper
 hesitate as to submitting him to the tempta
tions of metropolitan life my own judgment is
that he had better follow in the footsteps of his fa
ther become a useful member of society in the
circle in which he now moves and mingles and
not by false pride or mistaken ambition wander
awayfrom his true sphere and perhaps become
a victim to some habit or vice to which he is now
a stranger am l right c f an you give me any
advice on the subject
in our judgment our corresponcent is perfectly
correct if his son in addition to hie ambition
had manifested extraordinary talents it would
have been the duty of tho father to afford him a
full opportunity for their development and culti
vation but inasmuch as his intellectual facul
ties are but ordinary he should not bo tempted
beyond his proper sphere or induced by a tatal
vanity to venture into an arena for the fearful
struggle of which he is not suited trade in this
country are too much neglected it is another
mistake in parents to suppose that a boy in be
coming a mechanic unfits himself tor some high
er or perhaps we should say moro intellectual
pursuit this is not the case talent like wa
ter will always find its level some of the most
distinguished men of the country statesmen
philosophers philanthropistsstarted as humble
mechanics arlizans tradesmen or farmers  his
can be readily ascertained on turning to the early
histories of many of the most eminent men in our
land
what a boy most requires is first a proper mo
ral basissecond habits of industry give him
these with a fair education and his character will
develop itsef whether he be a mill boy iu vir
ginia or a wagoner in ohio whether born in
one extremtiy of the union or the other our
men of enterprise are in niue cases out of ten
the childrtn of poverty compelled by the force
of circumstances to depend upon their own re
sources and to struggle against all the anxieties
difficulties and perils which beset the upper path
of fame
the boy it should be remembered is father
to the man in more senses than oneand there
fore it is that early training proper hat iu in
youth an active buoyant determined spirit are
all important it is said of the late sage of quin
cy that bis last words to his son were a stout
heart a clear conscience and never despair
this doctrine covers the whole ground and
yet parents are apt to make fearful mistakes with
regard to proper pursuiu for their children the
careful aud thoughtful selection of a calling or
profession is one of the most responsible duties
of life we thus at once direct iu some sense
the future existence of beiogs over whom we have
the greatest control and who naturally look to ns
with respect and confidence how careful should
we be not to commit a mistake not to sacrifice a
sons happiness on the altsr of false pride who
cannot point out intelligent citizens in this com
munity who have taught their sons to despise la
bor to regard honest industry as a reproach alas
what a false what a criminal erroran error that
may involve unhappiness for yearspoverty dis
sipation misery aud their fearful attendants

a somnambulist stsry
from the paris correspondent of the london atlas
la tho month of november last a young girl
named eulalie m of the age of  wasbrot
to one otthe hospital of paris while laboring un
der a most alarming attack of catalepey the case
was a most curious one and the mother of the girl
declared that she waa subject to this disease but
had never been afflicted for so long a period to
gether having been  days and  nights without
consciousness the doctors of the establishment
wereof course enchanted with this tonne anomie
and lorlhwith began to experimentalize and to
provo and test a hundred different methods of cure
which nevertheless had all been exhausted before
the poor patient was restored to herself such
however was the debilitated state in which the
disease or rather the remedies had left her
that she was compelled to remain for sometime
longer in the hospital to regain her strength
it was during this convalescence that a pheno
menon of the most extraordinary nature wat wit
nessed in poor eulalie which caused the greatest
perplexity and confusion among the nurses and
doctors in attendance upon her she was seized
with an unceasing ungovernable flow of speech
words flowed in a torrent from her lips night
and day sleeping or waking it was all the same
with persons of her age and sex nothing is more
common but gentle reader it was the subject of
her discourse which was so extraordinary and
which caused even the oldest and most experi
enced of the medical advisers gathered round her
bed to turn aside ine in wrath others in confu
siouit was the complete unveiling of every thot
and desire which was passing through the mind of
whoever approached within a certain distance of
her bed
tho evil grew to such a heightso many secrets
got afloatso many suspicions had grown into
certainty by this means that it was deemed expe
dient to dismiss the patient before a complete
schism was created among the authorities of the
hospital every celebrity in the magnetic science
had been summoned to visit the girl and all had
declared that never before had a subject possess
ing such extraordinary powers of clairvoyance
been met with every one of the professors of
course contended for the honor of bringing her
into public notice but the yeuug assistant of the
hospital who attended her in the first instance
became the happy man and bore off the treasure
to an obscure lodging near the rue st jacques
giving up for her sake and for the dream ot for
tune promised by the wonderful faculty which
she possessed his present situation and the cer
taintv of advancement he had acquired by many
years study and steadfast attention to his arduous
profession
for awhile everything prospered with the young
codple all paris flocked to hear the revelations
of the sybil and her house was flocked from morn
till night with eager inquirers about a year ago
madame do  well known by her eccentric
researches in every kind of science became so en
thusiastic in her admiration for eulalie that she
insisted upon her taking up her abode with her in
order to aid in certain occult works upon which
she was engagedthe end and aim being directed
to no less an obiect than the discovery of all the
buried treasures whicii existed throughout france
it would appear that the revelations of the fair
euluke were of such a nature as to satisfy the
most goldeu anticipations of madame de 
hundreds of visions more gorgeous than imag
ination could supply burst one by one upon the
sleeping sense of tlie somnambulist but of all
those which were thus laid open to the greedy
anticipations of the consullunte none seemed to
ofter such irnmeuso and certain chance of splen
dor as that which was beheld at the chatecq of
lndus
these ruins so celebrated in english soag be
came forthwith the object of a pilgrimage and
the marquis de  repaired thither with the
firm intention of purchasing the ruins if they
were to be had for love or money
but the owner cared not a whit for the first so
far as the marquise was concerned at least and a
great deal too much for the second so that the
affair was rather more difficult to manage than
madame do s had anticipated nothing
however is impossible tu tlioje who are gifted with
a will firm ana resolute as that of the stoutheart
ed marquise and the bargain was struck at an
enormous sacrifice on her part the only condition
being the removal of the rubbish which encutn
bered the entrance to the principal dungeon of the r
castle where so the persuasion existedthe whole
of the treasure was contained the imptieuce
of the lair purchaser was so great that fearing
the customary delay in all french proceedings
be insisted upon tho performance of this part of
tho bargain before she would consent to sign the
contract i
accordmglv workmen were sent to commence
the task at once when lo by the very stroke of
the hammer which loveled to the ground the rem
nant of the old wall that barred ail access to the
dungeon a recess was discovered hollowed iu the
stone and in the recess a casket of iron curious
ly wrought in the fashion of the greek empire
which casket being opened was found to contain
a diamond of wonderful magnitude and of the
first water it is said to be six times lsrger than
the legem and of a lustre unrivalled by any stone
known as yet to the world the value of the
treasure is supposed to he at least  of
francs

ert of sir john franklins whereabouts
we stated the other day that a proposition had
actually been made to lady franklinn tostaitoff
in a steam bloon to look up her lost husband
amid the icy regions of the far north looking
over a file of english papers brought by the last
steamer we find some very remarkable revelations
i raid to have been made by a certain young lady
under the affluence of mesmerism in reference
to the whereabouts of the missing navigator
which we transfer lo our columns as a fitting
corollary to the cnal absurdity
from the manchester guardian
sirln the manchester guardian of satur
day last th september you have inserted a
short notice of inquiries recently made of the bol
ton clairvoyant respecting the fate of bir john
j franklin which besides being essentially incor
rect seems calculated unnecessarily to increase
the uneasiness felt by his friends regarding him
as a party concerned i feel it a duty therefore
thougii with some reluctance to communicate tbe
real facts to you ia detail if disbelieved their
publication can do no barm and if ever so tittle
credited they are rather encouraging th p other

pression would natarally be that he woald be de
taiaed till the ensuing spring which weald just
make up the nine months specified before he ex
pected to be in england this period not having
been given by the clairvoyants as a prophecy but
as the impression on her mind with which she
professed to have some mysterious means of coin
muincation
it is true that she said that he had only three
persons with him but other parties of his men are
following in the same direction though some way
separated from him she saw also the shells
dead bodies of others in different postures under
the snow and she described graphically enough
the deer wild cattle wild men and rough tangled
forests that she passed in going to him with an
animal striped down the back and sides which
leaps very far and may be the panther or wild
cat
she also professed to go and visit his ships
one of whom she said was under water with very
thick timbers the other above it and an old
letter being also possessed from sir james ross
she went to visit him too for this purpose she
said she had to go much further he is fast in
the ice and unabled to turn his ship round but
he intends returning to england when he can
she added that it was snowing heavily when she
saw him he had not seen sir john franklin
the difference between his apparent tf ne and
that of bolton was nearly eight hoars correspond
ing to  deg to  deg w and when requir
ed subsequently to show the place on the map
she pointed to bankes land almost at once a
position fall of probability
sir james ross she says is well but much
annoyed at being stopped another ship is not
far from him ana neither of them have sailed yet
bat there is a third ship much nearer uuder sail
and coming apparently from their direction her
difference of time is only two hours and a half
corresponding to  degress to  degrees west
can this be the transport sent last spring to re
new their supplies she mentioned this ship first
herself only one person in the room knew that
such a vessel had been sent out and in his in
terest for the principal persons concerned he had
not thought of the transport sent to their relief till
this third ship was mentioned
she expressed great astonishment at finding
the clocks differ so much and said they should
be sent to the watchmaker to put them right
she also described sir james ross as being stout
er than sir james franklin and in better case
more squash were her words sir johns
cheeks she said are somewhat sunk through his
fatigue but his health is good and he has now
abundance to eat her description of his person
was otherwise sufficiently near and she respect
fully mentioned hiß being bald
these then were the principal statements
that were thus elicited many other details were
added not without interest but this communica

of the time they were collected they will gain
various degrees of present credit according to the
temperament of those who may receive them in
truth it would seem premature at present to place
much reliance upon them though in these days
when we make the lightning carry our messages
and the sun take our portraits it is very difficult
to draw the precise line betwixt the possible and
the impossible in any case it would be for the
interest of truth that they are recorded when col

a new article of fuel our attention was
drawn a few days since to a load at the door of a
citizen in albany which in appearance resem
bled unburnt bricks upon inquiry we found
that it was an article of fuel manufactured in the
vicinity of newtons corners a few miles out of
the city from a swampy piece of low land which
furnishes an article much resembling peat we
learn that this muck or peat is thrown into a mill
and ground then pressed in the shape of bricks
for the purpose of thoroughly drying when it is
ready for use it is considered to be quite as
cheap as hard coal and preferable to either coke
or coal for grates there being no gas or smoke
