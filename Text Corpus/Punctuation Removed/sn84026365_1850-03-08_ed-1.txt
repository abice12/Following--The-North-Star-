speech of mr t stevens
of pennsylvania
in the house of representatives wednesday february
  in committee of the whole on the state
of the union on the reference of the presidents
annual message
mr stevens of pennsylvania
said
mr chairman i do not know that
i should have troubled the committee
at this time eow i ee nnv reasona
ble prospect that the house would de
vote its time to practical legislation
but for a considerable time after our
meeting the organization of the house
was obstructed and siuce organized
a large portion of its time has been oc
cupied by speeches on the subject of
slavery mostly by southern gentlemen i
when no practical question to which i
they could apply was before the com
mittee there was no doubt a well
defined object in this partly to intimi
date congress and partly to occupy
its time so that no legislation couid be
matured obnoxious to southern gentle
men indeed we are not left to con
jecture on this point the learned
gentlemen from north carolina mr j
cungman who was selected to open
the debate in behalfof human bondage
distinctly notified us that unless con
gress as a condition precedent sub
mitted to settle the slavery question
according to southern demands there
should be no legislation even to the
passage of the ordinary appropriation
bills necessary to sustain the govern
ment and that such measures would
not he obstructed by meeting them in
manly debate and voting on their
merits but by incessantly calling the
yeas and nays on repeated and frivo
lous motions to adjourn until the end
of the session sir i doubt not that
before he ventured on so high a threat
he had full assurances from a sufficient
number of southern gentlemen to carry
it into effect for if he had made it
upon his own hare authority it would
degenerate into contemptible gasco
nade which i am sure the disereet
gentlemen would not indulge in the
scene of last monday in this house ful
ly sustained him and showed that they
had the will and the power to execute
it
here then we have a welidefined
and palpable conspiracy of southern
members combined to stop the supplies
necessary to the existence of the gov
ernment disorganize and dissolve it
until the bands that bind the union to
gether are severed and as a gentle
men early in the session desired dis
cord well might the gentlemen an
ticipate that the country and posterity
would pronounce this treason rank
treason against the nation sir i
doubt if there is another legislative
body in the world where such sedition
would not be followed by prosecution
and punishment france has lately
exiled members of her assembly for a
similar offence but in this glorious
country where nearly twothirds of
the people are free we can say any
thing within these walls or beyond
them with impunity unless it be to ag
itate in favor of human libertythat
is aggression
let us inquire what is the grave
offence the mighty wrong which can
justify a threat big with such portentous
consequences the refusal of con
gress to propagate or to establish a
doubtful or even an admitted good
in the territories would surely be no
cause for rebellion and revolution
much less would the refusal to extend
an evil an admitted evil as unmitiga
ted wrong will an intelligent and
and free posterity believe it when im
partial history records that the only
cause for this high threat was the ap
right is of no sextruth is of no color
prehension that the congress of this
free republic would not propagate
nor permit to be propogated the insti
tution ol human slavery into her vast
territories now free yet such is the
simple fact it is proper then to in
quire whether the thing sought to be
forced upon the territories at the risk
of treason and rebellion be a good or
an evil i think it is a great evil
which ought to be interdicted that we
should oppose it as statesmen as phil
anthropists and as rnaralistsnßtwith
standing the extraordinary position ta
ken by the gentleman from alabama
mr hilliard to the contrary
while i thus announce my unchange
able hostility to slavery in every form
and in every place i also avow my de
termination to stand by all the compro
mises of the constitution and carry
them into faithful effect some of
those compromises i greatly dislike
and were they now open for considera
tion they should never recieve my as
sent but i find them in a constitution
formed in difficult times and i would
not disturb them
by those compromises congress has
no power over slavery in the states
i greatly regret that it is so for if it
j were our legitimate control i would
go regardless of all threats for some
just safe and certain mean for its fi
nal extinction but i know of no one
who claims the right or desires to
touch it within the states but when
we come to form governments for ter
ritories acquired long since the forma
tion of the constitution and to admit
new stales whose only claim for ad
mission depends on the will of con
gress we are bound so to discharge
that duty as shall best contribute to
the prosperity the power the perman
ency and the glory of this nation
does slavery contribute to either of
these is it not rather subversive of
them all let us first view it in the
j low light of political economy that
 nation i suppose is always the most
prosperous all other things being
i equalthat has the most industriousand
the larger number of the producing
classes those who merely consume
the fruits of the earth add nothing to
the strength or the wealth of a nation
slave countries never can have a large
j number of industrious freemen slave
j holders form an untitled aristocracy
with numerous dependents individu
i als appropriate large tracts of territory
i to themselves and thus prevent it jroiii
i being thickly settled by freemen
i their laborers having no ambition to
gratify no love of gain to stimulate
them no parental feelings to impel
them to action are idle and wasteful
when the lash is the only stimulant
the spirit of man revolts from labor
that republic must be feeble both
in peace and war that has not an in
telligent and industrious yeomanry
equally removed from luxury and from
poverty the middling classes who
own the soil and work it with their
own hands are the main support of ev
ery free government despotism may
be powerful and long sustained by a
mixed population of serfs and nobles
but free representative republics that
rely upon the voluntary action of the
people never can under such gov
ernments those who defend and sup
port the country must have a stake in
 the soil must have interest to protect
and rights to defend
slave countries never can have such
a yeomanry never can have a body of
small proprietors who own the soil and
till it with their own hands and sit
down in conscious independence under
their own vine and figtree there is
no sound connecting link between the
aristocrat and tho slave true there
is a class of human beings between
them but they are the most worthless
and miserable of mankind the poor
white laborer is the scorn of the slave
himself for slavery always degrades
labor the white people who work
with their hands are ranked with the
other laborersthe slaves they are
excluded from the society of the rich
their associations if anywhere are
with the colored population they
feel that they are degraded and despi
sed and their minds and conduct gen
erally conform to their condition
the soil occupied by slavery is much
less productive than a similar soil oc
cupied by freemen men who are to
 receive none of the wages of their la
i bor do not care to multiply its fruits j
i sloth negligence improvidence are
the consequence the land being
neglected becomes poor and barren
as it becomes exhausted it is thrown
out as waste for slave labor never ren
ovates its strength this applies par
ticularly to agricultural states take
j virginia the favorite example for the
south which has been so triumphantly
referred to by the gentleman from
j north carolina mr clingman
whence he drew his facts that she was
more prosperous more populous and
more rich than the free states  know
not lam sure it was not from perso
nal observation he would not cer
tainly draw on his imagination in mat
ters of fact i suppose he must have
been misled by the most miserable of
sophists and most false of chroniclers
ellwood fisher
i admit that by nature virginia has
capabilities equal if not superior to
any state in the union she has a
delightful climate a soil naturally fer
tile she is intersected as was well
said by the gentleman from virginia
mr bayly by the noblest rivers
her hills and mountains are filled with
rich minerals and covered with valua
ble timber she has the finest water
l believe in the nation in the very
heart of her state and her harbors
are among the best in ths worldr at
the time of the adoption of the consti
tution she was the most powerful state
her population was double that of
new york it was the boast of her
statesmen that she was pinma inter
puren what is she now the pop
ulation of new york is more than dou
blel think the next census will show
nearly treble hers her land cultiva
ted by unwilling handsis unproductive
travel through the adjouirhkyg states
of ohio and pennsylvania and yon will
see that the land produces more than
double as much as the same kind of
land in virginia in the free states
new towns are everywhere springing
up and thriving the land is becoming
more productive smiling habitations
are within hail of each other the whole
country is dotted with schoolhouses
and churches almost within sight of j
each other and except under peculiar
circumstances their manufactures and
mechanic arts furnishing lucrative em
ployment to all their people and their
population steadily and rapidly increas
ing turn again to virginia there
is scarcely a new town except at one
or two pointswithin her whole borders
her ancient villages wear the appear
ance of mournful decay her miner
als and timber are unwrought her
noble waterpower is but partially oc
cupied her fine harbors are with
out ships except from other ports and
her seaport towns are without com
merce and failing to decay ask
yourself the cause sir and i will abide
the answer
it is essential to the existence of re
publics that education should be gener
ally diffused among the people sla
very prevents this rich men employ
private tutors or send their children
abroad but the children of the people
generally cannot be educated without
the instrumentality of district schools
in slave states where the plantations
are large the population is too sparse
even to maintain them besides there
is another fatal obstacle to them in the
aversion of the rich to associatewith
the poor the poor white laborers
children could never be permitted to
mingle in the same schools and sit
upon the same benches wfith the rich
mens sons that would be offensive
slavery enfeebles a nation in war as
well as in peace it is impossible that
a nation of masters and slaves can be
pjtttjlnl txild fo situ j lit cnfici ll
offensive or defensive war a  a nation
of freemen a large portion of her
population must remain at home to
prevent the rebellien of those who are
constantly in a state of latent warfare
with their oppressors i know sir
we have had a most alarming descrip
tion of the prowess of the south we
have heard their eftnnon roar seen
their bayonets bristle heard the war
cry of the charging chivalry and seen
their bowieknives gleam within this
hall in the vivid picture of the terrible
gentleman from north carolina mr
clingmax
we have often been modestly re
minded of the blood and treasure
and gallantry of the south this i
do not dispute lam proud to admit
that she has furnished many gallant
sons whose names will adorn the
brightest pages of our history both for
the war of the revolution the war of
 and the war which we lately as
sumed as the ally of texas and of sla
very i give her full credit for her
patriotism in furnishing most of the
men who have borne the official bur
dens of the government both in the
civil and the military list i know too
that she has furnished the kind of men
for our armies who are apt to be dis
tinguished when great deeds are done
for it is only the officers and com
manders of armies who live in stoay
the stout hearts and strong arms of
the common soldiers that fight the
battles and win the victories are un
known to fame their birthplace is
not sought for their graves are undis
tinguished and the south has always
furnished officers for our armies pre
sidents for our republic most of our
foreign ambassadors heads of depart
ments chiefs of bureaus and some
times in her proud humility has con
sented that the younger sons of her
dilapidated houses should monopolize
the places of clerks and messengers to
the government but whence are
drawn the common soldiery the men
who peril their lives and win victories
for your glory almost entirely from
i the free states except in cases of sud
den emergency when volunteers are
i called nearest the scene of danger
the present secretary of war a
southern gentleman of great ability
j and strenuous for southern rights says
in his report
according to the practice which
has long prevailed the great majority
i of enlistments is made in the northern
atlantic cities and the adjacent interior
towns whence the recruits are sent to
the general depot for instruction and
finally distributed to the southern and
western posts according to the wants
of the service
yes sir our northern freemen have
always filled the ranks of the regular
army the south has lent us the gen
tlemen to wear the epaulettes and the
sword to take command of the troops
and lead them to southern and south
western climates to fight the frontier
battles and whiten your fields with
their bones
i am opposed to the diffusion of sla
very because confining it to its present
limits will bring the states themselves
to its gradual abolition let this dis
ease spread and although it will render
rochester n y friday march  
the whole body leprous and loathsome
yet it will long survive confine it
and like the cancer that is tending to
the heart it must be eradicated or it
will eat out the vitals the sooner
the patient is convinced of this the
sooner ha will procure the healing
operation the learned aad able gen
tleman from virginia mr meade in
a pamphlet which he laid upon the
table takes the same view of it he
says virginia has adrye population
of near half a million wfift aue is
chieriy dependent on s irn de
mand let us pause a moment over
this humiliating confession in plain
english whatdoes it mean that
virginia is now fit only to be the
breeder not the employer of slaves
that she is reduced to the condition
that her proud chivalry are compelled
to turn slavetraders lor a livelihood
instead of attempting to renovate the
soil and by their own honest labor
compelling the earth to yield her
abundance instead of seeking for the
best breed of cattle and horses to feed
on her hills and valleys and fertilize
the land the sons of that great state
must devote their time to selecting and
grooming the most lusty sires and the
most fruitful wenches to supply the j
slave barracoons of the south and
the learned gentleman pathetically la
ments that the profits of this genteel
traffic will be greatly lessened by the
circumscription of slavery this is
his picture not mine
the same gentleman says in the
same speech if we intend to submit
to the policy of confining the slaves
within their present limits we should
commence torthwith the work of gra
dual emancipation it is an easier task
for us than for our children the
eloquent gentleman from alabama mr
hilliard is of the same opinion
he said we must make up our
minds either to resist the interdiction
of the progress of slavery or to sub
mit to an organic change in our insti
tutions yes sir this admitted re
sult is to my mind one of the most
agreeable consequences of the legiti
mate restriction of slavery confine
this malady within its present limits
surround it by a cordon of freemen
that it cannot spread and in less than
twentyfive years every slaveholding
state in this union will have on its
statutebooks a law for the gradual and i
final extinction of slavery then will
nave oevii jue
wishes of every patriots heart then
wil our fair country be glorious in
deed and be to posterity a bright
example of the true principles of gov
ernment of universal freedom
i am opposed to the extension of sla
very into territories now free for still
graver reasonsbecause i am opposed
to despotism throughout the world i
admit that this government cannot
preach a crusade of liberty into other
states and nations much as she abhors
tyrants and tyranny there she can
only mourn over its existence but
when the question of government is
within her own control and she permits
despotism to exist and aids its diffusion
she is responsible for it in the face of
the civilized world and before tho god
ofliberty in my judgment not only
the slave states but the general go
vernment recognizing and aiding as it
does slavery is a despotism ido not
use the word in a declamatory but
strictly legal signification that go
vernment is despotic where the rulers
govern subjects by their own mere will
by decrees and laws emanating from
their uncontrolled will in the enact
ment and extension of which the ruled
have no voice and under which they
have no rights except at the will of the
rulers despotism does not depend
upon the number of the rulers or the
number of the subjects it may have
one ruler or many rome was a des
potism under nero so she was under
the triumvirate athens was a despo
tism under her thirty tyrants under
her four hundred tyrants under her
three thousand tyrants it has been
generally observed that despotism in
creases in severity with the number
of despots the responsibility is more
divided and the claims mflre numerous
the triumvirs each demanded his vic
tims the smaller the number oi strb
jects in proportion to thetyrants the
more cruel the oppression because the
less danger from rebellion in this
government the free white citizens
are the rulersthe sovereigns as we de
light to be called all others are sub
jects there are perhaps some sixteen
or seventeen millions of sovereigns
and some four millions of subjects
the rulers and the ruled are of all
colors from the clear white of the
caucasian tribes to the swarthy eth
iopian the former by courtesy are
all called white the latter black
in this government the subject has no
rights politic or personal he has no
voice in the laws which govern him
he can hold no property his very
wife and children are not his his
labor is anothers he and all that
appertains to him are the absolute
property of his rulers he is governed
bought sold executed by laws to
which he never gave his assent and
by rulers whom he never chose he
is not a serf merely with half the rights
of men like the the subjects of despotic
russia but a naked slave stripped of
every right which god and nature gave
himand which the high spirit of our
revolution declared inalienablewhich
he himself could not surrendrr and
which man could not take from him
is he not then the subject of despotic
sway
the slaves of athens and of rome
god is the father of us all and all men are brethren
j were free in comparison they had
some rightscould acquire some pro
perty could choose their own masters
and purchase their own freedom and
when ree could rise in social and politi
cal life the slaves of america then
lie under the most absolute and grind
ing despotism that the world ever saw
but who are the despots the rulers
of the countrythe sovereign people
not merely the slaveholder who
cracks the lash he is but the instru
ment of despotism that despotism is
the government ofthe slave states and
the united states consisting of all its
rulersall the free citizens do not
look upon this as a paradox because
you and i and the sixteen millions of
rulers are free nicholas of russia
is free the grand sultan of turkey
is free the butcher of austria is free
augustus antony and lepidus were
free while they drenched rome in
blood the thirty tyrants the four
hundred the three thousand were
free while they bound their countrymen
in chanis you and i and the six
teen millions are free while we fasten
iron chains and rivet manacles on four
millions of our fellow men tear their
wives and children from them separate
them sell them anddoom them to per
petual eternal bondage are we not
then despotsdespots such as history
will brand and god abhors
but we are told that that is none of
our business that southern slavery
is a matter between the slavelolders
and their own consiences i trust it
may be so decided by impartial history
and the unerring judge that we may
not be branded with that great stigma
and that grievous burden may not
weigh upon our souls but could we
hope for that justification if now when
we have the power to prevent it we
should permit this evil to spread over
thousands of square leagues now free
and settle upon unborn millions sir
for myself i should look upon any
northern man enlightened by a north
ern education who would directly or
indirectly by omission or commission
by basely voting or cowardly skulking
permit it to spread over one rood of
gods free earth as a traitor to liberty
and recreant to his god
slavery tends to render the people
among whom it is planted arrogant
insolent intolerant and tyrannical to
wards the freemen of other parts of the
union the honorable member from
virgin whom i have ahud
quoted mr meade says speaking
of slavery our past history testifies
to the fact that it elevates the charac
ter of the white man though we
have been in a numerical minority in
the union for fifty years vet during the
greatei part of that period we have
managed to control the destinies of the
union whether on the battlefield
or in the council the sons of the south
have taken the lead and the records of
the nation afford ample testimony of
their superior energy and genius
sir i do not complain of this state
ment the former part of it is both
candid and true but i cannot listen
to the recital without feeling the burn
ing blush on my countenance that the
north with her overshadowing mil
lions of freemen has for half a cent
ury been tame and servile enough to
submit to this arrogant rule
the south imprison northern free
men when found within her borders if
they happen to be guilty of a dark
skin and carry it between the wind
and their nobility and when a sov
ereign state sends a learned and
venerable agent to test the legality of
such imprisonment before their own
tribunals he is driven with violence
and indignity from tneir shores massa
chusetts has sufferod and i trust re
members the insult
how often have these walls been
profaned and the north insulted by the
insolent threat that if cotigress legis
late against southern will it should be
disregarded resisted to extremity and
theunion destroyed during the pre
sent session we have been more than
once told amidst raving excitement
that if we dared to legislate n a certain
way the south would teach the north
a lesson that their minds were made
up to extreme resistance is this the
pkre to use threats instead of argu
ments are the representatives of
freemen to be thus treated true you
are not wholly without justification in
the belief that it will be effectual you
have too often intimidated congress
you have more than once frightened
the tame north from its propriety and
found doughfaces enough to be your
tools and when you lacked a given
number i take no ride in saying you
to find them m old pennsyl
vania who in former years has rank
ed a portion of her delegation among
your most submissive slaves but i
hope with some fears that the race of
doughfaces is extinct i do not see
how it could well be otherwise thoy
were an unmanly an unvirile race in
capable according to the laws of na
ture of reproduction i hope they
have let no descendants the old ones
are deep in political graves for them
i am sure there is no resurrection for
they were soulless now when the
whole civilized world unites in de
nouncing slavery as a curse a shame
and a crime i trust that when the
great battle between liberty and slave
ry comes to be fought on this floor
there will none be found hiding among
the stuff no fraudulent concealments
not one aceursed achan in this whole
camp of the representatives of free
men
the eloquent gentleman from vir
ginia mr seddoi the other day
in his beautiful peroration personated
the great states of virginia kentucky
and louisiana and in their name apos
trophized the good and i will add the
great man who now occupies the exe
cutive chair and in their name be
sought him as he loved the place of his
birth the place of his nature and the
place of his residence not to forsake
his northern brethren in this emergen
cy but to stand by them in the defence
of human bondage how much more
effective enduring and hallowed would
that eloquence have been had the ora
tors lips been touched with a coal
from the altar of freedom then
could he have gone with friendly anxie
ty to that noble benevolent and hero
ic man and admonished him that
although he had gathered all the earth
ly laurels that can be reaped by the
sickle of death yet if he would have
his name descend to posterity with in
creasing lustre he must by one great
just and patriotic example wipe out
the only spot that obscures the sun of
his glory he might with propriety
have taken with him the learned gen
tleman from alabama mr hilliard
and together have pointed him to that
solemn tiour which to him and to all
of us who are treading the downhill
of life must soon arrive when the
visions of ambition and of earthly
wealth shall have passed from before
his eyes and left him nothing but a
gaping grave and an eternal judge
ment
the accomplished gentleman from
alabama rev mr hilliard might
with peculiar propriety do what with
profane lips i dare not go to his illus
trious friend and with fervid piety and
eloquence more thrilling than that
which made felix tremble implore him
by a love deeper than that of birth
place of nature and of residence by
the love of his own immortal soul to
be warned in time by the awful the
inexorable doom accursed is the
manstealer he might perhaps
have pointed him to the gloomy jour
ney that leads through the dark shadow
and shown him how ineffably brighter
are the glories of that kingdom where
all are tree perchance too he would i
have noticed the thronging thousands
traveling to that same dread tribunal
summoned to give evidence of deeds
done in the body some of them were
bondsmen and slaves on earth but
whose disembodied spirits were then
failed erect tali the proudest
of earths oppressors and asked him
to inquire of his own conscience who j
was most likely to meet a hearty wel i

vocated by the supplicating voices of
thousands with whom he had dealt
justly on earth and made free indeed
or he whose admission should be with

stripes and their wounds to their fa

and to his judge
when mr stevens concluded his
speech several southern members en
deavored to get the floor and among
them messrs seddon and millson
but the chairman awarded it to mr
buel of michigan
from the christian citizen
senator douglass
this gentleman in relation to
whose future political course upon the
slavery question some of our cotempo
raries had begun to entertain a favor
able opinion has shown his hand in
the development of a scheme the sub
stance of which we presented in our
last weeks no adapted to give the
whole of the remaining territory ac
quired from mexico to slavery
while the former course of mr
douglass has certainly given no just j
ground to expect that he would do any
thing favorable to the interests of free
dom we had yet in common with
others hoped that a better acquaintance
with the feelings and sentiments of
northern men his constituents which
his past years residence in chicago
has enabled him to acquire might in
duce him to take that stand in the pen
ding struggle between freedom and
slavery which his position as the sena
toiial re preae native of a free state i
distinctly points out as his duty
but it seems that he regards his
notorious pledge to the people of new
orleans as more binding than his obli
gations to his own state or rather
that there is more to be made political
ly by proving treacherous to the inter
ests of his own constituents than by
obeying their direct and positive mstruc
tions no allowance can be made for
honesty of purpose in a case like the
one before us where the will of the
people of a state has been clearly ex
pressed though their legislative assem
bly and is thus deliberately violated
douglass must henceforth be classed
with dickinson and cass as utterly
traitorous and untrustworthy
the time when such a compromise
as the one proposed by mr douglass
can be looked upon by northern men
with anything but the deepest abhor
rence has long since passed by the
precedent for a series of years acted
upon of coupling a free and slave state
upon their admission into the confed
eracy will no longer be respected
slavery is a doomed institution and
doomed will be the man or class of men
who attempt by bolstering it up and
i obstructing liberal legislation to per
petuate the loathsome curse the in
j effaceable brand of infamy will be
burned into the character of such men
and they will be remembered by pos
terity if remembered at all only in
john dick p bi nter

connection with beneejct arnold the
traitor as those w ho would sell all that
is promising and glorious in our free
institutions for sordid and ephemaral
popularity
oliver johnson of the antislavery bu
gle holds the following language on that
part ot mr clays speech and compromise
resolutions which relates to the return of
fugitive slaves
there is one part of mr gys
speech which has excited in our breast
emotions of deepest indignation and
horror it is diabolically cool infer
nally atrocious it proves conclusively
that mr clay in spite of his smooth
exterior and pious professions has a
rotten heart we allude to what
he says about the capture of fugitive
slaves on this point he goes with him
who goes farthest witness his precise
words it is our duty to make the lair
more effective and i shall go with the
senator from the south who goes far
thest in making penal laws andfim
posing the heaviest sanctions
for the recovery of fugitive slaves
and the restoration of them to their
owners
if a man who could utter a sentiment
like that at this meridian of the
nineteenth centnry and in a land
boasting of liberty is not a villain
at heart then let the word be banish
ed from the language and haynau
the austrian manhunter and butcher
be baptised as a christian suppose
mr clay for the sake of certain pecu
niary and commercial advantages prof
fered to us by austria had deliberate
ly proposed a treaty with that govern
ment stipulating among other things
that an austrian agent haynau for
example might come here and by the
help of our courtsjails and sheriffs
drag from our shores the hungarian
refugees who have been the recipi
ents of so much american sympathy
would not the whole people have cried
out with horror against a proposal so
inhuman and monstrous would they
not have said perish commerce per
ish property perish every earthly in
terest sooner than consent to perpe
trate such a crime
free colored people of louisi
anathe laws of louisiana respect
ing the free people of color are more
liberal than in any other slaveholding
stat or some free states they con
stitute a class of citizens whom law
recognises and protects and whose
social position is better than that of
free people of color in other sections
the new orleans picayune of the
th ultimo contains the report of a
case decided by the supreme court of
the state which held that they were
competent witnesses in trials of white
persons and also assigned the reason
therefor as followsjudge king de
livering the opinion
our legislation and jurisprudence
upon this subject differs materially
from those of the slave states general
ly in which the rule contended for
prevails this difference of public
policy has no doubt arisen from the
different condition of that class of per
sons in this state at the date of our
earliest legislation as a territory a
well as at the present day free persons
of color constituted a numerous class
in some districts they are respectable
from their intelligence industry and
habits of good order many of them
are highly educated and the instances
are by no means rare in which they are
large property holders so far from

the slave trade
our readers will recollect that we lately
a correspondence of william har
med of new aork with bruin hill deal
ers in men women and babies in relation to
o beautiful white girl named family russel
jfor whom the said soul traders demanded
eighteen hundred dollars
efforts have been made to purchase her but
without success reader remember that
this young woman was imprisoned in alex
andria for nearly fifty years a portion of
the district ofcolumbia where slavery and
the slave trade existed by the permission of
the people of the free states
the following account of the matter is
from the washington correspondent of the
true democrat
washington feb  
on wednesday last a friend of mine re
ceived a letter from new york soliciting his
assistance in the purchase of a slave girl who
has recently fallen into the hands of the soul
traders in alexandria my friend being pres
sed with business was anxious that i should
take the matter in hajid and i accordingly
assented
the letter strongly urged the purchase of
the girl at a reasonable sum which sum kind
triends in new york who kindly esteemed
the mother of the unfortunate slave agreed
to raise
before starting for alexandria yesterday
morning i was informed by joshua leavitt
who had just arrived from new york that
the friends there had abandoned the idea ol
giving siboo and if they would not take
jess the mother and her friends must endure
the calamity as we would any calamity by
pirates they were willing to give one thou
sand or twelve hundred tosatisfy the capidity
of these inhuman fleshdealers and prevent a
separation of the girl from those whom she
joved above all others on earth but they
were not disposed to yield further to the
imercenary demands of these monsters
with these instructions i proceeded upon
my mission anived at alexandria i went
in search of the pen and found it in the rear
of the city in a place dreary and deserted
which seemed marked by the frowns of
omnipotence a fit theatre for piratical opera
tion a suitable dwelling place for penitentia
ry and gallows deserving ruffians
the main building is of brick joined to
this are small wood buildings and the large
pen which contained some hundred colored
peopleor in southern parlance a drove
ready for the southern market the keeper
of the establishment a whiskybloated biped
admitted me and upon making known my
business i was informed that bruin had
gone to alexandria
i then asked if mr hill was in
no said the fellow he has gone south
with a drove
upon my informing him that i came to
purchase emily he told me that mr bruin
was waiting to hear from her mother who
jie expectfcd would give siboo for her
i set his itlitfd at rest on that point end de
sired to see her and was flatly refused
i have strict oiders said he not to
admit any one
he then directed a smartlooking colored
outh to go with me to the city and find
bruin
as i left the door i caßt my eye through
she gratingand beheld an indiscriminate mass
of men women and children whose counte
nances betokened the deep emotions of the
heart all destined for the cotton and rice
fields of the south families broken up
the strongest ties of humanity sundered
weeping and lamentationbrokenhearted
and desolate with no eye to pity and no hand
to save god of the oppressed how long
will thine arm be stayed
on my way to the city i inquired of my
young sable companion about emily
said i do you see her often
o yea master i secs her very often and
carries her meals to her
is site a smart gut
 yes sa shes right smart and shes right
good lookin too
is she black 
no sa shes almost as white as any white
girl
does she want to go south 
no sa she cries a heap about and wants
to live uid her mother
do you belong to mr bruin
yes sa i belongs to him and has got to
go south ivid de res i expect
do you want to go
no sa none of us wants to go
at this answer the words came to my
lips then ivhy in the name of all that is
sacred to liberty and dear to mans freedom
dont you and your companions in bondage
tear doum the infernal pen set it on fire and
run away by the light of it but to give
utterance to such words would be treason in
this quarter though glorious advice all over
the world to the white man held in durance
vile
we found bruin and i was received by
him with a suavity of manner which would
eclipse even lord chesterfield himself his
appearance wofully belies his profession he
is a middleaged man all smiles and polite
ness and very intelligent but we all know
that satan can transform himself into an
angel of light and a man may smile and
mile and be a villain still
i made known the object of my visit and
informed him that our new york friends had
abandoned the idea of purchasing emily at
siboo
said he i am glad of it sir i dont want
to send her northl prefer that she should
go south i have a large lot that lam go
ing to take of the most respectable class
she is one of the best of the lot besides it
will do us no good to let her go north
after attempting a negotiation in every
way that i could mustei to no effect i en
deavored to appeal to bis sympathy
thete is her mother she loves her
daughter can you not take less to pre
vent their separation
no sir said he she cant go north for
a cent short of what i have named but if some
gentleman he laid much stress on the word
gentleman here wishes to purchase her lor
himself he can hav e her for fifteen
hundred dollars
in other words i was made to understand
that the mother could have her daughter
whom god had given her and who was en
dowed with no ordinary qualities of person
and mind for eighteen hundred
dollars and not a cent less but if
some gentleman here wished to purchase
her for himselffor puiposes too abhorrent to
namehe could have her for fif teen
hundred dollars
great heaven to what a depth of infamy
will not men descend setting a price upon
female virtue beauty and innecence and for
what and these abominations too within
sight of the american capitol and by virtue
of american laws oh if there is a sin
more damning in its effects than the entire
aggregate of others it is the buying and
selling of virtuous females for purposes of
prostitution
to raise the siboo was impossible i
inew it and told bruin so but it had no
effect he would have that or he would
sell her to some gentleman a number of
whom had already applied for her
i saw before me a being in human form
but an incarnate devil at heart a wretch
abandoned of heaven and devoted to the al
mighty dollar upon whom no words of sym
pathy no considerations of humanity could
have effect and i left him fully conscious that
the monster would one day meet with some
awful doom
if there is a wretch upon earth commission
ed by satan to the performance of deeds from
which the spirit of darkness would shrink
with horror and dismay bruin is one of them
emily is doomed she is white and beau
tiful and hence her market value she
may withstand the assaults of the fell destroy
er but her mother brothers sisters and
friends she will probably never see more
with her unfortunate companions she will be
taken down the river next week you who
enjoy the comforts of home the blessings of
the social circle and the sweet smiles of
your children think of emily and the thou
sands who like her in this republican gov
ernment are bought and sold lor puiposea so
abhorrent so helldeserving ours

yielding to the slave power
if the mass of the people in the free
states do not yield in the present crisis of our
political affairs to all the demands of the slave
power it will not be because their party lead
ers do not do all in their power to accomplish
such a result on friday evening of last
week the great democratic meeting at phil
adelphia in favor of the extension of slavery
was presided over by hon chas brown and
addressed by john cadwallader col page
robert tyler vincent l bradford b s

resolved that the constitution of the
united slates vests in congress no power to
make laws for the people of the territories
acquired by or annexed to the union but only
to dispose of and make needful rules and re
gulations respecting territory or other property
belonging to the united states
resolved that the principle of the wil
mot proviso is not a harmless political specu
lation or abstraction excused if erroneous by
its alleged philanthropic intent but is the same
ancient aristocratic pernicious and pestilent
political heresy ever repudiated and denoun
ced by the democratic party of the union
which seeks by means of an implication ot
power of congress gradually to undermine
state sovereignty destroy legislation in the
respective states consolidate the union and
establish on the ruins of stale rights a cen
tral sovereignty easily contiolled or managed
by the few at the expense of the many
resolved that it is contrary to the spirit
in which the constitution of the union was
framed and by which alone it can be perpet
uated to abolish by act of congress the in
stitution of slavery in the district of colum
bia without the consent of the people thereof
and the consent of the slates which ceded the
district for the use of the government of the
united ssates
resolved that we cal upon our state
legislature to repeal all laws conflicting with
that section of the constitution of the united
states in regard to the restitution of runaway
slaves so that the fundamental obligation
binding upon every citizen of the union and
the law t of congress passed to carry it into ef
fect may no longer be set at defiance and the
rights of our southern brethren trampled un
der foot
resolved that we rejoice at the votes in
the national house of representatives laying
the wilmot proviso upon the table as an ap
propriate disposition of a measure which did so
much to procrastinate the war with mexico
and to embarrass the late illustrious adminis
tration and which events have sufficiently
proved to be without any practical importance
except for purposes of irritation and insult
and we rejoice also that messrs gilmore
mann robbins mclanahan ross and dim
mick six ot the eight democrats from this
state in congress voted to extinguish the
firebrand wihch has been productive of so
much disaster and dissention
in commenting upon these resolutions the

ifwe do not mistake the present appeal
ances it is the purpose of the northern partj
ners to this bloody bond to create and j
excitement about the safety of the union
whether intended or not the tendency of
their course is to produce in the public mind
a spirit of violent persecution against all who
say aught against the constitution or who
utter a syllable of condemnation upon the
vile system of slavery
meetings have been recently held in new
york philadelphia and elsewhere the na j
tural tendency of whose proceedings is to
arouse and to inflame the most malignant pas j
sions of the populace and to beget a blind j
and bagaless enthusiasm in favor of the ex
isting slaveholding uniptj fn character with i
the proceedings of these meetings are the
tone and bearing of the northern press
journals of all descriptionswhig and dem
i ocritic religious and politicalteem from
week to week with appeals ir favor pf the
union and with highwrought eulogies on
he constitution angry invectives and n
vengeful threats towards all who have lie
manliness to ayow sentiments hostile to this
idol are seen along the columns of rpany of
our influential newspapers while the lowest
grades of the press are openly and directly
attempting under the vile pietence that the
union is in danger to raise a storm of mur
derous violence and to afford a pretext to
mobocrats for the commission of cruel and
wanton outrages upon the few who shall dare
to cali in question our unhallowed national
compact in this view of passing events it
becomes the men and women of our land
whose high motto is no union with
slaveholders and who mean to stand
firmly by the cause of liberty at every haz
ard to examine well the foundation of their
faith and to be prepared for any danger or
hardship which they may be called to meet
in the free utterance of their conscientious
convictions of duty
the iniquitous and mischievous character
and tendency of this union and the duty
and necessity of its dissolution were never
more solemnly impressed upon our mind than
at the present moment scarcoly a speech
from congress or an editorial from the press
but comes laden with instruction on this point
in the name and at the demand of the union
the north is urgently required to sacrifice
freedom of speech the liberty of the press
the right of assembling and the right of peti
tion we are called upon in the name of
this unholy confederacy to be deaf to the
voice of human woe to extinguish in our
hearts the holiest sympathies of our nature
to abandon the very basis of all morality to
repudiate the religion of jesus christ which
is full of mercy and good fruits virtually to
deny god and to fall down before the con
stitution as the highest object of veneration
and regard in its name we must be ready
to extend the foul cyatqm of slavery over a
soil of almost incalculable dimensions to
hunt down our fellow men in the northern
states like beasts of prey and in the event
of a struggle for freedom on the part of the
slaves against their goddefyjng oppressors
northern men are required to shoulder arpis
to march to the scene of conflict and to pout
the deadly contents of their weapons not
into the breast of the infernal oppressor but
into the bosom of the rebellious slave intq
such an union we say in the name of the
living god we can never enter perish the
bond it should be ground to powder and
the whirlwinds of offended heaven should
sweep away its dust forever yes we say
the union ought to be dissolved how dare
any citizen of the state of new ork sol
emnly bind himself to shoot down ot hunt
down his fellow man no man needs to be
told that such a pledge is wrong it is self
evideeitly so and it only needs to be honest
ly a hurried to deepen conviction in the heart
of every honest man we shall go on
therefore to oppose this wrongto preach
hostility towards this guilty compact trusting

w e are unable to announce any signs of j
hor e or of progress from the proceedings of
cf ingress since our last issue  here have
bjen no rallyings in behalf of liberty in
e ither branch of the legislature speech
making has been the order ot the day and
in this department the south seems to have
everything its own way w hat northern
representatives will do when the time for
words has passed and the time for action
comps it may be unwise to predict though
we must say that the past history of the
men as well as the present complexion of
political events leaves us little ground to
hope for a bold stand on their pait against
the slavepower the little resolution dis
played at the commencement of the session
is now sicklied oer by the pale cast of
thought treachery to thejwilmot proviso
and to free soil principles has shown itself
unmistakably throughout the whig ranks
and the spirit of compromise is rapidly doing
its work upon the northern press and people
judging from these indications we seem to
be shut up to the sad conclusion that in the
present conflict as in former ones where
liberty and slavery have been arrayed
against each other m congress the slave
power will k victorious and the north l
humbled nddefeated
but to the proceedings
on the thof februaty in committee of
the whole house on the state of the union
mr w v n bay of missouri made a
long speech mainly n the subject of slavery
he denied that the south was responsible for
the agitation affirmed that the north had
maje war on southern institutions spoke of
slavery as a purely domestic institution
said that it existed prior to fhe adoption of
the constitution contended that slaves were
property and subject fo the laws which gov
ern and control property referred to the or
dinance of  and especially to that part
relating to fugitive slaves he then pro
ceeded to read the north a lecture on its
failure io comply with the d section of the
th article of the constitution he admitted
that the article in question had been held
sometimes to refer to apprentices or to per
sons bound to labor for a limited period but
he read a portion of the decision of the su
preme court delivered by judge story in
the case of prigg vs pennsylvania and he
held the interpretation tlrere given to be the
only one which the clause can properly re
ceive he paraded this decision before the
house tyith the horrid law of  both of
which he contended had been grossly viol
ated by the north
after a long display of griefs and regrets
at the alleged perfidy of the north he ad
dressed himself to the territorial question
his objection to the wilmot proviso was
that it proposed to legislate for a people who
are competent to legislate for themselves
we have referred to this speech and pre
sented some of its leading features not be
cause of its intrinsic vajue but simply to
allow all to be heard
in the house on the st mr w h
bissell of illinois administered a most blis
tering rebuke to the hotheads of the south
who were to bully the north into
an abandonment of the wilmot proviso
by threats of disunion he quoted largely
from the speeches of brown clingman and
inge and laid bare their falsehood violence
and disunion designs mr bissell is not an
abolitionist and scarcely a free soil man
but we cannot but thank him for the keen
and powerful manner in which he has dis
posed of southern braggadpcia and southern
grievances boll however as he is he
could not we are sorry to say allow the op
portunity to pass while making this other
wise creditable speech without consoling the
slaveholders by speaking of the garrisons
tappans and smiths in the same category
with the southern advocates of pisunion
and by assuring the human fleshmongeis
that the north will stand by the south i
assure you sir said he that wc the re
presentatives of the north icill aid you to pre
serve your constitutional rights as we have
ever done this of course means that the
wilmot proviso will not be insisted on that
slavery in the district of columbia and in
the navy yards will not be abolished and
that the horrid traffic in human souls will be
continued undisturbed by the action of nor
thern representatives this pledge coming
from mr bissell at such a lime shows that
even a man with sufficient courage to fight a
duel may lack the necessary moral courage
to declare in lhe face of slaveholders a right
eous course of action and further proves
that even a duellist may be a doughface
the speech of mr t stevens which will
be found on the first page of this weeks
paper has most thoroughly stirred up the
wrath of mr millson of virginia the
unenviable pictuie drawn by the former of
the character and condition of the old do
minion caused the chivalrous blood of the
latter to boil with rage we give a speci
men of iliis gentlemans tsaquisiie taste
refined setittbfthy and manly indignation in
the following
i endeavored mr chairman to get jhe
floor immediately upon the close of the re
marks submitted by one of the representa
tives from pennsylvania mr stevens 
wished to give instant expression to the irri
tation occasioned by the gross and offensive
allusions to the state from which i come
that irritation however was ljut momentary
and has since subsided into a quiet feciing
of loathing and indignation a leeling more
fitting the accusation and the accuser in
speaking of the slave population of my state
and of the employment of her citizens that
member had the boldness to declare that
virginia was now so degraded that but
i will not i cannot repeat the gross lan
guage uttered by him i could pof do so
without violating the decorum of this body
without outraging those proprieties which
should at all tmes be respected and obser
vedwithout shocking the delicacy of that
portion of our auditors who attend our delib
erations in ihe confidence that they will hear
nothing to offend their modesty or wound
their sensibility
if the truth were known this same mill
son whose delicate sensibility has been so
terribly shocked by the bare mention of the
occupation is himself like many other hon
orable gentlemen of his state in vulgar par
lance a slavebreeder and perhaps the
money in his purse is the price of some girl
sold from her mother for no other cause than
to replenish that purse such abominable
hypocrisy and affectation as he evinces in the
above remarks mav be met with in all the
circles of the south henry clay treated us
to a dish of the same sort in his late speech
when he inveighed against the slavetrade in
the district of columbia and would at the j
same time have the horrible system of sla
very perpetuated in that district ihe at
tempt to disguise the gross and foul enormij
ties of slavery with the gauze of a mockj
refinement is a trick which has been too often
and too successfully played in this land bf
shams but we leave mr millson in the
hands of mr stevens who is abundantly
able and judging from his speech which
we hope no one will fail to read is equally
willing to do the chivalrous virginig every
possible justice f a
on the th february mr giddings of
ohio with his characteristic promptitude and
bodness presented a petition various
individuals in pennsylvania and delaware
asking for a peaceful dissolution of the union
and accompanying the preservation with the
motion to refer them to a select committee
with instructions to inquire firstly whether
dissatisfaction with our federal union exists
among the people of these states d if so
to what extent and d from what has such
dissatisfaction arisen as is usual in the
case of such petitions it created considerable
stir among honorable members and they
rushed upon it from all quarters
guish its light of course it was rejected
only  voting for and  against it thus
anpther stab has been given to the right of

proposition to the committee of the house
to admit california yith her present bound
aries into the union on an equal footing
with the original states
the subject of slavery again became the
theme and the house was addressed by
mr toombs mr baker and mr mclane
the first and last are southerners and of the
ultra southern stamp we copy here a por
tion of the defense set up by mr mclane
for slavery in maryland
he lived in a border state that could do i
very well without slavery but which did not
for that reason say that slavery was a moral i
wrong a national disgrace they did not
think so sickly spirits migtt so clothe j
their philanthrophy the people of his state
thought it an institution which was a moral
necessity where it now existed advantageous
jn soqie states but necessary in all the
states where it now had an existence a
single view of this question he did not care
one particle whether northern men on either
side of the house gave him their acquiescence
or not it was a question which came nearer
home to him than to them we could not
live in the midst of a large black population
the law of slavery jt was a law
as necessary to the discipline of the free
black man as of the slavea law which the
free states adopted every one of them
they had every one of them got their slave
ry they had every one of them found it to
be necessary to enact their laws establishing
negro slavery cultivated men of the north
did not deny it beyond the political dis
tinction which they made against the blacks
there was the social municipal distinction
it was the social distinction of which he
spoke it was bondage bondage in degree
it was necessary to themhe was not re
proaching them for it they could not live
without it it was thus limited in degree
with them on account of their free sparse
black population and their overwhelming
proportion of whites now in maryland
the whites were not so overwhelming in
numbers as in pennsylvania and the other
free states and therefore they wanted a
more complete system of bondage than the
people of the free statesthey wanted more
than a prohibition against blacks and whites
entering together into the sacred bonds of
matrimony and the other like municipal re
straints imposed upon the black population
they required the law of slavery did not
every man know that in the revolutionary
war the black slave messed with the white
soldier and no white soldier objected to it
this was the case upon the battle fields of
north carolina m the gallant corps of
south carolina in greenes army in the
corps of washington at yorktownblack
slaves messed with the white soldiers and
the whites made no objection why be
cause thpre was a consciousness of moral
and legal superiority or the part of the white
but the slave though inferior was called
there to defend his the slaves fireside his
wife his children as the white men were
defending theirs and if there had been no
law recognizing slaveryif the blacks had
been free blacks the white soldier would
not have messed with them
well upon our humble word if we cculd
not pick out a dozen of these inferior colored
men of our own good city of rochester that
would put this incoherent and weakminded
legislator to the blush we would yield readily
to the imputation of moral arid intellectual
inferiority what bungling jargon what
ridiculous nonsense and yet nonsensical
and ridiculous as is is the foregoing it is
about as rational and as worthy of respect as
any defence which can be made for slavery
in the senate clays compromise resolu
tions have been the main topic mr foote
of mississippi renewed and insisted on his
motion for the appointment ef a committee of
thirteen with instructions for ihe purpose of
maturing a scheme of compromise for the
adjustment of all pending questions growing
out of the subject of slavery he accom
panied his proposal with the declaration that
unless something of the kind he proposed
was done speedily it would be impossible to
preserve the union a long debate ensued
upon the proposition of mr foote in which
badger foote clemens dayton butler
berrien walker davis of mississippi and
others took part and the senate adjourned
before the motion tor a committee was
voted on
on ihe same day feb  mr chase
of ohio presented a resolution of the legis
lature of ohio in favor of the acknowledg
ment of the independence of liberia which
was referred to the committee on foreign
i relations and ordered to be printed mr
seward requested to present a memorial ol
the citizens and residents of the valley of the
rio grande in which they represent that it
is their desire that all the section east of the
rio grande and south of the line of new
mexico distinct from the province of texas
be erected into a new territory to be called
the territory of the rio grande the
petition was referred
mr benton pending the consideration of
clays compromise took occasion to deal an
annihilating blow on the heads of the small
babblers fiom the south who have from
time to time exerted themselves in their
little way to establish the conviction that
slavery has never been legally abolished in
mexico this mischievous pretence set
afloat by the propaga dists of slavery we
think will scarcely dare to make its appear
ance again in the senate mr benton has
literally overwhelmed that body with evi
dence demonstrating that slavery ha  not
only been legally universally and for ever
i abolished hut that even when it existed it
was a system that whitened into purity com
pared to the foul abomination which now
seeks admission into the new territories mr
benton as every one expected denounced
the wilmot proviso as useless and look
essentially the ground of cass clay taylor

dear sir the ladies of new york anx
ious for the emancipation of their oppressed
race and being well assured that an organ
through which to make known their grie
vances and plead for their redress is necessa
ry feeling convinced that the north star
from the very able manner in which it is con
ducted and its wide circulation is one of the
most efficient instrunientalities for the accom
plishment of that end purpose emulating the
noble example of their sisters in philadelphia
by holding a fair for the benefit of said pa
per during the anniversary week in may next
and have formed an association for the fur
therance of tfiat object
you would confer a favor on the ladies by
making known their intentiop through the
cpluiqns o yoqr valuable paper by soliciting
for them the aid of all who are friendly to
their object and by receiving for and for
warding to them all contributions which may
be obtained from your section of country
very respectfully yours
fanny tompkins secy
remarks we have readily and gratefully
given place in our columns to the above an
nouncement the intended effort to sustain
the north is evidence of an interest
in the cause of the slave w hich we heartily
appreciate and is worthy of the enlightened
ladies who propose to make it we are
happy to learn that the pioposition is taken
up with much earnestness and that a large
committee consisting of twentyfive ladies
has already been organised mrs emmeline
bastien has been appointed first directress
miss fanny tompkins a lady well fitted for
the office appointed secretary mrs j m
forten treasurer we also see among the
committee the names of mrs e benian
mrs s downing and mrs rosetta cowes
committees have also been appointed to pur
chase goods select rooms and solicit dona
tions in aid of the fair judging from these
preparations the ladies are resolved to do
something which shall be worthy of the in
telligence activity and generosity of new
york
a box has already been received from
england containing many valuable articles
which will be displayed for sale at the con
templated fair we are authorised to ob
serve in connection with this announcement
that the contemplated fair like the paper
w hich it designs to support will be conducted
on the broad principle of a common humani
ty it is to be open to the cooperation of all
without distinction of cdlor we make this
declaration with a view to remove all ground
for alleging that this is to be a colored fair
as some were wont to that held in
philadelphia during christmas week we
see no earthly reason why a fair conducted
mainly by colored ladies but which is open
to the cooperation of all should be termed a
colored fair it seems that we are never
to lead in anything however good it be and
however general its character without at
taching to that good the odium which a bitter
and relentless prejudice has attached to our
effior abolitionists at any rate should
judge differently and determine the worthi
ness of our actions by the motives and objects
in view rather than by the complexion we
bear there uno more reason for calling a
fair conducted mainly by colored ladies a
colored fair than for calling a fair con
ducted by white ladies a white fair
contributions for this fair will be grate
fully ieceived by f douglass at the north

our friends ward and thomas are taxing
their ingenuity to ascertain who is a genuine
abolitionist friend thomas with more
liberality than w t ard admits that w l
garr isonand f douglass are genuine aboli
tionists we cannot say that we think the
controversy on this point between these two
expert editors is of very great consequence
in the antislavery field as in other
fields of labor the genuine workman will
be known by his fruits and we think that the
labors of wm l garrison if measured by
their results will be found to be not inferior

meet and join hands and heart for the union
we meet for the union aye and will die un
der the union a great black cloud hangs over
our southern atmosphere and its threatning
aspect denotes widespread ruin it is carry
ing across the water the lamentable news that
this country of liberty of equality of union
is about to be dissevered and plunged into fra
tricidal strife and for whai for somewhat
of injury done to the south  stand here to
speak the word the north has failed to do
her duty to the south she has failed to ful
fil the provisions ol the constitution we
have not done justice to the south i stand
here to ask evenhanded justice and if it be
done the south will sit down with us under
our vine and fig tree and through all time
worship the same idol of liberty we have
violated the constitution and injured the south
by not returning their runaway slaves when
they sought them among us cries of no
no cheers fanaticism and abolitionism
are but other names for burglary robbery
fraud and larceny it was a compromise on
the question of slavery tfiat brought the fed
ral onion together and by that comptomise
that constitution we are hound by our oaths
by our fealty to our country to render up their
fugitive property i ask the question have
we done so no we nevet ought we
have not

maryland  appear in coutt as the basis of a

free a man frpm his bonds but i will not go
so far as to break through the constitution
i will yield up the negroes it is our duty to
yield them up when they have run away
from their owners i have professionally
defended several such cases apd have found

mined out that the claimant was his own fath

temaie slavesthe jury returned a verdict in
favor of the negro did north carolina com
plain no anti shp never will complain if
strict justice be done i tell you our fanatics
our abolitionists are the worst men i ever
saw when mr lee of marylandas hon

slave a bodyservant and one in whom he bad
placed great confidence one who had always
fated better ihan tfie free negro here he
mr l found shameful treatment
he found that the slave had been persuaded
to run away by some free negroes that he
never desired to leave his master but the ne
groes and abolitionists would not allow him tu
go back i made arrangements then to sell
the negro for one third of his value and could
have done sc and he might easily have earned
his freedom hatj these fanatics and abolition
ists let him alone oh ihese smooth qua
ker rascals these fanatic villains these scound
rel abolitionists whose hypocrisy ought to
doubledamn them it is they who induce a
judge to reverse his decisions and rob a man
it is they who have got us to the very brink of
disunion great confusion when we do
justics to the south there will be no cause for
complaint there will be no complaint the
noise was now so great that we could not
catch mr ws remarks for some time the
south are as deeply interested in preserving
ihe constitution intact as we are they say
to the north do us justicesimple justice
let us begin then to do our duty and the
cause of strife will be at an end the union
must not cannot be dissolved nearly all
those before me have been nursed under the
union protect the union then and let it
stand the glorious beacon to which all the
hopes of humanity in the old world are anx
iously looking let it never be said that the
brilliant stars grew dim and one by one drop
ped from their spherethat those stripes were
tarnished by internal strifethat this great
union is shivered and scattered abroad let
us say to the south we will do you justice
our judiciary shall do you justice let us
say and do this and the union shall not be
dissolvedthe south shall be bound up with
the north in the hopes of those who are to
come after uswho are to live in peace and
prosperity under our union let us pledge
our lives our fortunes and our sacred hot
or that not a star shall be obliterated not a
stripe erased from the glorious flag that now
floats over our union
this speeeh speaks for itself and shows
the low vulgar material which rally around
the standard of clay and this slaveholding
union we might fill our columns from
week to week with just such vile blackguard
ism and with just such appeals to the selfish
inhuman and brutal passion of the mob it
is men of the class of this whiting that con
trol the action of church and state at the
north and make the liberty of the colored
man in the country but an empty name

no doubt seize any free man of color and sell

disposed are invited to call and attach to it
their names
to the senate and house of representatives in
congress ussembltd
the undersigned inhabitants ot philadel
phia on behalf of themselves and of a large
and rapidly incieasing portion of the people
of pennsylvania and other northern states
respectfully represent that the union at pre
sent subsisting between the slaveholding and
nonslaveholding portions of this confederacy
is a source of grievances so numerous and
oppressive as to call for immediate measures
on the part of those who have the power
for their redress among these grievances
they would respectfully enumerate the follow
ing as the most pressing in their demand lor
correction
 despite the article of the federal con
stitution which declares that the citizens
of each state shal enjoy all the privileges
and immunities of citizens of the sevral
states a portion of the citizens of the north
solely on account of their complexions on
visiting southern states are seized thrust into
prison fined condemned to work with felons
in the chain gang and frequently sold on the
auction block as slaves
 perfectly legal measures to bring those
eutrages to the notice of the federal courts
are forbidden by severe penal enactments as
in the case of the hon samuel hoar and
hon henry hubbard who were appointed
for this especial purpose by the legislature
of massachusetts but who were driven back
with insult and violence from the states to
which they were sent
 the most sacred of all rights that of
freedom of speech and of the press withoul
which there can be no true liberty under any
form of government has been practically de
nied in a large portion of this country and
to thousands of its most respectable as well
as some of its most distinguished inhabitants
it is a notorious fact that there are but few
places south of mason and dixons line
where the doctrine of the declaration of in
dependence that all men are created equal
and endowed with an inalienable right to life
liberty and the pursuit of happiness can be
publicly avowed and appropriately applied
without imminent personal hazard
iv the union between the slaveholding
and nonslaveholding states and the alleged
necessity of its perpetuation is made the
pretext for l exorbitant and nnjust demands on
the part of the former and the most degrading
concessions and humiliating self abasement on
the part of the latter begetting a spirit on
the one hand of overbearing tyranny and on
the other of slavish and grovelling submis
sionboth alike inconsistent with our theory
of republican equality at vaiiance with the
best interests of a majority of the people and
injurious to the cause ot freedom and free
institutions throughout the world
v the comproses of the federal con
stitution are felt to be especially burdensome
because by them the people of the north are
obliged ist to fcid slaveholder di
rectly or indirectly in recapturing his fugitive
slaves d to assist if in the judgment ot
the executive it should ever become necessa
ry to repress by force any uprising on the
part of the slaves for their liberty and d
to concede to the slaveholder extraordinary
political power in the privilege of repre
senting threefifths of his slaves in the elec
toral college and in congressthus famish
ing him at the same moment the motive and
ability to perpetuate his system by these
compromises the people of the north are in
volved as partners in the support of slavery
and made to share with the suoth in all the
evils and responsibilities of its continuance
to these facts as constituting grievances
no longer tolerable the undersigned invite
the attention of your honorable body and res
pectfully ask that if in your judgment there
be no other speedy means for their redress
you will take immediate measures for the
peaceful dissolution of the union

extraordinary developments are expected
there is a great excitement here

north to a compromise corr n v ex
press
the crisis apparently approaching
washington feb th
a coupdemain was attempted in the sen
ate today by senator foote or ratliei it was
led off by him the senate seemed more
deeply excited than i had imagined could be
possible during the enactment of this scene
foote proposed that a committee of twelve
should be elected by ballot equally from free
and slave states who should choose the thir
teenth and to them should bejsubmitted all of
the matters in defence between the north and
south and upon which they should report
he remarked to the apparent astonishment
of the senate that unless there was some
movement towards an adjustment of this kind
events would occur within a week or ten days
which must render any compromise impossible
this was said with startling solemnity but
ler of s c opposed such a movement now
as calculated to place them in an awkward
position if the proposition agieed upon in com
mittee should fail in the senate he took
occasion to say in the course of remark that
if we were to part he hoped to do so without
leaving behind him any personal ill feeling
with any senator from the north
this heightened the excitment walker of
wisconsin deprecated the movement davis
badger and berrien in favor dayton of new
jersey in a cool sensible onslaught upon the
movement made sad havoc with the deep and
solemn impression of impending danger which
had been created so it was postponed until
tomorrow
it is almost impossible to judge of this
movement in the excitement of the moment
w ithdrawalfrom congress ishowever i doubt
not contemplated as a majority constitutes a
quorum however it will be seen that enough
will remain to do business the ulimate
result must be that those who withdraw will
lose their seats and their pay and the people
of the south will send others to their places
i have within a day or two past chanced to
see some unmistakable evidences of southern
attachment to the union the compromise
too some southern states cousidered ultra
this desperate move of footes is regarded
as in consequence of the reaction juvenal

ture was upon the whole interesting and elo
quentthe usual debate was postponed to en
able him to occupy the whole evening which
he did and many would have been pleased to
have heard him again dr peck who pur
poses visiting the west indies has lectured
twice before the p l con mesmerism to
the great satisfaction of his numerous hearers
oneof them an english gentleman apparently
after the doctor had experimented upon him
made a speech in which he expressed the
great pleasure it gava him to find so many
persons so well employed and complimented
them upon the effectual manner in which
they were refuting the slanderous accusations
of their enemies it is rarely that any of our
city friends i e les blancs honor us with
their presence or encourage us in our efforts
for improvement they believe they perform
their duty in contributing towards the aboli
tion of slavery and the slave trade and in
encouraging the sale of free labor produce
they care but little for the moral and in
tellectual elevation of the free people of color
and believe them sufficiently happy if they
have become good cooks and scullions hew
ers of wood and drawers of water unlike
the quaint powerful but mean hero wor
shipper they would rather we were not un
der the rule of beneficent whips at the
same time they believe that if we whip in
hand drive their horsestve are fulfilling our
destiny and that there is no necessity for us
to progress and to develope our faculties to
aspire to the learned professions the fine arts
or mercantile persuits last week mr
robert purvis lectured upon human
rights before the p l c his discourse
was brief but to the point full of poetic fire
and delivered with fiis characteristic energy
and enthusiam he was quite severe upon
secret institutions existing among the color
ed population and set forth in glowing colors
the great good that might be accomplished
if instead of applying such large sums of
money to gewgaws processions lc they
were expended for the attainment of equal
rights proving his position by incontroverti
ble facts one of which was that while the
whites smiled approvingly upon extravagant
displays of costly regalia c and encour
aged processions which diverted the oppres
sed from the object which should command
all their talents they mobhed them when
in procession they displayed banners signifi
cant of liberty and equal right
at the close of the lecturea warm dis
cussion took place with regard to secret in
stitutions a white gentleman mr w de
fended oddfellowship c very ingenious
ly but i thought erred in net taking a vie w
of it from tfie proper point he should place
himself amid the same circumstances which
surround the colored man when debating
this question mr purviss great argument
in opposition appealed to he that those
institutions absorbed too much of the means
and talents which would be rqore usefully em
ployed in rescuing as from the anomalous
position we occupy and obtaining for us the
rights of freemen mr w s difference of
opinion served to elicit all mi purviss elo
quence which afforded the assembly a fine in
tellectual repast in the course of the debate
mrpurvis administered a cutting rebuke to the
venerable arch compromiser who ignorant
of that magnanimity of soul which should
be one of the principal characteristics of a
great mind has so frequently slandered a weak
and persecuted portion ot the american peo
ple would the hon gentleman could have
heard it it would have enabled him for the
future to view us in a different light and
caused perhaps a fresh spring of thought to
meander thiough his gigantic intellect before
the phcenixonian dr bryan lectured upon
the anatomy of the age he is one of the
ablest lecturers whom i have ever had the
pleasure of listening to he complimented
the audience upon their attention and con
gratulated them upon the instruction they
were receiving from different persons of emi
nence dr patterson also lectured before
this institution upon the circulation of the
blood illustrated by many beautiful engrav
ings and preparations a paper read betore
this institution by mr townsend on t
habits and instincts of birds abounded with
agreeable information the lectures before
these two institutions are always well at
tended the phoenixonians charge i  cts
for a single lecture and  cts for the course
the phil lib co give their lectures free
gratis and take up a collection there has
been a barbers ball since my last writing
which i have been told w r a fully and fashion
ably attended a fancy ball is in prepara
tion and the gay spirits are all on the qui
vive a number of concerts have also
taken place lately one was given by the
odd fellows in franklin hall great pre
parations were made for this entertainment
many who had purchased tickets were un
able to gain admittance on account of the
large attendance it is thought there were
between eight and nine hundred persons in
the hall the performance went off in a
pleasing manner splendid wreaths were
presented to miss g and to mrs b whose
vocal abilities afforded the large audience so
much pleasure the concert is to be re
peated r d
we have not been able to publish the let
ters to which friend mabbitt refers we
think however that the present one contains
the gist of his former ones
women  rights
in my last article on this subject i insist
ed that there was no good reason why wo
men might not take at least an equal part
with our sex in the professions of la w medi
cine and the christian ministry
in previous articles i have endeavoured to
show the inadequacy and futility of existing
laws and customs to render equal justice to
widows and unmarried women i wish to
say something more on this point
a few years since the people of this state
were called upon to vote in reference to the
license systemwhelher we should or should
not have licensed dram houseswhether men
could have the sanction and authority of their
respective towns to deal out the imoxicating
fluid to their fellow men  sin meii
ced this series of articles our legislature
have passed an act prohibiting the sale of
intoxicating drinks as a beverage but which
will not become a law unless by the
legal voters of their state at our general elec
tion next fall now is there a reasonable
doubt if all our tax paying citizens without
reference to color or sex could have the use
of the elective franchise that the shameless
monster intemperance could have a legal ex
istence i think not too many of our
female citizens have felt the effects not t
avail themselves of the opportunity for the
removal of the cause
take the case of war suppose some
nation should insult our countiys flag and
there should be a public expression through
the ballot box calledj forwomen being al
lowed to vote is there a doubt as to the
result of such an expression the reasoning
of our mother wives sisters daughters
would be something like this pretty idea
truly to think of going to war and hazard
the loss of life property and public virtue
just to punish an entire nation because a few
inconsiderate men had insulted our flag
and how have they insulted our flag
why they have reminded us of the great
propriety of such a flagthat it represents by
its stars an exalted profession of liberty
and by its atiipesthe lash upon the backs of
slavesgreat reason this for going to war
no our men shall not by our consent go to
war with their neighbors because they have
had sufficient courage to tell them the truth
acting in accordance with sentiments of this
kind qur women wmuld save our country
from the ruinous consequences of war and
without reproach to us as a people since it is
no repioach to avoid the calamities of yar
again take the subject pf slavery could our
citizens of the other sexof adult age be al
lowed an expression upon this subject through
the ballot box there would no chance for a
slaveholder as such to occupy any other posi
tion than one of the lowest infamy a nuis
ance to anything like republicanism there
are yet some men to be found in our land
who hesitate not to sell their own children
shame on the creatures they are not men
and such creatures are allowed to vote and to
be voted for but thank god no american
woman has yet been guilty of that dark deed
indeed it doe  not now occur to my mind
that the page of history is stained with a re
cord of any such crime i am aware that
the records of antiquityjafford precedents of
parents selling their children but i have yet
to learn that a woman has beep found or
heprd from thqt voluntarily without fear or
compulsion ever sold her own child i think
my opinion is well founded when  say give
the women of our country the use of the
elective franchise and slavery would no
longer be tolerated

we will give another instance of his
idiocy previous to the publication of
the deserted village the book
seller gave him a note for the price
agreed uponone hundred guineas
as he was on his way home he met an
acquaintance to whom he related the
circumstance the gentleman thought
this a very large sum for so small a
poem in truth said goldsmith
i think so too it is much more than
the honest man can afford or the piece
is worth i have not been easy since
i received it the idiot actually re
turned the note to the bookseller and
left him to graduate the payment ac
cording to the success of the work
such idiocy is not very common in the
world and men were astounded at such
displays of it as there is not much
danger of o great an increase in the
number of such idiots as to render them
a public burden we should be glad to
have a few more of them goldsmith
was called an inspired idiotwe
wish his acquaintances had the grace
to consider such idiocy the gift of in
spiration
we now come to the other charge
against goldsmith the charge of vani
ty this charge was made particular
ly by that vainest of the vain james
boswell whose jaundiced eye saw
everything in a yellow light he
seems to have been an ardent believer
in the doctrine to which carlyle refers
that neediness and greediness and
vainglory are the chief qualities of
mankind and that whatever cannot be
referred to the categories of need and
greed is without scruple ranged under
that of vainylory goldsmith had need
enough it is true but as he was totally
destitute of greed boswell thought an
extraordinary number of his actions
was to be attributed to vainglory the
peacock who was so vain in regard to
dress that after having been at court
he went to the printing office with his
trappings and summoned all the prin
ters devils to admire him accuses
goldsmith of displaying vanity in dress
mr irving with kindhearted good
sense attributes his apparent vanity to
another feeling this proneness to
finery in dress savs he which
boswell and others of goldsmiths con
temporaries who did not understand
the secret plies of his character attri
buted to vanity arose we are convin
ced from a widely different motive it
was from a painful idea of his own
personal defects which had been cruel
jly stamped upon his mind in his boy
hood by the sneers and jeers of his
playmates and had been ground deep
er into it by rude speeches made to him
in every step of his struggling career
until it had become a constant cause of
awkwardness and
he had experienced more sensibly since
his reputation had elevated him into
polite society and he was constantly
endeavoring by the aid of dress to ac
quire that personal acceptability if we
may use the phrase which nature had
denied him if ever he betrayed a
little selfcomplacency on first turning
out in a new suit it may perhaps have
been because he felt he had achieved a
triumph over his ugliness he goes
on to speak of circumstances existing
xt the time of which he is treating
which may have rendered goldsmith
more than usually attentive to his per
sonal appearance he had become
acquainted with the beautiful intelli
gent sprightly and agreeable miss
hornecks and was inspired with tender
feelings towards the younger who went
by the name of the jessamy bridt
alas poor goldsmith exclaims mr
laying how rauchofthis silken finery
was dictated not by vanity but by
humble consciousness of thy defects
how much of it was to atone for the un
couthness of thy person and to win
favor in theeyes of the jessamy
bride a slight personal defect
caused byron to hate his fellowmen
in goldsmith the cofisciousnese of per
sonal defect led to a vpfell meant effort
to remove its effects yel byron is ad
mired and goldsmith is laughed at
but boswell represents goldsmith as
strutting about and bragging of his
dress it is easy to see that on the
occasion to which boswell alludes
goldsmith was indulging his humor ol
which he possessed a sreat share
such a fool as boswell was incapable
of understanding goldsmith
we will give two other instances of
what the incorrigible dunce considers
displays of vanity he went with the
miss hornecks jto france while
stopping at a hotel in lisle they were
drawn to the windows by a military
parade in front the extreme beauty
of the miss horrecks immediately at
tracted the attention of the officers
who broke forth with enthusiastic
speeches and compliments intended for
their ears goldsmith was amused for
a while but at length affected impati
ence at this exclusive admiration of his
beautiful companions and exclaimed
with mock severity elsewhere i also
would have my admirers it required
a boswell to construe this into an evi
dence of mortified vanity on another
occasion he went with burke to wit
ness the performances of some puppets
when burke praised the dexterity
wiih which one of them tossed a pike
pshaw said goldsmith with some
warmth according to boswell i can
do it better myself the same even
ing adds this prince of fools he
broke his shin by attempting to exhibit
to the company how much better he
could jump over a stick than ihe pup
pets well did johnson describe bos
well as a fellow who had missed his
only chance of immortality by not hav
ing been alive when the dunciad was
written it is true he gained immortaii
ty in a way not expected by johnson
but his work is like freason we are
pleased with the thing itself but des
pise the author he was so anxious
to be down an ass that in
the absence of the sexton ije wrote it
down himself
croker in his notes to boswell re
lates an occurrence which has been
considered a ludicrous display of gold
smiths vanity it was related to
croker by col omoore of cloghan
castle in ireland who was a party
concerned the colonel and burke
walking one day through leicester
square on their way to sir joshua
reynoldss wtih whom they were to
dine observed goldsmith who was
likewise to be a guest standing and
regarding a crowd which was staring
and shouting at some foreign ladies in
the window of a hotel observe
goldsmith said bupke to omoore
and mark what passes between us at
sir joshuas they passed on and ar
rived there before him burke receiv
ed qoldsnith with affected reserve ard
coldness being pressed ip explain
the reason said he i am
ashamed to keep company with a per
son who could act as you have just done
in the square goldsmith protested
he was ignorant of what was meant
why said burke did you not ex
claim as you were looking up at those
women what a stupid beast the crowd
must be for staring with such admira
tion at those painted jezebels while a
man of your talents passed py un
noticed surely surely my dear
friend cried goldsmith with alarm
surely i did not say so nay
rrpjied kurke if you had not said so
how should i have known it thats
true answered goldsmith i am
very sorryit was very foolish ido
recollect that something of the kind
passed through my mind but i did not
think that i had uttered it
now this proves nothing in the world
but goldsmiths childlike simplicity of
character he was unsuspicious of a
trick and could be made to believe al
most anything we do believe the
thoughts no more passed the mind than
the words passed from his lips but his
mind having no suspicion of decep
tion was seeking a cause for the effect
before him and could find no other
explanation than that he must have
spoken the words and thought the
thoughts when a man in a very
earnest manner insists that you cer
tainly do know some particular indivi
dual you will begin to think you do
know him though you have never seen
him in your life if water is thrown in
the face of a sleeping man his mind
goes to work to invent a cause he
dreams that he sees clouds gathering
slowly in the west they become
gradually thicker and darker at last
they approach the whole heaven is
oyerspread and the rain pours down
in torrents upon his head all this is
dreamed in the very moment of wak
ing the sleeper dreams of a storm
to account for the water on his face
we believe that goldsmiths thoughts
were as imaginary as the sprinkled
sleepers clouds burke threw water
in his face and the rpind invented an
explanation
the little peculiarities of goldsmith
never impaired the affection of his
friends the same burke that had
amused himself with tricks upon his
simplicity burst into tears when he
heard of his death sir joshua rey
nolds threw by his pencil and grieved
more than he had done in times ot great
family distres johnson felt the blow
deeply land gloomily the object of
such affection must have had a noble
soul we feel that we could have
clasped such a man to our bosom and
loved him with all his debts a gold
smith is not given to us every day
let us love his virtues and forget his
failings
from blackwoods magazine
romance of russian history
the characters of few sovereigns
admit of being judged more variously
than that of peter i of russia sur
named the great according to the
point of view whence we contemplate
him we behold the hero or the savage
the wise legislator or the lawless ty
rant the patient pursuer of sicence or
the dissolute and heartless debauchee
a short time before his death ac
cording to mr blanc although other
writers fix the date some years earlier
peter was violently smitten by the
charms of a young girl named ivan
owd although tenderly attached and
about to be married to an officer of the
regiment of schonvaioff she dared
not oppose the czars wisher but be
came his mistress peter who took
her repugnance for timidity fancied
himself beioved and passed much of
his time in her society in a charming
cottage in which he had installed her
at one of the extremities of st peters
burgh her had enriched her family
who were ignorant however of her re
treat he betrothed whose name was
demetrius danilotf was iivdespair at
her disappearance and made uncea
sing efforts to discover her but all in
vain until ivanowa having made a
confidant of a livonian slave had him
conducted to her presence the lovers
meetings were then trequent so much
so that peter received intelligence of
them his anger was terrible he
roared like a tiger
betrayed betrayed everywhere
and always cried he striding wildly
about the room and striking his brow
with his clenched fist oh revenge
revenge
before the close of the day he left
the palace alone wrapped in a coarse
cloak his feet in mailed shoes whose
patches attested their long service his
head covered with a foxskin cap which
came down over his eyebrows and hall
concealed his eyes he soon reached
ivanowas house where the lovers
deemed themselves perfently secure
for the czar had spread a report of
his departure for moscow moreover
the faithful livonian slave kept watch
in the antechamber to give an alarm
at the least noise peter knew all this
and had taken his measures according
ly ooening an outer door with a key
of his own he bounced into the ante
room upon the slave and with a kick
of his powerful foot burst the door that
separated him from the lovers all
this occurred with the speed of light
ning daniloff and ivanowa had scarce
time to rise from their seats before the
czar stood over them with a drawn
sword ip his hand ivanowa uttered a
cry of terror fell on her knees and
fainted prompt as the czar daniloff
bared his sabre and threvy himself bs
tweea his mistress and peter the
latter lowered his weapon
no he said the revenge were
too brief
he opened a wjnficny and erjea
hourral at this signal a hundred sol
diers crowded into the house master
ing his fury the czar ordered the
young officer to be taken to prison
there to receive one hundred blows of
the hattoques or sticks ivanowa was
also confined until the senate should
decide on her fate the next day
daniloff received his terrible punish
ment before half of it had been in
flicted his back from the loins to the
shoulders was one hideous wound
c c we omit the reyolting de
tails nevertheless the executioners
strike and the hundred
blows were counted without a com
plaint from the sufferer the unfortu
nate daniloff had not even fainted he
got up ajope f when untied and asked
to have hwwounds carefuily dressed
i have need to live a short time
longer he added
meanwhile ivanowa was brought
before the senate and accused of high
treason and of trying to discover state
secrets a charge of peters invention
the supple senate created by the
czar condemned her to receive twen
tytwo blows of the knot in the pres
ence of her accomplice daniloff al
ready punished by the emperors order
on the day appointed for the execu
tion peter stood upon the balcony of
his winter palace several batalions
of infantry marched past escorting
the unfortunate demetrius who in
spite of the frightful sufferings he still
endured walked with a steady step
and with a firm and even joyful counte
nance surrounded by other escorts
was seen the young and lovely ivan
owa half dead with terror supported j
on one side by a priest and on the
other by a soldier and letting her
beautiful head fall from one shoulder
to the other according to the impulse
given it by her painful progress even
peters heart melted at the sight re
entering his appartment he put on the
ribbon of the order of st andred
threw a cloak over his shoulders left
the palace sprang into a boat and
reached the opposite side of the river
at the same moment as the mournful j
procession which had crossed the j
bridge making his way through tho 
crowd he dropped his cloak took iva
nowa in his arms and imprinted a kiss
upon her brow a murmur arose
amongst the people and suddenly cries
of pardon were heard
the knights of st andred then en
joyed the singular privilege that a kiss
given by them to a condemned person
deprived the executioner ot his victim
this privilege has endured even to
our day but not withoy some modifi
cation
daniloff had recognised peter he
approached the czar whose every
movement he had anxiously watched
stripped off his coat and rent the
bloody shirt that covered his shoulders
the man who could thus suffer
he said knows how to die czar
thy repentance comes top late iva
nowal go to wait for thee and draw
ing a concealed pionard he stabbed
himself twice his death was instan
taneous peter hurried back to his
palace and the stupified crowd slowly
dispersed ivanowa died shortly after
wards im the convent to which she
had been permitted to retire
b kind to everybody there is
nothing like kindnessit sweetens ev
erything a single look of love a
grasp of the hand has gained more
friends than both wealth and learning
charity suffereth long and is kind
history shows us that all great principles
however ardently espoused for a time have a
tendeney to fade into tradition to degenerate
into a hollow cant to become words of little
impoit and to remain for declamation when
their vital power is gone at such a period
every good citizen is called to do what in him
lies to restore their life and power
