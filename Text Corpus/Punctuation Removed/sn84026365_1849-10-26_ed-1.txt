speech of the honorable edward l keyes at the close of the worcester convention 
mr president i think it is not
an evidence of taste or judgment on the
part of this audience to call upon me
at this late hour when it would require
the eloquence of a sumner or at least a
cicero to speak here with success
loud and prolonged cheering
by the few feeble attempts which i
have made on other occasions i have
learned that the flowers of oratory nev
er bloomed for me and that i am wi
ling to appear upon this platform at all
must he accepted as a proof that i am
disposed to sacrifice all even the grace
of modesty itself on the still nobler al
tars of right and liberty
i rejoice that so much attention was
bestowed upon the remarks af the gen
tleman who preceded me but i tear
we have not yet paid sufficient atten
tion to the taylor party
we are assembled mr president
in the heart ot the commonwealth
we are under the guardianship ot hei
lawswe are assailed by no mobs
composed of gentlemen of property
and standingwe feel no danger as
we walk the crowded streets but we
cannot disguise from ourselves the fact
that a large number of persons belong
ing to the two old parties regard us
as intruders in the political field as
poachers upon the lordly domains of
our bettersas stragglers and vaga
bonds stalking up the broad aisles and
disturbing the worship of the whig and
democratic churches our first duty
is to teach them as our lathers taught
the royalists and loyalists of the rev
olution that we ask no favors and will
suffer no dictationthat we know our
rights and dare maintain them that
not unmindful of the power of combi
ned wealth we still have learned that
thrice is he armed who hath his quar
rel just and what they will regard
perhaps of still greater importance
that like the youthful hannibal we have
sworn it on our countrys altar that we
will not lay down our arms until
the victory is achieved the despots
ofthe old world may succeed in stifling
the aspirations for freedom which are
welling in the bosoms of their subjects
but intelligent freeborn men repub
lican citizens of a free commonwealth
graduates of the free schools of new
england sons of revolutionary sires
ice regard the threatened indignant
frowns of our new slaveholding chief
magistrate with indignation largely
m ogled with contempt
i am reminded by the presence of a
gentlei nan before me that seventyfour
tears ag a ou ng and ardent friend
of america q independence whose name
had been pla ed on the roll ofthe pro
scribed by the oyalst officers of bos
ton came to this place and resumed
the publication of a new spaper which
had already been for several years
the organ of american liberty in bos
ton the name of that paper was the
massachusetts spy cheers
and considering the changing and un
stable nature of all earthly things it
is a significant and cheering circum
stance that after the lapse of three
quarters of a century with another
of its editors proscribed not only by i
the royalist officers but by the royal
family itself of worcester it is still
ibt faithful and fearless advocate of the
doctriuen of the declaration of inde
w nt
we assembled here a year
a b supposed that the great crisis
uc wt l  dotsnniue ths question of
very or freedom in the tsrritoriee j
m ftirtvtd w were not mistaken i
the north star
the crisis hsd arrived and as far ai
j human penetration can detect the op
eration of moral nod immaterial forces
it was owing in some good part to tba
convention that the vast territoriei
of new mexico and califotnia wen
preserved to freedom a short time lon
geranother year and that we havt
a feeble hope they will be so preserve
for all time to come
our proceedings had hardly been re
corded before that genuine free soil
taylor whig john m clayton intro
duced his motionon the th of july
for the appointment of that more that
janus faced committee composed o
two northern and two southern demo
cratsand two northern and two southern
whigs charged with the duty of de
vising some plan for the settlement o
the question and here it would b
proper if had time to trace the pro
i gress of the slaveholding movemen
i through that and the succeeding sea
sion of congress that it might be seei
how narrowly we escaped and hov
clayton johnson and preston mem
bers of gen taylors cabinetuni
formly battled on the side of slavery
against the principle and measure o
the wilmot proviso but  canno
now pursue the enquiry go on
go on no the emotions whicl
already agitate you inform me tha
you need no labored arguments t
arouse you to a full comprehension o
i the importance of our movement
i your thoughts mounting upward ii
contemplation of the great and univer
sal principles which we seek to cstab
iish disdain even the fetters of elocu
tion and would rather circumnavigati
at random the wide empire of civiliza
tion and of mankind
mr president we are told that th
whig party is the only safeguan
against the extension of slavery an
the encroachments of the slavepower
the brazen impudence of this state
meat has not been equalled since sa
tan uttered his blasphemous counsel
to the fallen host the great gul
 which leads to destruction lies conceal
ed under the hypocritical banners o
whiggery the plans of nationa
locofocoismofthe cass democracy
are as bold as they are infamous
they will entrap none but the willing
and the determined while the tayloi
party with its slaveholding president
and slaveholding cabinet fights for
slavery like the pirate under the dove
like banners of innocence and peace
i tell you mr president that the
taylor party the administration at
washingtondoes not even promise
any assistance against the extension
of slavery much less against the en
croachments of the slavepower the
washington republicthe taylor or
gan at the seat ofgovernment founded
and to a great extent supported by the
patronage of the general government
says that the whigs everywhere north
es well as south are in favor of with
drawing the slavery question from the
arena of party politics this is true
but suppose it was not so suppose
the taylor party should put on a north
ern whited sepulchre face what
then it would not deceive us it
has fed us on falsehoods from the com
mencment the whole series of its
violated promises now hang like mill
stones about its neck general tay
lor we are told would not seek to in
fluence the action of congress yet he
had been scarcely a week among the
slavepens of the capital before his or
gan was called upon to excuse and jus
tify his interference the decisions of
congress he would obey in good faith
yet his minions are at this moment en
gaged in establishing a government in
california directly in the face of a
vote of congress refusing him authori
ty to do so he would not proscribe
yet the bodies of fallen office holders
proscribed for their political opinions
are piled in hecatombs all around us
in regard to the last we do not so much
complain of the act as ofthe violation
of faith which led to it general tay
lor must proscribe the taylor vic
tory without proscription would be no
victory the praetorian bands the
swiss mercenaries the hessian flies
who dragged him from his camp stool in
mexico and floated him on one unbro
ken tiamof falsehood to washington
must be paid the laborer is worthy
of his hire the taylor administra
tion is upheld by the grand central pil
lar of proscription remove that and
it would sinksink hoplessly where no
fathom line could reach it but as
lord chatham once said in reference
to another administration laboring un
der embarrassments it is a misera
ble condition wherein disgrace is pru
dence and wherein it is necessary to
be contemptible it is but prudence
in the taylor party to court the dis
grace of falsifying all its promises and
whenever it ceases to be contemptible
its entire distinctive character will be
gone
mr president we were accused on
every stump during the last campaign
not only of being factionists but office
seekers desiring nothing but our own
honor and profit where now are
those incorruptible patriots whose lips
moved by the inspiration of their own
mercenary hearts gave utterance to
these flaming falsehoods where are
the b hammett nortons the lawren
ces the charles w denisons the
hudson the lunts the woodmans
and also the slaveholdiog chandlers
where is that brace of beauties who

full view of the portrait of some of the
fathers ot the republic endeavored
in vain to lisp his uxorious love for our
venerable commonwealth where
are the hopeful heirs of those two great
worcester houses who became surety
for taylorism in the heart of massachu
sets where are those twin cherubs
who tired of obscurity and panting
for an opportunity to serve the repub
lic laid all they could of the state ol
maine a willing sacrifice at the feet ot

those cravenhearted men who origi
nally affecting a disgust for taylorism
turned back to pliinge into its filthiest
pools where are they fattening
at the government crib haltered at
the government stalls where i trust
they may have time and opportunity to
con over some ofthe contemptuous dia
tribes which in other days they put
forth against locofoco officeseekers
and learn in part even from them
selves something of that full measure
of contempt with which honest men re
gard traitors and hypocrites these
are the men who trumpet the glories
the virtues and the patriotism of the
whig party these are the men who
have seized theory of the one idea
party and have applied it to us and
who have to use a strong figure of ed
mund burke flyblown it into all the
weak and rotten parts of the country
in hopes that when the insects shall
have taken wing their importunate buz
zing may sound something like the
public voice
mr president  have already de
tained you too long go on kc i
will only add a word or two in a more
serious strain
other parties promise it belongs to
us to perform the whig party if
promises and good resolutions were
effectualmight long ago have scaled
the empyrean height but its ground
and lofty tumblings of late have thrown
into the shade the harlequins of the
stage the principles which we advo
cate are destined to triumph in this
countrywhether our party shall triumph
or not firm and unyielding minori
ties are always powerfulsometimes
almost omnipotent our strength at
this moment is immense the coun
tenance of many a politician blanches
at our tread the temples of whig
and democratic hunkerism shake to
their foundations at the echo of our
voices
in eleven ofthe free states we hold
the balance between the two factions
and can elevate one or the other to vic
tory or consign them to defeat two
senators and eighteen members of con

have ceased to play their fantastic
tricks before the nation only because
tee have so ordered it
gentlemen the path of our duty lies
plain before u it is to summon to

of slavery away from the home of re

circular
of the provisional committee for the
promotion of education among the
colored people in such of the slave
states as are or may be accessible
the organization of this committee
is the work of necessity it grew out
ofthe consideration that the labors and
prayers of the friends of the slave had
been blessed in the deliverance of many
thousands from the fetters of legal bon
dage but their condition when thus
emancipated suggests the important
inquiry that how glorious soever may
be our success in the future whether
the consummation we so arlently desire
would not be reft of half its interest and
importance if we were denied the rea
sonable anticipation that a blow so well
aimed and effective would be followed
by a ready zeal fidelity and insight in
ample preparations to impart the rudi
ments of sound knowledge with health
ful moral discipline to the youthful
masses just escaped from legal bondage
what is true of our slaves and colot ed
people is true of every people long
outcast and degraded such can se
cure the recognition of their rights only
through an intellectual and moral re
generation they roust burst the fet
ters of ignorance and vanquish the do
minion of low sensual passions or live
and die in a condition in no way more
exalted or worthy of a divine manhood
than that of the veriest slaves
the time has fully come in our judg
ment when a well advised and effected
plan may be vigorously prosecuted for
the enlightenment and elevation of our
colored people who are at least nomi
nally free though in the slave states
in some of those states they are not
seriously interrupted in the pvnnit of
knowledge they way be reached in
either of two wya to wit by establish
ing schools directly among them or by
electing young persons of good mor
tis and endowedfriih adit mroag
powers of mind who when sufficiently
rochester n y friday october  
best social influences to be found at the
north may return to labor in tbe de
partment of instruction among their
friends and the people of their peculiar
class at the south this latter is the
idea which strikes us forcibly and
which for the present we shall seek to
make available by our efforts through
tbe events of providence we have it in
our power just now in an easy quiet
way to make an experunent in the di
rection alluded to and under lh most
agreeable and gratifying circumstances
tbe edmondson sisters mary and em
ily you know by reputation their
brief history is singular and affecting
it is enough to say that they were for
seven months in the hands of slavetra
ders in washington baltimore alex
andria and new orleans that their
virtuous and christian character afford
ed them a shield of completedefence
that by a rare impulse of social sym
pathy twentytwo hundred and fifty
dollars were raised for their redemption
they are of a good family are now in
this neighborhood uuder the most fa
vorable circumstances to be thoroughly
taught possessing highly respectable
capacities with most exemplary indus
try and a rare deportment for proprie
ty they are anxious to acquire infor
mation that will in every way render
them competent and effective as teach
ers and examples among their people
in the district of columbia this com
mittee propose to take charge of them
to advise them and to raise whatev
er means may be required in the course
of their education others of equal
promise will no doubt soon offer them
selves indeed we are well informed
that any number of persons adapted to
the object we have in view can at any
time be selected at washington or bal
timore
allow us to say that it is not our
purpose to make pets of our beneficia
riesto spoil them by indulgence or
by superficial shallow views of the re
lations and duties of life it shall be
our aim to foster and assist their own
exertions and by no means to supersede
them nor is it our design in any
way to build up schools exclusively for
colored children we shall place them
where the chances for sound instruc
tion exact discipline and real elevation
of character are the most completely
satisfactory
our limits forbid addition to this has
ty outline of our plans we wish to
regard you as a corresponding member
of our body and to look to you con
stantly for counsel and support as a
cordial and active laborer in a common
field of enterprise and responsibility
is it not a delightful thought that by a
united effort the women of new york
can in a brief period place in the dis
trict of columbia or the state of mary
iand a dozen intelligent welltrained
colored females as teachors of schools
and models of manners behavior and
character to exert an influence among
those who are most sadly in need of its
quickening power

slavery ix cuba
with respect to this foul curse mr
turnbull has the following rernancs
as the experience of years had
taught me to believe that the spaniards
are a kind of warm hearted race and
as i had frequently been told that the
slave owners of the havana were tbe
most indulgent masters in the world i
was not a little surprised to find as the
result of personal inquiry and minute
observation that in this last particular
i had been must miserably deceived
and that in no quarter unless perhaps
in the brazils which i have not visited
is the state of slavery so desperately
wretched as it is on the sugar planta
tions of the queen of the indies the
farfamed island of cuba the same
error is commou among persons who
have never visted the island and even
with those who have but have not vis
ited the interior to those who are
not wilfully blindfold there are not
wanting even at the havana not to
speak ol the sugar or even of the cof
fee plantations a thousand palpable in
dications of the misery which attends
the curse of slavery independent alto
gether of the horrors ofthe slave trade
when a stranger visits the town resi
dences of a cuba proprietor be finds
the family surrounded by s little colony
of slaves of every vanety of complex
ion from ebony to alabaster most of
them have been born in the house have
grown with ihe growth of the family
and are perhaps the foster brothers or
foster sisters of the roaster or his chil
dren when these slaves are unwil
ling or disobedient they are sent in
order to save tune and labor or per
haps to spare the too tender feeling of
their masters or mistresses to a build
ing just outside the gates of ths forti
fied portion of the city in the interior
of which are a aerie of whipping ports
but although by the means of the par
apets tbe authority soeceed in shut
ting oat the inquisitive glances of the
futtn b h wt xelul ft hlie
view the streaming mood and lacerated
flesh of the sufferers they cannot shut
in their piercing screams and piteous
shrieks for mercy
mr turnbull also says it is the
policy of the court of madrid to keep
tbe island of cuba in her dependence
and this it is supposed can only be
done effectually by the salutary terror
inspired by the presence of a numerous j
halfsavage negro population the
existence of such a population seems at
mice to justify and require the presence
of a peninsular army which under the
command of a captaingeneral enjoy
ing the confidence of the court and
zealously aided by a numerous train of
public functionaries and empleados pro
jlgces such a pressure oo creole inter
ests as to have hitherto deterred the
native inhabitants mom any open at
tempt to assert their independence
these public functionaries with scarce 
ly any exception are europeans by
birth and therefore decidedly opposed
to a separation which would instantly
deprive them of all their emoluments
the philadelphia riots again
from the philadelphia inquirer
the second riot
quiet continued until about  oclock
this wednesday rooming when the
ominous  taps of the state house bell
announced another riot this second
outbreak commenced about  oclock
when the hose of the morris hose com
pany which was doing service at the
scene of action was cut this was the
signal for the rioters to commence an
assault brickbats and tones were
hurled by them at the firemen and fire
arms were used with considerable ef
fect several persons being wounded
the mayor sheriff and police were
soon on the ground and succeeded in
restoring order mayor swift himself
who arrived before the military arrest
ed two men
approach of the military the
military which had been down at the
scene of the first riot had returned up
on the restoration of quiet and it was
some time before they could be collect
ed again for the suppression of the re
newed disorders about a m
however they began to assemble in in
dependence square many delays oc
curred and it was nearly nino oclock
when a body of five or six companies
with their ranks but partly filled march
ed to the scene of action the whole
were under command of gen patterson
and col bohlen their approach to
st mary street soon became known to
tbe rioters and by the time they came
upon the ground these had disappeared
into their various haunts the compa
nies were assigned positions at the va
rious avenues leading to the scene of
riot so as to command every approach
completely the military are provided
with ball cartridges and have full au
thority to fire upon any renewal of the
lawless and outrageous proceedings by
the rioters

perate resistance in the struggle with

from tbe philadelphia ledger
the riots deplorable results
the killed and wounded we
resume the details of the riot from the
point at which our account of yesterday
broke off
the rioters ascertaining that the mil
itary forces had retired recommenced
their lawless acts and by davlight the
disturbance was raging furiously
some of the rioters jumped the fence
above the california house and set
fire to the frame building in the rear of
the open space between it and the
dwelling above the colored papula
tion residing in the vicinity commenced
moving when even the females were
pelted with stones by the rioters while
carrying off articles of furniture the
flames spreading tbe meanwhile brot
firemen again to the spot they sallied
down the street and the rioters retreat
ing before them the phcrnix was put in
service in a short time however the
rioters returned and let fljf a volley of
bricks with discharges of fire arms
and the members of the phcecix were
forced to fly from their carriage the
firemen however were reinforced by
citizens and returning again to the fire
the goodwill and phcenix were put
into service and prevented the further
spread of the fire which at this time
had communicated to a row of court
houses running west from sixth street
the roofs of which were all damaged
the robert morris hose company
had laid their hose for tbe purpose of
assisting in extinguishing the fire when
the members were beaten off the car
riage and it was takeu possession of
by the rioters who ran off the hose
which was cut by them and then car
ried off the apparatus into moyamen
sing it was afterwards restored to
the company by john kneass and some
other watchmen of that district the
hose of the diligent fire company was
hacked with koives so as to be useless

the following is the verdict of the
coroners inquest upon the body of

melwright came to his death by a wound
in his breast inflicted by a musket ball
which perforated the heart at the jnne

known to the jury on the night of the

in the discharge of his duties as a fire
man during the riot at sixth and st
mary streets
the coroner also held an inquest up
on the body of john griffith the color

died at the hospital from a wound in
the head inflicted by a musket ball
the following is the verdict of the jury
that john griffith came to his death
from a wound in his head by a ball from
a musket fired in the hands of some
person unknown to the jury on the
night of the th of oct during the riots
at the corner of sixth and st mary
streets
cornelius speed one of the election
judges in sixth ward southwark was
struck on the forehead with a spent
ball the injury was not serious
the colored church in lombard st
below th and the old church edifice at
fifth and gaskill streets have been
converted into barracks for the use of
the military
with the exception of several dis
charges of firearms in moyamensing
apparently intended for signals by the
rioters no disturbance occurred last
evening in visiting the scene of the
late disturbance we found the streets
in the vicinity completely deserted the
rain having had the effect of driving the
rioters as well as the spectators to their
homes
mcshane died at the hospital last
evening about dark this makes the
third fatal case he had arrived in
this country but a few weeks since and
was making preparations to return in
tending to start the last of this week
arrest for rioting during tues
day night and yesterday thirty men
and boys black and white were arrest
ed and committed to the city lock up
on the charge of having been engaged
in the riots five of them were subse
quently discharged those in custody
will have a hearing today or tomorrow
the outbreak was one of those sud
sudden explosions of brutal passions
which could not have been foreseen
and owing to the employment of the po
lice force on duties incident to the elec
tion could not be guarded against
still the public authorities ofthe coun
try are justly censurable for allowing a
lawless gang of ruffians to gain by im
punity for former frequent outrages the
audacity that showed itself in the resis
tance they made to the laws on tuesday
night the rioters have been guilty of
the highest crimes known to the laws
arson and murderand we suggest
whether it is not the duty of the gover
nor to immediately offer a reward for
the arrest and conviction of every indi
vidual known to have had a hand in the
outrage

it is difficult here at the north to be
lieve that the writer of the following is
a christian minister or that he is
not jesting in what he says of the ho
ly wise and beneficent institution of
slavery it is difficult to conceive how
any men upon whom ha ever beamed
toe light of modern civilization can
thus talk in earnest of an institution
which tramples on the most sacred af
fections of the human heart and anni
hilates those domestic relations to which
christianity and civilization owe all
their efficiency to redeem the world
it is however with slavery as with oth
er sins those who make a gain of
the bones sinews and souls of their
fellow men are the most hopeless vic
tims of their own crimes against god
and their race we take the following
extracts from a long address in the au
gusta igs republic to tbe editors of
the christian review the writer pro
fesses to be a clergyman whose soul is
grieved at the abolition fanaticism
of northern christians in denouncing
the godordained institution
and what is yet mors alarming
says this writer this foul spirit has
not only fallen upso and warpod the
judgment of your most distinguished
politicians who in prospect of human
greatness hare sought honor on of
another said not tbs honor which com
sth from god only who through their
miliin miaf
john dick praushia
whole no 
ged mountain of fame have found au
time to examine minutely the lively or
teles and make themselves acquainted
with the god of the bible but this ao
olilion fanaiicim has also thrown its
pestilentisl vapors into the departments
of religion and infected and bliodsd
the minds of many who profess to mk
for the truth as it is in jesus evan
many among you who occupy the sa
cred desk instead of feeding thir
flocks with tho sincere milk of tits
word desecrate thr sabbath and its
services in hurling towards southern
slaveholders the poisoned shafts of ab
olition agitation which hew ever fall not
upon themselves and their ocagrega
tions proving in truth to be a savour
of death unto death for the conss
qseace is as might be expected that
those who undertake against tks
god of the bible roust tail in the con
flict many of the strong alobtion
minisurs of the north forsaken by tk
restraining grace of god hete been per
mitted to fall into giojs siiz and others
into open apostacy or into the adoption
of some one of the prevailing heresies
abounding in the land of edwards and
dwight once distinguished for cherish
ing the orthodox faith of the gospel
we invito any whe arc not bimd
icd to madness to look into this holy
wise and merciful uurk if a beneficent
creator and in defending the eburac
terjof the christians god as the au
thor or southern slavery we onl
ask tiiat its history may be traced go
back then into the wilds of africa
and see two of her savage tribes en
gaged in the din of deadly battle the
one and perhaps not the aggressor
proves victorious iu the conflict and
now the brooding spirit of the god of
mercy says to the conquering party do
not butcherjyour captives though they
may have unjustly assailed you and if
conquering might have put you to
death and paved their yards with your
skulls as many savage tribes of your
country ofteu do with their captured en
emies but do you act upon the princi
ple of mercy and benevolence make
them your servants turn tln m into your
money and then they will be grateful
to you and you will love and protect
them the divine influence prevailed

a lnend relator to u the following
fact which would give its subject a wide
fame but for nu crime of a colored skin
a boy about fifteen years ot ige who
was formerly a slave in virginia has
resided for about three year with his
youug master in baltimore but
for some trifling offence the slavehold
er resolved to send him again to vir
ginia the boy knowing that it would
lessen his chances for freedom refused
to go he was seized and forcibly
thrust on board the steamboat for nor
folk to be sent to ietersburgb and so
closely watched till the boat had leftthat
he could not escape but despair could
not quench his love of liberty watch
ing his opportunity when the boat was
well under weigh and some two or three
miles from shore he leaped overboard
resolved to swim while he could and
then resign himself to hi fate w elcom
ing death rather than slavery fortu
nately for the brave hoy he soon dis
covered a floating plunk and seizing it
he sustained himself upon it to the shore
and started for a land of liberty ev
ery generous heart will rejoice with
hirn that he has gained the rich blessing
he has so nobly earned but be cheek
of every american should tingle with
shame to know that five hfndred
dollars has been offered by tbs

hero and hs return into slavery
thanks to the free hearts of the north
whose humanity is stronger than coo

if be nothing more effectual done to aid tha

jnud calls from all parts of the meeting fo
r the american apologist to ascend the plattorm
a w inch request he at first declined to accedi
to init ultimately at the solicitation of th
chairman the gentleman accepted the invi
taiion and amidst loud cheers took his sea
ie near mr thompson having been calle
i t forward by the chairman to address the meet
ing he rose and slated that his name was
geo jonesthat he would yield to n
man m eiihur hemisphere in his love of liber
tv in is most enlarged sense he was ai
s englishman by birth as his name certified
i but bad lived m boston in americafor eight
ee i years he there ore from that platforn
bad some right lo be considered as addressing
d t urn wilb truth as well as mr thompson
u the negaiive wliich he mr jones had giv
en to mr thompson was on t matter of fact
and if he had misunderstood the honorabu
spaker lie was soirv lor it allpeisons wert
liable lu er in hearing as well as in speaking
e hut he had understood mr thompson dis
s icclly to say that in the eastern states oi
amer ci the prejudice against the colorec
people was as galling that was the phras
as slavery itself aud he made a eompaii
i son between the slavery of the sou then
states and the prejudice of the others
mi thompson that is coned
 j
f mr jones said if so he would deny it from
personal observation mr daniel webslet
e was tns mi jones personal inend and the
last glass of wine lie took the day before he
y ft america in the drawingroom of mr
webster he mr jones said ditmciiy
tit it the coloied pdoplc nevet did pass through
the city of boston meeting with frowns from
the americans and tie called on mr brown
in testimony to whom tie mr jones
would join hands with the meeting but he
called upn hnu to contradict the assertion
 the anniversary of amencan independence
i was on the th day of july and the
anniversary of the abolition of slavery
in the state of massachusetts was on
lie th of july and he would call upon mr
i brown to state whether the colored people
mere bad not iheu pi occasion on that day hr
i celebrating their emancipation ten days after
tic anniversary ot the declaration of inde
pendence that fact tie would dare the gen
berrien to negative in reply he would alsu
i give another proof of the nonexutence of
prejudice against color which mr thomp
mjn with all tua eloquence could not gainsay
he alluded to the fact that ihe chaplain of the
senate ol mmaachuseit was changed every
r non ill and the minister were taken in roia
utlon and the rev mr paul whom they
must all koow aince they vindicated the nc
gro was a negro preacher in boston and 
never desecrated hi polpitby receiving a
vyhiut smfi into hltttt that vtdowd pram her j
had a seat io tire senate of the coontry wi
op hit prater to god in charily h
mr jones had beet attracted by the trow
freedom at the or of the meeting and
bad therefore entered it and he declared that
the state of the negro in the east wa not aa
galing a in the south he made that de
claration not only before that meeting but be
fore his god he aaaerted that the charge
was the meeting would pardon himi
he would not uttet the word in heart woulo
dictate for lie te mem be rod be waa before a
public assembly he had also
years in the south in uginia and had been
entertained there by gentlemen although they
knew he was oppoaed to slavery on pnnoiple
he was not less happy in his residence there
slaves there had bought their freedom
there woiked as mechanics they had satur
day for tbetr overwork and their time was
paid for in gold aod in the savings bank
ny ot them had enough to purchase their free
dom but they would not do it this was
the case of col myers tobacco manufactory
w hich had  colored people in it he mr
jones abbot red slavery on principle but lie
objected to misrepresentation when mr
charles dickens published lus wotk on amer
ica some years since be had stated that it
w as a common practice of the slaveholders to
pod out the teeth of their slaves as a punish
ment for having stigmatized the americans
in that manner he mr jones had refused
to give his hand to that excellent writer
trusted the meeting would pardon him for
having expressed himself warmly while be
was an englishman here he was also a citi
zen of the united states hi public life
w as his pledge for him that in england and
america he had endeavored on all occasions
to defend the wronged and vindicate the op
pressed and he was doing so at that time
he had come as a stranger to the meeting
having no right to the platform hear
he thanked mr thompson for his courtesy
and the chairman for his fait play in having
given him an opportunity to make that speech
he only rose to vindicate his negative to thej
statement made by mr thompson relative to
the poiats he had refetred to with that ex
ception he had given the same british hearty
applause which throughout they had given to
the noble sentiments of his opponent
mr thompson rose and saidhe could neith
er retract nor modify a single word he had
i uttered respecting the prejudice against color
hi the united slates cheers notwith
btanding what mr jones had said of boston
e r thompson would arflira that even in
i that city the colored man was the victim of a
pieiudice which in its effect upon the mind of
a sensitive and educated person was as gall
ing as slavery itself to one of less susceptible
mind cheers let us he continued try
boston by a test which better than any other
perhaps will decide the question between me
and my opponent if there is a place on
which men should assemole as on a common
level from winch pride and prejudice should
be banished where conventional distinctions
should tor the ume be obliterated that place
is the sanctuary for there tve meet as the
children of one father and as heirs of the
same promise vv heiher as sinners or saints
we aie equal and the consciousness of com
mon necessities and common hopes should
leaeh us to fling away the prejudices and pre
possessions w inch we are prone to cherish in
ihe world how stands the case in boston i
why  will undertake to say that there is
not a church in that city unless one formed
tm antislavery principles in which a colored
man can hold anduccupya pew in the body ol
the building erected for public worship an
 instance did once occur of a colored citizen
becoming the proprietor of a pew but his ap
pearance in it threw the whites into conster
nation and the man and his family were per
seemed until the property was relinquished
mr jones cannot point me to a religious de
nomination in boston that as such hai
opened ns doors to the colored man and ad
mitted him on terms ot perfect social equality
episcopalians presbyterians congregational
lsis methodists baptists unitarians swe
denborgians and uuiversahsts are aliki
guilty in this matter and if such is the ex
ample set by professing christians what cai
we expect from those who have no reverenci
for religion and no respect for the principle
of christianity
mr brown on coming forward was greet
ed with loud applause which lor a lime pre
vented him from proceeding he presume
they had all heard something of the  pecu
liar institution of america from which h
had so unceremoniously giaduated laugh
ter in the first place what was the slaver
of the united states so much was sail
about american democracy american repub
licanism american philanthropy and amer
ican christianity that when american slave
ry was spoken of people generally suppose
that slavery amid all those glorious institu
tions which they heard so much about mut
be rather better than slavery in any other poi
tion of the world but what was the fact
was it so why the slave of the unite
states w as a chattel a thing a saleable cotr
mod itv without any legal right to own him
self oi to receive the avails of his labor dt
pnved of the privilege of protecting bimsel
bis wife or children he spoke not from the
i ory or hearsay but from actual experience
when he thus described the workings of th
j slave system in america he was not onl
i an american slave but the son ot an amer
 can slaveholder and they would see in th
latter fact another hideous feature of th
damning system of slavery hear hear
the slave in the united states was unprotee
ed by law or public sentiment and occupie
the same position as a mans horse or dog
in si louis from which he had escaped th
horse in fact received more protection than ih
slave lor if the quadruped was unmercifull
beaten an action might be brought against th
man for the offence but it a slave was flog
 ged with however much severity a cry wj
j immediately raised among the bvstandert
give it the nigger give it him heai
hear if awlave feels that god has give
him a right to occupy a higher position tba
merely toiling for the man who claims to ow
both bis body and soul aod attempts to mak
bis escape ihe bloodhounds are put upon hi
track and if caught he is dragged back agai
into slavery thrown into a dungeon torturec
and finally aold from his wife and chiidrer
and sent lo be worked upon a cotton sugai

 hear the constitution of the unite

common with john c calhoun of sout
carolina every citizen of the unite

country in the event of the slaves atterap

no one regrets more than i do that he should
have thrown his iofiueice into the scale of
american slavery hear bear the cir
cumstance proves however the baleful effect
which slavery exeits over every individual
who cornea within tbe sphere of ha influence
here is a man who in  in conjunction
with daniel oconnell l f rl b an address
to america signed by  irishmen cal
liog upoq ikeir countrymen in the united
states to take sides with the abolitionists and
have nothing at all to do with proalavery peo
ple as far as their influence was concerned
telling them that the abolitionists were the
friends of the negro and calling upon them to
join them bean and hand and telling them
moreover that they must oot even keep neu
tral for there was no neutral ground upon the
antislavery platform hear that man
goes to america breathes its corrupting air
and mark in a moment he is paralyzed he
can do nothing whatever for the poor slave
whom he had before recommended to the zeal
ous support of his countrymen in the united
states hear he was called upon by the
slave in the pernors of the antislavery
committee to attend a t irst of august meet
ing in celebration of that british west india
emancipation which he himself had labored to
bring about what aashis reply lcannot
commit myself while in amenca loud
groans hiss and marks of disapprobation
the slave comes upon his bended knees to
this irish apostle and tells him that his wife
has been torn from him and carried into the
most miserable bondage reminds him you
called upon your irish brethren in america to
stand fast by the abolitionists we now only
ask you to practice in america what you
preach in ireland he turns round and says
he cannot have anything at all to do with
j antislavery in america hear and why i
he had a few days before received an invita
tion from our slaveholding president to be
come his guest while visiting washington
hear hear hear yes he had received
an invitation to the white house and he im
mediately throws himself and his influence in
to the of the elave power samson was
never more thoroughly shorn of his physical
strength by throwing himself into the lap o
delilah than was father matthew shorn o
his moral influence by his apostacy to the an
tislavery cause loud cheers the man
who in ireland seven years ago said thai
slavery was a highhanded sin has found out
since he has reached america that there is
nothing in scripture against slaveholding
cries ofshame it might not be just in
me to express my warm feelings upon that
point and therefore  will quote your own
cowper who has said
of all the arts sagacious dupes invent
to cheat themselves and gain the worlds assent
 he worst is scripture warped from its intent
those men go wrong who with ingenious skill
bend the straight rule to their own crooked will
and will a clear and shining light supplied
first put it out then take it for their guide
cheers he mr brown had been asked
why he had come to england his answer
was in the first place that he might for the
the first time in his life stand upon a soil that
was really iree cheers he wanted to
see the people who had knocked off the chains
from  of his brethren in slavery oh
what a glorious atmosphere was england
just tbe very breathing of it so expanded the
limbs of the slave that the chains that had
hound him for thirty years burst asunder he
wished that every slave and slaveholder in
america could see that meeting aoothei
reason why he came to england was to agi
tate the question and endeavor to build up
public sentiment there so that englishmen
would say to americans lf you wish to be
 thought ol as other nations never again send
a slaveholder to represent you in the court ol
 st james he wanted a public sentiment
raised up in england which should point the
finger of scorn at evry slaveholder who dared
to pollute its soil the welcome which the
 people of england had extended to him mr
brown would be appreciated by the 
i  slaves and the  colored freemer
as an honor done to them all men had no l
t acted as father matthew had there wa
 one man who fifteen years ago went fron
that country to america to agnate the ques
tion of slavery and although he rose oru
morning and found in the pious city of bos
 ton a gallows erected before his door as i
warning to him to stop agitation upon tha
t subject yet he refused to close his lips upor
the question and in the meeting that gwe hiir
mr brown a farewell in boston upon leav
 ing america three of the loudest longest
and heartiest cheers that were given on tha
occasion went up for that man and that mar
was george thompson loud and prolong
ed cheering
mr brown concluded a long and most elu
quent speech amidst reiterated cheers
b the following resolutions drawn up by
y mr farmerthe first moved by h t atkin
son esq and seconded by w h ashurst
e esq the second moved by d mcdonnell
e esq and seconded by william geesin esq
were adopted with cordial unanimity
resolved that this meeting tenders its
d warmest and most cordial congratulations u
mr william wells brown upon his arrival
e in england bevond the reach of the american
e manstealer that animated by the common
y feeling of englishmen they indignantly repu
e diate the doctrine of the inferiority of the af
rican race and on behalf of this nation public
s ly give to mr brown as a representative ol
f his oppressed people an unreserved recogm
tion of his right to perfect social political and
n religious equality a right received from the
n hands of his creator but of which he was
n impiously robbed by nominal republicans and
e christians in amenca that having in the
providence of god achieved his own deliver
d ance from slavery and resolved to consecrate
tbe emancipated energies of his mind and the
influence of his moral character to the cause
of the redemption of bis three million of breth
ren in bonds this meeting welcomes him to
d the metropolis of england and bids him god
n speed in bis holy mission on both aides of the
atlantic
resolved that in the deliberate and deci
e ded opinion of ibia meeting the claim of prp
erty in man either as practically asserted in
the slave stales of the american union or
as conventionally abetted in the free is a fear
 ful invasion of the prerogative of god and
e wholly incompatible with the religion ot
christ whether professed by individuals or
communities that while anxiously desirous
j of rendering a full and respectful acknow led 
mem of whatever is honorable in tbe national

it is astonishing an  mortifying that the
people of all others under the broad canopy ol
beaten who ought to be the moat united pre
sent to the world the leant evidence of that
union smarting under wrongs and denied
rights which should cause all bearta to throb
together as the heart of one man in a com
mon effort to redress those wrongs and to
achieve those rights we are yea a disunited
separated and scattered people and we pre
sent to the world no grand movement nor
comprehensire scheme fot bettering onr con
dition
without wishing to censure unjustly or
to compare unwarrantably we do think
that a cause like ours were it in the hands ol
any other people would certainly rally
larger numbers excite a deeper interest and
obtain a belter suport than now falls to its
lot it is always grievous to be compelled
to speak in disparagement of an oppressed
people if we ever do so it is with a view
of inciting them to make the needful exer
tions for their deliverance and this is the
only apology we deem necesary
there is not an intelligent colored man in
the land who does not know that the colored
people in this country need organization and
it has been a cause of deep grief to the noble
minded among us that no eftoit has been made
for a general organization by which the mor
al power of our people could be made avail
able to our cause go where we will we
hear a general lament that we are a disuni
ted people yet how few there are who have
the energy and the will to remedy the evil of
which all su readily complain
on the th of august last we suggested
the rough outline of a constitution which
should serve as a landmark to those of our
people who are desirous to secure an
union of the oppressedfor the sake of free
dom and although a few among u  have
readily and wholly responded to our sugges
tion the overwhelming mass have remained
silent as the grave on the subject the im
partial citizen e dited by a colored man did
not even notice it the rams horn hau
been dumb over it very few of our public
men have as yet given to the idea the slight
est encouragement pittsburgh that should
always be ready to speak as she always has
an opinion has been silent cincinnati con
taining a colored population as intelligent
active and wealthy as any in the country
has not lisped a word pro or con on the sub
ject new york as usual has nothing to
say
what can be the cause of this apparent in
difference can it be that the professions of
regret with which we meet from time to
time that there is not an union among the
colored people are false and hypocritical
can it be that the profession is put forth
merely as a cloak for indifference and indo
lence we cannot believe it the true rea
son of the apparent general apathy and uncon
cern with which the idea of a national league
has been received by the people must be
lound in the fact that the subject has not been
airly brought before them our leading men
have not taken it up nor pressed its impor
tance upon them in addition to this we
have reason to believe that sectarianism is
not among the least of the causes of the hes
itation and coldness with which the move
ment has been received colored people m
common with white people have their differ
ent religious creeds and sects to support
nor are we disposed to quarrel with them on
that account but when they allow their re
ligious differences to stand in the way of prop
er efforts for their enfranchisement they at
 once become suitable objects for exposure
and rebuke
there isnothing necssanly in a difference
of religious opinions to divide us on subjects
pertaining to our civil social and political
rights and relations but in the causes that
separate us there is something more difficult
and bitter than mere differences of religious
opinions it is the bigotry of sect so nar
row and neatsighted that it can see good no
where beyond the limits of its own particular
communion it is this ignorance and intole
rance that stand directly in the way of that
union so devoutly to be wished for
there is that among us as among other peo
ple which leads us to reject a thing good tn
itself merely because the person or the par
ty bringing it forward may entertain opinions
on other subjects not stamped with orthodoxy
we have among us our little popes and
bishops who claim and assume to decide lor
the colored people what shall be the religious
opinions of those who undertake to instruct
them such men love the uppermost seats
in the synagogue and they will have tliem oi
they will have will have nothing but it is
not our purpose to give an expose of the hin
drances with which oar ptoposed movement
must contend we see no impediments but
what may be easily removed it is impossible
to keep a people asunder for any long time
wbo are so strongly and peculiarly identified
together when there i a vigorous effort nude
to unite them we shall never despair of
our peoplean union shall yet be effected
our ranks cannot always be divided the in
juries which we mutually suffer the con
tempt in whieh we are held the wrongs
which we endure together with a sense of
our own dignity as men must eventually
lead ua to combine it will one day become
obvious to all that the evils that afflict ua all
require the united strength of all for their xe
moval at preseoi we as a people do uot feel
nor see this we have not yet learaed the j h
losophy of reform nor the appreciation of
moral forces there are many among us

mountable difficulties in the way of the move
ment we uant discussion tee t cant ac

we call upon pittsburgh cincinnati new

and to express their opinions freely on the
wisdom and desirableness of such a combina
tion as that proposed under the title of the
rational league philadelphia chicago
buffalo and albany hare already spoken and
will undoubtedly stand ready to give the
measure their warmest and most energetic
support a grand convention in which
these cities with others are largely represen
ted by the wise and the good would pruduce
a thrilling effect and a lasting impression on
the public mind d
education among the coloied people
one of the most gratifying and encoura
ging signs of the times is the interest at pres
ent manifested in the important work of ed
ucation among the colored people the time
was when this subject scarcely excited any
attention among our white fellow country men
when they could say the negro ought to he
tiee they felt that they had uttered a radi
cal and philanthropic sentiment but as the
cause of emancipation progresses and human
rights and human duties become belter under
stood something more than the mere act o
emancipation is now thought to be due to thii
jong neglected and deeply injured people
our attention has been directed to this sub
ject by a circular emanating from a uumbe
of philanthropic ladies of farmington whicl
document the reader will find on the outsidt
of tikis weeks north star
with the object of this committee wemos
cordially sympathise the work which the
have undertaken is an important one for o
all the people under the broad blue sky wh
stand in need of the advantages of educa
tion the colored people of this couutr
are preeminent surrounded by a peopl
j possessing every facility for improvement ih
disparity between us and them is alone
j source of great pain and unhappiness bu
when we add to this the fact that w e are com
pelled by a bitter prejudice to follow the mos
menial and the least lucrative employment
for a living and that we are the constant ob
jects of the scorn contempt and ridicule o
the community education which is ever es
jseitia to all becomes doubly important to ns
we are the competitors of personscompara
lively well instructed and were we even wel
educated we should still have difficulties tc
struggle against to which our oppressors art
strangers but how great is the disparity ano
how fearful are the odds while education ii
common to the white people and denied to us
j knowledge is power said bacon and it if
about the only power that can at present be
wielded by the colored people political pow
er they have not the power of wealth they
cannot reachour only hope in this country
at piesent rests upon the improvement of oui
minds and the elevation of our character
knowledge is the preliminary step to all pow
er and for the want of this knowledge the
colored man is killed all the day long out
ignorance is pleaded as a reason for withhold
ing our lights while knowledge itself has
been locked up from us this statement per
i haps may bequestioned and we shall be
pointed to the fact that in this state school
privileges are extended to colored children
i but the answer to this fact rnay be found in
the circumstance that colored people subjec
ted as they are to the most menial einploy
ment have the hardest possible struggle to
i live when bread and education are placed
before a hungry man it ieav to see which
will lie preferred to educate thecolored
eople something more must be done than to
j admit us into schools and this is the mountain
difficulty in the way of our progress
j we have not the means in many cases
requisite to enable us to send our childien to
tschool as soon as they arrive at an age
suitable to commence service they are put
out and in these circumstances they early
i learn to look upon themselves as inferiors and
i as being marked out for a life of degradation
j the ordinary incentives to the attainment of
knowledge are nipped in the bud they are
taught to feel that the onlyeducation necessary
for theit condition in life is to know what is
coming to them at the end of a months work
and w ith their energies thus crushed their
example and ignorance are most cruelly and
unjustly used to feed the flmeof american
prejudice
whatever serves to remove these difficul
ties and to smooth the pathway to knowledge
is appopriate antislavery work we there
lore hail with a thrill of delight this new ef
fort on the pan of the ladies comjioaing the
provisional educational committee we
must however express the belief that the
movement would wear a much more lmpar
i nal aspect and meet with greater encourage
 rnent if other colored persons besides those
l born south of masoo and dixons line were
included among the beneficiaries
there are a great many colored persons at
the uorth who cannot understand why fugi
tives from slavery should be selected out as
the objects of special benevolence and educa
ted as ladies while they in our uudt are
never thought of having fled from slavery
ourselves and been the objects of especial fa
vor as well as of marked hatred we cannot
be suspected of a want of sympathy for fugi
tives ws must also dissent iron the prop
osition of sending colored teachers into the

i have beard of tbe lira and sir truly sor
ry for it
you are not a btt better than they are
they are all a set of thieves an ism cer
tain columbia would be better off if they were
all back ia slavery again and the best way i
see to get them sway is to burn them out
i think they have just as good a right to
live and enjoy all the immunities of our town
as you or i
they all ought to be slaves they
were made to obey the bible says so and
i am sure vou would not dare to deny the
commands of jehovah
i am curious to know what part of the
bible you get your authority from
hand me that bible on the shelf now
turn to leviticns th chap and th a
th verses and you will find these words
you must recollect that this was s command
given by almighty god himself
thy bondmen and thy bondwomen which
thou shall have shall be of the heathen that
are around about you of them shall you buy
bond men and bondwomen and ye shall tike
them as an inheritance for your children after
you tu inherit them for a possession they
shall be your bondmen for ever
now if you can show me where this ho
ly command has been abrogsted why then i
will listen to you and not till then and
moreover i think american slavery is justi
fied by this one passage alone that i have just
read without referring to any more
wellnow let us see if the slavery spoken
of in the book is a quarter as bad as ameri
can slavery slaves in that day went free
in the th and sometimes in the th year of
their bondage by turning back to leviticus
th chap th verse you will find these
words
and ye shall hallow the th year and
proclaim liberty through all the laud unto
all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubi
lee unto you and ye shall return every man
unto his possession and ye shall return every
man unto his family
thus you see that there was a limit in
those days to slavery which is not the case
with american slavery and more than that
you cannot show me out of the bible that
slaves under the moasic laws were liable to
be sold at auction as they are in this country
parents from their childrenhusbands from
their wives and so on through the whole
family
i believe that god approves of hu
man slavery and that the institution is of
divine appointment and so  care not what
you may say to the contrary you may turn
fourierite and try to overthrow the word of
god but all your efforts will be in vain it
has withstood the bhock of ages upon ages
the bloodstained banner of christianity will
continue to wave over the eternal battlements
for time untold yet to come
my friend after delivering himself of this
pathetic appeal vanished he is an average
specimen of a man who considers himself a
first rate citizen and goes to church once
twice and sometimes three times a week
but this is not an uncommon case in our
town are to be found caririiansthat have a ho
ly horror of the negro i could name some
who if asked to sit down at table to eat with
them would turn away indignantly and leave
the house but if you told them there was a
chance to win fifty or a hundred dollars off
them at a gaming table ten chances to one
they would jump at it without once turning up
their nose or making use of disparaging ex
pressions but it is the way of the world
the man that does not feel that christianity
andslaveiy are opposed to each other seems
to me to be beyond the reach of reason or con
viction the principles of universal justice
are gaining ground rapidly in our town not
withstanding there are imported occasionally
from the south some professional hotspur or
a northern doughfaceoffice holder
i am aready extending this communication
to a too great a length in drawing it to a
close i cannot refrain from making some
mention of the kind friends of the oppressed
in this place and it we are to judge of the
past i have no hesitation in saying that the
refugee will always find the string of the latch
hanging out and a warm heart in the persons

an appeal in behalf of the western
new york antislavery fair
earnestly desiring the abolition of slavery
in this land and being deeply convinced that
this result can only be accomplished by renew
ed efforts to change our present corrupt moral
sentiment the undersigned members and
f riends of the western new york antislavery
society again make their appeal to the
friends of the slave in behalf of their annual
bazaar which will be held in rochester in
december next
whiiewe have been cheered and gladdened
by the progress already made and the good
already done and while we rejoice to observe
that friends have been raised up to plead the
cause of the bondman among persons and in
quarters where we had least expected them
we still see the harvest to be great and the
laborers to be few and instead of relaxing
our efforts we are impressed with a sense of
the ruty of doubling our diligence and ap
plying more closely our energy to the means
of advancing this holy causewe appeal the
more boldly to our friends because those for
whom we plead cannot plesd for themselves
while we are surrounded by our domestic
circle with none to molest or make us afraid
there are three millions of men and women in
our own land doomed to abject slavery and
chains robbed of every rightcivilsocial
personaland political remembering those
in bonds as bound with them we desire to
plead their cause as though they were on our
own limbs and the knotted lash were applied j
to our own backs
while to obtain means for enlightening the
public mind is the stiong motive for holding
our annual fair it is not the only one a
great amount of good may be traced directly
to such occasions many who are now ac
tive workers in behalf of this holy movement j
became first interested in it through the in
strumeiitality of those annual exhibitions of
antislavery industry tact and skill
the present object of the rochester anti
slavery bazaar is for the general enlighten
ment of the public mind on the subject of sla 
very recognizing the north star published
in this city as an efficient antislavery in
strumentality we propose that the funds raised
by the sale of articles at tbe bazaar on
behalf of which we here appeal shall be
mainly appropriated to the support of that
important paper
we gaietully acknowledge the prompt as
sistance rendered to our last f air by our
friends and coadjutors in various parts of our
own state wisconsin and michigan and we
earnestly solicit their continued cooperation
with us in the good work that no time may
be lost we especially recommend to them the
immediate formation of sewing circles in their
various towns with a view to making articles
for the rochester bazaar we would also
in this connection render our heartfelt thanks
to our british friends for the valuable aid ex
tended by them to our last years fair and
we would again warmly solicit their generous
assistance it t  due to our transatlantic
friends to say that for much of the interest felt
in our last bazaar we were indebted to them
and we are persuaded that their continued
cooperation will essentially piomote the suc
cess of our approaching december bazaar
and tbe advgdcement of the cause of the slave
in our land
we hope that the foregoiog appeal will
commend itself to out philanthropic friend on
both sides of the atlantic and that they will
cordially unite with us in the effort here pro

bula county ohio to miss angelina
adopted daughter of benjamin and sarah brown of
pittsburgh
several hundred years ago there liv
ed in germany a very gifted and pious
artist called george surlin he was es
pecially successful id the production oi
sacred pictures and images of saints
to which branch of his art he had devo
ted himself with so much love aud en
thusiasm that he could scarcely gel
enough to do in it yet he never want
ed work or orders for his fame had
spread far and near and there were
few large churches in the country which
did not possets a sacred picture by
master george surlin
one day as he was seated at work
in his studio there came to him some
monks emmisaries of the monastery nl
blaubeuren in switzerland and asked
him whether he would paint a large
and beautiful picture lor the altar ol
their cloister chapel it was not how
ever to tie painted upon canvass or up
on wood but upon the wall back ol tbe
altar and george surlin it he would
undertake the order must therefore
prepare himself for the long journey to
blaubeuren he concluded to go not
so much on account of the great re
ward which the abbot of said cloister
had promised him but because the rev
erend lather so valued the limners art
and hud sent for him from afar he
resolved to devote all his powers and
energies to that picture
the abbot received the artist with
open arms conducted him to a high
airy and beautiful chamber the win
dows of which overlooked a most ex
quisite landscape and only left his guest
to allow him time to rest and sleep in
order to enable him to commence his
great work as soon as possible w hen
the early morning sun cast in its com
ing a purple line upon the glaciers
master surlin was already seated by
his window drawing inspiration lrom
the glorious works ot nature for his
forthcoming great work of art as the
painting advanced and more and more
approached completion upon the white
walls of the altar the artist himself be
came enamored ol his handiwork and
at last confessed in his own mind that
it was a masterwork of rare beauty and
perfection
the monks and the abbot himself
who was a great connoisseur rejoiced
no little that george surlins best pic
ture should adorn their chapel and thus
make it an object of envy as well as
admiration of the neighboring cloisters
they never tired of watching the
master at his work and of loading him
with praise presents and marks of
approbation
at last the painting was finished and
a solemn service was held to inaugu
rate the noble work of art the paint
er then kneeled at the foot of the altar
and thanked and praised god who had
allowed him to complete his great work
and the collected people stared and
wondered at the glory of the picture
and praised the master hand which hud
created it
after the mass the abbot addressed
the artist and said master you
have given us a most rare work of youi
beautiful art and you yourself con
ceive it to be your masterpiece has
this labor exhausted your inner resour
ces of design or do you think that you
might yet be able to produce even a
greater or still more beautiful painting
give me an honest answer to my ques
tion master surlin
the painter who thought of nothing
except that the abbot would give him a
i new order and who like a true artist
on the completion of a great work fell
himself imbued with fresh courage and
energy for renewed labors replied un
hesitatingly that he might venture to
make such a promise as art was an in
exhaustible lountain ever generating
new supplies to her earnest and indus
trious disciples moreover confin
ed the artist my gratitude to the
lord whose mighty arm has assisted
me in the work i have just finished ur
ges ine on to attempt a greater and still
more perfect work to bis praise honor
and glory
tlie abbot listened to these words in
great displeasure for it was not his in
tention to give the master another or
der but he desired that surlin should
never again commence so masterly a
 work in order that his cloister might
have the honor of possessing the best
picture by the great master now
however be heard to his mortification
and anger that master surlin was ca
pable of painting not only an equally
good but even a much superior pic
ture and hi foolish vanity revolted at
the thought he resorted to a tiend
like expedient by which to remain m
f possession of george surlins last and
best painting
on the following night whilst the
painter was last asleep the two monks
who had accompanied him to switzer
land crept to las couch tied his arms
with cords and with a sharp knife cut
out both his eyes draining the sight
that precious font of light and color
forever to kill him much as tlie
wretched man begged for death as a fa
vor they had not the courage they
only circulated a report that the great
painter had died on his homeward jour
ney and kept the poor man carefully
hidden in a remote cell
and now the poor master was forev
er robbed of glorious light and to the
sublime pictures which still lived in
his soul he could no longer give life
and color lost in mental misery he
scarcely noticed the physical tortures
and pams he had to undergo it griev
ed his soul much more to be hencetorth
buried in night and never again to be
able to distmguish lights and colors
one of the monks who was in the dai
ly habit of bringing him a jug of wine
and ihe necessary food took pity on the
poor man
a  d adjr emce for your he
said wnen he found the painter with
his arms open seated by the latticed
window of bis cell as iflongmg to rush
forth upon the beauteous landscape
which be could no longer behold
guide me once more to the altar
upon which  painted my laat picture
begged the unfortunate man and the
pious brother could not refuse him that
reqaect at midnight when the iv
bot and the other monka were nelnnp
he guided him to the chapel led him to
i the foot of the ikar end tkre left him
alone promieing to return early in the
morning to conduct the painter back to
hia cell
but the good monk awoke too late on
the folloming morning and could not
venture to guide the blind men from the
church as the other monks would hare
perceived it he had barely sufficient
time to bide suriiu in a deep wooden
confessional chair which had stood un
used for a long time behind the altar
there the artist had to remain during
the whole day and listen to the religious
services of the monks secretly his
i friend managed at noon to give him
some food and promised him to return
at night and conduct him back to his
cell this he did but the blind paint
or had marked the way which led to the
church and aa the monks bad gradu
ally omitted to lock his cell since they
believed that the poor blind man could
not leave his little room without aid
he stole every evening to the church
prayed in front of the altar and then
passed a great part of the time in the
wooden confessional where he worked
silently and mysteriously
upon his couch be had found the
kuile which the monks had used to blind
him and iu the intenseness of his pains
and misery the unhappy man was upon
the point of making that weapon the
instrument of suicide but an invisi
ble hand restrained him from commit
ting this great sin which would have
made him truly deserving of all the
misery he had endured heaven nev
er had given him the rare ability of
conceiving his glorious pictures to al
low him to commit a deadly sin be
cause the power of representing his
fancies on canvas was lost to him for
ever
he was frightened at his own cow
ardly intentions and determined now to
make the instrument of death the in
strument of his future consolation as
he could no longer represent his de
signs in colors he began to cut them
in wood and his sense of feeling
became a substitute for the sense oi
sight with the sharp knife he had
obtained and after an immense deal of
labor he thus cut the whole history
of his misfortune upon the wooden side
of the confesional he spent many
years upon this labor and forgot his
misery in the employment no one
discovered his nightly walks nor hie
work in the church and gradually the
monks felt so secure that they opened
the chiirch to any and every strangei
who desired to see george surlins fas
and bqst picture
often at these times was the pool
blind artist a silent and unsuspected
witness of the admiration bestowed up
on his work by foreign artists none oi
whom ever dreamed that the master
whose genius was so warmly lauded by
them whose rare talent they so envied
was hidden a blind and wretched old
man behind the altar working with in
defatigable patience upon a wooden pic
ture
from the day when his carved pic
ture was finished he remained silently
and patiently awaiting his end which
came on the third day delivering hin
from all earthly pain and sorrow am
now only could the monks breatht
more freely for the silent lunatic foi
such they believed him be when the
saw him so often and without a mur
mur seeming with sightless eyes t
stare upon vacancythat silent luna
tic now lay deep beneath the sod anc
with him the fearful secret of theii
guilt was buried nor did they spar
masses for his soul to procure for the
poor artist whom they had robbed o
all the good and beautiful in life happi
ness in death and heavenly rest ai
they in their mental blindness though
their masses could do the woodei
confessional however was never open
ed and thus nobody discovered the las
work of the blind artist
meanwhile the abbot had easily suc
ceeded in exciting the jealousy and en
vy of other monasteries for the beau
titul painting that adorned the altar o
his many foreign artists and high no
ble gentlemen came from far and near
to look upon this rare work of art am
all regretted the early death of thi
great master
it happened that one day a travel
ler visited the monastery who coul
scarcely leave the altar or stop gaziug
so great was his admiration of th
painting nothing escaped his atten
tion or notice and thus it chanced tha
he observed a beautifully carved rose
upon the pannel of the door of an ole
wooden confessional the door am
the whole confessional chair were s
dustcovered that it was evident the
had not been used by the monks for ma
ny years
besides the greatest painter yoi
seem tohave had one of the greates
carvers at work here he said in i
tone of astonishment to the monk wh
accompanied him the rose was in re
ality a masterpiece in its way hii
companion however assured him tha
there was no carved or sculpturewort
any where in the church and that tht
rose must have come there by some un
accountable accident
this reply excited the strangers cu
riositv still more and he opened thi
door of the confessional to see whethei
he could find any more carved work b
the same masterhand that had execu
ted the rose at tirst the door wouk
not open for the old hinges had rusted
but at last they yielded sending a
creaking and ominous sound througl
the chapel the stranger entered tha
chair and stepped upon a hard sub
stance which rattled over the fiaga
raising it he observed that it was a
knife which bore old blotches of moos
upon its blade the monk waagreatlj
frightened for he it once recognizee
the knife as having been one of the twe
w hich had been used in the torture o
the unfortunate artist how could thal
knife have come to this place wau
it through a miracle in order to bring
now after so many years had elapsed
that black deed to light and its perpe
trators to justice
the length of time had loosed ike
panels from the framework of the con
fessional and as it seemed to the stran
ger that be copid even in the dusk dis
cover some carving of merit than he
raiaed the paoel took it owl and
brought it te the tight
r  it u
and no terror end tear betel the
mk who had already been horrified
at the mffctwltfco knife aod he ruabed
from the chapel exclaiming
lbiiigiittihfffaheffwi
thegrave to acceeehiemurdereie
the at ranger now perceived that ic
hia hood be held the picture of a man
who had been deprived of both eyes
as drops of blood seemed to tall upon
the cheeks from the sightless sockets
his face wore the expression of intents
misery sad seemed to implore mercy
of two monks who were standing before
him one of theae atili held a knife in
hia band wbilat tba other whose face
expressed a fiendish triumph wai
breaking his pallet and brushes
there could not be s moments doubl
of the import and meaning of this pic
ture nor was the master hand which
had painted the altarpiece to be mis
taken in the grouping and formation ol
these carved figures the strangei
needed not the additional evidence ol
the exclamations of the frightened
monk to understand the connection ol
the whole terrible mystery
hastily he left the monastery and
took the carved picture with him bui
he soon returned with a long train and
the officers of justice whom he had
sought soon forced a confession of theii
fearful and wicked deed from the
monks these were punished with the
utmost rigor of justice and in memo
ry of their wickedness the wonderfully
carved panel was inserted in the dooi
of the vestry where it may be seen tc
this day
from the southern christian advocate
an original letter of dr
franklin
messrs editorsln my reading 
have fallen upon the following original
letter from dr b franklin the occa
sion of its production seems to be the
following after the emancipation oi
the north american states from the civi
and ecclesiastical power of the britisli
crown the few remaining clergymen
of the episcopal church wishing to
perpetuate the office of the episcopate
sent some of their brethren to england
to obtain from the british king parlia
ment and archbishop of canterbury
episcopal prerogatives in this attempt
they met with many difficulties and for
sympathy and help they wrote to dr
franklin the then american minister
at the court of france the following
is his reply
to messrs weems and grant citizens
of the united states in london
paris th july 
gentlemen on receipt of your let
ter acquainting me that the archbishop
of canterbury would not permit you tc
be ordained unless you took the oath ol
allegiance i applied to a clergyman ol
my acquaintance for information on the
subject of your obtaining ordination
here his opinion was that it could be
done and that if it were done you
would be required to vow obedience tc
the archbishop of paris i next inquir
ed of the popes nuncio whether you
might not be ordained by the bishop ol
america powers being sent him for the
purposerif he had them not already
the answer was the thing is impossi
ble unless the gentlemen become cath
olics this is an affair of which i know
but very little and therefore i may ask
questions and propose means that are
improper or impracticable but whal
is the necessity of your being connect
ed with the church of england
would it not do as well if you were
of the church of ireland the religion
is the same though there is a different
set of bishops and archbishops per
haps if you were to apply to the bishop
of derry who is a man of liberal senti
ments he might give you orders as oi
that church if both britain and ire
land refuse you and i am not sure
that the bishop of denmark or swe
den would ordain you unless you be
came lutherans what is then to be
done next to becoming presbyte
rians the episcopalian clergy of ame
rica in my humble opinion cannot do
much better than to follow the exam
ple of the first clergy of scotland soon
after the conversion of that country
to christianity when their king had
built the cathedral of st andrews
and requested the king of northumber
land to lend his bishops to ordain one
of them that their clergy might not as
heretofore be obliged to go to north
umberland for orders and their re
quest was refuced they assembled
in the cathedral and the mitre crosier
and robes of a bishop being laid upon the
altar they after earnest prayers for
direction in their choice elected one of
their own number when the king
