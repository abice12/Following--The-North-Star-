mr editor l find it useless to
write to men who do not heed or can
not comprehend the ideas i may con
voy and who judging from the matter
of the editorial of the samples of your
paper sent ire attempt more the rhe
toric of words than the imparting of
solid knowledge in all the mass of
verbiage which you write for that
press how little of ideas are conveyed
and of these ideas how little accurate
do you really understand yourselves as
white folks see your reasoning  have
taken a glance over some few of your
editorials and although i observe the
exhibition of some talents the bulk o
their purports falls far below the con
densed or even diffuse argumentation
of able white editors  know not that
you have any white assistant to correct
and dress up your effusions but they
are not such as men properly pretend
ing to or conscious of equal parts and
capacities with any other people on the
globe would write take one exam
ple elaborate with f ihis rea
soning to his own people january th
last lie said that the colored people
c annot find a state by themselves in
new mexico or anywhere not beyond
gunshot of the anglosaxon race
this is the cream of that pieceof tedi
ous loquacities now what has this
model negro of abolition idealized
that can be observable as to his
race i put it to gerrit smith to
lewis tappan and to w l garrison
on your side and to any three gentle
men on the side of fairness of truth
to decide whether or not you implied
the inferiority of your race and the
propriety of going off to liberiathat
land beyond american gunshot
you do me injustice in trying to ex 
hibit me to ridicule you ridicule
your own mental and moral powers by
estimating yourselves unable to live
near but separate from the anglo
saxon as if one race could control
the destiny of the other however
guarded yours be by a state con
stitution and in effect you in that
th january article undid the allega
tion you made a few weeks previously i
that you had better moral and mental
qualities than my second letter to you
evinced to be mine your inferiority
and dependence on the race of your
old masters are confessed by your
selves
in few and short remarks you made
relating to myself you do not respect
that god to whom i referred as to cer
tain decrees and attempt to cast odium
on me as a seeker after notoriety
ii i want negro notoriousness in writ
ing to you ami had no ulterior view
no ameliorating design no desire to
rescue my republic troin dissolution ini
its uniy it in short iny object equal
to assassinating a iueeu was like
the aspiration of erastratus why did i
not get a shorter road to this fame
by immolating myself in georgia and
sanctifying my name at the north
among your friends by sending you a
letter most abusive on the south why 
do i face the thunder of the south by
warning its interests to colonize your 
dangerous tribe off in their patrimonial
country and incur the hatred and
scurrility of the kmancipatists in engt
land and america by telling you in
plain unsophisticated english what
you are of course like every man
who tries to better the world  too
must have some ambition ail men but
u merest drone or expletive have
atoiratiou the only difference is that
vh exists be ween mere seekers of i
the north star
fame for its sake like bonaparte or
those that look to conservative deeds
for gratitude of mankind which con
fers a true and honest immortality if
i can no matter what or whom i be
manage to induce my countrymen to
peremptorily plant the africans else
where out of this republic and by so
doing preserve not only our political
union but an affection between the
various sections thereof ultimately
henefitting both races my motive would
be better seen and my notoriety
transcending all your conceptions of it
if i were in england so far from no
ticing the queen who i  the helpless
creature of the british constitution
were i inclined to do britains a favor i
would point to the necessity of ameud
ing her magna charts to greater lib
erality i care not for persons prin
ciples and systems are what the wise
aim to establishthe matter of indi
viduals being arranged by nations
whenever circumstance and prophecy
warrant a division
i do not care for a controversy when
i have evidence that no fair argument
ation can exist with those who descend
only to ridicule and to sneer it is
enough that the north saw my letters
the thinking white people there who
have the capacity to appreciate my
remarks and the candor to conscien
tiously admit the impregnability of
my position as well the propriety and
humanity of my advice to you you
flitted over them like the butterfly overl
die flowery hills but the truth is not the
less durable
i saw that my observation that i had
prayed to god to agony for the coloni
zation of the negro race in africa
drew from j d a jest at its being
scarcely endurable
i saw my remarks in the second
epistle bringing from f i the
churchattacking epithets of calvin
istic kidnapper and evangelical
womanflogger
what now shall be inferred from
such lame attempts at disparagement
eschewing all argument as these my
natural view was directed to that pro
pensity of your race everywhere to
using mockery or mirth at anybody or
thing and to the easy graduation by
which negroes fall from a laughing
habit to a vituperative temper and
in review passing before me was ham
mocking the patriarch noah in his
state of nudity and then quickly that
jufdlial and undevout haughty char
icter which he exhibited when as all
mtiquarians proved he was angry at
hat ancestor and blasphemous against
he deity ana making himself as ju
iter ammon their god he instituted
jagan worship and his grandson nim
rod kingcraftthings that yet scourge
he nations and which made noahs
curse the more irrevocable on ham
in keeping with this sacrilegious char
acter you with a few such rabid and
incoherent traitors to truth and to their
country as gcrrit smith and open infi
dels and destructives as w l garri
son compare the american character
to fiends and devils because
they do not join you in hating and
abusing all that hold slaves in this part
of the union and the only ipsedixii of
your fraternity by which a christian
must find his standard is neither in
piety nor peace nor the bible but in
bow ing down and idolizing the egyp
tian blackness of your internal com
plexion or in detiling gods sane the
ory with the abominations of your err
ing judgments i knew how white
israelites strove to turn back to egypt
not only on the way but long alter
joshuas time and so fascinating was
the egyptian face to them that god
by one of the prophets admonished
them thus now the egyptians are
men and not gods how seducing
must the negros charms be over many
white persons to induce from on high
such an explanation i see it at the
north where not only men fall into the
irrelevant snare and think ever after
like nonsensical people bufour white
women in many places look with some
horror at the idea of not playing the
desdemona and making othellos of
your gang and contemplate the refusal
to wed with a negro as a sin and i
am fully conscious that among your
reasons for wishing to stay iorever in
the centre of white communities here
is none more extrordinary and allab
sorbing than the secret or open hope
or wish to get white wives in fact
your own daily habit of talkingwriting
and acting prove your deep disdain for
yourselves
but i warn the insane north that
this would never do the truits of in
discriminate amalgamation have been
seen in the population of arabia ot
mauritiauia of spain of italy of
ireland and arc now visible in south
america and mexico if it ever im
proved on the african constitution it
does not on the european ye white
men and women are perfect enough
without your amalgam your mixture
spoils that original perfectness the
arabs are a people with hand mutually
against each other why turn to
that book you fearfully make light ot
and see ishmael was a halfegyptian
a mulatto the prophecy fulfilled in
his family is certain to this hour but
why was it given why was not isaac
also thus historically foretold the
moors that held spain for six centuries
contaminated the gothic majesty and
blood into that mongrel race of span
iards that yet not only acts turbulently
at home bat still in brazil and othci
places keeps up the slavetrade across
the ocean the portuguese are of the
same family look too at ireland
her own historians would have it
that a colony of trading phoenician
cunaanites settled in their island
and incorporated with the natives the
fact uow is that in ireland there arc
might is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren
many darkskinned blackhaired and
darkeyed men who are of canaanite
origin and the further fact is that the
irish here have the habit of falling into
negroerrors called balls and are ol
i course many of them a quarrelsome
i peppery ferocious and reckless people
i and as their ancestor was apparently
doomed to inferiority or slavery so
j they are measurably easily enslaved by
the race of the anglosaxons so you
see the consequence of amalgamation
is not creditable to us in ireland
phoenician men married gothic wo
men and their progeny had a different
i appearance from the mulattoes of the
i south who are the breed of white men
and black or colored women this is
the cause that the irish do not resemble
our mulattoes but the philosophy of
i the fact is defined
if you negroes have any high sense
really of your abilities or qualities
why do you shrink so sensitively from
finding a local habitation of your own
if my reason be the true one i must
repulse the affiliation for we should
qualify ourselves to the established laws
of jehovah before whom i bid you to
fajl down and humble yourselves and
to seek the grace of christ to enable
you to perceive the true path of duty
one observation more a paper
from boston the christian register
was by some unknown hand sent me
pen marked to indicate the ethnology
it is of the oth january as i can
not employ my time in writing so many
letters to the abolitionists  wish as
you may print this epistle as the third
and last from me to call the attention
of the editor of that press and of dr
cox to certain errors into which i con
ceive him fallen i was a little sur
prised to see the doctor admitting what
 thought no man north of virginia
ever admitted i thought fabers ela
borate attempt to discover the origin of
pagan idolatry was orthodox at the
north and that author stated that the
europeans were the progeny of cush
and the ethiopians of japhet lr
cox however reversed the belief and
i find at least one man who thinks the
truth there the abolitionists have
ever acted as if there was no division
of races by noahs three sons now
one man corroborates not only my sen
timent but the researches of that
greatest of archeologists bryant
nevertheless dr cox falls into an 
error as to the extent of the ciupe on j
ham i e canaan and as to the mean
ing of the word ethiopian
now  hold that this curse was not
confined to and fulfilled in canaan only
the canaanites were not enslaved a
very small portion of them were andj
that from a strategem they acted j
they were killed or expulsed the
idea of servitude attaching not to that
branch of hams race i inquire to
whom did it attach i answer to ail
our version of the bible said ham
was himself the mocker and the curse
on canaan was in mosesopinion to
have that drift as they were the tribe
with whom the jews dealt most still
hams name might have been canaan j
for he may have had more than one
appendage as we observe by jupiter
ammon the old arabic version of
genesis says cursed be ham the
father of canaan and the book of
lasher lately found has the same al
lusion notwithstanding all this mat
ter of slavery i think the curse was
to separation or to inferiority if united
aservant of servants implied a very
low degradation a servant to our
horses and dogslower than southern
slavery in fact it meant nothing but
separation or at least inferiority
the meaning of ethiopian dr cox
would find by consulting bryant is
serpent worshipper from ethi to
worship and ope a serpent this
is the right greek definition it would i
seem that when ham made his unfor
tunate progeny idolators they wori
shipped the figure and living symbol of
satan as the principle of dread and
cried eva eva in reference to
eve a rite in egypt this custom
still continues in some places in africa
adjoining liberia hence the blacks
became thus denoted

the most disgraceful and insulting

has inet our eye in a recent number of

of what is called lewiss free soil

is thus described the free states are
yellow the territories light blue and
the slaveholding states are shaded so
dark with india ink that it is difficult
to read the names of some of the

to notice by the tribune it is indeed
a matter to draw forth our indignation

ohio black laws
a very large and respectable
meeting of the colored citizens was
held on the evening of the ith ult in
the union baptist church cincinnati
for the purpose of making a demonstra
tion of feeling in reference to the re
peal of the black laws of the state of
ohio
on a motion the rev wallace
shelton was called to the chair and
james johnson rev wot p newman
john watfield wm darnes and
prince austin were appointed as vice
presidents phillip folliran james
leach secretaries
the throne of grace was addressed
by rev wm p newman after a
soulstirring song from the choir the
meeting proceeded to business
on motion a committee of five was
appointed consisting as follows john
j gaines chas m wilson reuben
r fowler lloyd l lewis john el
kins to draft business for the consider
ation of the meeting
while the committee was absent
the chairman made some happy re
marks occupying the time until it had
arrived on motion the committee
reported the following resolutions
which were adopted
wheieas the legislature of ohio
has in its wisdom repealed the black
laws so injurious to us as a class dis
graceful to the state and repugnant to
the liberal progressive spirit of the age
and
whereas said repeal will conduce
greatly to the interest happiuess and
prosperity of nativeborn colored ame
ricans and add to the fair fame of this
great commonwealth therefore
resolved that we return our sin
cere thanks to the general assembly of
the state of ohio for the consummation
of so praiseworthy an act
resolved that our thanks are espe
cially and peculiarly due to messrs
dr townsend morse and swift and
the handful of free soilers who are as
a balancewheel between the two great
parties of the state for the noble stand
they took in the contest believing the
black would not have been re
pealed in the present session of the
legislature without this cooperation
resolved that we sincerely regret
the amendments attached to the bill
excluding us from the benefit of the
poor lawnot because we are pau
pers or likely to become such but for
reason of its unjustness and its ten
dency towards that prejudice that has
been so powerfully against us in this
the land of our birth
resolved that we deem it a duty
which we owe to our god ourselves
and our country to use all honorable
lawful means in our power for the re
peal of all laws rules or regulations j
that make a distinction on account of
color
resolved that we recommend to
the officiating ministers in the several
colored churches to set apart sunday
the th of this mooth lor the purpose
of returning thanks to god for the re
peal of the laws and a discourse on
the general condition of our people
resolved that we earnestly and
affectionately entreat our brethren here
and elsewhere throughout the slate to
be as they ever have beenloyal sub

that it is our deliberate and solemn
conviction that the lasting prosperity

will be promoted by such changes in
the constitution as will gradually abol

that primary meetings and free
open and manly discussion be held and
had in every part of the common
wealth that a delegate convention
be held at a future day to consider the
best means of concentrating public
opinion on the subject of emancipation
that the subject belongs exclusively
to the citizens of their own state and
they deprecate the interference of all

the substitute and resolutions of the

j the lecturing fiel d that the antislavery opet
ator comes in contact with the patient and has
the most abundant opportunities for measuring
the pulse and fully acquainting himself with
the nature and extent of the disease which he
seeks to remove here the malignant spirii
of slavery is constantly developing itself tc
public view so that he must be a dull am
slothful observer who fails to read new lesson
of antislavery wisdom from such an expe
rience shut up in the narrow limits of th
editorial sanctum poring over books an
newspapers may be a good place to learn thi
more subtle forms w hich the proslavery demoi
assumes but the lecturing held is the stag
upon which to get a more vigorous idea o
the monster throwing aside the mantle o
learning and lefinefoent disdaining all iogi
and philosophy he shows himself in ail hi
huge ugliness here you luav find the raw
material of proslavety unadorned by th
uilded accompaniments which the dark spiri
assumes in the press and the pulpit yo
get here the teal barioom bluster ta
and leathers ride him out on a rail
ought to be hungthe ruggers ough

his usual calm but feeling manner with re
spect to the foul treachery and ruinous

attention and interest throughout and we
hope they will prove to be good seed sown in

were appointed hereafternoon and evening
about a bakers dosen assembled in the bap
tist vestry in he afternoon and were address
ed by friend jacohs and mys if the audt
ence was very respectable in the evening bui
very little impression was made upon them
there wasnot antislavery ennngh in town
j to give a lecturer on slavery a nights lodging
there is a plenty of piety and whiggery
here but no hospitality or antislavery we
went to the tavern and after being told by the
keeper that niggers were better off in
slavery and that we were only making theit
condition worse by lecturing against slave
holidng and that we ought to mind our owi
business c c we went to bed u
and dressed in the morning we were callec
to the table to breakfast and to our surprise
our landlord seated us at the table with hii
i white family and boarders making no di
tinction we found his practice better that
his theory
friday feb thlimathere was n
meeting appointed in this place we callei
ulon several abolitionists all of whom seem
ed glad to see us and expressed a wish tha
we should visit lima again as well as
willingness to get us up a meeting but noth

religious meetings in progress an interestinj

 were postponed here i parted with ftiem

seventy persons present yet the meeting wa
a most effective one and a deep interest wa
dxcited a revival was in prepress here am
siime efforts had been made to keep persom

s ound that sueh meetings are injurious t
the cause of religion when will men lean

less
sunday feb thcanandaiguaherj
meetings had been appointed for usfoe
noon afternoon and evening we were una
me to reach there in time for the forenooi
meeting and the time was occupied we wer
told in listening to a sermon from rev mr
whitney the ministei of the church in whicl
we were expected to speak on reaching th
meetinghouse we found it densely provided
and many were standing on the outside una
hie to gain admission the sight was heart
cheering we were there in time to see th
congregation leaving and ihus to assure then
of our presence in the afternoon at twi
oclock the house was densely crowded will
a most respectable and intelligent audience
 it was a pleasure to speak to such persons
the meet ng in the evening was even mor
j lensely packed than that in the afternoon
both were highly satisfactory to the hearts o
humble laborers in the cause of human free
dom our readers will be disposed tr marve
at the fact that a christian church could bt
thrown open on the sabbath day with the
sanction and encouragement of a christian
minister for the purpose of hearing the cam
of the slave pleaded by two unlearned and
despised fugitive slaves for it is a marvellous
fact demanding explanation the rev mr
whitney the gentleman wbote pulpit we
occupied was not long since the favored pas
tor of the large baptist church in canan
daigua and probably would have remained
such until now but for his devotion to god
and humanity he saw tbe sufferings of tbe
amenean bondman the deep responsibility ol
the church and tbe ministry for slavery their
cold and heartless indiffereree toward the
antislavery cause and unable to keep si
lence or to preach abstract righteousness
longer he opened bis mouth fur tbe dumb
and poured upon the unwilling ears of bu
pious congregation a fiery stream of anu
slavery truth his church could not stand
it his reasoning of righteousness and of
judgment to come was painful to them sod
they would not bear it they counselled
among themselves how to destroy him and
finally succeeded in getting a majority against
him and ejecting him from the pulpit bo 
in doing this they drove off with him some of
tbe purest and best of tbe flock and they
itand byhim until now receiving the pure

antislavery assemblage in bringing toge

of those engaged in the antislavery move

hought it very improper for us to talk about

neat little meetinghouse on ford street i
is one of the few colored churches who
doors are always opened with alacrity to ih

most of the person who attend there an
colored and we have therefore no hesitation
in giving the trustees and member our heart
good wishes r d
the rams horn stales that we have
taken the lecturing field for six months this
is a mistake but one in keeping with tho
w hich that print usually makes when speak

the antislavery bugle calls upon us
to show that the american constitution is noi
a covenant with death why it should
call upon us for such an explanation we are
at a loss to know especially as the editor

to correspondentswe have many
letters on file for publication which shall ap
pear just so soon as we can find room for
them we advie those who write for this
paper to condense their lucubrations as much
as possible where there are many to speak
and all wish to be heardand space is narrow
it is needful that all should lie brief and to
the point read over your composition
many times not for the purpose of ascertain
ing where you may put in a void hut to sec
where one may le left out many of us
have something to say and would say it but
that we are prone to block up the gangway
with whole barricades of words you have
a high example of brevity in the inaugural
address of general taylor which we pub
lish in another column though not a tenth
as lengthy as those of his modem prede
cessors it is as much an inaugural address a
theirs

frederick douglass i arrived in pitts
burg on wednesday the th inst having
crossed the mountains in perhaps as cold i
weather as was experienced on the
tops these mountains though common
every traveller from eastern to western penn
sylvania and familiar to all who have siudiedj
geography yet they are so novel and ioj
mantic in their appearance and arrangement
and withal so tedids to travel that a cursory
description of them here may not he amiss
though i have crossed them frequently in the
course of seventeen years and the fourth and
last time in the last five months
the alleghany mountains on this portion
of the pennsylvania improvements the penn
aylvania turnpike consist of a continuous
and contiguous range of seven mountains and
thirteen summits in a distance of eightysix
miles commencing at london fourteen miles
vest of chimbeisburg the terminus of the
philadelphia railroad and half way between
philadelphia and pittsburgh
first and second in rank of elevation is the
cove mountain seven miles from foot to fool
pcond the scrub ridge composed of six
summits or elevated points and ten miles
across third sidling hill three and a half
miles from foot to foot fourth llavs hill
two and a half miles fifth the alleghany
mountain fouiteen mill  across the greatest
and first in rank of elevation and vastness
sixth laurel hill the third in tank six miles
across and seventh and last chesnut
rtdge the most westerly fivo miles from
foot to foot and fortyfive miles east of
pittsburgh
in some cases the fool of one mountair
commences immediately at the foot of th
other as is the case with the cove mountain
and scrub ridge scrub ridge and sidling j
hill sidling and rays hill but a verv j
narrow vallew between them and where this i
is not the ease iheie are many little promi j
nences and rugged hills coursing along be
tween the mountains in the valleys so that
the plains are broken and undulated making
the travel one continuous ascension and d
scension from the time you strike the foot o
the first mountain untii you leave the base o
the last many are the scenes throughout th
whole course of these vast mountains am
valleysbeautiful picturesque grand and
sublime well worthy the pencil of the mo
accomplished artist in summer when clothe
with foliage and verdure the scenery is be
yond the most graphic description it m
worth the trip to thoe who have the means
to travel as the tediousness is lost in contem
plation of the scenery around the oul may
here expand in the magnitude of its nature
and soar to the extent of human susceptibility

fully appreciate my existence as a man u

philadelphia is a very important point and
field of labor there being an interesting popu

bearing upon the character arid deeiiny of the
whole colored people of the country there
is mucli work to be done among the people ol
this great city there are neverending
fields the harvests of which are lipe but
the laborers are few here is an arena for
the young people women and men the moral
and intelligent of whom could not better do
the will of god and subserve the cause of
suffering humanity than give a portion of
their spare time and there are those who
have much time to dispose of in visiting ad
vising distributing tracts and otherwise ad
ministering to the necessities of the numerous j
needy of that extensive city
the subject of tracts  introduced three i
yeais ago in philadelphia and again recently
w hich i am in hopes may arrest the attention j
of our people a tract association as soon j
as possible should be formed and subjects
adapted to our condition and wants treated j
upon the self elevation of bur people
should be made the leading topic of their con

to say hereafter in another position
there are several good select schools in this j
city for colored youth among which that ot

venient to come by this way then being at
wheeling va this appeared to be glory
enough for the people of the smoky city
even that he had condescended to notice them
hence the filing of cannon in honor of his
refusal the force of his noncompliance
may be the better realized when it is known
ihat on his way up the river he was particular
to stop at all slaveholding intermediate ports
going out of his way several hundred miles
ip the cumberland river to nashville and
down again cincinnati i believe was the
nly free town he honored with a visit on
his way up
such was the infatuation and emhosiasm
said to have been manifested on the occasion
of his approach that at memphis tennone
man had his arm shot off at louisville ky
ne man lust his life at cincinnati there
was one wounded at covington ky one
had an arm shot off at nashville ky an
other lt an arm on arriving at captina
a the ice not permitting the steamet to as
cend further up a sleigh was apptopriated for
nis special use when passing along al
though four men held two on each side to
prevent accident such was the wish to see
him that the sleigh was upset and the gen
eral tumbled beelsoverhead down a preci
cipice of a few feet not sufficientto do seri
ous injury but enough to frighten the brave
old hero of three hundred slaves and a miss
issippi cottonplantation and make the whole
thing ridiculous and slightly injure him
hence his letter to hon walter forward
that night sent to wheeling that in conse
quence of an accident and injury received 
he was unable to visit pittsburgh at pres
ent i suppose at the moment when the old
nonsurrender was tumbling over the declivity
he felt more like going to than giving
the mexicans hell it is also said that such
was the crowd upon the boat in which he
came passenger to captina that the provisions
were all consumed actually depriving the
president of three meals thus did they not
only show their high regard and love for the
general by killing several persons but were
well nigh killing him by starvation and dash
ing him to pieces
the extent to which the american people
carry this glorification of military crusaders
is beyond a parallel except in the days of
roman extravaganza w hich was but a fore
boding of the end of her glory and speedy
downfall of that haughty insolent empire
and commonwealth the extent to which
this homage is carried ceases to be respeciful
since it is neither kind nor complimentary
but like the homage of the serf to the noble
or the vassal to his lord it is ludicrous it is
unfit for fteemen and only worthy of slaves
it is a flagrant outrage upon common sense
and propriety
i intend to hold a series of meetings among
the colored citizens here and shall write once
more previous to my setting out for roches
ter when i shall give you an account of the
state and condition of people and things about

  took charge of the school  think
the first week in july and was elected a
member of the ex committee and its secre
tary in that month as sooo as i bad tune
i examined the books ac and the aoeoonta
of the agents particularly which i believe
was within some three or fotnr months after
these i found anything bat satisfactory
hence i introduced certain resolutions in the
ex committee forbidding the agents to beg
anything more until they had settled up their
accounts ac and published to the world
what they were doing i urged the calling
home of mr hanson who was then in the
east and the language of one of the resolu
tions was the agents are doing what no
body knows bat themselves these resolu
tions were adopted by the ex committee
and entered on their book the committee
instructed roe to call mr henson home and
i did so by writing to j w alden of bos
ton as i did not know where a letter would
reach him so much for sostaining the cause
but further w hen my first yeai expired
there the agents had not settled their accounts
satisfactory to me and when the ex com
mittee wanted me to teach another year i
told them i would not for it was my fixed and
settled purpose to leave as soon as they would
or rather could settle their business and
make a fair and honorable report to the pub
lic will mr wilson or the cammiueedeny
this   was dissatisfied from the time
found out how things were till the time
left with their management if they deny
it let them say so being unable to get
ihings tight the trustees met in september
 at which time i presented my resigna
tion a copy of which i here give
to the ex committee and trustees of the
british american institute
gextlemen i herein present you ray res
ignation as a teacher in your institution 
do it because of your present administration
and in view of the unchristian and murderous
treatment i received a few days since from
one with whom i am associated  cannot
and will not consent to be recreant to tn
trust and treacherous to the cause of god
aid the poor to please my persecutor mr

things i sustained the curse the murderous
conduct referred to was mr josiah hensonv
threatening to cut my throat knife in hand
he got on his knees in thpresence of the
trustees and begged my forgiveness and 
trad hardly said i forgive you before he
put at me again like a bon at the request
of the trustees and committee i took back
my resignation and remained in connection
wth the institution about one month after
 when the influence of mr henson broke up
i the school myself and mr wilson were
then misrepresented to the trustees by a
traitor things not being settled and that re
sulting in my leaving the institution instantly
thus my nearly two years connection with
the institution turns out to be about fifteen
months and two of them spent in labor to
overthrow the cutse  mr wilson says
i am furnishing instruction to rising of 
scholars he should have told the public
that these are the children of the neighbor
hood or at any rate tourfifths of them are
and the rest the youth of the settlement and
not strangers from afar as he would have us
to he should have added also that
the parents of these are and always have been
charged tuition for the instruction their child
ren received at dawn these scholars are
no charge to the public for they board at
home they hve not and do not receive any
of the  w hich has been given for their
education and support  i said in the arti
cle referred tu that was in the christian cot

truth is they have received over  in
cash clothing e thousands of this were
begged in the name of the commod schools in
different parts of the province but they have
not received oo in caeh clothing tic for
five years past and much of the clothing
was begged for gratuitous distribution among
the poor but they did not get it as they know
and will say nor did the missonaties laboring
in different parts of the province get it dots
mr wilson deny this let bira say so
 mr wilson says i have been eyes to

simply say that those who have received eyes

ward a project of law for entirely dosing the

serably negatived the project by a majniity of

course represent it as a mere trick of the

would appear that a majority of the assembly
thought otherwise knowing that they no i
longer represent the feeling of the majority
of their constituents they voted the second
reading of a bill to dissolve themselves a short
time hence by a majority of four hundred and
sixteen to four hundred and five the min
isters informed the assembly that ramifica

of france and they stale that they considei
themselves to have been saved from a desper

with which general changarnier the com
mander of paris made his preventive disposi
tions he did more than all have done before
himhe so employed the means at his dispo
sal as to render insurrection in the capital m
a military point of view impossible
the conduct of the president of france
has by no means justified the evil foreboding
entertained by the many on his elevation to
that high office he resolutely refused to
abandon his ministry when it was very evi
dent that except he severed himself from
them if ihey fell he must fall also at the

sufferings of nonconformists in 
never not even under the tyranny
of laud had the condition of thej
puritans been so deplorable as at that
time never had spies been so active
y employed in detecting congregations
never had magistrates grand jurors
rectors and churchwardens been sol
much on the alert many dissentersj
were cited before the ecclesiastical j
courts others found it necessary to
purchase the connivance of the agents
of the government by presents of hogsj
heads of wine and of gloves stuffed
with guineas it was impossible for
all the sectaries to pray together with
out precautions such as are employed
by coiners and receivers of stolen
foods the places of meeting were
requently changed worship was per
formed sometimes just before break of
day and sometimes at dead of night
hound the building where the little
flock was gathered together sentinels
were posted to give tbe alarm if a
stranger drew near the minister in
disguise was introduced through the
garden and the back yard in some
houses there were trapdoors through
which in case of danger he might
descend where nonconformists lived
next door to each other the walls were
often broken open and secret passages j
were made from dwelling to dwelling j
no psalm was sung and many con
trivances were used to prevent the voice
of the preacher in his moments of
fervour from being heard beyond the
walls yet with all this care it was
often found impossible to elude the vigi
lance of informers in the suburbs of i
london especially the law was enj
forced with the utmost rigor several j
opulent gentlemen were accused ol j
holding conventieles their houses
were strictly searched and distresses
were levied to the amount of many j
thousands of pounds the fiercer and
bolder sectaries thus driven from the
shelter of roofs met in the open air
and determined to repel force by force
a middlesex justice who had learned
that a nightly prayer meeting was held
in a gravel pit about two miles from j
london took with him a strong body
of constables broke in upon tic as
sembly and seized the preacher but
the congregation which consisted of
about two hundred men soon rescued
their pastor and put the magistrate and
his officers to flight this however
was no ordinary occurrrence in gen
eral the puritan spirit seemed to be
more effectually cowed at this conjunc
ture than at any moment before or
since the tory pamphleteers boast j
ed that not one fanatic dared to move j
tongue or pen in defence of his religi
ous opinions dissenting ministers j
however blameless in life however
eminent for learning and abilities j
could not venture to walk the streets
for fear of outrages which were not
only not repressed but encouraged by
those whose duty it was to preserve the
peace some divines of great fame j
were in prison among these was
richard baxter otheis who had
during a quarter of a century borne
up against oppression now lost heart
and quitted the kingdom among these
was john howe great numbers of
persons who had been accustomed to
frequent conventicles repaired to the
parish churches it was remarked
that the schismatics who had been ter
rified into this show of conformity
might easily be distinguished by the
difficulty which they had in finding out

the pennsylvanian copies from the
new york sunday times with ap
parent satisfaction an article upon the
slave trade in constantinople
which concludes with the following
paragraph
here we see the reverse of the
picture the black brutal master selling
the white beautiful slave and not a
christian voice is raised against the l
deep damnation of such an act the
sympathetic english so anxious to
abolish african slaverythe free soil
american so mad for the freedom of
the blackshave not a word to say a
hand to lift or voice to implore for 
white christian female slavery among
the mahometans who remonstrates
with the turks against this barbarity
who demands that the slavery of w hite
females shall cease in the east no
noe we show off our sympathy at
home wheae it is not needed this is
the world
have you then o wise editors dis
covered that we have a right to inter
fere with the peculiar institutions
of turkey and to remonstrate against
the barbaiity and deep damna
tion of selling ichite christian fe
males as slaves we had not looked
for such dangerous confessions from
you your rashness surprises us
gentlemen are you not aware that
the blows you strike against turkish
slavery fall heavier on the same system
in america when we follow your
lead and have roused the world with
an agitation against the social rela
tions of master and slave in turkey
what is to be the fate of our own slave 
system do you think it will endure
the moral earthquake which opens the
prison doors in constantinople your
southern masters will not thank you for
fulminating damnation against their
practices nor for teaching us such
incendiary iessoijs nor for abusing their
respectable allies almost the only
supporters they have in other nationsi
the turkish slave traffickers they
will fear though you do reverse the
old proverb and teach us to begin our
charity in turkey instead of at
home that it will not end there that
in casting your firebrands across the
atlantic to destroy mohammedan sla
very some sparks will fall into their
own system and explode it is highly
impudent in you to denounce even in
directly the barbarity of our liege
lords the harem keepers of the south
and they bare good reason to arraign
you for plantation mutiny call you
this backing your friends it will not
avail you to say you have not designed
your words to apply to new orleans and
washington traders in white christian
females for the practice is as bar
barous and damnable on tbe miss
issippi and potomac as on the
bosphorus and like the lawyer of old
they may exclaim thus saying yon
condemn us also we thank yon for
the implied acknowledgement that it is
our right and doty to condemn and de
nounce barbarities without regard
to national limits however you may
have intended to smite us your hand
falls alone upon slavery we are
encouraged to apply ourselves with
new zeal to pluck the beam of slavery
from the eyes of our own nation thatj
we may see clearly to take tbe motes
of oppression from the eyes of others

an egyptian magician
being myself a very good mesmeric
subject i asked one of my friends to
tell the old man that i had seen curi
ous things done in england and knew
the truth of such clarivoyance as he
professed to show and that i would
take the boys place i knew he would
refuse and plead some good reasons
against it but i desired my friend to
take no refusal the old man pres
ently said i might do as  liked but be
did not think it would succeed more
charms and incense were burned my
hand was duly scoured with ink and
the usual pool poured into the palm
and i faithfully gazed into it in two
minutes the sensation came though
there was no hand upon my head the
magician is a powerful and no doubt
unconscious mesmeriser presently i
began to see such odd things in the
pool of inkit grew so large before my
aching eyes and showed such strange
moving shadows and clear symmetrical
figures and intersecting lines that i
felt uncertain how bng i could com
mand my thoughts and words and
considering the number of strangers
present i thought it more prudent to
shake off the influence while i could
than to pursne the experiment the
perfumes might have some effect
though i was insensible to them and
so might the dead silence and iny
steadfast gazing into the ink but there
was also a strong mesmeric influence
present lam certain i hope it will
not be long before some satisfactory
course of mesmeric experiment like
that so triumphantly pursued by dr

anecdote of lamb coleridge
says de quincey told me of a
ludicrous embarrissment which charles
lambs stammering caused him at
hastings lamb had been medically
advised to a course of seabathing and
accordingly at the door of his bathing
machine whilst he stood shivering with
cold two stout fellows laid hold of him
one at each shoulder like heraldric
supporters they waited for the word of
command from their principal who
began the following oration to them
hear me men take notice of this
i am to be dipped what more he
would have said is unknown to the
land or seabathing machinist for
having reached the word dipped he
i commenced such a rolling fire of li
dididi that when at length he des
 cended a plomb upon the full word
dipped the two men rather tired of the
j long suspense became satisfied that
they had reached what lawyers call the
operativeclause of the sentence and
i both exclaiming at once oh yes sir
were quite aware of that down they
plunged him into the sea on emerg
ing lamb sobbed so much from the
cold that he found no voice suitable to
his indignation from necessity ne
seemed tranquil and again addressing
the men who stood respectfully listen
ing he began thus men is it pos
sible to obtain your attentionoh
surely sir by all means then listen
once more i tell you i am to be didi
di and then with a burst of in
dignation dipped i tell you oh
decidedly sirand down the stam
merer went for the second time petri
fied with cold and wrath once more
lamb made a feeble attempt at expla
nationgrant me pa pa patience
iis it mumum murder you meme
mean again and agaga
gain i tell you im to be dididi
dipped now speaking furiously with
the voice of an injured man oh yes
sir the men replied we know that
we fully understand it and for the
third time down went lamb into the
sea oh limbs of satan he said
on coming up for the third time its
now too late to tell you that i ainno

an indian expedient while a
man and his family a wife and several
children in a small canoe were cros
sing a large bay a shark rose near his
canoe and after reconnoitring a short
time swam towards it and endeavored
to upset it the size of the canoe
however rendered this impossible so
the ferocious monster actually began
to break it to pieces by rushing forci
bly against it the indian fired at the
shark when he first saw it but without
effect and not having time to reload
he seized his paddle and mode for the
shore the canoe however from the
repeated attacks of the fish soon be
came leaky and it was evident that
in a few minutes more the whole party
would be at the mercy of the infuriated
monster in this extremity the indian
took up his youngest child an infant
of a few months old and dropped it
overboard and while the share was
devouring it the rest of the party

experience the poet can no more
write without having suffered and
thought than the bird can fly in an

chords of ths everlasting harp before he
can draw sweet music from it but he
can draw sweet music from it but he
cannot play while he is learning he
cannot write while his heart is bleeding
if he attempts it he will but utter inco
herent sobs he must wait until that
suffering has passed into memory
there it will work fortifying the soul
with its examples not tearing it with
thorns he must wait till suffering be
come spiritualized by losing a portion
of tbe sensual pain before he can
transmute it into poetry because in the
divine world of art all is ideal even
tears and in its battles no real blood
flows from the wounded soldier but

icj ohe jam satis we say to the
washington agitators of slavery we
have had enough of it go to work
gabble prate do anything but talk the
week in and the week out upon slavery
slavery for breakfast slavery for din
ner and slavery for supper is a little
too much even of a good thing and
much less of that which in itself is
goott for nothing and which in its
constant repetition and agitation would
become nauseous if ever so good
the taste wearies upon one ever re
curring topic congress ceases to be
interesting when there is no novelty in
its scenes and when its speeches may
be stereotyped day after dayn y
express
we have not had enough of it and
we shall continue to have more and
more until slavery is abolished from
the capital and our country and from
our world we cannot have too much
of a good thing especially when that

in answer to the question who is to
blame for the recent outburst of
rowdyism in new york occasioned by
the prize fight says
we answer the men who reward
fighters with office tom hyers fight
with sullivan was almost infinitely more
honorable than our recent natinnal
fisticuff with ivrexico there was a
semblance of justice and fairness about
it the national melee was dastardly
yet the chief victor of such a fight is
held up to the multitudes by statesmen
and divines as having in that very war
achieved a glory which entitles him to
the highest honor and most important
trust in the nation this rowdyism at
tendant upon the hyer and sullivan
affair is precisely the whirlwind which
we are reaping for having sowed rough
and readyism to talk of checking
this evil by legislating penalties against
prize fights is quite stupid our whig
legislators cannot possibly from the
nature of the case do any such thing
they have estopped themselves by
supporting a national pugilist for the
presidency
hero worship the inconsisten
cy of man is vast people who cond
demn hyer and sullivan which they
are abstractedly right in doing are
ready to fall down and worship one
who has rode in triumph over some
famous slaughterfield and cut his name
with his sword into the surface of the
earth so deep that nothing save a great
physical convulsion can record all
creation owns the warrior and the
great mass of mankind like dlsraelis
sidonia worships the lord of hosts
and a man is sure of success in this
world in precisely the same proportion
that he has to use jean pauls idea

glass to the overful system of mankind
wellington would carry the day in a
peace society itself against jay and
all his supporters napoleon would
not have been the less an able man
had he never pulverized the austrians
in italy but it was owing to that pul
verizing that he became chief of
france and was enable to flax ont
all the kings and rulers of europe
the surest road to civil success in this
country is straight across the bloodiest
battleground that can be scared up
and we would back a frontiers man
who had killed his indian against
webster or calhoun or clay or cass
any day in the year the highly res
pectable gentleman who is now on the
eve of entering tbe presidency owes
his promotion to his most undoubted
pluck to his display of gamey
qualities in the mexican war in which
he destroyed every general that had the
audacity to enter the ring against him
