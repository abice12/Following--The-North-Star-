the form of modern governments is
not submitted to discussion all admit
it or all bow to it it is giv n us by the
very fact of our civilization it is the
free form the critical government of
discussion of common consent it is
the republic as we have seen before
but the mixed republic with many
bodies with one sole head republic at
its base monarchy at its summit the
need of unity in action and of a more
rapid and intense regulating power in
our vast modern states the necessity o
avoiding the frequent commotions that
the conquest of the supreme power
would produce in the state lias made
us for a long period consecrate this
fictitious and conventional royalty in an
hereditary chief call him president
or call him king it matters little he i
no monarch he has no sole no person
al power he lias a betterhe has the
social power centred in him he is
organ and agent he is no more he can
no more be the source and principle ol
authority his rights over us our du
ties towards him thus change natures
and titles we no longer adore power a
aucred and divine we discuss it as
logic we respect it as law
this accepted formand we niusl
accept it or quit the world or retro
grade in time or revolt against civili
zation itself and curse our own light
in order to take refuge under the shad
ow of others rights in slaverythi
form then accepted all which wil
tend to perfect and extend it all dial
shall b e more confirmable its nature
whether liberty discussion common
consent suffrage equality of s icial and
private rights will be true policy it
is then we shall have to march onwards
with confidence and courage sure that
the more we have conquered conse
quences ot a just and true principle
xhe more those consequences will pro
duce others and the more fruit these
prolific social truths will produce to hu
manity
apply this intellectual rule to the fla
grant questions of the day ami confront
them
the peerage or hereditary aristo
cratic power triple impossibility of

to say to the equal repartition of poli

justify before reason for it is an exclu

privilege m an of equality a con

would be a constituted impossibility a
creation without elements condemned
by conscience for it would be ravish
from all what all should possess and
exercise in order to invest a small
number with it posthumous tyranny
which could neither serve nor hurt
which could not maintain itself t n
years before the corrosive and rational
criticism of the press that new jury of

alarm the present by a shadow withou
hubetance mid serve tor a laughing

do not see in this more than a lons
and profound conviction of the impossi

a crime against the progressive truth
which manifests itself as it will when

been free before this epoch of the
world the world would now possess a
treasure of truth and of science which
would have augmented in equal propor

virtue for all truth fertilizes virtue by
its rays the divine word itself
christian truth the most social of all
truths has only been taught in spite
of men m the catacombs upon the
cross or at the stake had it been
free that sublime teaching would in a
few uges have traversed the whole
earth which it has nut yet traversed in

the separation or church and

cessity of an epoch where the power
belongs to all and not to some incon
testable for under u free and univer

exclusive and privileged happv be
cause religion has force and beauty
and virtue ouly in conscience it is
beautiful it is pure it is holy only be
tween man aud his god between the
faith and the priest between the priest
and the faithful nothing is wanted if
the state interposes between man and
that divine ray which he should seek
only in heaven it obscures or alter it
religion then becomes something palpa
ble and material for man thrown to or
withheld from him at the caprice of all
tyrannies it partakes of the love or
the hate which human power inspires
varying or falling with it it is the sa

corruptions of courts mid the impurities
right is of no stxtruth is of no color god is the fattier of us all and all we are brethren
of public places it is the word of life
n a dead mouth buying and selling in
the temple this system makes hypo
rites when the state is christian un

or martyrs when it is persecuting but
enough on tiiis subject a voice is
suing from the temple a voice which

without clearing the soil with the iron
we do not graft the bough without tear

election there is no truth in
in dern social or representative power
unless there be truth in the election
and there is no truth in the election un
less it be universal however if you
give suffrage to classes who compre
hend it not or who cannot exercise it
with independence you give a mere
figment that is to say you really re
fuse it several opinions issuing from
opposite points and wishing to attain a
contrary aim are demanding in con
cert universal suffrage one of the two
parties is assuredly mistaken for both
though demanding the same means cer
tainly do not wish the same result is
there light is there bona fuies in both
of these opinions necessarily one or
other is in error
this is the gravest question in the
organization at once free and vital
w hich this century must establish we
would solve it thus universal suffrage
to be true proportional suffrage to be
just we have already seen that an
hereditary peerage or a moderate aris
tocracy does not and cannct exist on
the levelled soil of the epoch and the
country we went farther we proved
that it could not subsist cither in logic
or morality society throughout has
in effect conservative interests which
it has always been an object to consti
tute or to incorporate into a second
chamber when the elements of this
second chamber are present it is well
but today in france vjhere these ele
ments are dissolved you are invincibly
led to one sole national representation
inasmuch a a political power should be
a truth and can only represent and re
alize what it is whether you make it
speak at two tribunes or at one is of
little moment your national represent
ation necessarily one should represent
at once social movement and stability
great middling and small properties
the interests of action and of repose
it should represent them in their sincere
reality proportion and combination
to attain this vigorous veraciousness j
this rigorous justice there is only one
meansthe proportional suffrage so
long as you do not arrive at that easy
realization france will neither pro
gress nor repose she will be agitated
without advancingshe will fall she
will rise to fall again proportional
and universal suffragethat is to say a
suffrage which starting at the lowest
steps of civic and landed lights the
sole means of establishing the exist
encethe rights and interests of the
citizen will rise by degrees to the most
elevated steps in the ladder and will
cause a real expression of his real po
litical importance to bo given to every
one by a vote in the true measure and
exact proportion of his social exist
ence perfect veracity rigorous jus
tice complete democracy and still
aristocracy de facto also recognized
suffrage in several scaes al ne resolves
this problem all the political unities
would have their suffrage in it eleva
ting purifyng enlightening themselves
in succession until the supreme elec
tion exact product of the forces the
rights and the interests of the time and
the country there is only one objec
tion to this system the country of to
day objects to it because it has once
made a ridiculous trial of it and also
let us say because it is not sufficiently
fond of political truthfulness but what
are antipathies brought face to face
with truth the one falls and is blotted
out the other increases and survives
we s all come to that

government it has not hitherto
fully comprehended either its basis its
mission or its path three ministers
have been appointed the first saw in
the catastrophe of july a dynastic ac
cident only of which the progressive
spirit of the epoch would take no ac
count he thought he saw in it only men
to be changed ciphers to be expunged
escutcheons to be remodeled men of
merit talent and light for fifteen years
of opposition were taken unawares by
this great day their system all made
waa nst cut to ttae fttefcon of the age
they have become great since their faff
by eloquence and energy the second
sought for unpopularity wild beast
which caresses you so long as you have
men or principles to toss to it that
minister fell powerless before that popu
larity which was commencing to roar
he made a generous movement against
it the day of the trial of charles
the tenths ministers he offered his life
for theirs that day does honor to him
as he d ies lion r to france
the third comprehended the euro
pean crisis foreign affairs wonderfully
in making treaties those written ethics
of nations respected he prevented uni
versal war to whomsoever that knotvs
the actual condition of europe univer
sal war is the final european cataclysm
he who shall throw open the folds of its
cloak will assume the responsibility of
an age of chaos of murder of blood
and servitude he will do what belgium
and holland would do were they to
overthrow their dvkes and to open a
way to the ocean nationalities and in
dividuals liberties and principlesfriends
and enemieseverything would be en
gulphed
now there was no sufficient need to
rush on these terrible risks belgium
was constituted more for than against

landsublime resurrection of a nation
ality which csnnot be extinguished
tardy but heroic protestation of right
sacrificed by europe france shame
ful accomplice in her severance at an
other epoch france which has no
booty but only blood to render back
bad doubtless the right to recognize tbe
fact of her resurrection for it is always
allowable to live again the date of a
political crime does not constitute a
right against the victim t here is no
prescription against a people who will
and can rise from their sepulchre but
if france had this right of acknowledg
ment and succor sho had also the right
and the duty to bide her own time
her national sympathy for polish hero
ism did not impose on her government
the necessity probably inopportune of
blindly precipitating her into the chan
ces of an universal collision govern
ments are the tutors of the people the
tutors of europe in that capacity they
may have to resist even the most gen

nity even too while sharing in them

do not think with some who wish t

the rights necessary to that existence
but that brutal law of retaliation just
so long as society was weak and im

the courage at least to try this
pression of blood iu our laws and t

to mankind to the future
but you will say to me here wha

what proportion in what measure wil
the legislature the people itself leavi
to future generations the liberties ant
institutions of which you have jus
been admitting the necessity or con

your communal your provincial youi
national rights and liberties stop
t hey will stop where public reason anc
conscience show their abuse or excess
they will extend in the proportion and
the measures of the country and the
time public reason and conscience
show their abuse and excess they will
extend in the proportion and the mea
sure of the morals of the country and
the time public reason and conscience
cannot be deceived long they have
only to confront them with morals
morals in effect are the anly basis
the indispensable condition of the laws
a strict proportion is necessary be
tween the one and the other and so
soon as this proportion is violatedso
soon as this harmony fails legislation
will be abortive it will bear no fruits
or bear only fatal ones this miscon
struction this antagonism of laws and
morals of spartan severity and sybar
ite effeminacy kills a people exami
nation reason experience and con
science are here to declare bona fide
what is instantly possible with us or
what is only attainable with the aid of
habits progress and time the press
and speech free are there in
their place carrying incessantly all
these questions before the national
grand jurybefore opinion which pro
nounces but not without appeal in a
system of majority nay more when
a liberty is ripe it will fall of course
from the tree with a puff of popular
wind upon a soil prepared to re
ceive it
here you will be astonished perhaps
not to hear ine condemn more that
which we caff centralization the com
mon abuse against which all parties
rise in concert because all seek to de
stroy none to establish not to see me
in mv turn dislocate some member of
the national union god and common
sense preserve me from buying popu
larity at such a price to ask political
liberty deliberative and elective for
all opinions for all interests for all lo
calities is in effect to destroy what
ought to be destroyedpolitical cen
tralization the oppressive influence of
a capital of a party of a class of a
man the monopoly of liberty in short
despotism such is the right tendency
of a liberal and enlightened mind ibis
is tbe work of tbe day and of the age
but to destroy administrative and exec

thought back into the members instead
of placing them strong and full in the
bead of tbe state to break tbe ixcc

operated after all by the constituent
assembly ia the only monument that
the revolution founded nth all the rum
it made that intensity of strength in
that uniformity of action which enable
social thought once freely conceivcc
and become law to be executed at thi
same moment with celerity regularity
control and uniformity in all th
spheres of the administration of a vast
state is the unity of those great bodies
j which we caff a nation if you destroy
it they perish or that unity recon
structs itself in spite of you for it h
i their life and the dissolution of this
unity or of this centralization is death
let the soul of the social body that
is to say political thought and action
be free expansive able to prove them
selves speaking and acting everywhere
let them be no more enchained as they
have been hitherto to ne caprice of a
tyrannical bureaucracy to the delirium
of a capital in revolt sport of a tribune
or of a faction let them have their
power and their point of support in
themselves and upon themselvesupon
the powers the interests the opinions
of communes aad of prov inces but let
the natioul administration be one
one in its form one in its action let
all the strings of the governmental ma
chine act on a single centre where
they receive impulse power and regu

lies entirely in the perfection of this
i system of unity or centralization the

statistics of tiie war
we take this appalling account ol
the awful mortality in mexico by war
and pestilence from the new orleans
bulletin of the st ult
the whole number of americans
that were killed in the recent war in
eluding the line of the rio grande and
j that of vera cruz is estimated at 
 and the wounded nt  it is impos
sible to say how many of the latter have
died in consequence of their wounds
but we should suppose not less than
one fourth say  making in all t
deaths from battle
this however bears but a small pro
portion to the number who have sunk
under disease
we state under the authority of sev
eral officers of rank that on the left
flank of the castle ofperote there are
 american graves all victims ot
disease
a still larger nurtiber perished at the
capitalthe deaths tbare for a consid
erable time were one thousand month
ly und we learn that at no time did
they fall below from  to 
the first mississippi regiment that
went out to the rio grande buried 
on the banks of that river before it ever
went into battle and finally brought
back less than one third of its number
they suffered dreadfully at buena
vista
the first and second pennsylvania
regiments recently returned went out
 strong  each they brought
home about  of their original num
berabout  fell in battle nearly
 died and about j were discharg
ed as unfit for dutyhow many of the
latter have since died is of course un
known
the third and fourth tennessee reg
iments also recently returned lost 
by deathneither of these regiments
have been in action
capt taylor of pennsylvania took
down a company of  men he brought
back seventeenhe entered the battle
of contreras with  men he brought
 out of it
the most frightful instance of mor
tality however that we have heard of
was in that gallant corps the georgia
battalion commanded by a gallant and
accomplished officer col seymour
they were considered acclimated
and actually suffered much less while
in the lower country than when march
ed into the interior on high land the
battalion went to mexico  strong i
about  actually died a large num
ber were discharged with broken down
and ruined constitutions and many of
them no doubt have since gone to their
graves and the battalion was reduced
to thirtyfour men fit for duty on one
parade when a certain company was
called that had mustered upwards of
one hundred rnen a single private an
swered to tbe call and was its sole living
representative the captain the three j
lieutenants the four sergeants and the
four corporals every commissioned
and nonconiraiioced officer were
dead
we have heard from officers of nianj
other regiments detail very similar to
those we have given above which may i
be taken as about the fair average j
haises for all the volunteer regiments
the regulars did not suffer to the same
extent
such is war and such are the re
sults over which we are called upon to
rejoice

such however is the accelerated motion u
thos who loosen their hold on truth
hut the liberty party is not extinct
few are left to hold up its standard and pre
serve it name ami honor its principles sucl
of as reside in this state have as yoi
called a state convention at cauastota
sth nihi mt it is meant that the conventioi
should be held in the county which amonj
all the counties of the laud is the banne
county of the liberty partya county
which ere that party corrupted itself ha
carried up its vote as high as eighteen hun
finda county too in which the hoods o
defection have perhaps swept off a less pro
portion of the members of the liberty party
than they have swept off in ny othei
county
piie proposed slate convention should b
largely attended from this county for th
purpose of promoting such attendance an
of strengthening each others hearts let ui
hold a county convention in peterboro oi
friday the lofli instant beginning at  a
m we choose peterboro because it like
cauastota is a place of interesting associa
tions to the abolitionists it was in canastota
that the liberty party resolved to erect
monument upon the grave of myron holley
its great founder and when thirteen yean
ago the friends of the slave were driven fron
 tica by an infuriated mob peterboro wa
the only place truthloving and brave enougl
to afford them a safe retreat peterboro is
also the place in which the liberty part
first dared ro tell the slave that he is a man
and has the rights of a man
we hope for a large convention the ti
instant we liojhj that the friends of the
poor white man as well as of the poor black
manin a w ord tin friends of righteous civil
governmentwill attend it in great numbers
among ihe speakers will be j k kigali ol
newyork who will present the cause of the
land reform parts
aside from the liberty league and land
reform party which have the same presi
dential candidate that the liberty party has
there are four political parties in the country
their real character on this subject of slavery
is to be ascertained not by looking to their
professions and boasted platforms but by
looking to their candidates
ist the presidential candidate of the
whig party is celebrated for nothing else than
recommending the use of bloodhounds in the
war of tiiis nation against the poor innocent
florida indians for his success in butcher
ing the unoffending mexicans for owning
and working without wages three hundred
of his fellowmen for confessed utter igno
rance of civil government and for having
never cast a vote
d the presidential candidate of the
deinocatic party is distinguished as a dem
agogue and as a tool of the slave power
od we come now to the presidential
candidate of the freesoil party of his
horrid past we will not speak since it is said
we fear only said that he lias repented ol
it he is indeed opposed to the extension
of slavery into the regions of which we have
robbed mexico we arc happy that he is
and because he is we warmly hope that
whigs and democrats will vote lor linn ra
ther than for cass or taylor llut he will
not lift a linger in behalf of the three millions
of american slaves and though he says
that lie would no longer veto a hill to deliver
the slaves of the district of columbia he still
thinks it inexpedient to deliver them strange
candidate this lor abolitionists abolitionists
may well rejoice in this freesoil movement
for it is a part of the effect of their own
doings and it shows that they have got the
antislavery load half way up the hill hut
to get it up the other half or even to prevent
it rolling hack to the bottom they must keep
on pulling let them pull patiently a year
or two longer and the fieesoilere also will
stand on the top of the lull and will also he
abolitionists hut no more progress will
the freesoilers make after the abolitionists
shall have gone down to them the locomo
tive is then d taehed ami both roll hack into
a common ruin
ih u remains to say that the presidential
candidate of the liberty party is not such an
almihtionist as zachary taylor nor such an
abolitionist as ljcwis cass nor such an abo
litionist as marlin van huron hut that he
is such an abolitionist as gerrit sum it

mv dear north star i secure this
my first opportunity of writing since our ab
rupt separation at midnight between monday
and  uesday th and sth of september i
j propose now to tell you of a few of the
 sights and scenes through which i have pass
ed since that parting on taking the cars
from rochester to buffalo i found them
densely crowded with passengers on their
way to the great state fair which opened on
tuesday the developments of character
among our passengers during the whole
passage from rochester to buffalo showed
conclusively that a large quantity of rare
caftle would be exhibited at the fair
j dialogues of the following description might
i be heard after leaving some of the most prom
j inent watering stations
out of scat sir you have got my seat
in the sjt you are mistaken sir i was
directed to this scat hy the conductor
out of seal sir  dont care a dn
j about that i have paid twelve dollars for
this scat and have held it ever since i left
albany and shall have it again d d quick
j too and you had better leave it
in the seal l shall do no such thing
when a seat is vacant it is as free for one
gentleman as another
out of scat l appeal to the gentleman on
the other side if i have not held this seat ever
since i left auburn the gentleman on the
other side sits silent evidently wishing to
avoid a row
in the seat a mans right to a seat ceases
w hen he leaves it and there is nothing of his
left in it to show that lie intends to return to
it again this scat was entirely vacant
when  took it
out of the scat now sir you have two
things before you you must either come out
of that seat or be dragged out for have that j
 scat i will
in the scat drag away as quick as you 
please but you may find you have got the
i wrong pig by the ear loud laughter on
the part of the passengers and cries of hold
on to your seat
the seated man having got the grin of the j
importunate upstander and there being no 
probability of gaining his seat he marchesi
peaceably into another car amid the jeers of
the surrounding passengers

passengers i certainly expected rough fate
ou board this imat and was pleasantly sur
prised to find the opfioaite hie captain and
whole slops company as wll as uie pass
engers treats myself and company with tl e
ntiut kindness and attenltoo during the
whole tup and so far as i am myself con
t rued he passed me along without charge

confess  maud affected by that change
i du wednesday morning gib sept w were

cleveland delany and myself accepted the
kind hospitality of gapt mnjvin huusclf a

chataeier of colored men at eleven oclock
the ouvcntitm meet in the vmrt i loose
there are delegates from various parts o
ohio illinois michigan new york and
canada and a fine looking set of men they
are just the sort to take the lead to the great
cause of moral aortal aud mental elevation
here i shall skip the proceedings of the con
vention as i mean to y t them
when i get under your own modcm beams in

j tag me from eating with the hungry herd at
whites who generally swarm the first table
no great degradation alter all hot still not
exactly as it ought to be my dear mr
francis who is on board in company with
mr francis has just told a gentleman who
i am aad they insist upon me to give theta
an antislavery speech a vote is takea
by which  am unanimously invited to speak
the captain himself consenting  am told
that this is the first trip of the oregon
when a colored man has been allowed a cabin
passage another oregon free soil victo
ry oh the cause is rulliog oa believing
that this was s favorable opportunity forinflu
encing the popular mind  accepted the invita
tion to make a speech the audience listen
ed to me without the slightest manifestation
of approval on the one hand or dissent on the
other the passengers were evidently stran
gers to each others views and the political
excitement now abroad and the breaking up
of the old parties made it still more difficult to
applaud or condemn for you know our north
em people are very independent and are pecw
liarly careless of public opinion during my
remarks  convicted the slaveholder of thef
and robbery and considering myself among
strangers to the antislavery subject i font
tied myself on every hand and hemmed the
slaveholder in beyond the possibility of escape
at the close of my remarks i invited any
persons who might feel disposed to question
any of my positions to avail themselves of
the opportunity of doing so for  was ready
to submit my speech to the closest examina
tion here a scene transpired which would
require the pen of a jcrrold to describe a
man rose with the most contemptuous sneer
on his face and said if there are any slave
holders on board he supposed they were
white gentlemen and it was not to be suppos
ed that any white man would condescend to
discuss this question with a nigger he
was himself a slaveholder and i had called
him a thief and a robber c at the close of
this little speech finding the passengers pleas
ed with the verdancy of the slaveholding gen
tleman i replied to his speech in a somewhat
facetious account of my gcncolagy i inform
ed the gentleman that he was much mistaken
in supposing me to be a nigger that i was but
a half negrothat my dear father was as
white as himself and if he could not conde
scend to reply to negro bloodto reply to the eu
ropean blood here the grin wascompletc
jy on the poor slaveholder i then went on
to show that he had sssumed a little too much
in presuming all slaveholders to be white
and cited cases of black men who were slave
holdersshowing that though we may differ
widely in the complexion of our skins we are
identical in the color of our morals it was
easy to see that the slaveholder felt himself
losing favor with the passeugers when i
sat down he rose again as if in utter despera
tion he stamped upon the deck and said that
he had travelled ia various parts of this nouo
try that he thought he knew something of
the public sentiment of the country and that
nothing but the actual knowledge which he
had that night acquired could have made him
believe that such sentiments and impudence
as he had heard from my lips could be tolera
ted and applauded by white men in any part
of this union the only effect produced by
tins exclamation of astonishment and chagrin
was to bring to his feet a northern man who
whined out an apology for the slaveholder
on the ground that almlitionists had not been
sufficiently careful of thefeelingsof slavehold
ersthat bad as was the condition of the
slave the poor slaveholder was in the most
unfortunate condition of the two this open
ed up another view of the subject and induce
ed a comparison of the relative condition of
the slave and uie slaveholder and led to an
interesting discussion in which a number of
the passengers participated the meeting
continued from about eight in the evening to
ten oclock and the meeting adjourned the
whole affair showed the great change going
on in tire public mind on the subject of
slavery

which would hare done discredit to no

try we fed proud to be associated and
identified with these our maligned and de
spised fellowcountry men the conreotioo
taken as a whole was tbe most satisfactory
and unexceptionable of any colored conven
tion which we ever attended whilst there
wag manifested a variety of views warmly
set forth and insisted upon by the various
speakers there was a commendable toleration
and forbearance towards each other as well
as an abnsnce of party or seetional feeling
quite surpassing say convention which we
ever attended there appeared te be but one
heart and one soul in tbe convention and that
was pervaded by one spirit every one
seemed to be deeply desirous of getting at the
best means for improving oar condition at the
north and removing every hindrance to the
emancipation of our brethien at the south
having but just returned from this conven
tion and withal quite jaded out with our la
bors during the past week we shall not be
able to give our readers that detailed account
of its proceedings which they might have ex
pected in this number of the north star
they will however be content to wait a
little longer when we assure them that an
authenticated and carefully drawn up account
of those proceedings will be speedily pub
lished by the industrious and talented secreta
ries whose able and accurate discharge of the
duties incumbent upon them commanded the
high respect and the warm gratitude of the
convention that appointed them
there was no feature of the convention
more gratifying than the spirit with which it
was regarded by the white citizens of cleve
land on these the convention exerted a
most cheering influence our day meetings
were all largely attended by white poisons
while our evening meetings were literally
thronged many being compelled to leave the
court house and the tabernaclelarge rooms
where the convention was alternately held
unable to gain admission as an indication
of the change which has taken ptace in the
public mind in reference to our people we
may state that the court actually adjourned
several hours earlier in consequence of the
court house hiving been previously engaged
to the convention this change in public
opinion and its superiority to tbe law was
frequently referred to during the interesting
discussions of the cue vss toon it will be re
raembeted that ohio is disgraced by what are
called black laws and such they are one
of those laws forbids colored men to come
into her borders without giving bonds that
they will not become paupers and a public
expense and all such persons are liable to
arrest if found in the state but here such
is the change of public opinion that we are
not only welcomed within her borders but her
law administrators throw open the doors of
her public buildings for our accommodation
we call upon slaveholders and their abettors
to mark this fact and we also call upon our
colored biethrcn to mark it and hail it as a
sign of the good time coming when
worth not complexion shall be the test
of respectability and excellence during the
whole three days of the convention we did
not hear of a single indignity offered by a
white citizen of cleveland to a colored man
it is true when we entered tbe city and went
to the new eifjgland hotel there was mani
fested on the part of the barkeeper of that
house a slight want of courtesy when ques
tioned to know if ho could accommodate us
but this treatment stopped at that hotel the
delegates who went to the american hotel
and also those who put up at the durham
house were treated with the respect and
attention commonly paid to other travellers
and we have not beard of any of the white
inmates or boarders who raised the slightest
objection to this treatment of colored persons
the dunham house one of the most orderly
and elegantly conducted hotels in the city was
peculiarly free from skin aristocracy and we
would especially recommend that house to the
attention of all the travelling friends of free
oil free men and free speech who may
chance to pass through or stop any length of
time in cleveland we are sure that they
will find in that bouse a rare combination of
those excellencies of character in the propri
etor and all connected with its management
which make a temporerary home in a hotel
pleasant and agreeable
we feel sure that the convention if its
influence shall not extend even beyond the
limits of cleveland has done a sufficient
amount of good to justify the bedding of it
but its influence will not stop there the
delegates in attendance from illinois michi
gan ohio and new york will return to the
various circles who sent them and carry to
them new zeal an increased knowledge a
firm determination to dedicate their energies
lo higher and holier objects than those to which
we as a people have been too long and too
deeply devoted they will tell them that
they can only be free whom the truth makes
free that in order to elevation ihetr lives

b  we publish in another place an address
to the liberty party of madison county new
yorknot because we agree with its senti
ments but because we desire that any class
of sbolitionists sincerely laboring for the
overthrow of slavery and all its infernal train
of ills should be fairly heard especially at
this crisis we do not sympathize with its
regrets that the old liberty party ia over
thrown but on the contrary we believe
that so far as the real and vital antislavery
sentiment of the country is concerned that
sentiment will have a better field for its opera
tion now than when subjected and hampered
by a political organization the friends of the
slave may now press their cause upon popular
attention without awakening the suspicion
that they are aiming to attain the loaves and
fishesoffice the spirit of fieedom now
swings free from the galling fetters of party
creeds and may once more devote itself to its
legitimate work of enlightening the public
mind purifying the national hearts waging
its warfare against a slaverysanctioning
church and dumbdog ministry and thus
hastening the jubilee to millions we are
however far from feeling surprise that those
who have relied so implicitly on political ac
tion for the overthrow of slavery should be
greatly aggrieved at the unceremonious swal
lowing up of the liberty organization by the
free soil party nor are we disposed to cen
sure as much as admire their tenacity in
clinging to an instrumentality from which
they hope to gain such an important result as
that of dragging the free soil party to the

he has so reported the speeches of many of

the only two speeches of all that he had
reported which did noi need such revision

resolved that at  ockx today this

temple and there merge and mingle our
selves with the state convention of the free
democracy in forming a stale organisation
and recommending candidates for slate officers
to support the buffalo platform
resolved that john p hale had onr
hearty confidence when he was nominatod
for the presidency he won our admiration
by his course in the senate and he has
secured the first place in our heart of hearts
by his magnanimous course in reference to 
the late buffido convention

hoy char lies francis adams has writ
ten a letter to the editor of the boston repub
lican explanatory of certain charges which
he made against martin van buren in a
pamphlet the object of which was to rouse
the sluggish feelings of the people of the
free states against the slaveholding plot of
the annexation of texassome passages
from which had been quoted by mr ashman
of mass with the view of damaging the free
soil movement after referring to mr van
burens letter to mr hammett of miss on
the annexation of texas which he says
cost mr van buren the nomination mr
adams proceeds m
u i need not say that my opinion of mr
van buren was changed from that day and
throughout the canvass of  as well as
since wherever i addressed my fellow citi
zens i took occasion to enlarge upon this
fact to the honor of that gentleman for
much as  still disapproved of many of his
former acts  became convinced that there
was a point beyond which he would not go
and that point had been reached in the case of
texas since that time i have watched his
course w ith anziety and not without appre
hension and occasional fluctuations of opinion
until the buffalo convention and the result
of all my observation is that he seems to me
to have done more to concentrate and rally
the friends of liberty of all parties in the
free states than all the leading members
put together of the lata whig party who
now by way of proving their zeal against
the extension of slavery advocate the claims
to the presidency of the only slaveholder in
the field

gerril smith and the antislavery
standard
messrs editors i beg a small space i
the columns of your paper in order that
may call the attention of your readers to ai
article from the pen of mr sidney howar
gay in the standard of the st of august
the article to which i refer is under th
eaption of changes and principally relate
to gerrit smith esq and is highly seasonc
with that disingenuousness and uncharitable
new for which mr gay is so remarkable
the young gentleman s remarks comroeno
well but end ungracefully hy perusing hii
article you will perceive that if for the sake
of a change mr gay raises a mortal t
the skies it is for the purpose of dragging
him down again but enough is said by wat
of introduction head for yourselves am
compare what you read with the life of thii
greathearted philanthropist the standau
admits that mr smith is an abolitionist ye
he cannot let the opportunity pass withoui
hawking at him the vulture when everso
much pressed with hunger will not destroy
its own kind hear mr gay
the tone of the first part of mr gerrii
smiths letter refreshes an old abolitionist who
is not no far carried away by the new move
ment as to forget after all even if successful
it will leave the abolition of slavery in the
states a thing to lie contended for as much as
when garrison first unfurled the banner of
immediate emancipation though we do
not agree with mr smith in his view of the
constitution and therefore can only consider
his position as an absurd one and his efforts
to establish a mlideal party upon tiie ground
of the unconstitiitioriality of slavery ns utterlt
futile yet we cannot but respect the integrity
which still maintains a position so hopeless
and the sincerity of which lie gives so strong
an evidence but should he quite persuade
us that the hope of the slave rests only in him
and his party we should indeed despair of tlic
republic wiien on reading the closing pas
sage of his letter we learn that after all the
antislavery cause is quite a secondary matter
and that the overthrow of that monoioly ol
which he is so distinguished a representative
is the direct and real road to the destruction ol
the monopoly of laborers if mr smith
thinks himself a worse man than the slave
holder his duty as a reformer is surely a plain
one and his field of labor is not only at he
own door but in ins very land office
when did mr smith place the destruction
of chattel slavery as a secondary thing to any
of the oppressions that afflict mankind in
fhe spirit of his divine master he labors to
ibreak every yoke in the midst of all his ar
duous labtgs in the cause of true reform he
has ever looked to that measure as being cal
culated to remove all kinds of slavi ry his
language is i regard land monopoly take
the world together as a far more abundant
source of suffering and debasement than is
slavery take the world together and you
will find this remark to be true in many
parts of the world where there is no chattel
slavery there do the iron heels of land mo
nopolists grind out the life of the suffering
poor behold ireland her mournful history
records volumes there is no slavery there
but the oppressions of land monopolists have
engendered a lank and haggard famine and
the famine has swept away its thousands
again let slavery be abolished in this
country and let the land and the labor mo
nopolists have three or font hundred years the
start of the emancipated and still the free
men will be heavy laden with an uphill
course before them herein lies the secret of
the trouble in the british west indies the
old slaveholders are the landholders and such
they intend to be the chains of the las
slave on earth may be broken in twain and
till while the unholy system of landlordism
prevails nations and people will mourn but
the moment that this widespread and mon
strous evil is destroyed the dawn of the gos
pel day will break forth and the world will
hare rest
but mr smith is called a a distinguished
representative of land monopoly this
charge is so utterly untrue that it is not ne
cessary to ofter a refutation there are three
or four thousand poor men in this state who
have received the gift of homes from mr
smith these and thousands of others will
testify against the charge the most of his
life has been spent in providing for the poor
long long before mr gay became the sala
ried editor of the standard did mr s be
gin in his land office and at his ow n door to
act in strict conformity with his principles
but few persons are found who will aecnse
mr smith with inconsistency llis motto is
justice equality and love to all men he
welcomes to his home men of all colors and
of all creeds lie has but one talde in his
mansion and that is spread as well for the
black man as for the whitefor the rich and
the poor some of our loudmouthed and
whilegloved philanthropists would do well to
imitate his example in this matter
mr smith is a laborious man his con
crn is how he shall make others happy llis
office is t the theatre of speculation but an
asylum for th opposed he takes a chris
tian view of avi government and he with
holds his mifirage from those who will not do

shamefully in order to dress up his new doll
lady taylor in the white robes of peace and
puritymaking him out the nations only hope
in this hour of its extreme danger he made
a weak silly speech two other speakers
followed him in the advocacy of taylors
claims one of them green of chillicothe
declared that taylor was his first choice of
of all men for the presidency c the other
speaker was carey the great temperance
lecturer from cincinnftti lie declared that
if the three parties had all put their wits
together and had got the devil to help them
they could not have selected three men more
odious to him than the three which they had
presented he also said gentlemen i
would rather vote for henry clays old boots
than to vote for general taylor in the
evening at candlelight the free soil folks
had a meeting in a large hall which was
crowded full of listeners they had three
most excellent speakers and three soulcheer
ing songs accompanied by instrumental mu
sic the speakers were messrs mills brat
ncy and shields who all did good service in
behalf of human rights in the course of his
remarks mr bratney who was the former
editor of the xenia torch light a whig pa
per said we are accused of having left
the whig party and gone off to the abolition
ists but gentlemen i have never been
identified with the abolitionists and i feel that
candor and honesty requires me to state the
reasons why i have not been and they are as
follows because i have stifled my own con
victions of duty i have warred against my
own conscience rebelled against my owm rea
son and these are the only reasons why i am
not with the abolitionists heart and soul to
night the speeches of corwin green
and carey were dissected so far as they
could be found to have any farts to them to
dissect and to include the proceedings of
the day and evening together i should count
it a most glorious tiiumph of the free soil
over the slave soil party it is a wonder
with many peisons how corwin could have
the knowledge of the tricks of slaveholders
which lus speeches in the senate display and
then kick the pail over and spill it all by
pleading with the norih to still bow the sup
ple hinges of the knee and choose a cruel
and vengeful slaveholder as their president
 his however is thought by many of cor
wins old friends in ibis region to be attribu
table to the great fact long ago discovered
that money is the root of all evil there
are persons in this neighborhood who have
hoard corwin candidly declare it as his opin
ion that there was no man but what could be
bought at some price or other and on the
same evening he declared that he distrusted
everybody and distrusted himself he has
tood very high in the estimation of his friends
in this region heretofore but it is painful now
to look upon him lie doubtless feels bad
and how could he expect any other feeling
when he has voluntarily jumped into the
great whirlpool of slavery where he cannot
swim and feels himself sinking to rise no
more his own explanation of his abject
looks when i saw him at xenia the other day
was that he was u l l understood to mean
really and physically sick the same as we are
all liable to be even if we have behaved the
best that we know how but whilst i did not
feel ai liberty to doubt his word in the least
in that matter i could not help thinking that
his position would be enough to make some
folks sick v nicholson

lost and the party leaders cannot control tbe
people longer they have been humbugged
by the vampires until they have become
weary of the burdens under which they hav
so long groaned and declared themselves free
from the rule of such contemptible beings i
have been lecturing in chenango valley for

his boarders made remarks in relation to my

yours most respectfully

scraps from the bench not judicial
messrs editors lt is some time since i
last wrote you i hare not written simply
because i have had nothing to write about of
interest occurring in this vicinity and your
own pens have reviewed the movements of
the free soilersof j c calhoun and his
followers and other stirring events with far
more ability than i can presume to possess
i shall at present proceed lo give a medley
of views and matters that have come within
my observation in this allabsorbing w hirlpool
of dollars and cents for here the quality of
religious teachings is determined by the quan
tity of dollars and cents the cause of liberty
is estimated and the cause of humanity is
calculated by dollars and cents even poli
tics and politicians are advocated in accord
ance with their supposed relation to and
bearing upon dollars and cents id at the
loaves and fishes
the free soil movement and buffalo ru m
inees are quite favorably received by the rot
ing freemen of this place thay have held
several spirited meetings and are making ar
rangements foi holding a series o them a
number of individuals late prominent leaders
tn the proslavery parties are in the vanguard
of this movement but the men that belong
to the whig and democratic parties go it
strong for the regular nominees they
are rough at thinking fur themselves but
are  ready to do the bidding of their south
ern masters their motto is open yuur
mouth and shut your eyes and swallow it
down
whilst crossing the forry saturday after
noon i heard two gentleman whose appear
ance and language indicated that ihey were
of the higher circle of society conversing in
relation to mr websters rumored speech at
marshfield sustaining the regular nomina
tionl say upper circle iff society because
be it known reader that in this commercial
emporium and its environs we have upper
and lower gradescircle not castes because
the latter nre not jirtsiian or democratic
hut to ibo conversation mr a said that it
was rumored that mr webster had made a
tjntoh sustaining the philadelphia nominees
mr b answered in the affirmative when mr
a said h must have run against the
grata to which mr b aaseaied this is
but a poor eomplioimt to the coo of the
north and yet to have raid lew would have
been to defood his honest v at dm expense of
his godlik intellect the max must he
a ninny who sappoees bin to be fart enough
to be honest
by the hr mr webster seem to be em
phatically a man of tbe past lie delights to
dwell on tbe pant history of martin van
buren and assures us that when cotemperv
neota legislators they mutually opposed every
measure presented to each other and thinks
it must be ludicrous if not contemptible for
them to agree imiw the lion and lamb may
he down together hut tbe lion and fox cannot
well he and john c calhoun ran agree m
opposing him
hereafter when i wbb to make op my
mind what is my duty in relation to some meas
ure i will if my conscience allows mo as
certain tbe views of some oae who has matrly
differed from me and if they are in favor
more especially if they are tbe embodiment 
will oppose it it is a much handier way than
going through the mental process of investi
gating on its own merits it will be god
like
i had occasion last week to go to albany
to transact some business in returning

was answered in the affirmative whereujton

prefer going on beard the isaac newton and
repaired on board that aquatip palace which
is equal to any that the mos poetic imagina

friends peimit me through the columns of
your valuble paper to call the attention of the
public to the steamboat saratoga on board of
which colorphobia was so virulent that dele

ed freemen were refused a cabin passage
the reason assigned by the clerk who i think
they call merrell at all events he may be
easily known by his diminutive sallow syco
phant expression of countenance and much
sooner i should judge by his language was
that colored persons could not be permitted in
the cabin among whites such a pitiable speci
men of humanity and the officers who sup
port him in thus treating their superiors are
certainly being  that every man should des
pise and abhor i also found on board a hete
rogeneous mass of abomination in the form of
a black servant named bowman who gave
countenance to their conduct by a public ex
pression of his feelings he resides in cleve
land i simply mention these facts that
ladies and gentlemen of color as well as white
who sympathise with the oppressed may
when travelling on our western waters use
their means among a more worthy set the
company were compelled to lay over  hours
for the steamer oregon ou which a number

there was a a large gathering at the
chinese museum thursday night b
w richard presided assisted by
twentyfire vicepresident and fire
secretaries col thomas l kane
son of hon e k kane read the fol
lowing resolution which were en
thusiastically adopted
whereas the recent accession of
large portions of california and mexico
to the territory of the united states
lias made it the duty of congress to
provide rules aud regulations tor their
government and it has been sought
so to direct the action of congress in
regard to those territories us to au
thorize or permit the introduction w itb
m them of domestic slavery thereby
giving national sanction to the exten
sion of that institutionwithin the con
tines of the union and whereas the
question thus presented affects the
rights and honor and wellbeing of all
the citizens of the united states more
directly and powerfully than any other
now pending before them and the
principles which should determine it
are of broad enduring and most mo
mentous import and whereas it is
known that the candidates nominated
for the office of president of the united
states by the great political parties
which have divided the country are
agreed in the purpose to recognize by
favoring legisation the existence of
slavery in the new territories and it
is incumbent therefore on all who
believe such legislation perilous to the
welfare peace stability and continued
happy influence of the union that they
should proclain their opposition to it in
advance and unite iu efforts to avoid
 the evil therefore
resolved as the sense of the free
men of the city and county of phila
delphia here assembled
 that habitually inured to toil and
by it invigorated and sustained we
recognize no honoring distinction in
that incapacity or reluctance for toil
which the languor of a southern sky
or the wrongful legislation of a former
age may have made congenial to others
 that the sense of personal inde
pendence which is the offspring of
voluntary and selfdirected toil finds
its natural and just expansion in the
conscious equality of political rights
and that to degrade labor therefore is
to strike at the vital principle of our
institutions
 that the hand which is made
strong by free toil is the appropriate
and only safeguard of free govern
ments since no nation can long con
tinue to be free which has ceased to
depend for its freedom on the strength
of its own free people
 that a just recognition of the
rights of others is implied in the just
perception of our ow nthat universal
intelligence is the best security of social j
order as well as personal freedom
and that no institution therefore can
be congenial to a republic which arro
gates an exclusive title to personal
rights in favor of a single class of men
or which repels education and finds
safety in ignorance
 that the broadly advancing fron
tier ol the united states far removed
beyond the direct guardianship of the
national power and the controlling in
fluence of longestablished laws exacts
for its protection from hostile invasion
and fur the peace of domestic right
that the people who are to plant and
guard it shall be energetic and intelli
gent freemen identified in interest
knit together by common sympathies
confiding in themselves and in each
other all worthy to share in the res
ponsibilities of the common defence
and to be rewarded alike by the gener
al advance of intelligence and happi
ness
 that the rapid extension of our
geographical limits and their still un
faltering progess admonish us that as
the frontier region of a few years back
is now the compacted abode of a peo
ple free intelligent laborious powerful
and happy so the frontier of today
must soon be a centre of influence to
yet more extended regionsand it be
hoves us therefore to renew and per
petuate in behalf of posterity that
wise legislation of our fathers by which
freedom and the blessings that attend
it were made the equal birthright of
all within the territories of the united
states
 resohed that we assent hold
and maintain as clear and necessary
deductions from the principles thus
declared
the perpetual exemption of the soil
committed to our stewardshio from chat
tie slavery
the appropriation of the public do
main in limited quantities to actual
settlers only and
the right of education in its freest
sense the right of every community
to the best services of its citizens and
its duty to this end to take all neces
sary measures to insure their highest
moral physical and intellectual devel
opment
and that while we recognize the
government of the united states as
founded in the compromises of compact
and aim to cultivate the spirit of com
promise which has for its only just basis
the consciousness of possible error
and a deference to the opinions of asso
ciates we can recognize no compromise
ot principle nor tolerate any abate
ment ot these which we proclaim the
essential doctrines of the free demo
cracy of pennsylvania
 rsolrcd i hat regarding slavery
within the states m which it exists as
the creature ot their own local law
we hold it as such protected from inter
ference on the part of the general
government by the compact entered
into by the thirteen original states ati
the formation of the union that we
hold however as a truth equally in
contesiible that another part of that
compact invested the general gov
ernment with power to restrain and i
prohibit it in the territories and we
affirm that tfiis adjustment of the slae
ry question which at once established
aud restrained the jurisdiction and res
ponsibility of the national aed state
governments within the geographical
limits of their respective authorities is
the only compromise in regard to it
whifh is either morally just of irglb l
binding upon the freemen of the uni
ted states that farther tba obliga
tions of conscience the liberties ot a
fellowbeing me rights of another 
bis own or anothers children cau bv
no man be made the legitimate subject
of crinpromiee and that the won
compromise ia a cheat and a mockery
when it expresses the surrender of an
interest unlimited and absolute foi
which no consideration is offered and
for which no adequate consideration
can be received
 resolved that that right to ex
clude slavery from the territories
which is found in the words of the con
stitution to make all needful rule
and regulations for the government ol
the territory of the united states
early recognixod by the supreme jud
iciary exercised without question foi
nearly threescore years approved and
enforced by presidents of the l niied
states in acts of congress that have
established the laws of no less than
eleven territories since becoming
statesthis right now for the first
time questioned is so plain from the
letter and spirit of the instrument that
we have no need to sesort to history
for its contemporaneous exposition and
it is only to exalt an honorable pride
that wc commamorate the fact that this
was the unanimous sentiment of the
patriots of the revolution that it wa
thomas jefferson who introduced in
 the first wilinot proviso and
george washington who in  gave
his executive sanction to the first laws
carrying out the principles of the free
soil democrats of 
 resolved that however the ex
tension of territorial dominions may
be the necessary result of war the
enlightened judgment of the age in
which we live requires such dominion
to be exercised with a just regard to
the welfare of the conquered people
that where social freedom has been the
right of every man no conquest of ter
ritory can justify the subjection of its
inhabitants to personal boudage and
that to introduce slavery by virtue of
our laws into a region where it did not
exist under a less enlightened and less
liberal rule would insult that spirit of
freedom which it is our boast among
nations to represent and to be alike
without warrant from the organic law
of the united states the law of na
tions of nature and of god
 resolved that before the expir
ation of the next four years the great
question will have been decided whe
ther the lands of northern california
and mexico shall remain free as they
arc now inviting the free laborers of
the united states and the laborers of
europe seeking emancipation among
us to spread themselves out in honest
and friendly rivalry on those vast re
gions making them the homes of
energy fertility and freedom or whe
ther slavery despoiling labor of its
dignity and its fruits shall under pre
text of sharing in the occupation of the
soil mark out a barrier region beyond
which the emigration of free labor
must refuse to penetrate and wc be
lieve that this question so obvious in
the answer which it must receive and
yet so momentous in its character and
its consequences does most justly and
earnestly invoke the united efforts and
influence of all good men that the
time has come when a loftier appeal
tn v be made than to passions and pre
judices which had their origin in
ancient and now unavailing contro
versywhen party discipline and drill
must cease to be effective against prin
i eiple and rightand when a higher
object may be legitimately sought and
toiled for and attained than the eleva
tion of one or another of two men both
of them boldly and fatally pledged in
support of this pernicious error
 resolved that in the doings of
j the convention recently assembled in
i the city of buffalo in its intrepid and
unyielding assertion of principle its
i ready and unreserved sacrifice of pri
vate feeling in every feature of its
i upright generous and intelligent pa
triotism we see embodied the best
characteristics of the american nation
that we adopt and avow its declaration
of principles as our own and that we
esteem the candidates offered by it for
the approval of the people worthy to
i be the standardbearers of the prin
ciples they represent that while the
i name of martin van buren can gain
no additional dignity by his elevation
to the presidential chair it must owe
its chief lustre in future history to his
selfdenying championship of the prin
ciples of free soil and that in charles
francis adams we respect a scholar
and philanthropist the whole tenor of
whose past life is a guaranty of his en
ergy and fidelity in the cause of truth
and freedom
