speech of wendell phillips
at the fsaeud mating mtnday eventug mar th
mr president and fellow citizens
tne friend who preceded mu spoke
of the very remarkable crisis in which
we were met in faneuil hall tonight i
can liken it to nothing but to the sup
position that samuel adams in revo
lutionary times had gone over to the
british or john hancock had ratted
the men who came up to this hall iu
 with such news in what temper
would they have filled it
there has been hut one such event
as that we now consider within our day
i will not allude to those iny friend
has mentioned in the time ol charles ist
or of our own revolution but we
know there was a time when the fate
of hungary rested with one man and
who does not remember the indignatiou
that swept over europe when it was
known that georgey had been bought
by russian g ld t liberty stands now
in these northern states as it stood
then in hungary and the news has
come to u that our dictator in whom
massachusetts had trusted so londly in
whom she had garnered up all her con
fidence has been bought with ttie g ild
of our russia mark also that geor
gey when he eurrendred hungary
uriendered nothing but the political
rights of the men he was betraying
our statesman baser far is dealing
with those personal rights the violation
of any one of which outweighs that of
all civil privileges
we are met to consult tn such a cri
sis as this for after all whether we
are able to answer the arguments of
daniel webster or not whether mas
sachusetts can pick to pieces that logic
or not whether we can uuravel its so
phistry to her inhabitants or not the
convicti n of every mans heart is that
daniel webster is false no matter how
impregnable his logic be or seem hear
hear
we may be unable to unravel the
web of that sophistry he is a great
man doubtless and can easily utake
the worse appear the better reason
and it may be so deep and profound is
tbe confidence of the commonwealth in
him that it may be impossible to keep
her from the conclusions t which that
argument leads but let us stand as
chatham stood when some eophister
tried to prove to him that the cauae of
hampden end cromwell was to be
suspected was unconstitutional end
that after all charles ist and claren
don were the true friends of english
liberty and he retorted grant it all
no men ehall persuade me that it was
not the cause of liberty on the one hand
and of tyranny on tbe other prolong
ed applause
let it be so with us now i care not
whether  am able to answer that
speech or not the parties were met
they stood ranged and marshalled face
to face on the floor of the united states
senate and ee that speech is spoken
the feces of the friends of freedom ere
blenched sod joy brightens the cresi
of caihoun  care not for tbe argu
ment sensation he gave aid end
comfon to the enemy aod that is trea
son reiterated applause but this
is e speech thst is rotton ell through
not only in us spirit but its argument
also cheers it answers itself
the beginning sate the end it is like
munchausens lion that devoured the
bores so quick as to find himself in tbe
traces dregog the chariot shouts of
enthusiasm 
i will not go at length over the
ground which has been so wall trodden
before me but we must talk of tbe
spoeeb aod thsrtfere  niirttiulvftb
right is of no sextruth is of no color
same subjects as my friend who he
preceded me let me say a wore
about the argument an tu texan annex
ation in the texas address which he
dictated iu  mr webter pro
nounced that act a plain violation oi
ne constitution both iu orui and sub
amt in  at marshfield he
aid  take it that tiu mot important
event of ovr lime tending to tbe exten
sion of slavery mjt its everlasting es
ablishment on this continent was the
annexation of texasin im  in 
a springfield he told u we ere ti
use the first last and every occasion
vhich offers to oppose the extension c
lie slave power oil the loih angus
 after new mexico and califoruib
vere acquired he rose in the senate
md thus delivered himself
my opposition to the increase of sla
very m this country or to the metea
 slave representation is general am
universal it has no reteience to th
hues of latitude r points of the com
puss  shall oppose all such ex
tension at all times and under all
circumstances even against all in
ducements against all supposed
limitation of great interests
against all combinations againsi
all compromises
here t en was a crisis worthy
himself being judge of his utmost ex
ertion dignut vindice nodu a km i
which justified the interference of a
god it was unconstitutional it wa
most impurtaut it tended to makt
slavery everlasting he was pledged t
oppose it everywhere and by all
means
in w of all this what and how
much has daniel webster ever done
to prevent the annexation and when
by the unconstitutional action of a
temporary majority the deed was ii
some sense attempted or done whui
did he do to prevent its acquiring the
validity of law
he made a few speeches one in par
ticular at niblos garden new york
out when so mighty an injustice as thi
was in progress was it enough to speak
merely my friend told us just now
that mr webster was eloquent hi
is so but  remember a definition he
once gave of eloquence true elo
quence uoes not consist in speechsaid
lie the graces taught in the schools
the costly ornaments and studied con
trivances of speech shock and disgust
men when their own livet and the fate of
their wive their children and their coun
try hang on the decision of the hour
then patriotism is eloquent then self
devotion is eloquent the high purpose
the dauntless spirit urging the
whole man onward right onward to bi
object this is eloquence or ra her it
is something greater and higher than
all eloquence it is action noblesub
lime godlike action how much ot
thisactionhas he ever shown in hi
opposition to texas wiien in 
adams gates giddings briggs anu
tha rest raised the note of warning to
the people of the free slates where was
tbe name ot daniel webster
when did he ever throw his dreaded
gauntlet into the lists and challenge
every comer when did he ever pul
gallantly at hazard his name fame and
influence throw intrepidity into the
scale of antitexas all that be had and
that he was did he rally the country
did he try to animate and marshal even
the whig party did he counsel a
temporary suspension of attending to
minor points and a concentration ol
the vigilance ot tbe couniry on this the
thermopylae and gibraltar of the
nrth did he summon the states
whose relative weight as such was
being wickedly and illegally taken from
them to protest and exert themselves
for the ten years that the xas pro
ject was afoot he and with some truth
we may say he alone was competent
to any or all of these things one
blast upon his buglehorn had been
worth a thousand men but none ot
them did he attempt in a great mea
sure his lukewarmness and indiffer
ence were the one great obstacle m
the way of any other tnaus doing either
of them
true he got others to call a conven
tion in  in this hall and when
he had felt the pulse of boston and
found the meeting unpopular he never
came within its wails but ran away to
new york he dictated the unconsti
tutional part of that conventions ad
dress and then forbade them to divulge
the tact howmnch in ail ibis of high
purpose md daumles spirit
but in december  while be
sat iu the seuate the final law doing
the deed of annexation was passed
he expressed his opiniui he tells us
and recurded his vote in the negative
and there that vote stands and was
that all he stood and saw his loved
temple of liberty fired expressed his
opinion and voted againt it he saw
the constitution violatedthe balance
f the states utterly destroy dsaw a
a deed accomplished whose lal con
sequences even nis eloquence labors in
in attempting to portray in the texas
address and contented himself with
a speech and a vote when a ruthless
majority trainpiee on the form and
substance ofthe constitution of course
there must be eome constitutional
way of opposiog them of preventing
their acts acquiring validity as a pro
tbund constitutional lawyer mr web
ster couldnot but know these ways
ami means of constitutional opposition
la such a crisis he was hound to find
irte make one did be attempt ii
did ba contest the right to their aeat
of men who appeared on that flsor un
dor that plain violation of tha coasti
utfieft h mvr opened hie ntetithl
did he like the scottish chieft  
old send tke burnt cross throughout
new england reminding her i
he had dictated in it m di
say that the assent of the people of
state in a greet and lundameuta
question like this is it to be proved by
or inferred from any vote of its rep
resentatives in congress conjurt
them to assemble in convention ant
swear never to ratify by acquiescewt
this act which tended to make slaver
everlasting on the continent nothin
of the kind
did he if he thought it too late ft
undertake this place on solemn recorc
at washington and add his iufluenct
iu the denial ofthe massachusetts leg
islature of the validity of any compn
ume intended to preclude the future ap
plication of such a condition a wil
mots
instead of this he assures mr bell
f tennessee page  that he know
nofoim of legislation which can atren
ten this plain violation of the constitu
tion no recognition that can add a till
of weight to it any additional recog
nition would weaken the force of it
government is pledged by law and
contract p  and he surrenders
gives up the game promises to quintu
ple the weight of texas when asked 
this what he calls using the firstlast and
every occasion to resist thesisvepowerr
this opposition under all cir urn
stancesagainst all inducementsagain
all comfromisei daniel webslei
has tpoken some and well ugainsitexas
he has yet to do the first act to resist
her annexation or prevent the fatal ef
tecta of that measure his present po
sition either professes that his boasted
constitution is all a sham so weak thin
it leaves its friends no means of resist
ing the unconstitutional acts ot a ruth
less majority oi that his whole oppo
sition to texas judged by his puhlii
acta was a shain
does mr webster mean to say that
if the majority in the senate voed
maine out of that body or established
an order of n bles he should content
himself with an opinion and a vote
but i will pass from this point which
has been sufficiently spoken to if 
had tune  should like to try to show
that tbe annexation of texas is not yet
made valid by tbe acquiescence of the
people except so far as that she is in
the union and that as to the othei
portion of the agreement the bringing
in ol her slave states we msy honora
bly still try the question whether the
people will ratify it or whether we can
not persuade them fairly while theres
time to hold it void had we a man
and not a ffebster i i the senatethere
would be hope cheers
mr webster tells us in tbe second
portion of his argument that there is
no necessity for the wilmot proviso
upon what ground why that the
climate of naw mexico renders it im
possible that slavery should extend
there what does mr webster say
page  in his revised speech slave
ry existed in the earliest period of his
tory in the oriental nations what
does he say on the th page cali
fornia and mew mexico arewhat
asiatic in their formation and scenery
if they are so what prevents slavery
from existing there in the latest period
as it did iu the oriental nations in the
earliest loud plaudits
there was slavery among thegreeks
says mr webster what was greece
lronbound and sterile says edward
everett with an unproductive soil
importing her own corn what is the
description mr webster gives of new
mexico such as greece was with
her mountain fastnesses with vasi
ridges of mountains ol enormous height
broken ridges and deep valleys sla
very existed in greece without much
tillable and without cot on or tobacco
why cannot it exist in our mountains
at the present day
there never was one square mile of
the earths surface on which man dwelt
where slavery has not existed  am
within limits when  say that there is
not a hundred square miles upon the
earths surfac of inhabited territory
in which slavery has not existed and
yet he contends that it is impossible lor
slavery to exist in the countless mile
of unknown and untrodden territory
west of the del norte in every state
of this union except possibly vermont
slavery has existed does mr web
ster undertake to affirm that oo space
equal to new england exists in new
mexico which is not more pilled with
granite and less tillable than she it
is contradicted by all the history of th
world labor has never been bard
enugh to make it welcome to a free
man or make him unwillieg to force it
on a slave mr webster knows this
because he has said as much substan
tially in the commencement of his
speech yet be telle ue to trust to
what to trust to chance i would
te willing to trust to change fairly in
terpreted to the providence of god
but whoever trusts to change under
he constitution of the united staten
trusts to loaded dice aad peeked cards
cheers he trusts to a webster
surrendering the forces of liberty
while calhoun like tha guardsnever
yieldsbe dies hear hsar that
is the chance nowe will take a
bond of fate before we will trust to
that cheers
i will leave true untouched further
e my friend has treated it so fuliy aod
pass to the third portion of mr web
sters speech which deals with the fu
gitive eav i wish you to hear with
me a moment whtis  dwell upon this
mr wtkrttr uwubtwdi cupper
f rochester n y friday april  
not only the cuoshuhh but the bi
el mr mason on this subject
now i wish to brmgpo your recol
retina what that bill order tlm
ou may fairly judge uat be uodri
akes to support tint substance
the bill his been repeatm to you uj
n affidavits written ithiftiuny tiku
leforehand and wit holt warning i
proposes to allow amonl others an
ourt dark or posttnast to gram
warrant which shall hiae tbe slav
claimant to cany tbe man he claim
irotn boston to new orleans
suppose the claimant either througl
malice or carelessness hs takeu un
wrong person take a massachusetts
freeman how shall the victim be righ
ted why it is said by appealing t
some court in new orlvaus when he
arrives but remember the colorei
people are generall poor supp sr e
colored man never out of boston iu hi
life is snached w j how is he to
get friends in neworleans where he
never was before to bring his case be
fore a tribunal manths may passer
that and meanwhile the poor friend
less one is melting fort into the indis
tinguishable mass of slaves and ma
tie sold and passed on from baud t
hand till redress is impossible
but suppose sums human person i
foundthe case at last is in som
southern court where every colored
person is perfumed to be a slave until
tie shows the contrsry how then i
tlie boston boy to prove his boston
birth why you wll say let him
send for his mother father brothers
uncles playmates send it cost
immey send for their depositions
ihen court street asks money to tsk
them the man is poor but suppose
this svil also is surmount d his friend
ave come to him or sent their depos
itions the laws ot tbe s uth thui out
all thi testimony a coloicd man must
of course move his birth and residence
by colored friends generally but no
col red man can give evidence in a
southern couit in any case where a
white man is party he must get w hue
peisons to swear to his past life birth
c or he must sink down a slave iu
nine hundred aud niutyniue cases
therefore out of a thousand the
northern freeman opce intstakenh
surrendered under masous bill is lost
lot ever aud this is tbe hill which tbe
defender of the constitution under
takes to support he knew or should
have known that iu mar land virgi
nia the carolines georgia missouri
alabama and probably in all the slave
states any persn claiming that he is
w rongfully held may have a jury trial
but tne massachusetts man mistaken
ly seized in boston cannot have this
old saxon privilege he must be sur
rendered whenever any one office un
derling is satisfied on paper evi
dence that the slavs claimant is right
i go into these facts to show that mr
webster when he surrenders one of
his constituents to masons bill surren
ders him to slavery as long ago as
ikidnapp ing was ciniinbn in penn
s ivania they had only to catch a
inan gst him over the line aud mingle
mm among the slaves and he could
nt be found again mr webster
knows that all laws should be guarded
strictly in favor of liberty so csn fully
guarded as to make mistakes all but
impossible he has himself told us
that the spirit of linerty is indeed a
b ld and tearless spirit but it is also a
sharpsighted spirit it is a cautious
sagacious discriminating farseeing
intelligence it is jealous of encroach
ment jealous of power jealous of mam
it demands checks it seeks or
guards it insists on securities it en
trenches itself behind strong defences
and fortifies with all possible care
against the assaults of ambition and
passion it does not trust the amiable
weakness of human nature and there
fore it will not permit power to overstep
its prescribed limits though benevo
lence good intent and patriotic pur
pose c me along with it neither does
it sat siy itself with flashy aud tempora
ry resistance to illegal authority far
otherwise t t seeks for duration and
permanance it looks before and after
and building m the experience of ages
which are past it labors diligently lor
the benefit of ages to come this is
the nature of constitutional liberty and
this is our liberty if we will rightly un
derstand and preserve it
this very iiitl is such a one as that
against which he thus warns us the
lull is bad entugh on tba lacs of it
hut ius like the artesian wells grow
ing hotter aqd hotter the lower you go
it is naser add baser the more you an
alyze it
flweimnn finds stolen property
there he is i prove thst it is his thst
is the coinnu n law if  find a stolen
horse in marsh field  am bound to
prove tn marshfield that it la mine and
not leave the town with it until it is de
cided there by a jury of twelve men
applause but if an unfortunate
colored man claimed aa a slave should
go to marshficwnnd he would be very
unfortunate if he did laughter for
of the few men who have been wilting
to oonsign their names to iufiuny by
proclaiming thsir readiness to assist in
a slavebum certainly that of daniel
webster should stand at tbe head re
newed laughter bqt it such an unfor
tunate should take refuge from a slave
hunter there he is not to have jury
trial of maseaehusctte men no on
the affidavit paper testimony of any
body he is to be carried any number of
thousand wilea carried off hatpleas

land england it was the next do
ojoha hancock a house compart
ith the hopeless distance of new 
vans from boston lor the poor an
i iandleas colored wan
this is not the constitution ba
s that is it is nothing tike this mr
webster tries to persuad massacht
etts that he is only supporting ti
constitution the constitution say
to all criminal cases the right of tru
jury shall be preserved in att am
ases where the value is anouftlptirii
lollars the right shall be preserved
now the slave cause goes either inn
me or the other list when the siavt
is arrested it is either a criminal or t
civil cases and the constitution there
fore requires a jury mr webstei
knows this and instead of this speech
he should have lifted up his voice ii
behalf of this timehonored barrier o
me rights of the humblest citizen ii
place of that massachusetts is left t
seward of new york or some west
ern statesman to defend tor her th
principles of freedom great enthu
siasm yes we are left for some for
eigner from massachusetts to put thai
shield over the head of the colored cit
izen which the constitution enjoins
and which the massachusetts delendei
ol the constitution chooses to forget
shame this is my gravest chargi
against mr webster
once more and  will relieve yot
soongo on go onand that is ii
ihis matter of balancing the compli
ments of the south and north agautsi
each other mr webster plainly be
trays the bias under which he spoke
slurting with only sme twenty lines
the vast usurpation of new territories
which has comjietely changed th
character of the union he charge
ugaiufrt northern legialatoit a want o
fidelity to ibe consulution
that argument on the slavehunt i
plausibly put together to convince
massachusetts that he is only carrying
out the constitution the courier ol
this morning bids us declaimei against
mr webster read the constitution
aide by side with this speech and show
where they conflict why the con
stitution compared with that speech
is heaven that is hell lmmense
applause the constitution repudi
ates such a speech with loatning and
contempt
samuel adams signed the constitu
tion he would have let his ami
wither to the shoulder before he
would have signed to that speech
cheers it took one hungarian
gorgey to surrender his constitution
and it took another beni to become a
pacha with nine tails but more for
tuuate than either in one act webstei
surrenders both loud shouts and
cheers in one act he was a traitor
to his constitution and an apstat
from humanity the year  will
be fatal to other men than hungarians
to other lives than natural livea if we
shall do our duty in this common
wealth prolonged appiibse
thera is one point further on which
i wih to make a single remark aud ii
is this the southerners tell us that
the right of trial by jury is inconsistent
with slavery they tell us that if th
southerner is oblig d to prove his title
to his slave he would be very much
inconvenienced he cannot tarry st
long ha will have to tarry only at
long aa it would take to recover hi
horse but if ba ba inconvenienced
who ia to suffer he or liberty
 recollect in the life of that glo
rious baptist missionary william
km ibb that on one occasion he aud
his coadjutors came to an agreement
with the planters of jamaica that
slavery aud hristianty could not ex
ist together and tnere they parted
the planters said we will extermin
ate christian ty the missionariea re
joined we will abolish slavery lei
us make the same resolve as to habtat
corpus jury trial and the other sacred
barriers of liberty if the choice must
be made between them and chains dd
not let us make them yield to the con
venience of slaveholders which ii
to give way the rights of freemen oi
the couvenience of slaveholders i
which to give way the rights of the
colored people of boston that than
children may not play in safety in th
streets protected by just laws or the
gratilication of slavecatchers in th
nineteenth century  had almost said
that jury trial was a law of nature
applausecertainly it ia a law oi
the saxon race and the convenience
of slavery must give way to that greal
jury trial which protects the libertie
uf the humblest of that race in out
midst cheers
but i would say point me mr sen
ator to one single law on any statute
book in any free state inconsistent
with the constitution of the united
states point me to one single le
gislature that baa ever refused to d
what the constitution bade it the
moment the prtgg and pennsylvania
case was publishrdin which the court
said the states had no right to legislate
for or against the slaveholder in pur
suit of bis slave new york new
jersey massachusetts maine and ail
the northern states quietly yielded
the statute granting jury trial that
conflicted with this decision you and
i mr chairman want up to tho stats
house with n biu based on that de
cision sod it was pasted in a month
thera is not n law on any free stats
statutebook that conflicts in tho slight
est degree with the constitution or tbs
united state mr webster koowi
this to he the case he said as
ago as when he defended he consti
tution gait
resolved not to stunbit in silence t
accusations either against nryf md
vtdually or against the north whol
unfounded and unjust accusation
which impute to us a disposition t
vade the constitutional compact an
io extend the power of the govei omen
ver the internal laws and domestic
condition of the states he said in
march  to butler of south caro
line if the gentleman will say that
heir ready to defend her in march
ibo eheu quantum mutatus ab uo
he has nothing to say on the übjec
xcept to accuse his constituents
now having brought ths unjust
charge against the legislators of th
north be turns round and in the
norths behalf saya nothing bui
when he prints his speech in massa
ehusetts he prints in it a few feeblt
lines about south carolinias imprison
ing our seamen does he arraign
legislatures no does he allude to
laws never now there stand
upon their statute books laws which
they know are unconstitutional making
our seamen liable to be seized and
sold these statutes they confess to
be unconstitutional because they for
bid their being passed upon and tried
by any federal court mr webster
knows them to be unconstitutional
side by side with those statutes
louisiana and sooth carolina have
enacted that if any person from mas
tarhusetls or elsewhere goes to these
mates to make up a case and try the
constitutionality of these laws in the
supreme court he shall be punished
by imprisonment in the c mmon jail
mr webster ktnew all this vet he
has not a word to say against the
whole range of southern legislation
which is confessedly unconstitutional
aud which dares not meet the laces of
the judges of the supreme court of
the united slates
in his spoken speech he did not ut
ter a syllable of this it was publish
ed in the intelligencer and union with
out a line about the noithern seamen
put when he was about to send it
north he puts ir six or eight lines on
the subject he says lbis is not
only irritating but exceedingly in
convenient in practice and seems
altogether impracticable aud oppres
sive well the speech came to
the people of the north in this seem
ing way and a great many of the
massachusetts newspapers spoke out
against its poltroonery and only on
or two city ppers supported him
what doe he say in his second au
thorized edition seems madam
nay it is applause now it no
longer is inconvenient r serins irri
tating but is exceedingly unjustifiable
and oppressive his thermometer
has risen ten degrees what raised
it the country papers of massachu
setts prolonged applause let him
hear of s good hot meeting in faneuil
hall and it will go up to boiling point
enthusiasm why if we whip our
best we can whip this top into spinning
at last that paragraph had never j
been inserted if the speech had not
been obliged to bear the eyes of north
ern men he has changed itchanged
it f r the better let us go on and
we will make him make a better whole
speech still repeated cheers
 know that i have detained you a
great while too long no no 
have endeavored to obey the boston
courier and slick to the speech and
the constitution it is not necessary
to go out of the limits of that pamphlet
in order to answer even daniel web
ster in my opinion but this is no
doubt a momentous question for we
have reached the great western goal
f the world ln that high romance
if romance it be says edward
everett in which the great minds of
antiquity sketched the fortunes ot the
ages to come they pictured to them
selves a favored region beyond the
ocean a land of equal lam and happy
men the primitive poets beheld uin
the islands of the blest the doric
bards surveyed it in tbe hyperborean
region the sage of the academy placed
it ui tbe lost atlantis and even he
sterner spit it of seneca could discern
a fairer abode of humanity in the dis
tant region then unknown we look
back upon these uninspired predictions
and almost recoil from the obligation
they imply by us must these fair
visions be realized by us must be ful
filled these high auspices which burst
hi trying hours from the longing hearts
of the champions of truth there are
no more coutittema or worlds t be re
vealed atlantis hath ariaen from the
tcean the farthest thule it reached
there are no unre retreats beyond the
sea no more discoveries no inoie
hopes here then a mighty work is
to be fulfilled or never by the race
of mortals tbe mao who look with
tenderness on the sufferings oi good
men in other time the descendant of
the pilgrims who cherishes the memo
ry ol hie fathers tbe patriot who feels
an honeef glow at the majesty of the
system of which he ia a member you
are the men fellowcitizens by whom
these br ght auspices ere to be accom
plished this is the last solerne ex
periment ot humanity
are the tone purpose and resolve
of tbit a peach those which it is to
he tried th failing lart of e 
hater bf slavery in thee states an
swers for me no
daniet webster in one of his elo
quent moments when with the aaraeat
of ue of his most noble efforts
he de unced tbe slave trade in thin
langage criad tit pet
john dick pitm
whole no 
ivrity to these hearths that we have
kept sacred for them sacred how
by iraviug it to chaoce whether they
ball be polluted with e chain or con
secrated to freedom we call upon
him to come up iu hit age and fulfil
ho promise of his youth and if he ie
vanting if he has betrayed us let
nim be like arnold or like georgey
let the axe sever forever the tender
colds that bound him to the heart of
hearts of massachusetts l ud
ihtwet  iruemmhtfwtlclt mt y
of the moral sense of nvw england
as to think that he can stand up in the
thee of this community after he has
pledged himsell to be a slavehunter
let him at least learn to respect th in
telligence of new england which
knows at least when it is betrayed
applause let us teach him that we
have studied  faithfully in the school
where he has been so long a teacher
of glorious thoughts aud noble argu
ments lei him learn that we have
been too good disciples not to carry
out his lessons into deeds that we
mean to stand by the principles of the
ordinance of  that we mean to
beware just where tbe enemy are vigi
lant aud hopeful that where tbe south
clings with the agony of despair to the
right to catry their slaves into the ter
itory of the west just there will we
ne vigilant we will he taught by the
enemy we will erect the gate that
no man can mistake
in this speech at marshfield mr
webster quoted the ludicrous lines of
charles nd lime when a member
of the house of commons said in re
lation to james sod

of new mexico what he said in
 i desire massachusetts to echo
iu  even though mr webster has
found uut that there is no danger ol the
lions coming in at that open door
applause
let us cling to fde example of those
long years in which mr webster
thought he was leading the public sen
tinx nt o new england rather than
the total suirender ol hia own argu
ments his own sentiments his own
thunder from beginning to end in this
most melancliotj speech
 desire to add nothing in comment
upon mr webster upon his position
his course or his luiure if he is
willing that the sun of his fame shall
rise to the generation that is to coin
after us clouded with such a blot as
that pledge not only to sustain the
constitution of the united states but
the worst provisions of the worst slave
law that ever provoked the contempt
and indignation of any people let him
do so it is not for us to judge him
but when all the great men are recre
ant faneuil hull at least is left us
itlcoufidence in the present is gone
the memories of the past and labors
and hopes for tbe future ere still
ours
mr parker said that the citizens of
boston once met here when the chesa
peake was captured wa meet to
night because webster is kidnapped
choirs i remember that  once
spoke in this hull when john quincy
adams presided on the occasion of
the kidnapping of a fugitive slave in
south bostou we have met now
when a massachusetts man has been
kidnapped let us suve the state to
liberty let us try to save the fame
of the old commonwealth aud if we
connot save it it state street gives in
its adherence as it is going to do if
the men that were prominent in the
stormy days of  and  are put
ting their honor d nam s to a letter of
approbation lor mr webster let us
the little men of the commonwealth
have it to claim against the terrible re
buke that is to come to us from tbe
other aide of the water and from pos
terity that we raised our voices leebte
as they were in the most saer i spot
that we could find in behalf ol justice
and humanity great applause
but w need not talk in this strain
on owr side is every attribute of the
almighty it will take greater apos
tates than even this one to doom that
fair land long to slavery god
scooped the valley of tbe mississippi
as the cradle of bondage nor pihdthe
rocky mountains us ramparts lor ty
rants that valley is to be trodden by
free leet those harnesses held by free
hands such is indeed the will of
god which mocks alt the wickedness
of man to gainsay it long continued

the annexation of texas was conceived
and urged and consummated with the avow

 idb not charge northern men with acting
on this principle but we know that the of

there are those who think that the pro

spread slavery they have ceased to be valu
ablethe union has been endangered and
that instead of yielding to the demands of the
slave power to soot the uniunh e adop

ry adminiatation of the government are the
best means for preserving the union and the
only means which make it worth preserving

of jhe jeffeison ordinance of  to all tha

to the friends of freedom ond the
press
the ladies of new yotk in view of the
gteac benefits resulting fromlhe profession
of an organ devoted to the cause of freedom
and the elevation of their oppressed race
and being well assured that the north star
is an instrument in that cause which fiom
the xeal devotednett and intelligence of it
editor is calculated to effect in a gieat mea
sure the object for which it laborsfix the
emancipation and elevation  the colored
people and is therefore worthy of the pat
ronage of every american citizen particular
ly those for whom it labors have formed
an association for the purpose of holding a
fair during anniversary week in may next
to aid in sustaining said paper that its bea
conlight may continue to shine until every
bondman shall behold and be cheered by its
rays the association will also endeavor to
extend its ciiculation hoping that its truths
may penetrate every corner of that den of
oppression the south and cause light to
shine out of darkness that its exposure of
the crime and honors of slavery of the tears
and groans of the slave may soften the hard
hearts of their oppressors and cause them
to proclaim liberty throughout the land unto
all the inhabitants thereof that the apolo
gist of slavery at the north may receive
this light in in on icith the south and tyran
ny and oppression cease forever
the association earnestly solicits the aid of
every friend of freedom and fhe press and
sincerely hope that no one will lose this op
portunity of extending their generosity in a
noble cause every person must be convinced
of the power of ihe press and should there
fore exert theii utmost influence to sustain
it tne question then is will you assist in
eutmining it i if so you have an opportunity of
eo doing by contributing to the north sur
fair association
a box of valuable articles has been received
from friends in england aa a donation and
the ladies of philadelphia have promised a

to the editor of the north star
i observe in a late number of your paper
a brief article addressed to correspondents
who have from all parts of the country
queried of you respecting the mysterious
noises  which have indeed made so much
noise in these latter days
in the editorial alluded to youaaybe
ing too much engaged in the diacharge ot
xha numerous duties of our position to reply
to our correspondents upon this subjecty indi
vidually we beg to state to them briefly
through the columns of the north star
firstly tht we have heard the rappinga lie
we have never received any intelli
gence from those alleged spirits they
the earth earthy tad possess no mote
illumination than we wh are vet in this plod
of cumbrous clay
now friend douglass lam net going to
jpd fault with you for any myttpr therein
contained neither shall i blame you that you
have not chosen to slip the antislavery har
eee for the psrpoee of paying more atten
tion to things which seem to you to occupy
so outer field in which you have no work to
do  love the godapproved cause in which
your physical energies and devoted mind are
sgaged  well to ask you to rob it of a
single hour ot labor omo halt in the battle
while the foei yet unsubdued but as an
impression exists in my mind that twtnyof
your readers and especially the ooryesptw
dents referred to have a strong desire to
know something definite of what is to pus
posts sed biiiwpmsiibtiyudcp
pl i f m j
iwi
gfcgqgt a i j
r portumtie of owerw b t 
liftitefl to admit of snj v clw teroen
by you in regard to iu p o   m 
k discipl ot a bobbin ftficy or the victim of at
i ssploded humbug bui u an hoocst expositoi
of the truth to perform this email kb ol of loft
for you
let me state to you and your readers it
ths outset that were these sounds which wi
hear merely the effect of an ingenious con
trivance on the pait of a few men or women
no matter how cunning the hands that
made them i would not waste one moment
of my time or insult the intelligence of your
readers by any notice of this kind again
weie they only the simple but strange pro
duction of passive u after acted upon by
some hidden law as yet veiled to the tele
scopic eye of science we might wonder as
we always do when any new and unexplained
phenomena attract our attention and quietly
hand the subject over to the savans of our
time and tell them to find a patent for the
nondescript offspring
in the absence howerer of any such pos
sibility i deem the subject of too much im
puitance for summary disposal and of that
nature with which philosophy has nothing
to do any further thai it may rationally ex
plain the media which serves as the electric
chain connecting being with being in gods
universe in brief a uund of ordinary per
ceptions lacking not time or patience and
imbued with that sincerity which is ever wil
ling to unlearn error as well as to learn truth
is just as good an investigator of aorae things
as the whitehaired savan whose name has
countless appendages
it is somewhat difficult within the limits
of an newspaper article to give an explicit
and full exposition of this subject the
reader will undoubtedly on perusal find a
multitude of questiona suggested to hia mind
which he would like to have answered and
which had i the opportunity might for the
must part be replied to at once and satisfac
torily  will only attempt therefore to give
my own views and reasons for them
firstly as thousands can testify there are
sounds produced various in quality and
volume while observers are in the presence
of one or more certain individuals
secondly these sounds by their peculiar
nature variations difference of locality ano
simultaneous production afford to any one
who will listen to them during the space of
even thirty minutes when the communica
tion is free the most conclusive evidence tht
their origin is not in the volition of any visi
ble human being or beings
thirdly there is intelligence connecteu
with and controlling the sounds which is
manifested in a manner simple as it is beau
tiful by the answers to questions put by ob
servers at will to those unseen agencies
when a question is asked which requires as
an answer but a simple affirmative or nega
tive it is teplied to by the plain signal easily
understood but when a question requires
anything more than that the alphabet is re
sorted to
i will give a few incidents which have
come under my observation on one occasion
as a sort of test of their intelligence  took
fiom my desk three several letters from as
many different correspondents with the
names of the writets endorsed upon them
folded them compactly in a wrapper and
placed the package in my side coatpocket
when i came in the presence of these agen
cies and was seated with sevetal strangers
at the tabic my name tvs called to converse
with them  asked if the questions  had
prepared in my mmd would bo answered
an affiimative was received i then took out
the package laid it on the tableholding it
the w hileand asked how many letters are
there in this package three was the reply
i then asked if the dfmmunicaiot would tell
the company by spelling the names of the
writers of hhueelestem an affirmative was
signified i the alphabet was called and the
name of margaret robinson was given as
one of the w riiera the same process was
repeated and elizabeth was spelled by the
invisible agent the third name was tefused
to be giventwhy  know not but will state
that it was the name of my sister sarah
whose spirit meanwhile if we may balkye
the sounds was conversing with me on
asking how many letters are there in the
first name of the third writer jive was
the reply i then opened the package and
showed tothe company the result the re
plies were correct jn every particular
a gentleman from boston asked if the
sounds would tel by means of the alphabet
the last words which his mother addressed to
him an affirmative was the response the
letters were called and good bye my dear
were the words given as the last addressed
by the mother to her sun these wore her
very last words to meno more no less
was his exclamation
i have known a vast number of instances
in which these agencies be they what they
may have evinced art enerring perception
tvuly mtwnishtng aqd which gave lo the in
dividuals in conversation with them the most
unmistakable evidence of the possession of a
knowledge famlliat with all the rainnti of
their lives and a power to read at will the
unspoken thoughts sjirrjrig at the moment in
the secret receses of their minds
 i f
now i know not why anything of this na
ture should for a moment at this stage
prompt any person of ordinary understanding
in indulge in levity or carelessly saeer at
what he has not studied the subject has
chained the attention of some of the best
minds in our country they have approach
ed it with the honest determination to use
the apppliances of their best reason to
fathom the mystery if it was pf the parth
earthy no small number of those who hate
given it their attention would long since have
discovered the deception and juwe consigned
its authors lo that ighouin which they
would so riekly have deserved  sty and
say it with soioe emphasis that it argues ne
email degree of selfconceit in any one who

you hear the rapping click click click i

marks its author as a be ng but little lower

yes you will say but ths rapping is done
by machinery and therefore beautiful go
with me again but no you will not else
i would take you to another station wheje
the wires you here see are useless where
thought is borne to us from other worlds by
less complicated means than is here used to
bring it but a thousand miles the embodied
spirit has crossed mountains with his wires
has forded streams and robbed a forest to
erect thereon his electric bridge and con

the webster trial
dr websters address to the jury at the
conclusion of the argument of the connsei
chiefjustice shaw now with tears and
other indications of strong emotion addressed
the prisoner by name and informed him il
he had anything which he wished to add to
what had been urged in his behalf by his
counsel it was his privilege to do so then
but it was a privilege of which he had the
right to avail himself or not according to his
pleasure
the prisoner then arose and addressed
the court and audience rather than the jury
substantially as follows iu a wellraised
voice but m a lapid and netvous maimer
address
i feel grateful to the honorable court for
this courtesy lot i should like to give a lul
xplanation of the vast network of circum
stances which have been arrayed agoinst me
and have been crushing me for many
months but it would consume much oftbe
valuable lime of the court nor do i know
that my strength would be equal to it nine
tenths of what has appeared here i think 
could explain if i had a proper opportunity
ill could have seen and known what these
people were thinking and doing at the times
they have testified about in nine cases out
of ten i could have given a satisfactory ex
planation of the circumstances which have
been so unfortunately snd completely distort
ed against me here i think  had evidence
which with my explanations would have
cleared up these suspicious circumttances
and my innocence would have been eulirely
established but my lips have been sealed
i was in the bands of counsel who were
highly recommended to me and i deferred to
their superior judgment sud they did not
think fit to act upon my suggestion i have
placed in their hands the testimony necessary
to explain very many things which have
pressed most against me but they have judg
ed proper in some esses to disregard my
wishes or instructions if they had done so
many things would have lieeu cleared up
which willnow be misunderstood beesi e
they have been perverted by the witnesss
through then imperfect knowledge tluy
have not thought proper to biing loith it u
testimony it would have explained much
that the commonwealth now objects agatpst
me
but even now i will endeavor to correct
one sutomem that has been urged here
taken from that letter to piy daughter m
which  requested that my wile should not
open s bundle that lias been greatly mis
understood but i can fully explain it  had
read in one of that kind ot peis that are
distributed in the jail that  had purchased
some oxalic acid which was supposed to ite
or the purpose of taking out blood slams it
occurred to me that it musf mean some citric
acid which my wife asked me to procure
lor her to be used for some domestic pur
poses  did not gel it the day she first re
quested me to snd she laughed at me when
 returned home from boston lor having tor
gotten her request the next day which
was friday  did get it for her at mr tha
yers under the revere house about twelve
oclock and earned it home and gave it to
her it was from wfoat  lead in the paper
that i supposed it might be necessary to have
the package pteserved and that was the
package  wrote about  wanted it kept
for evidence it had no refeieuce to the notes
which were placed tn the trunk by mr cun
ningham i understood n
i wish to point out another circumstance
a mistake though an unintentional one i
have no doubt in the testimony of rev mr
parkman but  must say he has not done
me justice he introduced the subject of the
aberration of his brothers mind and  think
he will recollect it when i recalt the conver
sation to his mind he will recollect dial be
asked me if a common looking laboring man
was with his brother when he caate to the
college and he also asked me it he had any
lettuce m his hand and i answered no to
both these questions i told him  did not
notice any lettuce
then a to the nitrate of copper or nitric
acid it must be well known to person ac
quainted with chemistry that i wanted it fwr
my lectures iti which i explained and of
hibited the changes in the air produced by the
gases the blood too was used in the
leotuies by means of gas it could be
changed trom its dark oolor to the bright
yellow
it is said that i have been eam but if i
have been so i have not felt so in oqe
sense lam calm my trust is in god and my
innocence my couaselliave advised mo to

lo come forward  
the prisoner now resumed his seat some
what tremulous from agitation l
t tbs cbs rob m t j i
chiefjustice shaw proceeded at first in
a very low tone to sum up the cate and lay
its bearings before the jury he alludedto
the importance of tbe case and went ob to
consider the rules undei which the jury
would consider and decide on the evidence
the solemnity and magnitude of the case
was ufficteilly obvious to the minds of tbe
aibitrants in it he next touched on the
nature of the relationship existing between
the law and its intermediate and final adminis
trationtheir separate and at the same time
corljunctive dutiesfor the performance i
which no one was responsible to another or
a third party the duty of the jury was
simply to extract the truth iron the mass ot
evidence and found their verdict upon jt
the law gave the confidence of security in
doing so and would take up the case as it
fell thus iegitmately from their hands
the indictment was next alluded to and
the qualify and degrees of crime as included
under tfie general law of homicide described
these distinctions were briefly enumerated
as were also the nature and effect of piemedi
tation or malicious motives pointed out as
they operated as an aggravation of any act of
homicide the nature of provocation suf
ficient or limited was also explained and its
bearings on the several charges defined no
provocationby words only was allowed as a
justification for a mortal blow an opponent
carrying mortal weapons on his person and
threatening injury at the same time furnished
a kind of justification for homicide but any
thing malo ctninm being proved against an in
dividual precluded him from the benefits of
llie distil tiua made between murder and
manslaughter if a man used a deadly wea
pon in attacking a man and pleaded the in
tention not to do him harm by its use harm
having occurred which issued in death malice
was implied but if m attack and defence
homicide should ensuethe parties being
mutually engaged in a quarrelthe issue
having proceeded from heat of blood the
charge would be manslaughter
in the present case there was no evidence
of heat of blood or personal mutual coqflicf
whatever connected with it thfee tilings
weie to be proved
ist that death had occurred to dr park
naans bodv
d that hit life waa taken by john w
webstcv and
d did or did not dr george park man
meet his death by suicide or any accident
which might naturally have befallen him
in the eye of the law there were no dis
tinctions life having been taken by violence
tbe law took up its iavesiigstiun whoerei
might be charged and no individual was in
vestedwith any legal immunity who was
thus charged so it was with every uutior
crime none were exempt firoru the power
of the law the facts being known to its
officers and administrators the charge
against defendant is hat he murdered dr
george parkmati and otrtumsianttal evil
depce was brought to proxe the fact no erne
had eep the manner of death yet the law
aid it could h proved by cirpumstances few
of all criminal acts which destroy the publiq
peace and subvert its security would be
puntshed if the law provided otherwise this
law like all other had its disadvantages as
wpu as ita advantages crimebtunr general
ly commit wed in secret no possibility of proof
would be secured unless providence had pro
vided that the great chain of pircumsuncqs
which might follow should be taken to grove
that crime had been committed in many
very many instances tacts were capable of
beisg clear and correct conclusions arid cir
cumstantial evidence ot ibts character was
tnepefpre experimentally approved of t
supposing thatthe teeth found were pro
ved tw be those belonging to dr parkman
the body or collective pyrts of it foujtd al
though they thight notlie satisfactory identi
fied as the body of the deceased yet the
height and general appearance it furnished
mil being inconsistent with the presumption
that the body wa that of dr jevikwan were
npt to be thrown out of proof the piewnce
of the teeth favored thq presumption that the
body might be there several analogous in
stances were enumerated to itlußiraie this
point
the general conclusion draws froth the

a tale of napoleons time
the emperor napoleon had on one
occasion after aa audience with the
foreign minister remained conversing
with josephine in the deep recess of a
window which overlooked the gardens
of fontainebleau they were inter
rupted by the entrance of one of his
officers the chevalier de merville
who bowing said
sire a young lady from lyons has
been waiting hours for an opportunity
to see you
why was she not admitted ere
this asked napoleon hastily
four majesty forgets that tho aus
trian ambassadors have just depart
ed
ah i had forgotten a young
woman what is her business with
me
some petition i believe sire an
swered de merville
well well show her into our pres
ence now said the emperor looking
at josephine with a smile
the officer retired hut soon reap
peared in the corridor with a lady
leaning upon his arm whose face a
much as could be seen was very beau
tiful she trembled as she approached
the door
mademoiselle whispered hei
guide and pressing her hand take
courage but answer promptly whatevei
questions the emperor proposes h
detents hesitation then ushering
her ititu the spacious department ht
bowed and retired
the trembling girl seeing napoleon
on whom her loudest hopes depeuded
forgot herself and her timidity sht
thought only of another throwing
liernelf at the feet of napoleon sht
exclaimed in a voice choked with etno
lion mercy sire i sue for inercj
and pardon she could articulate m
more
josephine stepped from her partia
concealment and approaching tin
group contributed more by her swee
and sympathizing words oieucourage
ment to restore the courage of tut
young petitioner than even the em
peror by the graciousness of his man
uer as he bade her arise your pe
tilion mademoiselle said he
hennette arinand for that was hei
name looked imploringly at tlie em
peror and exclaimed ah sire j
ask pardon for louis deiamarre win
is condemned to be shot on the tnor
row oh grant him your royal par
don
a cloud gathered on the bvow o
napoleon as he interrupted her will
deserter mademoiselle he ha
twice deserted no he must be mad
an example to the rest of the reifi
meni
but the cause of his desertion
cried henrietta in ngony he wa
compelled sorely against his will t
joiu the army
what was the cause of his deser
lion interrupted napoleon
two weeks since answered hen
riette he received news that an oul
remaining parent his mother sire
was on her death bed and longed da
and night to behold her son again
louis knew that relief from his pos
was impossible his mind was fillet
with one thought that she might clos
her eyes forever ere they rested 
the son she loved so fondly
did she die asked the empress
with interest
n mudatne replied henriette
she at last recovered but hardh
had louis received her blessing beei
folded in her arms ere he was tori
from her grasp by the officers of jus
tice and dragged hither oh must ii
die meicy sire i beseech you
mademoiselle said napoleon
apparently this was tbt
second offence nave the first yoi
omitted that
it was answered henriette hesi
tating and cw riig it was that ht
heard i was to marry conrad ferrand
whom i detest as much as he does
added henriette with naivette
are you his sister that you feel sn
great au interest in bis fate asked
he emperor
ah no sire said henriette hei
lovely cheek assuming a still deeper
hue of the rose  ain only his
cousin
ah only his cousin repeated
napoleon glancing at josephine with
a half suppressed smile
on sire said hemiette recol
lect the anguish of his widowed moth
er when she reflects lhat the affection
if her sn for her is the cause of his
death what continued she can i
do to save himand the poor girl
forgetting the presence of royalty
iurst into tears the kindhearted
josephine glanced at the emperorwith
eyes expressive of pity and sympathy
she noticed the workings of his face
and felt at once that it was very un
certain whether louis deiamarre was
shot the next morning
napoeon approached the weeping
girl she hastily looked up and dried
her tears
mademoiselle said he would
vou give your life for his would
you die could louis deiamarre be re
lored to life liberty and his mother i
henriette started back turned dead
ly pale looked fixedly at the emperor i
i moment then turning away she
uried her face in her hands after
nlence of soma moments she was
deadly pale but an air of firm determi
nation rested upon her lace  am
villing said she in a very low but
calm voice
napoleon looked at bar with sur
prise as if be had not expected so
ready an acquiescence in his proposal
i will see you again aaid he in
he meantime accept such apartments
or your accommodation as i shall di
rect so saying the emperor him
self escorted her to the door and whis
periog in tba ear of da merville
resigned her to his ear

b writte stood alone in a spacious
magnificent apartment hour bad
aeti unobserved ao intensely was
he absobed in reverie a small foldre
paper waa tightly grasped in one hand
a it waa traced these words a de
rter is condemned by tba laws of thi
ermy to suffer death if you wish
louis dslamarrs rostered to liberty
the meant are in your power ere
morning dawns be may be on hit way
to join hit mother whom be to much
loves
ah murmured henriette do i
not love him too pressing her hand
upon her heart as if to hush its tumult
uous beatings she paced the apart
ment the door opened and the che
valier de merville entered he
paused ere he articulated made
moiselle
i am ready replied thehighmind
ed henriette my decision is made
de merville appeared to compre
hend the important of her words he
looked upon her in reverence as well
at admiration as she stood with the
high resolve impressed upon her beauti
ful brow follow me mademoiselle
said he they traversed long corrihoia
and uutnerous suites of superb apart
ments and descending a staircase
quickly reached an outer court com
niuuicating with the guaid house
enteri g this henriette was ushered
by her guide into a small uutenanied
room where she was soon left to her
self she looked around on a chair
was flung a uniform of the regiment to
wliicti louis belonged on a table lay
a plumed cap henriette comprehend
ed it all in a moment quickly habit
ing herself in the uniform she stood
belore the small mirror and gather
ing up her beautiful brown tresses in a
knot placed ihe cap upon her head
she almost uttered a cry of joy at the
success of her transformation a little
below the stature of louts th  cap ad
ded to her height while its long black
plumes sweeping over her face effec
tually concealed it from view she
knew that she was to be led to the fatal
ground at the morrows dawn the
bullet which would have struck louis
to the eaith would pierce her heart
but she shrunk not hack love tri
umphed over the timid womans nature
louiss mother will bless me in her
heart she whispered louis him
self will never loiget ine ah often
has he sworn that lie loved tne better
than all things else beside drawing
a lock of raven hair from her bosuui
she pressed it to her lips then breathed
a prayer to heaven
morning dawned the sound ol
footsteps aroused henriette she start
ed up grasping the band ot hair

part of the guard house happily igno

so well the soldiers whose bullets
were intended to pierce the heait ol
louis had taken their proper distances
and only awaited the word ofcouiiiiaud
from the emperor who was slatioued
at a window commanding a view of the

an argument against early

of the wiseand good franklin upon
this subject who was a warm advocatt
in its favor perhaps franklin wa
philosophically right in his opinion but
facts go to prove that he was practical
ly wrong for instance gentlemen
all know or should know that child
