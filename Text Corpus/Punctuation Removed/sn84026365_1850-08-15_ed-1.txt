southern dictation in the
senate
the attempt of mr pratt one of the
whig senators from maryland to
bully senator seward ot new york is
another specimen of the peculiar tac
tics by which the south controls the
legislation of the country mr seward
proposed an amendment to the com
promise bill viz that at some fixed
time after the president has ascer
tained that the constitution of new
mexico is republican in its character
he shall have authority to issue his
proclamation admitting her into the
union mr pratt rose in a towering
passion and charged that the amend
ment was a violation of the constitution
and could only come from a senator
who had pleaded that there was a
higher law than the constitution and
in conflict with it mr seward dis
tinctly and calmly disclaimed mr ps
verson of his remark mr pratt re
plied with new violence and declared
that mr seward ought to be expelled
from the mr raid win of con j
necticut rose and read the objectionable
sentenco from mr sewardsspeech
and defended it mr hale did the
same and said that if an agreement
with mr seward in such an opinion was
an offence for which a senator de
served expulsion he mr hale and
some others would be expelled mr
pratt replied that he would include him
in the motion with great pleasure mr
atchison of missouri and mr foote
expressed their opinions agreeing with
mr pratt mr chase of ohio did not
like to hear these declarations of offen
sive purposes he would rather see an
attempt made to carry them out the
correspondent of the n y herald says
that mr foote had a retort and a
look from mr chasewhich constituted
the most powerful argument of the days j
debate we have seen nothing like
the instantaneous effect it produced j
mr clays assault upon john davis
was in similar spirit with mr pratts j
attack mr clay was arguing that
the great staple articles of the south
would not be cultivated in new mexi
co and hence slave labor would be t
valueless there he then went on to
say but the hon senator from
massachusetts mr davis has found
out a new object of temptation in re
spect to slaves in new mexico he
has employed an expression which filled
all of us with profound regret on ac
count of the dignity the character ofi
the senator and the high stations
which he has occupied he spoke of
new mexico being adapted to the j
breeding of slaves he has had the
good sense to omit that expression in
his printed speech and to substitute for
it the traffic in slaves here mr
davis in his seat remarked i be
lieve i did not use that expressionj
mr clay replied the senator did
employ it for it was heard and noticed j
by more than myself mr davis
again said that according to the best of
his recollection he used the word traf
fic clay went on
that is the language of the gen
tlemans speech as printed but the
word breeding was used by the gen
tleman or i never heard a word of the
speech several senators took note of
it and we expressed how much we were
shocked and surprised at it it was
one of the principal topics ot thesen
atorsspeech to talk about the cotton
power the cotton interest and the
breeding of slaves now if the sena
tor had put it on the ground of a lapsus
linguae from the heat of debate or the
nnguarded character of debate ishod
not insist upon attributing it to him but
the expression was used by him and i
remarked it it was fixed upon my
memory and very much did i regret
that he made use of it this talk sir
about the cotton power the lords of the
loom and the breeding of slaves will
do for the barrooms of crossroad tav
erns but  never hoped or expected to
hear upon the floor of the senate such
epithets applied to the great manufac
turers of the north or the cotton grow
ers of the south
then he proceeded to tell how he
bad struggled by the side of mr davis
yol  no 
for protective tariffs and how many
southern men and southern states had
stood with them and how the northern
locofoco states had gone the other
way and how mr davis would not get
protection to manufactures bv throwing
out such taunts in relation to the cotton
power or the slave breeding interest
and with a great deal more of this sol
emn kind ot humbug he wound up as
follows
this charge upon the slaveholdii l
states for breeding slaves for ru
ket is utterly false and giuu a
no such purpose ever enters oeic
into the mind of any slaveholder
takes of t slaves he fosters
them a d treats them often with the ten
derness of his own children they
multiply on his hands he cannot find
employment for them and he is ulti
mately but most reluctantly and pain
fully compelled to part with some of
them because of the increase of num
bers and the want of occupation but
to say that it is the purpose design or
object of the slaveholder to breed
slaves as he would breed domestic ani
mals for a foreign market is untrue in
fact and unkind to be imputed or ever
intimated by any one and it is not by
such reproachful epithets as lords of
the loom lords of the plantation
the slave power and the money
power that this country is to be har
monized especially when we are de
bating upon these great measures which
are essential to its onward progress
and to its present and future pros
perity
and john davis submitted to this
scourging as a plantation nigger
would submit to a flogging from an
overseer he uttered not a word
what cause was there for clays
grossly offensive attack we suppose
that it is as notorious in spite of mr
clays denial as any fact in the world
that the breeding of slaves is made
a business in some parts of the south
a matter of calculationthe sale of
human flesh and blood is such a fact
too delicate to be alluded to at all oris
the word breeding too offensive for
delicate southern ears the word is
a good one it expresses precisely the
fact which traffic does not mr
davis in trying to express hs meaning
would no doubt choose words to suit
his case and if he selected the word
breeding he took the right word
it he used that word and then expunged
it and denied its use he is the mean
est of cowards if he did not use it it
was proper to say so but he should not
have suffered clays offensive style of
attack to pass without reply
icjpwe give place to blacksons
communicatioti with great pleasure
we were not at the meeting alluded to
and depended upon a friend for the
sketch we made who we doubt not
gave it as correctly as he could we
have lived long enough to learn that no
two men will report the same proceed
ings alike especially while there is ex
citement and such excitement as pre
failed at the meeting we may as
well here say that it is the candid opin
ion among the white folks who were
there that mr woodson was assailed
without cause and that he acted more
creditable than any of his opponents
pittsburgh post
mr editor l regret to see the
remarks in the post of this morning re
specting the meetings held in this city
by frederick douglass under the
heading trouble among the anti
slavery men the entire article i
think will make a false impression with
respect to the character of those meet
ings it is stated that the wylie street
church was refused on sunday but
on tuesday mr douglass and a large
audience took possession of it now
this sounds as if mr douglass and his
friends without grant or permission
had taken possession of the church
when nothing could be further trom
the fact in the case mr douglass
had obtained the entire consent of the
officers of the church for the use
of the house in qnestion there was
great noise and confusion there
wasbut where out of doors caused
by a woman i am informed who un
der the window of the church at
tempted to whip her poor drunken hus
band the noise and confusion should
not therefore be set to the account of
the meeting for my part considering
that the noise was made so near the
church i deem it quite surprising that
the audience remained so quiet and
orderly as they did
i have to complain too that while
the article in question speaks strongly
in regard to the severity of mr doug
lass towards mr woodson it does not
state with equal strength the cause
which provoked that severity the
complaint against mr w w r as not that
he came into the meeting of mr d
and charged him with infidel views but
that he had done so in the absence of
mr douglass and in such a manner
as to deprive the latter of the oppor
tunity to set himself right before the
wilie street church and the public it
was this seeming unfairness that roused
ths indignation of the negro orator and
called forth his withering denunciation
your reporter states that there were
one or two fights during the meeting
in this statement there is not a word of
truth except in the case above cited
and with that the meeting had nothing
whatever to do and is therefore by no
means responsible for it
by giving the above an insertion in
your forthcoming edition you will ob
lige very respectfully

first of august celebration
at pittsburgh
the celebration of the first of
august by the colored citizens was
quite as orderly and well managed as
any fourth of july celebration we have
ever attended the heavy rain during
the afternoon interrupted the proceed
ings for some time but they were re
sumed with nndiminished spirit after the
bhe speeches were very goodthat

the white portion of the audience as
well as among the colored and he is
evidently an able man a clearthink

fred douglass declaring his total in
ability to attend able addresses were
delivered by messrs peck freeman
delany yashon and one or two other
colored gentlemen and messrs s fol
jambe r h kerr and general lari

in behalf of human liberty
one unpleasant accident marred the
pleasure of the day a son of rev
munroe while playing with powder
imprudently held his hands and face
over the train and burned himself very
badly hewas in great agony and
his father finally took him up to the
city to procure medical relief
the following is the letter of mr
douglass
j b yashon my dear sirl
have but just reached erie being 
hours performing the trip which i had
expected to make in the space of thirty
six and worse still i have to intorm
you that there is no hope of my being
able to get a passage from here to buf
falo before five oclock this afternoon
these circumstances should they prove
as favorable as i hope forbid me long
er to cherish the expectation of being
present with my friends in pittsburg on
the first of august i have been de
ceived and disappointed by the hand
bills of this canal line company
they profess to convey passengers from
beaver to erie in thirtysix hours and
they often delay them on their journey
full forty eight hours this gross im
position on the traveling public ought
to be exposed and corrected the
outrage ought not to be endured it
makes all chance ot correct calculation
and arrangemorvt out nf tim tiinn
and throngs the travellers pathway
with vexatious disappointments
i have no language to express my
regrets at the prospects now before me
i feel the disappointment all the more
keenly because the hope of being pre
sent at your celebration seemed to have
the approbation of all past circum
stances and arrangements i was re
leased from my engagement at penn
yan tnat i might goto medina i was
released from medina by the offer of
my friend mr langston to fill that ap
pointment but now all my plans
have failed and my ardent hopes are
so far as i can see entirely defeated
it is rendered nearly certain that i can
not be present in pittsburg at the grand
celebration and that the pleasure of
mingling my voice with the exulting
multitude will be denied to me
the only consolation now left me is
that i can still be with you on that oc
casion in spirit aim and principle
that though time and distance have mu
tually interposed their insurmountable
barriers against my botfiiy presence
that neither can eusiuve absolutely
the free spirit this impalpable es
sence this mysterious agent this
spark of the divine mind is free and is
all that can give freedom to an enslav

walls can imprison it like the quick
flash of electric fire in the sky it can
defy all distance spurn all restraint
break through all bonds encircle the

from the christian citizen
colored sons of temperance
there sometimes occur circumstan
ces so anomalous so incongruous so
utterly monstrous in the action of soci
eties which wear phylacteries on their
foreheads inscribed with virtuous pro
fessions that they tempt one to doubt
the verity of logic and to question the
existence of a human moral nature
we say human moral nature because
the beasts of the field never manifest
so mean a quality of instinct as are
some of the manifestations of the in
stincts of their human brothers who
have perhaps been cradled on the
knees of christian mothers and whose
schooling has cost the state fifty dollars
each
the national division of the sons of
temperance at their late annual con
vention in boston voted seventysix
to six that it is improper and illegal to
admit colored men into the general
union perhaps this verdict stands un
paralleled in the history of opinion for
cool insolence and for moral atrocity
wo defy egyptian jew greek ro
man scythian or south carolinian to
produce a parellel verdict to it within
the whole compass of their history
the motto of the sons of temperance
is love purity fidelity these are
the trinity of splendid abstractions
which they print upon their banners
and which they solemnly accept as the
ideal of their moral life the great
majority of these sons of temperance
are northern men all of them are
professing republicans and yet their
national division their amphictyon
their federal council has proposed a
resolution that would have made pha
raoh blush and nicholas of russia to
hang his head for shameseventy
six members ofthis national division
of republican sons of temperance
stand forward not as the spaniels of
the south not as the apologists of sla
very not as despots of politics nor
despots of social estate but in the
hitherto unheard position of despots to
virtue
we believe that the world was not
previously aware that virtuous princi
ples possessed certain proper colors
and certain legal proprieties until the
teetotal syllogists assembled at bos
ton propounded this new gospel ofpro
priety and legality if we construe
the word propriety as decency and le
gality as natural right perhaps there
might be something of truth and jus
tice discovered in this unique verdict
but it would not redound to the advan
tage of paleface jury the positive
indecency of their inhuman decision
deprives themselves of the rights of hu
manity and their unhallowed proposi
tion of legality which is opposed to all
gods moral laws cuts them off from
legal fellowship with every true man
our colored brethren have been driven
from the ballotbox and contumeliously
expelled from the railway car and the
church pew and now here are men
seeking to aggravate those crimes and
god is the father of us all and all men are brethren
insults by ostracising them from the
peoples moral unions
we ask ever man of heart every
man who has not been utterly contam
inated by the logic of the south to
look this vote of the national division
of the sons of temperance steadily in
the face and then to ask himself if
this new aristocracythis aristocracy
of moral pretensionit is to be tolera
in this land arc men because cne
perhaps of african mingles
s v n ghths ui their caucasian
i j jo be driven from amongst us
and a participation in virtuous
action with us upon account of this
think on the treason even according
to the logic of captain rynders of con
demning seven eights of an anglosax
on to bondage to insult and to fash
ionable infamy became a portion of
that blood that flowed in the heart of
cleopatra flows in his veins
we grow sad as we contemplate the
obliquity of moral vision that condemns
us to review this most inhuman vote
which denies to our colored brethren
all participation in the spread of moral
virtue and in the elevation of man
kind
we take heart again and thank god
however that the justice of massachu
setts is true to humanity in this case
although the national division has
been faithless the district sections
have calmly nobly manfully repudia
ted this decision of the national di
vision and have reproved its seventy
six members with the most courteous
but at the same most effective
of all reproofsthey have refused to
sustain their decree
this vote is as humiliating if we
examine it collaterally as it is so posi
tively positively it demonstrates an
amount of prejudice against color in
the north that even seeks to poison
with its stagnant odors our very
benevolent unions and it shows a sub
serviency to the dictation of the south
that is truly saddening such verdicts
as this cannot degrade men of color
they rather make the red blood mount
into the cheek of white men at the mor
al debasement of their race
virtue knows no clime no condition
no race no order as the negro arose
from the hand of god an equal in the
economy of the creation with the
white man so did god give him an
equal power and right to accept those
virtues which sprang from the afflu
ence of his divine mind god placed
in the soul of the negro an eternal and
fclfovitable legality or natural right to
iove virtue and liberty and ho will
forever acknowledge the beautiful pro
priety of that love even although ev
ery man should endorse a counter lie
god before the world was decreed a
law stronger than any opinion that the
national division of tho sons of tem
perance has dared or wiil ever dare
to propose and that law is the essential
equality of man and the universal
brotherhood of virtue by this decree
eternal as the heavens it is legal it is
proper for colored men to unite with
all other men to elevate humanity in
spite of such inhuman treason as was
perpetrated by the national division of
the sons of temperance of boston

approving of the verdict refused to
grant a new trial which was applied

of exceptions was then taken and tried
before the general court at richmond

jury summoned mostly from another
county one of the jury was from the

could have a fair and impartial hearing
he was again found guilty and again
sentenced to be hung another bill
of exceptions was laid before the gen

granted this was more that the pa

important development
treasonable project
i lie washington correspondent of
the courier and enquirer in a letter
dated august d makes the following
startling development of a project to
dissolve the union and form a southern
confederacy which should embrace
the republic of mexico
the facts which i am about to dis
close will necessarily excite as much
astonishment throughout the country
as they did in my mind when they
were first presented with all the in
trinsic evidence of undoubted truth
and with a weight of direct authority
which admitted of no misapprehension
i learn from an unquestionable source
that a gentleman reported to be of
considerable character and influence
in the visited mexico incognito
in the month of april last and after
various conferences with persons in
authorityfinally submitted a formal and
wellprepared proposition for the es
tablishment of a southern confederacy
into which that republic was to be
merged one of the arguments and
reasons that were urged upon the per
sons to whom this scheme was submit
ted as entitling it to favorable con
sideration was that the city of mexico
would probably be selected as the capi
tal of the new empire since a part of
the plan embraced the extension of its
territory peaceably or forcibly fur
ther south that project was laid be
fore the mexican cabinet by m la
conza the minister of foreign affairs
and was urged by him in council in a
speech of considerable length it was
resisted brother membersof the cabi
net and finally declined the agent
of this nefarious cheme left soon after
for california mr doyle the british
minister was made aware of the pro
ceedings if ho did not lend them coun
tenance but the impression is that the
conspiracy received decided encour
agement from the british legation i
am restrained by considerations affect
ing the personal safety of individuals
from disclosing the reasons which op
erated on the mexican cabinet in re
jecting this infamous overture and al
so of doing justice to those who entitled
themselves to immortal honor for scorn
ing and denouncing the proposition of
the traitors the day may not be far
distant when they can receive full jus
tice and with less danger than at
present president taylor was not
ignorant of this design and with his
usual sagacity and resolution had pro
vided against injurious consequences
it might be mooted as a serious
question whether it is not the duty of
our government to demand of mexico
whether a scheme for its dismember
ment was thus entertained  under
take to say emphatically and unquali
fiedly such is my confidence in the in
formation which has been placed at my
disposal so far as the great fact is con
cerned that this movement may b
verified in every essential particular
that  have stated if congress or the
execntive department will direct the
necessary inquiries to be instituted if
the proot was questionable in any
form i would not entertain it but hav
ing seen the testimony i have felt not
only justified but impelled by a sense
of moral obligation in giving this state

battle week tuesday june 
was the anniversary of the memorable
battle of waterloo and the current
week is not worthy for the aniversary
of more bloody and important battles
fought within some two cenuries past
than any other seven days of the year
the battle of naseby between the
cavaliers and roundheada was fought
june   of the russian and
swedes at poultowa june  
of the allies and french at dettingen
june   of the austrians and
prussians at kolin june   of
the americans and british at bunker
hill june   of the russians
and french at frebbia june  
of the same at marengo june 
 and again at friedlands june
  of the british and french at
salamanca june   of the
british and americans at niagara
june   of the french and prus
sians at ligny june   and
lastly of the british and french at
waterloo june   it would be
easy to show that in most of these
terrible fights something decisive has
been gained to the great cause of civil
liberty and that thus the entire week
is made up of redletter days in the
calender of freedom
none are so hard to please as those
whom satiety of pleasure makes weary
of themselves nor any so readily pro
voked as those who have been always
courted with an emulation of civility
sir robert peel as an orator
sir robert peels speeches were
like himself in practical there elo
quence consisted in their persuasive
ness in the skill with which the argu
ments were evolved and in the illus
trations generally familiar and tan
gible to the general his state
ments of his case were singularly lucid
built up laboriously and constructed
with precision so as to make them
clear to the least ready capacity dur
ing the latter years of his career ho
had as it were to instruct the public
in pi inciples and details more espe
cially on commercial questions and of
course there remains much on record
which had only a temporary and fleet
ing interest morover to impress his
purpose on his hearers he would fre
quently repeat his arguments whicn
though effective in the delivery was
teadious to peruse notwithstanding
these drawbacks sir robert peel
from the singular fascination of his man
ner and the pains he took to adapt
himself to the various capacities he had
to address was one of the most per
suasive and influential speakers ofhis
time in fact his was the eloquence
adapted to a popular assembly which
was to be assailed not merely through
prejudices habits of thought interests
not always of the highest order as well
as through reason looking at the
materials of which his speeches were
formed the winning art of the speaker
was the more to be admired let us
add that when the ordinary necessities
of the debate did not compel sir rob
ert peel to descend to tne level of tho
average of his hearers he could be as
lofty and philosophical as the most
elaborate orators his personal vindi
cations at great crises of his life were
characterised by a striking dignity
which uniformly commanded respect
from the house of commons such a
combination of qualitiesof wisdom
the fruit of long experienceof caution
the consequence not of timidity but of
prudenceof boldness tempered by
sagacity of information gleaned
through a long and laborous public life
of high probity and sensitive honor
of statesmanlike tvisdom not disdain
ing popular influence and sympathy
of eloquence spontaneously springing
from the peculiar wants of his position
and intuitively adapted to the occa
sions of its excercisesuch a rare
union of many requisites for a states
man and minister in a popular govern
ment will not soon be seen again in anv
individual nowhere will his loss be
more deplored than in that house of
commons where he was accustomed
o rule by the power of his persuasive
eloquence with almost absolute sway

on the
texas boundary question
to the senate and house of representatives
i herewith transmit to the two houses of
congress a letter from his excellency the
governor of texas dated on the th of
june last addressed to the late president of
the united states which not having been
answeied by him came to my hands on his
death and i also transmit a copy of the an
swer which i have felt it to be my duty to
cause to be made to that communicatihn
congress will perceive that the governor of
texas officially states that by authority of
the legislature of that state he despatched
a special commissioner with full power and
instructions to extend the civil jurisdiction of
the state over the unorganized counties of
el paso worth presido and santa fe
situated on its northwestern limits he pro
ceeds to say that the commissioner had
reported to him in an official form that the
military officers employed in the service ol
the u s stationed at santa fe interposed
adversely with the inhabitants to the fulfil
ment of his object and in favor of the estab
lishment of a separate state government
east of the rio grande within the rightful
limits of the state of texas
these four counties which texas proposes
to establish and organize being within her
own jurisdiction extended over the whole of
the territory east of rio giande which has
been heretofore regarded e ar osential and
integral part of the departmentof new mexi
co and actually governed and possessed by
her people until conquered and severed from
the republic of mexico by the american
arms the legislature of texas has
been called together by the governor for the
purpose as is understood of maintaining her
claim to the territory east of the rio grande
and of establishing over it her own jurisdic
tion and her own laws by force
these proceedings of texas may well
arrest the attention of all branches of ihe
government of the united states and  re
joice that they occur while congress is yet in
session a crisis may be brought on which
shall summon the two houses of congress
and still more directly the executive govern
ment to an immediate performance of their
respective duties under the constitution of the
united states
the president is constituted commander
inchief of the army and navy and of the
militia of the several states when called into
the actual service of the united states the
constitution declares also that lie shall take
care of that the laws be faithfully executed
and that he shall from time to time give to
congress information of the state of the
union
congress has power under the constitution
to provide for calling out the militia to exe
cute the laws of the union and suitable and
appropriate acts of congress have been
passed as well for providing for calling forth
the militia as for placing other suitable and
efficient means in the hands of the president
to enable him to discharge the constitutional
functions of his office the second section
of the act of the th of february  de
clares that whenever the laws of the united
state shall be opposed or their execution ob
structed in any state by combinations too
powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary
course of judicial proceedings or the power
vested in the marshals the president may
call forth the militia so far as may be neces
sary to suppress such combinations and to
cause the laws to be duly executed
bv the act of march d  it is provided
that in all cases to the obstructions of the
laws either of the united states or any indi
vidual state orterritory w hen it is lawfu
for the president to call forth the military to
the purpose of causing the laws to be dnlv
executed it shall be lawful for him to employ
for the purposes such part of the land o
naval force of the united slates as lie shal
judge necessary these several enactment
are now in full force if therefore the law
of the united states are opposed ot obstruct
ed in any state or territory by combinations
too powerful to be suppressed by the judieia
or civil authorities and it becomes a case in
which it is the duty of the president either
to call out the militia or to employ the mili
tary or naval force of the united states or u
do both if in his judgment exigency of the
occasion shall so require for the purpose ot
suppressing such combination the consti
tutional duty of the president is plain ano
peremtory the authority vested in him by
law for the performance of his duty is clear
and ample texas as a states is authorizec
to maintain her own laws so far as they are
not repugnant to the constitution laws and
treaties of the united states to suppress in
surrections against her authority and to
punish those who commit treason against the
state according to the forms provided by her
own constitution and her own laws but
this power is local and confined entirely
within the limits of texas herself she can
fiossiby confer no authority which can be
awfully exercised beyond her own boundary
all this is plain and hardly needs argument
or elucidation if texas militia tliereiore
march into any one of the other states or
into any territory of the united states there
to execute or enforce any law of texas they
beeome at that moment trespassers they are
no longer under the protection of any law ful
authority and are to be regarded merely as
intrudes and if within such state or terri
tory they obstruct any law of the united
slates either py f rce of arms or mere power
of numbers constituting such a combination
as is too powerful to be suppressed by the
civil authority the president of the united
states has no option left to him but is bound
to obey the solemn injunction of the constitu
tion and exercise the high powers vested in
him by that instrument and by the acts of
congressor if any civil posse armed or
unarmed enter into anv territory of the
united states under the protection of the
laws thereof with the intention to seize indi
viduals to be cairied elsewhere for trial for
alleged offences and this posse be too pow
erful to be resisted by the local and civil au
thorities such seisure or attempt to seize is
to be prevented or resisted by the authorities
of the united slates the grave and impor
tant question now arises whether there be in
the territory of new mexico any existing
law of the united states opposition to which
or obstruction of w hich would constitute a
case calling for the interposition of the au
thority vested in the president
the constitution of the united states de
clares that the constitution and laws of the
united statas which shall be made in pur
suance thereof and all the treaties made or
which shall be made under the authority of
the united states shall be the supreme law
of the land if therefore new mexico be a
territory of the united states and if any
treaty stipulation be in force therein such
treaty stipulation is the supreme law of the
land and is to be maintained and upheld
and accordingly in the letter to the governor
of texas my reasons are given for believing
that new mexico is now a territory of the
united states with the same extent and the
same boundaries which belonged te it in the
actual possession of the republic of mexico
and before the late war in the early part of
that war both california and new mexico
were conquered by the arms of the united
states and were in the military possession of
the united states at the date of the treaty
of peace by that treaty the title by conquest
was confirmed and these territories pro
vinces or departments separated from mexico
forever and by the same treaty certain im
portant rights and securities were solemnly
guaranteed to the inhabitants residing there
in by the fifth article of the treaty it is
declared that the boundary line between the
two republics shall commence in the gulf of
mexico three leagues from land opposite the
mouth of the rio grande otherwise called
the rio bravo del norte or oppusite the
mouth of its deepest branch if it should make
more than one branch emptying directly into
the sea from thence up the middle of that
river following the deepestchannel where it
has more than one to the point where it
strikes the southern boundary of new mexico
thence westwardly along the whole southern
boundary of new mexico which runs north
of the town called paso to its western boun
dary termination thence westward along the
western line of new mexico until it intersects
the first branch of the river gifa or if it
should not inleisect any branch of that liver
then to the point on the said line nearest to
such branch and thence in a direct line to the
same thence down the middleiof said branch
and of the said river until it empties into the
rio colorado thence across the colorado
following the division line between upper and
lower california to the pacific ocean
the bth article of this trea yis in the
following terms the inhabitants of mexi
can origin now established in territories pre
viously belonging to mexico and who remain
for the future within the limits of the united
states shall be free to continue where they
now reside or to remove at any time to the
mexican republic retaining the property
which they possess in the said territory or
disposing thereof and removing the proceeds
wherever they please without being subject
ed on this account to any contribution lax or
charge whatever those who shall prefer to
remain in the said territories may either re
tain the tittle and rights of mexican citizens
or acquire those of citizens of the united
states hut they shall be under obligation to
make their election within one year from the
date of the exchange of ratifications of this
treatv and whesthroaiaifrm itie said
territories after the expiration of that yej
without having declared their intention to
retain the character of mexicans shall be
considered to have elected to become citizens
of the united states in the said territories
property of every kind now belonging to
mexicans not established there shall be in
violate the present owners their heirs and
all mexicans who may hereafter acquire said
property by contract shall enjoy with respect
to it guarantees equally ample as if the same
belonged to citizens of the united states
the th article of the treaty is in these
words the mexicans who in the territo
ries aforesaid shall not preserve the character
of citizens of the mexican republic conform
ably with what is stipulated in the preced
ing article shall be incorporated into the
union of the united states and be admitted
at the proper time to be judged of by the
congress of the united states to the enjoy
ment of all the tights of citizens of the united
states according to the principles of the con
stitution andin the meantime shall be main
tained and protected in the free enjoyment
of their liberty and property and secured in
the free exercise of their religion without re
striction it is plain therefore in the face
of these treaty stipulations that all mexicans
established in territories north or east ot the
line of demarcation already mentioned come
within the protection of the th article and
that the treaty being a part of the supreme
law of the land extends over all such mexi
cans and assures to them perfect security in
the free enjoyment of their liberty and pro
perty and in the free exercise of their re
ligion and this supreme law of ihe land is
in actual force over this terriiory and is to
be maintained until it shall be displaced or
superseded by other legal provisions or ob
structed by combinations too powerful to be
suppressed by the civil authority
this case is one which comes within the
provisions of the law and which obliges the
president to enforce these provisions neither
the constitution nor the laws nor iny duty or
my oath of office leave me any alternative
or any choice of ray action the executive
government of the united states has no pow
er or authority to determine what was the
true line of boundary between mexico and the
united states before the treaty of guada
loupe hidalgo nor has it any such power
now since the question has become one be
tween the state of texas and the united
states so far as this boundary is doubtful
that doubt should be removed by some act of
congress to which the assent of texas may
be necessary by some appropriate mode of
legal adjudication but in the meantime if
disturbances or collisions arise or should be
threatened it is absolutely incumbent on the
executive government however painful the
duty to take cate that the laws are faithful
ly maintained he can regard only the
actual state of things existing in the date of
the treaty and is bound to protect all inhabi
tants who were then established and now re
main north and east of the line of demarcation
in the full enjoyment of their liberties and
property according to the provisions the th
article of the treaty in other words all
now regarded as new mexico which
was possessed and occupied as new mexico
by the citizens of new mexico at the date of
the treaty until a definite line of boundary
shall be established and by competent au
thority this assertion of duty to protect the
people of new mexico from threatened vio
lence or from liability to be earned into
iexas for trial for alleged offences against
texan laws does not at ail include any claim
of oower on the part of the executive to es
tablish any civil or military government with
in that territory that power belongs ex
clusively to the legislative department and
congress is the sole judge of the time and
manner of creating or authorising any such
government the duty oi the executive only
applies to the execution of laws and the
maintenance of treaties actually in force and
the protection of all the people of the united
states in the enjoyment of the lights which
those treaties and laws guarantee it is ex
ceedingly desirable that no occasion should
arise for the exercise of the powers thus ves
ted in the president by the constitution and
the laws with whatever mildness those
powers might be executed or however clear
the case of necessity yet might
nevertheless follow which no human sagacity
can foresee
 have thus laid before congress the com
munication of his excellency the governor of
texas and the answer thereto and i have
made such observations as  have thought the
occasion called for respecting constitutional
obligations which may arise in the future pro
gress of things and may devolve on me to
discharge i hope i shall not be regarded as
stepping aside from the line of my duty not
withstanding i am aware that the subject is
now before both houses if i express my deep
and earnest conviction of the importance of an
immediate decision oi arrangement for the
settlement of the question of the boundary
between texas and the territory of new
mexico all considerations of justice gene
ral expediency and domestic tranquility call
for this it seems to be in its character and
by position the first or one of the first of the
questions growing out of the acquisition of
california and new mexico cannot be made
either a state or a territory until it shall be
first ascertained what new mexico is and
what are her limits and boundaries these
cannot be fixed or known fill the line of divi
sion between her and texas shall be ascer
tained and established numerous and weighty
reasons conspire in my judgement to show
that this divisional line should be established
by congress with the assent of the sweriv
ment of texas in the first place this seems
by far the most prompt mode of proceeding
by which the end can be accomplished if
judicial proceedings were resorted to such
proceedings would necessarily be slow anct
years would pass by in all probability before
the controversy could be ended so great a
delay in this case is to be avoided if possible
such delay would he every way inconvenient
and might be the occasion of disturbances and
collisions for the same reason  would with
the utmost defence to the wisdom of congress
express a doubt of the expediency of the ap
pointment of commissioners and of examina
tion estimate and award of indemnity to be
made by them this would be but a species of
arbitration which might last as long as a
suit at law so fat as lam able to compre
hend the general facts are now all known
and congress is as capable of deciding it
justly and properly now as it probably would
be after the report of the commissioners
if the claim of title on the part of texas
appears to be well founded in the whole or
part it is in the competency of congress to
offer her an indemnity for the surrender of
the claim in a case lik this surrounded as
it is by many cogent considerations all call
ing for an amicable adjustment and immediate
settlement the states would be justi
fied in my opinion in allowing an indemnity
to texas not unreasonable or extravagant
but lair liberal and awarded in a just
spirit of accommodation  think no event
would be hailed with more gratification by
the people of the united states than the
amicable adjustment of these difficult ques
tions which have for a long time agitated the
country and occupied to the exclusion of
other subjects the time and attention of con
gress having thus freely communicated the
result of my own reflection on the most ad
visable mode of adjusting this boundary ques
tion  shall nevertheless cheerfully acquiesce
in any other mode which the wfisdom of con
gress may devise and in conclusion  repeat
try conviction that every consideration of the
public interest manifests the necessity of a
provision by congress for a settlement of this
boundary question before the present session
be brought to a close the settlement of
other questions connected with the same sub
ject within the same period is greatly to be
desired but the adjustment of this appears
to me to be ia thefiighest degveo important
in the tram of such an adjustment we may
well hope there will follow a return of bamm
ny and good will an increased attachment t
the union and the general satisfaction ofik

southern chivalry a writer in the
hartford republican says that it is amusing
to ruad the boass of the southern chivalry
particularly of that famous legion whose
headquarters appear to be fixed in south
carolinaa stale that has more negroes than
whites and contains almost as many inhabi
tans as ccnnecticut
during the mexican war south carolina
was represented in mexico by a volunteer
regiment composed of as fine young men as
the slate afforded in fact the state took
special pride in this regiment and great care
was taken in selecting the men for it
now it is well known to many who served
in the th or newengland regiment that
in the battle of churubusco this carefully
chosen regiment of south carolina palmet
tos had a most uncomfortable tremor of the
nerves at one time the consequences of which
might have been disastrous but for the su
perior steadiness of the new england regi
ment
the south carolina regiment being in
advance of the th was thrown into a panic
by the w histle of mexican bullets broke and
like a flock of disorderly sheep rolled back
on the new england regiment and threw it
into disorder but the new englandets recov
ered allowed the chivalry to pass through
their ranks to the rear ane under the direc
tion of their officers ransom and seymour
formed again amid the thickest of the fliyng
bulletsthe chivalry not having suf
ficient nerve to follow this example got be
hind a wall and building and there
much has been said of the flight of the d
indiana regiment at the battle of buena
vista and some of the chivalry papers
have stigmatized them as northern sol
diets but this feat of the palmettos at the
battle of churubsco has been passed over in
silence enan republican

as to the time and the manner a propriety
which gives value even to the least the man

mr frederick douglass and the
timesmr douglass has addressed ihe
following intelligent and manly letter to the
times
sir although i fear it may be an un
warrantable intrusion upon your lime and at
tention on my part i must yield to the strong
desire which moves me to tiiank you in the
name of and humanity lor your timely
remarks in the of june th on the
subject of americamselavery and more espe
cially for your animadversions on the brutal
assault made upon me by a mob while i w
quietly and inoffensively walking on the b
teiy at new york
the influence exerted upon the more
telligent class of the american people by t
judicious expression of british sense of ju
tice and humanity is immense and i belie
highly beneficial
the outrage committed upon me in ne
fork was the work of low and vicious pe
pie yet sir you were perfectly right
taking that outrage and the remarks mat
upon it by the globe as a far illustration
the bitter antipathy which is entertained her
even by the better class of white peop
against colored persons polished ameiica
gentlemen wmuld applaud a deed ofrufflanis
like theone in question although they mig
shrink fiom the performance of the deed
self my offence is alleged to be that of wal
ing down broadway in company of twovvhi
women this however is not a fair stat
ment of that offence my offence was that
walked down broadway in company wit
white persons on terms of equality had
been with those persons simply as a servan
and not as a friend i should have been re
garded with complacency by the refined ant
with respect by the vulgar class of white pe
sons who throng that great thoroughfare
the clamor here about human equality
meaningless we have here an aristocrac
of skin with which if a man be coveied ant
can keep out of the state prisons he pos
sesses the high privilege or insulting a color
ed man with the most ferfect impunity thi
class of aristocrats are never more dispieaset
than when they meet with an intelligent co
ored man they recognise in him a contra
diction to their ungenerous and unsound the
ories respecting the negro race and not be
ing able to reason him down to a level wit
the brute they use brute force to knock him
down to the desired level i am perhaps
trespassing too long upon your time ant
although it may be a small matter to you as
to how  may feel with respect to your noble
defence of injured and insulted humanity
could not be satisfied with myself without ex
pressing in my humble way my sincerest
gratitude for that defence
we have takenthe above from the lon
don inquirer and the latter doubtless copied
it from the london times the letter
was not originally intended for publication
but simply for the editor of the times
for whom we experienced the grateful feel
ings indicated in that letter their ptompt
and able article which was published a few
weeks since exposing to the world the
infamous conduct of a band of cowardly ruff
ians on the battery in new york and the
still more ruffianly tone of the new york
press ou the subject of that conduct was so
noble that poor as are the thanks of a slave
we felt encouraged to offer them since the
london times has taken up the subject
several other highly respectable and influential
british journals have denounced the cruel
brutal and barbarous attack upon us among
these we gratefully remember the london
standard of freedom and the london
inquirer each of these papers has made
that outrage the occasion for highly intel
ligent comments upon american customs
civilization and freedom f d
id  we have received the following aiticle
from our esteemed friend mrs henry rich
ardson of newcastleupontyne her time
and talents are now almost entirely devoted
to the h ree labor cause such industiy de
votion and perseverance as hers cannot be
employed in any cause without attracting
attention we are indebted to her zeal and
untiring pen for many important facts bearing
on the subject of free produce although we
do not attach the first importance to this
branch of the antislavery movement we
readily lay befoie our readeis such facts on
the subject as may be found in the following
article f d
cotton from portnatajan influen
tial colonist and mercantile gentleman has
addressed a letter of which the following is
a copy to an inhabitant of newcastleupon
tyne and as the subject of his communica
tion is of vital importance to a great staple
manufacture of this country we gateshead
observer gladly give it insertion in our
journal
port natal march  
knowing that you take a great interest in
the production of cotton produced by free
labor i have thought that a few lines from
natal would not be unacceptable though i
am sorry to slate as far as that article is con
cerned it is rather retrograding than pro
gressing and yet i am more than ever con
vinced that cotton can be produced here equal
if not superiot to any in the world and that
if cultivated on a proper scale by persons
who understand the climate and the peculiar
nature of the cotton plant it would yield a
a large return for capital employed besides
throwing open a most beautiful country to the
enterprise of thousands of european families
who through the means of this one article
alone would find employment at iheir various
callings but lam grieved beyond measure
to see vessel after vessel arriving w r ith emi
grants most or all of whom are totally unfit
for an undertaking like this to give you a
slight idea of the absurd notions formed in
england by many i may just mention that it
is not an uncommon thing to find individuals
provided with agricultuaal implements and
actually on their arrival here have not the
means to pay for the conveyance of them to
their land they appear never to have
thought that implements were of no use with
out cattle and that months must elapse before
they could expect a return for their labor
then there are certain difficulties that dis
courage otheusuch as being afraid of not
getting native labor all new comers find a
difficulty in getting natives they spoil them
in the first instance by overkindness and
not knowing their natural character soon find
themselves without a servant so convinced
am i that cotton will be a profitable article to
cultivate besides the immense good that will
result from it in a variety of ways  have
thought that should you know any party that
would be inclined to invest from one thousand
to fifteen hundred pounds in this way leaving
the entire management to myself i would on
certain conditions give up the business i have
rn town lei my premises and devote the
whole o tsy uib tu j energy to this one ob
ject this lam certain ot r m a one j
successful enterprising individual can show
good returns for his mitay there will soon be
plenty of followers but for tiew comers with
little or no meansno experience of the place
and everything new about them the diffij
culties appear insurmountable should mv
offer be approved of by any of your friends
my proposition would be thisthat not lessi
than one thousand or rather say fifteen
hundred pounds should be placed in the
cape of good hope bank at my disposal for
me to draw as occasion may require for this
efipecial purpose purchasing land and carry
ing on the plantation
tho finest land for cotton is on the other
side of theumgeni river where at the pres
ent moment i could purchase for cash the
finest cotton land foi s or s per acre
the land i would of course have registered
m the partys name who advanced the cash
in fact all business of importance such as
yearly or halfyearly accounts and reports i
should wish to pass through the hands of mr
d d buchanan who is an attorney of the
highest respectability here or any other per
son that might be thought fit and would be
satisfactory to all parties  should wish to
purchase not less than six or eight hundred
acres from one tree of the greenseed va
riety that i have growing in anything hut a
good situation neqr my house i have gather
ed full six and a half pounds annually for
the last ihree yearsabout three pounds the
first year six pounds of cotton as it
comes from the tree yields two pounds of
cotton one thousand such trees can
be grown on an acre of ground and there
must be some cause for it if they should on
ly produce half that quantity however for
safety i shall make my calculation on one
pound only of clean cotton instead of more
than two though i am persuaded that where
there is a right selection of soil and the
seasons are favourable for both crops two
housand pounds of clean coton will some
times be produced to the acre tou yiust
observe that all the principal expenses fall
in the first year afterwards the profits i
trust will be very great these expenses
however all tend to increase the value of the
properly lam not an advocate for putting
up temporary buildings but should use rough
stone procured on the spot and should wish j
to have fluted galvanized iron for the roof farj
warded whhout delay as it cannot always he
procured here there are also some other
articles which there might be a saving in
shipping direct to natal no person in
natal lias taken moie interest in this subject
than myself and should any of your friends
be inclined to further the cultivation of free
labour cotton and the interests of natal 
am prepared to give good security if requir
ed lor the due fulfilment on my pait of the
engagement having valuable property both
in town and near the town should my of
fer be accepted the first year i should ex
pect a salary of lo after the first year
i shall be contented with half the net profits
allowing soo for the purchase of land
i have calculated that there would not be
much less than seven or eight hundred pounds
expenses the first yedr after which the
expenses would be triflingservants wa
ges almost the only thing the first
years crop t calculate at oz clean cotton to
each tree which at d per lb supposing i
should get  acres sown the return would
he  os bd oi  s d per acre
the second year  acres or two hundred
thousand trees at one pound each at d per

less tlin halt what one tree producedl

ence from the friend as a satisfactory re
ply to those who will contend that respect for
human life by the government begets con
tempt for human life in society
mr editor in a recent conversation up
on the deathpenalty and advocate of the
satqe staled as an argument in its favor that
in michigan the experiment of its abolution
had been tried and proved a failure the leg
islature having been competed to restore the
penalty in consequence of the alarming in
crease of capital crime resulting from its ab
olition doubting the correctness of this
statement i immediately addressed a note to
the secretary of state of michigan request
ing information upon the subject believing
that ifis highly satisfactory reply may seive
to correct a great deal of misapprehension i
hand it to you for publication
truly yours

alfred gibbs campbell esq dear sir
your favor of the th ult is before me you
desire to ascertain whether our state has ie
turned to the practice of the deathpenalty
also my opinion as to the general sentiment
of our state with our present experience on
this subject
in reply i would state that our state has
not returned to the practice of the deathpen
alty it has repealed at the time of the re
vision of our statutes of  there has
been but one attempt to revive the law that
was in  i think and it signally failed
on examination of the journal i cannot find
that the question was ever brought to a vote
in either house
in reply to your second interrogatory i
have no hesitation in giving it as my opinion
that the general sentiment of our state is be
yond all question very nearly unanimous in
favor of our present laws on that subject in
deed in the whole range of my acquaintance
i do not know one individual in favor of a re
turn to that practice i am certain i have
beard no one ex pi ess himself in favor of such
a change
i am not aware of there being any statistics
on file on this office bearing upon this ques
tion by coincidence merely there were
committed in wayne county within two vears
from the revision jour murders the grand
jury of that county memorialized the legisla
ture in favor of a repeal counter memorials
showed most conclusively that the increase of
capital crime startling indeed as it was could
not have had any connection with the change
in the law as in three out of the four eases
certainly the criminals knew not of the
change since that time three certainly has
been no increase of capital crime
very respectfully yours

from the liberator
anniversary of emancipation in the
west indies
the twelfth anniveisary of west indie
emancipation was commemorated in wor
cester on the ist inst by appropriate exer
cises at the city hall the meeting which
was large was called to order by francig
jackson of boston and was organized bv the
choice of the following officers
president
wm lloyd garrison of boston
vice presidents edward quincy of bos
ton francis jackson of boston bourne
spooner ol plymouth effingham l capron

ford alfred wyman of westminster and
james b whitecomb of brooklyn ct
secretaries samuel may jr of leices
ter and benjamin snow jr of fitchburg
mr garrison on taking the chair made
some introductory remarks referring chiefly to
the great event this day celebrated the peace
ful emancipation of near one million of slaves
accomplished without the shedding of one
master s blood or the destroying of one plan
tation without any act of violence or anv
civil commotionwhen he concluded the
audience united in singing a jubilee sonr
samuel may jr followed with some
statements in relation to the business concerns
of the meeting and then proceeded to lay
before the audience evidence of the good
effects of west india emancipation elicited
by geo w alexander in his recent visit to
those islands
charles c burleigh followed with a most
eloquent impressive exposition of the
working of emancipation in the west indies
rev mr carpenter of bristol england
was then introduced by the and
made a very appropriate spirited and pointed
address in the course of which he made said
work with the arguments of the opponents of
emancipation as drawn from its operation in
the west indies he had heard it said by
them that lamaica was not so well cultivated
as it ought to be but he had also heard it said
that the emancipated slaves weie not the
laziest people there were in that island in
allusion to ihe argument that the exports of
the west indies had diminished he said he
had a great jealousy of exports and when he
saw pigs imported into his own city of bristol
he saw in that not an evidence of the re
dundance of pigs in ireland but of the
suffer ngs ot ihe people from whose necessi
ties they were drawn when he concluded
another hymn was sung
mr carpenter again rose and said the
tune that had just been sung was one of their
national anthemsthey call it god save
ihe qeen we cal it america there is
another tune called emancipation sun this
day in chorus by  souls and he hoped
the time was near at hand when it would be
sung by three millions in our own land
charles l remond then made some hope
ful remarks on the indications of the times
and the meeting adjourned till  oclock
in the afternoon able and eloquet speech
rs were made by edmund quincy wendell
phillips stephen s foster and j b syme
in which the question of emancipation was
placed upon its true ground of an absolute
tight on the part of the oppressed and an ab
solute duty on the part ot the oppressor and
of those who have ths power of contributing

abolition lectures or incendiary pamphleteer

arrest and imprisonment of
william l chaplin
the announcement that william l chap
lin has been arrested and is in prison in the
capital on a charge of assisting slaves to
escape fiom slavery will fall with stunning
effect upon vast numbers of the people of
new york and new england among whom
he has long been distinguished as a talented
and devoted advocate of human rights
v e have not yet obtained the particulars
of this appalling and heartsickening affair
enough however is known to assure us that
another victim has fallen into the revengeful
cruel and remorseless jaws of slavery and
that that victim is none other than the tal
ented warmhearted and zealous friend of
humanity just named
his case comes home to every heart we
have seen him heard him and know him
and if our brother had been seized at our
side by a ferocious tiger we could not feel
more keenly than we now do for william l
chaplin he is charged with a high enme
even that of delivering the spoiled out of
the hand of the spoilerof ptactically re
membering those in bonds as being bound
with themdoing to others as he would be
done untoall high crimes in this christian
and democratic country for which it is al
most impossible to find adequate punishments
as to what will be the fate of mr chaplin
the prospect seems now too darktoo fearful
to contemplate there is every reason to
believe that he will be made another meal to
feed the hungry and bloodthirsty revenge of
the slaveholding south he is too distin
guished a mark to be allowed to escape the
inhuman clutches of slavery yet something
ought to be done if money can bail him it
should be forthcoming but if this will not
do there should bepetitions circulated in all
directions remonstrating against his impris
onment on such a charge and the authorities
of the district of columbia should be waited
upon by thousands and respectfully informed
that if the prison doors are not thrown
open the walls of their infernal slave dun
geons shall be stormed the time has
come for action it remains to be seen
whether there is sufficient manhood and heroic
love of liberty left at the north to meet the
present trying crisis the ground which
every rightminded man will take in respect
to the matter is this that william l
chaplin is guiltv of no crime that if he
assisted slaves to escape as charged he has
but performed a highly meritorious and chris
tian act that instead of being branded with
the infamy of a slavestealer his name should
be made glorious as a manrestorer that
they alone are nrenstealers who hold buy
and sell men women aud children as property
the imprisonment of wm l chaplin
otlghv arouse the dormant energies of
every ln he land it should call
forth one simultaneous and burst
of unconsolabse lament and settled indignation
we cannot write about it the event is
too painful too monstrously cruel and de 
mands something more than longue or pen
can express we wish to consult cooperate
unite act do something which shall look like
saving a noble man from the wolfish and
bloody prowlers of slavery
to this end we shall go and do now call
upon all in whose hearts there is one spark of
human freedom to go to cazenoviaon wens
day and thursday next we expect to meet
there one of the mightiest antislavery gath
erings that ever congregated in the state of
sew york f d
from the liberty party paper
great meeting of runaway slaves at
cazenovia
those thailhave escaped from slavery
and those who mean to escape from it and
those who think it right for men to escape
from it and those who will help men to es
cape from it and all men who think human
rights are the true capital of the country
will meet in caucus at cazenovia on the st
and d days of august in respect to the
call of gerrit smith president of the n y
state vigilance committee
there let douglass and ward and bibb
milton clark and  box brown
and william and ellen ciaft c c who
are cleat of the chains with which southern
villainy bound their infant limbs meet the
panting fugitives who have just escaped and
all together vith their white sympathisers
let them mingle their congratulations and
engage in wise council to break every yoke
to free every slave in jhis outraged country
come up to cazenovia on the st and stay
through the d and what true democ
racy and jrue politics are ye deluded parti
sans of the state and ye demagogues and
deceivers of the people come and look on
and in the light of nobleness and true virtue
which will be there see your own meanness
and demerits and leatn to leap up from the
degradation of the places you occupy or
aspire to occupy to true manhood
this should be a great gathering and
from the making for it from the
novel character and signal ability of the per
sons to be present it cannot but be a great
meeting the mighty minds and great
hearts of the north which have broke from
the shackles of fa se religion and false
government at the noith will meet there
the rinrgeu bodies and daring spirits which
slaverycoum not subdue which broke its
shackles at thv south and plunged into the
mountains and streams and lakes and
wildernesses and found a way here where a
slave is hailed as a man and embraced as a
there has never been such a convention
before called in this country not in the world
perhaps it is not long that it has been safe
to hold such a convention it is safe now
thank god in spite of daniel webster and
moses stuart and others like them let
daniel webster and moses stuart and
others like them come too if they dare and
attempt to capture hind and give back to a
chnstless heathenism the emancipated bodies
and spirits which will be there congregated
let them come and dare to interrrupt the
deliberations of this convention under a
pretend ot a law or constitution that over
rides heavens law and asserts that those
noble spirits are the property of men who
tby virtue of law or constitucpn may ride
them through the world and bruijfy them
erase gods image which he has put upon
them and place their own names there and
turn them into their fields and stalls and
kennels as they do their hogs and horses
and dogs
should they come we think they will cor
xect their notions of law in the face of the
flashing eyes and burning hearts and strong
frames and iron sinews there assembled
about the body of freedom
let the senators and congressmen also
come who propose to compromise the rights
and liberties of the glorious hand of slaves
who shall collect there and in the presence of
the t selfemancipated bodies and their faces
heavenlit with the alternative liberty or
death nd l ie p re senceof the old body
guards of ai erican freedom who will be
gathered around fhem decide whether they
can again by any agreement plan or com
promise lay liberty in a quiet grave any
where in this country
but we especially urge them to come to
lay on the altar of freedom every principle
or prejudice they have ever cherished against
the equal brotherhood of manto learn of a
certainly that any compact men may make
against such brotherhoed will but increase
the agitation it is intended to quell and that
legal slavery is the foulest falsehood ever
uttered under heaven
villauous post masters
post masters should be truthful and trust
worthy men if the following facts be true
j m rice post master of phoenix is far
trom being a truthful and trustworthy man
indeed a man capable of such small wicked
ness is much to be pitied such aie the men
in power tho he represents his principal
the head of hia party nevertheless such
heads dont like their agents to manifest their
integrity by open falsehood aud when they
do so out of the ordinary track of party
villany they disown thes agents and tun l
them out of office so ought mr fillmore
to do with j m rice post master of phoe
nix if the following letters be true if fillmore
does not ship him he will be considered as
approving the falsehood and fraud attempted
on dea chaffee ourselves and the public
for the liberty party paper
gilberts mills july d 
friend thomasl saw in the last num
ber of your paper a short article from a post
master of our town ordering the discontinu
ance of the liberty party paper sent to dea
chaffee and giving as reasons that he
never ordered it sent to him and refuses to
take it from the office and furthermore
that he prefers to take a paper that has some
regard for truth not filled with libels on our
best citizens you very wisely ask was
that letter dictated by dea chaffee or is it
the pioduction of the post master himself
the facts in the case are these mr
chaffee has taken some three or four papers
from the office and read them he says he
likes the paper very much believes it takes
right grounds c but feeling unable
to subscribe and pay for the paper just now
and being assured by the post master that if
he took them from the office he would be
holden for the pay therefore simply tequest
ed him to send a uumber back telling him at
the same time he likes the paper first tale
not expecting however that the post mas
ter an ultra whig of course would give his
own opinion of the paper and make him re
sponsible for them
in view of these facts it does seem strange
that a man should thus attempt to injure a
paper so completely and entirely devoted to
the cause of truth and tighteousnesa while
we too prefer an editor who stands by the
right and tiuth we should also prefer a
post master who has some regard for the
truth and who is not so strongly pledged to
the support of a wicked proslavery party
that he is unwilling that a thoroughgoing
antislavery paper should be taken from his
office
hoping to see no more libels in the
liberty party paper we shall yet deem it
safe to remain a reader and sustainer
yours for the right
h n gilbert
since we received the above we have re
ceived the following fiom dea chaffee him
self we give them both to the public no
wonder the people are indignant when such
men as rice hold places of power they
are not safe in the light of these facts how
much better post master would dea chaffee
make or h n gilbert ilieymust be post
poned for such ftien as rice there is the
contrast between whigs ami liberty party
men the country over
pennelville july th 
mr editor i see in the st no of the
liberty party paper by j m rice post
master of phcenix it is stated as folovvs
dea chaffee wishes the liberty party
paper discontinued he never ordered it sent
to him and refuses to take it from the office
he prefers to take a paper that haa
gard for truth not filled with libels on our
best citizens
lam the dea chaffee referred td i told
mr rice i was suited with the paper but
under present circumstances felt unable to
pay for it on account of los of property
c
i am a liberty party man and will advo
cate its principles i think mr rice has
been very unkind to me and to yourself like
wise i hope he will write no more stuff

of these occasions i was a little disap
pointed for a few minutes after he began
there was but little in bis appearance and
manner that indicated anything above medi
diocrity and i have seen many colored men
who were much more prepossessing his
articulation was slow for some little time and
apparently laborednot evidences certainly
of the orator however this did not last
long and he soon got fairly afloat and before
the wind when he seemed to be suddenly
transformed and for nearly two hours this
man beyond all cavil or question one of the
most extraordinary of the agepoured forth
a perfect torrent of eloquence invective and
satire such as i never had the fortune to listen
to befoie he gave an account of his visit to
england which happened about the time that
the evangelical alliance of ridiculous memory
vasin session there he gave the whole
history of that godly assemblage and held the
mirrior up to some of those reverend advo
cates of american slavery who went there
wiili the determination to prevent any decided
action of the alliance on the subject of the
domestic institution by which slaveholders
should be excluded from its privileges his
description of the urfily in which these
brethren dwelt for a few days before the
vexed question was brought up of their beau
tiful professions of christian love for one an
other and how they endeavored to cast aside
all inferior questions about the sins of the
world and fix there whole soui on the glor
ious idea of uniona union said ho in his
eainest and eloquent way without human
ity without morality or without leligion
was most laughable and indeed the whole
discourse was a masterpiece of dry humor
and terrible satire
as people generally seem ignorant ol
douglass and his history  will take the opt
portunity to relate in a few words what i
heard of it since lie has been here he was
a slave in baltimore where he picked up
j irom the boys in the street the letters of the
alphabet and he learned to put them together
when he got hold ot the columbian orator
the first book he had ever had ir his hands
and he was then giown in that book no
doubt his first lessons in eloquence were
learned and his first ideas of freedom obtain
ed which he soon put in ptactice and fled
from a yoke more galling than ever roman or
i urk imposed to england and now with no
other resources than those that god and na
ture and his own indomitable soul afforded
him he has risen up asserted his manhood
and his claims and those of all his unfortunate
race to freedom and the enjoyment of their
rights with a power and cogency equalled
perhaps but not often surpassed i do not
hesitate to call him a most eloquent man and
more than that an earnest truthful and whole
souled one it is surprising how he has ac
quired the use of our tongue so completely in
so short a timehis language is entirely
lree from barbarism and is full of strength
and elegance i trust you and your fellow
ciziten will have the opportunity of hearing
him before he returns home
the people here intend to make some
demonstration of respect for the president o
which i will tell you in my next
yours pliny
more about the outrage committed upon
ns at columbus ohio
we clip the following from the ohio
standard
stage co and frederick doug
lass the editor of the summit beacon has
been on a flying visit to our goodly city of
columbus he compliments the capital for
its enterprise and splendid improvements and
says it will stand forth the beauty of the
west and the pride of all buckeyedom
but there was one dark shade cast over
this beautiful picture while mr teesdale
was in our city he was present at the even
ing lecture of frederick douglass in the state
house where the latter was interrupted and
the auditory grossly insulted after noticing
the mobbish proceedings at the state house
mr teesdale records another fact in rela
tion to the treatment of douglass while here
not heretotore adverted to in our paper
we copy from the peacon of the th ult
to crown all it is said that the ohio
stage co refused the next morning to allow
douglass a seat inside the coach although
the passengers unanin ously requested that he
be permitted to have one thev told him to
ride on the outside he declined having
paid for a seat inside he then requested
the repayment of his money and we were
told that even that was refused for the
sake of all that is decent we hope the last
step was not persisted in there is enough
ot crowning infamy in the first to cause the
company to make a public disavowal of the
acts of their agent if they were unauthor
ized
w add that the stage co through their
agents here persisted in their refusal to re
fund the money and that a suit is now pend
fng tor its recovery
an insuit though not inteuded
mr badgei last friday in the senate
made certain declarations extremely offen
sive to his northern whig brethren thev
were in tact insulting though he did not
mean them to be so
he took the ground that the true policy of
the south was to remain in the union for in
that connection it had sufficient power to pro
tect itself against all aggression though in
a minoiity it had in its hands a most effective
means to bring the north to terms north
ern men needed protection for their manu
factures he was one who believed that
congress had power to impose prohibitory or
protective duties to any amount and he was
in favor of the policy of protection but it
northern men would insist upon forcing their
itinaentaliiier their notions about slavery
on the south he now would give them fair
warning their factories might decay their
operatives might be turned out of employ
ment their streets might be filled with able
bodied beggars unable to maintain work
they must ask no favors from him never
should his vote or that of his colleague and
he believed he might say the same of his
friends from georgia be given in support of
any measure to protect or foster northern in
dustry
wecannot seethe wisdom of such a menace
as thisespecially as more than onehalf of
the northern senators ask no such protection
their principles leaning to fiee trade
but by iiis whig associates from the
north it must have been regarded as in
sulting for it assumed that their opposition to
slavery and ils extension yas either hypo
critical or if the offspring of an enlightened
moral sente it might be overcome by an ap
peal to their ayarice
mr badger is a moderate man and gen
erally courteous and goodtempered but in
his instance he strangely forgot himself and
what was due to his political brethren
we know not how far the capitalists of the
north may be prepared to gojbr the sake of
securing a tariff that shall double their prof
its but we know that with the great majority
of the people of the north opposition to the
extension of slavery springs from a moral
principle a religious sentiment that can nei
ther be bribed nor intimidated n era
emancipation in jamaica mr alexan
der the efficient and benevolent secretary of
the british and foreign antislavery society
has been on a visit to jamaica with a view
to ascertain the real effects which the emanci
pation has had upon the people his testi
mony is that of an intelligent sincere and
houorabie man who has taken ample oppor
tunity to investigete whether emancipation
has been successful or not the reader may
udge lronx a single paragraph of a recent
letter
we have now been five weeks in jamai
ca during which time we have traveled over
a large part of the island and are truly glad
to find the condition of planters merchants
and laborets better than we expected that
of the latter especially is iu general one of
much comfort this fine island is not at present
hastening to ruin notwithstanding the severe
trial to which it has been exposed by the
cruel injurious and inconsistent sugar act
of  ir has been delightful to us to see
the large number of the emancipated peasant
ry and their children who are brought under
a moral and religious influence by the good
men who are scattered over jamaica there
can  think be little or no doubt thatpipula
tion is increasing now that the dead weight
of slavery is removed and there are many
indications of an increase of cultivation which
will unless i am much mistaken be very
shoitly manifested by laiger exports unless
checked by had legislation or the operation

colored people in ohioa memorial
numerously signed by citizens of hamilton
county was presented in the ohio constitu
tional convention during its recent session
which prays that in the new constitution pro
vision may be made for the removal of all
colored persons from that state the reason
given is that the geographical position ot
ohio makes the state the refuge of all the
fugitive and manumitted slaves of a number
of southern states in consequence whereof
the colored population increases more rapibly
than in any other free state the memorial
says in the year  there were hut

ihe slavery question has been involved in
this canvass and the most inflammatory ap
peals made to slaveholders to vote against
manly because he was in favor of the ad

to the friends of impartial education
the undersigned on behalf of the colored
people of the city ot albany do respectfully
represent
that such of the colored children who up
to march last attended the different district
schools of the city were by vote of the
school commissioners excluded from said
schools and driven to the alternative of attend
ing one set apart for their exclusive use or
liuc ihc benefit of the public school act
feeling it to be wrong to permit our chil
dren to be thus driven from the schools of the
district in which they reside without resist
ing it and knowing that this new outrage
upon our rights involved a principle which
we should battle against and which should
lead us to unite our energies tor the purpose of
having our children educated promiscuously
with other children therefore the people
came together and resolved to protest against
the cause taken by the board of education a
memorial was drawn up setting forth in te
pectful terms yet earnestly our views and
feelings upon theii course and our determina
tion to oppose them in their efforts to coloize
our children in a district school they took
no notice of our appeal and cur next resort
was to apply to the secy of state who de
cided he had no authoriry to interfere with
the commissioners arrangement thus we were
left to the counsel as to the manner best to
proceed in order to gain our rights and after
several public meetings concluded to test the
legality of their act by prosecuting them at a
court of law
our attorney and counselor after carfully
examining the question in all its bearings
have decided that there can be no doubt as
to law or precedent but that a decision must
he given in favor of the prosecution
the object of this appeal ts to get pecuniary
assistance front friends out of the city believ
ing it to be such an object as we may with
propriety ask such aid we do so hoping that
all who can give will give something of
ourselves we ate not able pecuniarily to
conduct this suit and so far we yet lack
about two hundred and fifty dollars and trust
no one who feels any interest in promoting the
principles of free and equal education will
permit our case to be forgoten

new mexicoits population
the timely movement of the people
of new mexico by which they have
placed themselves in the position of
state sovereignty enabling them to
demand as their constitutional right ad
mission into the union on a footing of
equality with the other states seems
to give entire satisfaction to all save
the slaverypropagandists of the south
and their allies at the north the for
mer class of opponents openly deny the
right of the people of new mexico to
exclude slavery the latter are not
exactly prepared to take this ground
and are under the necessity of present
ing objections to the admission of the
new state drawn from the character
of its population accordingly we are
told by men professing to be the ad
vocates of ultra democracy and the lar
gest liberty that the indian and mexi
can voters of new mexico are unfit for
political freedom and the exercise of
the rights of selfgovernment
the delegate from new mexico n
h smith estimates the population of
the territory in round numbers at 
of these some  are the descend
ants of the aztecs the semicivilized
founders of those ancient cities the
ruins f which scattered over mexico
attest their original splendor and the
skill of their artificers they are the
best farmers of new mexico living in
compact villages surrounded by fruit
trees gardens and great fields of corn
and melons the report  lieut j
w albertof his examination of new
mexico in the years 
gives minute descriptions ofsome of the
principal pueblo or indian towns
the houses are from two to three sto
ries high firmly constructed of sun
dried bricks or rough stone plastered
with clay or the glittering white of sel
enite each village has its church its
padre an alcade or chief magistrate
the inhabitants are industrious peace
able and kindhearted they are
lovers of flowers and fruit trees and
lieut albert says he could at first
sight distinguish an indian from a span
ish town by the green clump of trees
which enclosed it they raise large
numbers of common domestic fowls
and like their aztec ancestors have a
fancy for taming birds in dress and
appearance they scarcely suffer
in comparison with their castilian
neighbors col emory in his report
to the secretary of war of his explor
ations in new mexico gives the por
trait of an indian woman painted from
life in the parlor of the indian alcade
of isoletta it is a picture of remarka
ble beauty the figure full and grace
fully mouldedand the features delicate
ly chiselled the women are very tol
erable housewives and our officers
who during the late war had occasion
to partake of their hospitality speak of
their wellloaded tables their sponge
cakes fine wheaten loaves and do
mestic wines
these pueblo indians were the first
to welcome the american troops to
new mexico thoy disliked the mex
ican rule as it constantly reminded
them of the days of the conquest and
the subjugation of their ancestors
colonel emory does not hesitate to pro
nounce them the best and most peace
able citizens of new mexico it
would certainly be a most ungrateful
return to these people if their state
should be denied a place in the ameri
can confederacy on the ground that
they are unworthy of the rights of citi
zenship
as to the mexican or spanish part
of the population they are to say the
least quite as well fitted for the duties
and responsibilities of state govern
ment as the old inhabitants of louisiana
and florida when those states were
taken into the union they are not an
enterprising hardworking peoplethe
majority content themselves with the
simple necessaries of lifethey have
neither the thriftiness nor the shifti
ness of yankees they have a few
books and no newspapers yet they
are by no means deficient in the rudi
ments of education each village has its
padre more or less learned and lieut
albert says it is rare to find a new
mexican boy or girl who is unable to
read many of the old landed propri
etors are wealthy living in a style of
rude magnificence exhibiting upon
their tables massive silver plate the
product of new mexican mines and the
work of new mexican artizans and
hanging their walls with mirrors and
paintings their sons are educated in
the united states or mexico several
have graduated at the st louis col
lege some of their private residences
are spacious and not without archi
tectural pretension that of senor
ortoiro at peralta has a front pertail
or pizza of five hundred feet in length
at peralta albuquerque el paso pad
dilla and bernallilo our officers found
polite and intelligent society all
classes are courteous and civil in their
social intercourse crimes of the high
est degree are unfrequent but as in
all parts of mexico gaming is a prev
alent vice in the northern part of
the territory there is a good deal of
intemperance and the famous taos
whiskey is too freely used lower
down the light delicious wines of e
paso are in common use the amer
icans who visit them have the reputa
tion of hard drinkers and when col
emory on one occasion declined the
proffer of a bottle of whiskey the as
tonished mexican exclaimed what
no whiskey then you are no ameri

to the restless unsatisfied grasp
ing anglosaxon the careless ease and
listleness and simple pastoral habits of
the new mexicans are well calculated
to awaken a feeling of contemptuous
superiority on the part of the former
but it may be a question after all
whether the dolce far niente the quiet
indifference of the one is not as pro
ductive of happiness as the goading ir
ritability and habitual unrest of the
other
livery year the tide of emigration
setting towards us from the old world
brings to our shores the poor the ig
norant and vicious in numbers far
greater than the entire population of
new mexico these are incorporated
in our body politic and in the new
slates and territories speedily be j
miscellaneous
by j g whittier
come voters we would not if we
could close our ports against them
and refuse them an asylum in our
broad territory but who would notj
prefer to the refuse and squalid over
plus of crowded european cities and
the annual disgorgements of their jails
and workhouses the quiet homelov
ing and pastoral life of new mexico
who for the last quarter of a century
have exercised the rights of citizens ofj
a republic apd whose insulated posii
tion if it has deprived them in some
measure of the benefits of the general
progress of civilization has at the same
time preserved them from some of the
worst vices which that civilization has
carried in its train
but as things are what avail all
facts and argument on this point it
is not manifest to the wisdcm of this
great republicin congress assembled
that these new mexicans are incapa
ble of duly appreciating our cherished
institutions inasmuch as they have
prohibited forever domestic slavery in
their state constitution they have
left out the key of the arch they have
rejected the cornerstone of the re
publican edifice they need to wait
yet longer in territorial limbopros
elytes of the gate tarriers at jericho
until the beard of their democracy has
grown to cover the shame and folly ol
their antislavery partialities their
task just now is plainly that which
senator webster has assigned to
massachusetts they must conquer
their prejudices whenever they
shall have accomplished this and are
ready to present themselves at the
door of the union with a constitution
modelled after that of south carolina
they will find their present opponents
transformed into chivalrous friends
with whom a recognition of the rights
of the peculiar institution will prove as
the open sesame of ali baba did to
the forty theives national era
a fable
in ancient times when flowers and
trees and fairies were on speaking
terms and all friendly together one
fine summers day the sun shone out
on a beautiful garden where there
were all sorts of flowers that ye could
mention and a lovely but giddy fairy
went sporting about from one to the
other although no one could see her
because of the sunlight as gay as the
morning lark then says the fairy to
the rose rose if the sun was cloud
ed and the storm came on would you
shelter and love me still do you
doubt me says the rose and redden
ed up with anger lily says the
fairy to another love if the sun was
clouded and a storm came on would
ye shelter and love me still oh
do you think i would change says
the lily and she grew still paler with
sorrow tulip said the fairy if
the sun was clouded and a storm came
on would ye shelter and love me still
upon my word said the tulip mak
ing a very gentlemanlike bow yere
the first lady that ever doubted my
constancy so the fairy sported on
joyful to think of her kind and bloom
ing friends she revelled away for a
time nndtlven she thought on the pale
blue violet that was almost covered
with its broad green leaves and al
though it was an old comrade she
might have forgotten it had it not been
for the sweet scent that came up from
the modest flower uh violet said
the fairy if the sun was clouded
and a storm came on would ye shelter
and love me still and the violet
made answer ye have known me
long sweet fairy and in the first
springtime when there were but few
other flowers ye used to shield from
the cold blast under my leaves now
yeve almost forgotten mebut let it
passtry my truth if ever ye should
meet with misfortunebut i sav noth
ing well the at that
and clapped her silvery wings and
whisked singing off on a sunbeam but
she was hardly gone when a black
cloud grew up at the north all in a min
ute and the light was shrouded and
the rain fell in slashings like hail and
away flies the fairy to her friend the
rose now rose says she he
rain has come so shelter and love me
still i can hardly shelter my own
buds said the rose but the lily
has a deep cup well the poor little
fairyswings were almost wet through
but she got to the lily lily says
she the storm has come so shelter
and love me still i am sorry
says the lily but if i were to open
my cup the rain would beat in like fun
and my seed would be spoiltthe tulip
has long leaves well the fairy
was downhearted enough but she
went to the tulip whom she always
thought a sweetspoken gentleman
he certainly did not look as he had
done in the sun but she waved her lit
tle wand and tulip said she the
rain and storm are come and i am very
weary but you will shelter and lovo
me still begone says the tulip
be off says he a pretty pickle i
should be in if i jet every wandering
trollop come about me
well by this time she was tired
and her wings hung dripping at her
back wet indeedbut there was no
help for it and leaning on her silver
wand she limped off to the violet
and the darling little flower with its
blue eye thats as clear as a kittens
saw her coming and never a word she
spoke but opened her broad green
leaves and took the wild wandering
little creature to her bosom and dried
her wings and then breathed sweetest
of perfumes over her and sheltered
her until the storm was clean gone
then the humble violet spoke and
said fairy queen it is bad to flirt
with many for the love of one true
heart is enough for earthly woman or
fairy spirit the old love is better than
the gay compliments of the world of
flowers for it will last when the others
fade away
and the fairy knew that what the
violet said was true and she contented
herself ever after and built her downy
bower under the widespreading violet
leaves that sheltered her from the rude
winters wind and the hot summers
sun and to this very day the fairies
love the violet beds

indulge in the feelings of virtuous in

growth of coffee and pep
per in java
in extent java is about seven hun
dred miles in length and it varies from
eighty to one hundred and forty miles
in width its area is less than twenty
thousand square miles the face of
the country is more or less broken by
mountains but the soil generally is
rich and productive the products
are rice sugar coffee peper spiees
and a profusion of the finest tropical
productions growing coffee is cultij
vated here to as great perfection as in
almost any other part ot the world it
grows upon large bushes that very
much resemble our large chairkapin
bushes and the grains of coffee are
formed two in a berry about the size
and shape of our common plum the
skin of the berry is about as thick as
that of the plum and the color when
ripe a pale scarlet
the bush is very productive every
branch is loaded with the berries
which grow two jn a place on opposite
sides of each other and about an inch
and a half apart when ripe the skin
bursts open and the grains of coffee
fall out upon the ground but a more
way is to spread something
under the bush and shake the coffee
down after the outer skin is taken
offthere remains a kind of husk over
each kernel which is broken off after
being well dried in the sun by heavy
rollers the coffee after this needs
winnowing in order to be freed from
the broken particles of the husk it
has been said by some writers that
one bush will not with another aver
age more than a pound of coffee
though it seemed to me judging from
appearances that this was too small
an allowance for each bush
biack pepper is also raised to some
extent on the island of java but suma
tra which lies just across the straits is
by far the most celebrated for this com
modity her pepper is perhaps the
finest and most abundant of any in the
world black pepper grows on a vine
very much like our grape vine and the
pepper vineyards remind me very much
of our american vineyards of grapes
the pepper grows and looks when
green a good deal like our currants
there is this difference however the
currant has each its own distinct stem
but the pepper has not every grain
grows hard on to one common stem
just as each grain of indian corn does
on the cob or husk as virginians in
correctly would say the color of
pepper when first ripe is almost a
bright red and changes to the dead
black common to us by being exposed
to the heat of the sun
the famous white pepper is nothing
more than the common black with the
outer skin taken off it is first soaked
until this skin bursts open which is
then rubbed off and the grain dried
the white is not considered so pungent
as the black though it is nicer and
more expensive as more labor is ne

replying to a beggar the duke
of wellington is famous for his pithy
arid laconic style of speaking and writ
ing almost as much as for his vigorous
and decisive mode of acting on the
battlefield his military despatches
and his speeches in parliament were
always remarkable for their directness
brevity and point here is a a speci

times characterize his notes a rector

presents his compliments to mr
as mr feels that his letter needs
apology the duke will say no more on
that subject but he must add that
there is not a church chapel glebe
house school or even a pagoda built
from the north to the south pole or
within the utmost limits of the earth
to which he the duke of wellington
is not called upon to contribute the
duke is surprised that mr hav
