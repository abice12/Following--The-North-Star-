jiut sir i will express my thanks to
the gentleman from south carolina for
bringing this subject before us in its
present form it is now under consid
eration and must he disposed of and
i most devoutly thank iny god that he i
has permitted me to seea time when
northern men must act when there is
no way of evading this question when
the doughfaces of this body will be
constrained to vote on this identical
question and that such action will he
public and their votes placed on record
so that their constituents and the coun
try may know and bear witness to the
question before us will they vote to
tax their constituents at the dictation of
southern members to pay for a fugitive
slave who ran away from maryland 
years ago they must do it or they
must refuse to do it they must now
serve god or mammon they can no
longer act both ways the subject will
soon be decided by the monosyllables
yes or no to be pronounced by each
member
it has been said that we deirc to
keep this money in the treasury i
sir have no such wish god forbid it
is the price of blood it was obtained
from great britain by the executive
without consulting this body the
treaties and conventions were nego
tiated and the money obtained by the
treatymaking power with which we
have no right to interfere the presi
dent and senate undertook to act as the
agent and attorney of those slavehold
ers they obtained the money from
great britain they have paid out all
but two thousand dollars let them dis
pose of that as they please if the
gentleman who reported this bill will
modify it so as to let the president dis
pose of the remainder to whom and as
he pleases i will vote for it lie is a
slaveholder he understands this deal
ing in human flesh i do not eet him
have the money and let him pay it
out i will have uotniug to d with such
business
i differ frm my honorable friend
from vermont who gave us such a
lucid expose of this treaty and its stip
ulations  understood him to saythat
if the committee would take the case i
again into consideration and show such t
facts as will bring this slave within the
provisions of our treaty with great
britain lie will vote to pay for him
fiir  will do no such thing i will not
in iny capacitty as a legislator acting
ns the representative of freemen de
grade myself while sitting in this hall
by an inquiry into the price and value
of our common humanity  will not
disgrace my constituents while acting
under their high commission by enter
mg upon an inquiry as to the titlei
ee s y which one man holds another
as property ii njt g t j iere tj
quire a t the value in dollars and
m lullu bones and muscles
blood and anew n he
tor of our legislation hall not bear to 
pooling generations the fact that the
twentieth congressional dotrict of ohio
at this age ot the world wth the light
and knowledge which now beam noon i
us waa disgraced by u rep re nallve
in thui hall entering upon b uc h au in
quiry my constituents do not estimate
inan the child of immortality created
in the image of his god with bis ex
alted nature his undying intellect by 
the value of sordid dust
i wish to address some inquiries to
the north star
r the honorable chairman of the commit
tee who reported that bill mr smith
of connecticut he appears to hav
united in this extraordinary report
 which estimates the value of this mai
at twj hundred and eighty dollars
that gentleman is from connecticut
from the very county in which mv pa
rents long resided i should like t
inquire of him the price current of hu
manity in that land of steady habits
by what rule does he arrive at the valui
i of men is he governed by the bril
j liancy of their virtuesby their intel
lectual endowments docs he estimau
men by their religious devotion or b
their learning is he guided by theii
complexion if so which is the mosi
 valuable black or white or is a mix
ture of blood to be preferred whal
price in gold and silver does he place
upon lus constituents how would he
sell them sir i feel humbled when i
see northern representatives consent
to enter upon this slavedealing legisla
tion and become the instruments of the
slavepower to strike down the honor
the dignity and independence of the
northern states i appeal to northern
de minerals and northern whigs by
wiiat rule are you governed when you
decide upon the value of your brother
man t when inquired of by your con
stituents as to your estimate will you
say that he was valuable on account ol
his political principles that he was
a supporter of mr polk or of mr
clay and when they ask you if you
believe that selfevident truth that all
men are born equal what will be your
answerr will you like honest men
admit that u have contributed your
vote fu taie ui m nc  in their pock
ets to piv i r aoijurtu slaves if you
do i apprehend tuey will tell you
hereativr to deal on your own account
while trading in human i sh and not to
use then tulids for such purpose
but this bill is based upon the prin
ciple that under our federal constitu
tion man may hold his feliowman as
property i speak not of the slave
stales but of the federal government
i deny that we possess the power un
der the coiistituti m to liubrute our
fellowmen and r u r them property
that we have powi i disrobe man of
the dignity in which lie was created
tear from him the rights which god has
given him and deliver him over to the
arbitrary will of his brother man to
toil at anothers bidding cringe beneath
his owners lash tremble at his frown
and be sold at his will such powers
have notecn granted us by the people
of this nation such doctrines cahoot
find support inthis hall ut the present
age of the world
mr holmes of south carolina in
terrupting mr giddings said that the
southern states would hold their slaves
as property in spite of any act of the
federal government or the efforts of
northern abolitionists
mr giddings i have nothing to do
with the southern states they control
their own policy their barbarism has
no relation to iny duties as a member of
congress if they see fit to make one
halt of their people the property of the
other half we cannot interfere with
their laws if with the inhabitants of
the fejee islands they become canni
bals and eat each other we have not
the power to prohibit such revolting
practice by our legislation all we
can do is to see that they shall not dis
grace nor degrade this government
nor the people of the free states either
by their slavery or their cannibalism
our motto is keep your slavery
vour disgusting barbarity within your
own states bring it not into this hall
nor attempt to involve us in its burdens
or its crimes i repeat that we are
not now acting under the constitutions
of either of the slave or of the free
states hut under our federal com
pact i he formation of that instrument
was preceded by a long and ardent
struggle br freedom for the rights of
humanity
in looking back to the darker and
more barbarous ages when war was
regarded as the only honorable employ
ment of mankind we find that slavery
existed and the prisoner captured in
war and held as a slave by his captor
was considered as property at that
period when moral darkness enshroud
ed the minds ol men and shut out from 
them an understanding of their nuturai
rights the opiui n that slaves were pro 
petty was g n i l and no one doubted
its correctness i sav none i mean
none but the learned except the
philosophers for aristotle mhisdavj
with a mind enlightened by study and
reflection although he lived in a bar
barous age long prior to the christian
era denied the doctrine so zealously
maintained in this hall today by south
ern gentlemen the immaculate na
zarene declared that one object of his
divine mission was to proclaim lib
erty to the captive he too com
batted this doctrine of oppression
which through ages i jj centuries of
intellectual darknessrmoed a portion of
our race of their inalienable rightsand
which is now advocated in this body
with mortf zeal than it was among the
jews eighteen hundred years since
even at a comparatively recent period
some learned and intelligent men held
this doctrine now so abhorrent to every
friend of freedom as late as 
lord hardwich of england held that
trover lay in the english courts for a
slave brought from the west indies
into england when in  gran
ville sharpe published his first easava
denying this doctrine it was looked
upon aa ujtraism as opposed to the
doctrine of english law to the princi
ple expressed by lord hardwich
and sharpe was regarded as s fanatic
at that time no lawyer dared to rise in
a british court and deny that man could
hold property in man on british soil
right is op no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us alu and all we are brethren
when in  somerset was brotigb
up before lord mansfield on a habea
corpus and the sole claim for his free
dom was the great fundamental truth
that god had created him free andtha
no statute exist in england by w hicl
he could be deprived of that libertj
which god had given him his lordabi
saw the force of this heavenbon
truth his brilliant mind comprehended
its bearing and the effect it must hav
on mankind still he hesitated remand
ed somerset and endeavored to avoid i
direct decision of the point by advising
the parties to compromise the matter
for more than two years he refused t
declare the opinion of theoourt a
length he gave judgment in favor of tlu
natural and inherent right of man tc
the enjoyment of his liberty speaking
of slavery he said it is so odious
that nothing but prsitive law can be suf
fered to support it
on the th of july  our fathers
assembled in solemn convocation de
nied the doctrine so strenuously advo
cated here today and with unanimous
voice proclaimed it a selfevident truth
that all men are born equal that they
are endowed by their creator with cer
tain inalienable rights that among those
rights are life liberty and the pursuit
ofhappiness
sir no evasion no sophism can
break the force or impair the perspicu
ity of this language it proclaimed
slavery to be a transgression of the
laws of nature and of natures god
these undying truths took strong hold
upon the public mind of this nation and
of civilized man they strike at the
existence of property in man wherev
er these truths are acknowledged sla
very itself cannot exist
eleven years after these doctrines
were recognized as the basis of ameri
can liberty and government the pres
ent constitution was adopted the
framers of that instrument had passed
through a seven years war had en
countered danger and toil and great
suffering to establish upon a perma
nent basis the doctrines they had pro
claimed in  we have now reach
ed an important period of our history as
regards this doctrine of property in
man
mr madison in his papers informs
us that on wednesday august iial
the convention proceeded to consider
the report of the committee of detail
in relation to duties on exports a capi
ation tax and a navigation act the
iourth section reported as fol
ows
no tax or duty shall belaid by
he legislature on articles exported
rom any state nor on the migration
lor importation of such persons as the
several states shall think proper to ad
nit nor shall such migration nor itn
ortation be prohibited
mr gerry thought we had nothing
o do with the conduct of the states as
o slavery but we ought to be careful
lot to giveany sanction
sir will the members from massa
husetts the successors of gerry here
oday maintain the doctrine which he
aid down will they refuse all sanc
ion of slavery by refusing to legislate
a its favor will they discard the
proposition before us as an indignity to
lie representatives of freemen i trust
hey will mr madison informs us that
mr sherman of connecticut was
imposed to any tax on slaves as making
the matter worse because it implied
hey were property
sir mr sherman that patriot of
distinguished ability of the most un
sullied purity of the highest devotion to
aur country would do no act which
would sanction slavery or imply that
slaves were property since that day
more than sixty years have elapsed
sherman has long since been gathered
to his fathers his precepts and exam
ples are left on record for our instruc
tion light and knowledge have pro
gressed mankind are advancing in re
finement yet sir an honorable mem
ber of the house from connecticut a
successorof her distingushed sherman
the present chairman of an important
committee of this body one who has
long served here and who is about to
be transferred to the other end of the
capitol silently unites in reporting to
this body a bill to tax his constituents
ind the people of the north to pay for
the body of a fellow man as property
sir when the gentleman gets into the
senatehe and i shall be separated from
ach other i shall be uuahle to fol
ow him there but i would now remind
him of the example of his illustrious
predecessor and i would ask him if he
intends to oppose today the doctrine of
sherman in 
i cannot withhold the expression of
my regret that any northern member
particularly a northern whig of expe
rience should have tacitly acquiesced
in presenting to us a proposition
so offensive to every sentiment of
freedom
i appeal to the members from con
necticut to come forward todav in sup
port of tbe doctrine which sherman
proclaimed at the adoption of the con
stitution will they acknowledge in
direct terms by voting for this bill that
slaves are property under the federal
constitution sherman would do no
act that could imply such an acknowl
edgement but let us trace the pro
ceedings of the convention a little
further
the discussion it will be observed
turned upon the peculiar phraseology
of the second part of the report which
in classifying slaves as merchandise
seemed to imply that they were proper
ty no one expressed a desire that
such an idea should be unbodied in the
constitution on the contrary there
was a manifest desire on the part of the
members of the convention so to shape
the phraseology ss to exclude the eoa
rochester n y friday june  
 struction given to it by mr sherman
mr madison it seems agreed with tha
gentleman he thus reports himself
f mr madiwon thought it wrong t
admit in the constitotion the idea tha
there could be property in man
colonel mason in answer to mr
gouvernear morris the provision
as it now stands was necessary lor thi
case of convicts in order to preveu
the introduction of them
still the convention was not satis
fied and it was finally agreed nem
eon to have the clause read
m and a tax or duty may be impose
on such importation not exceeding
for each person
and then the second part as
amended was agreed to
thus sir the convention that framer
the constitution expressed their denial
that slaves were property they have
left no doubt on that point they would
use no language which would leave an
implication of the doctrine now con
tended for by southern gentlemen it
was discarded by them but it is now l
urged upon us mr madison thought
it wrong to admit in the constitution
the idea that there could be property in
men
sir the gentleman from south caro
lina mr yvoodward asked with great
emphasis if any member of that
convention was so stupid as to doubt
the propriety of holding property in
men i answvr james madison the
father of the constitution a southern
man and afterwards president of the
united states has left on record his
denial of that doctrine i stand here
now the advocate of the principle
maintained in maintained by the
entire convention that framed the con
stitution in  including the illustri
ous madison and sherman and gerry
yy here are the representatives of yir
ginia today yy here the successors of
yy ashington of jefferson of henry
and of madison sir the representa
tives of that old dominion the
mother of statesmen and of states
now stand here as the advocates of op
pression degradation and abject sla
very they sir denying the doc
trines of the constitutionthe doc
trines of yy r ashington and his compa
triotsinsist that one portion of man
kind may own the other as property
ah sir yfirginia has fahen the
fine gold has become dim her sons
no longer lead thevhosis of freedom
tiyry have fewonjr hostile to the senti
ments ot tneir fathers her people
breed men hke oren for the shambles
drive ygnen to market and traffic in
babes and children moral darkness
broods over her anti physical desola
tion reigns throughout her dominion
sir these arguments can have little
effect upon southern men they can
not and will not take any definite posi
tion on this subject today they will
insist that slaves arc not persons but
property tomorrow should a differ
ent question come before us they w ill
insist that slaves are not property but
persons  have for ten years been
striving to find out w hat definite princi
ple southern men hold on this subject
but i find they refuse to adhere to any
principle whatever they are some
times one w r ay and sometimes the other i
everything by turns and nothing 
long as the saving is and now sir 
as an illustration of what i have stated
i venture to proclaim that not a mem
ber south of mason and dixons line
dare rise in his place and say that he
adopts the doctrine either that slaves
are persons or that they are property
if suph a member be present i chal
lenge him to rise in his place and say
which side of this question he will es
pouse and adhere to and i now offer
for that purpose to yield the floor mr 
biddings paused
mr y t oodward of south carolina
rose and stated in substance that
slaves were regarded as both persons
and property
mr biddings yes they are a sort
of amphibious animalneither one nor j
the other but composed of both they
are partly persons and partly things
part human and part inanimate yvell
sir this i call sitting on the fence
i was aware that gentb men could not
be provoked to take any fixed position
in regard to slavery the truth is
slavery itself is an anomaly it is op
posed to all moral principle as well as
to natural rights and can be reconciled
to no rule of propriety but to return
to the constitution in every instance
in w hich reference to slaves is made in
the constitution they are termed per
sons thus in fixing the ratio of re
presentation it provides that the num
ber shall be ascertained by adding to
the whole number of free persons in
cluding those bound to serve for a
term of years and excluding indians
not taxed threefifths of all other per
sons it is clear that the framers not
only regarded slaves as persons but
they were spoken of as other persons
thus placing them upon the same gen
eral basis as freetnen in the th sec
tion of the first article the constitution
provides the migration or im
portation of such persons as any of the
states shall thfnk proper to admit shall
not be prohibited until the year iw
blc here agaio the language is care
fully used to distinguish slaves from
property again in the second section
of the third article the constitution
provides no person held to service or
labor ta one state under the laws there
of and escaping into soother shall by
any law or regulation thereof he dis
charged from such service or labor
thus ta every instance in which the
constitution refers to slaves they are
designated as persons coatrdistin
guishing them from property we are
not only informed that the framers re
garded it as wrong to admit in the con
stitaftoo that there coaid be property
in man but they carefully employed
such language in fraifting that instru
ment as to preclude such a presump
i tioo so clear have they left this üb
i ject that no man who examines it can
have doubts nor is the subject left at
this point the construction of the
constitution belongs to the judicial
branch of the government
t in the case of groves vs slaughter
and others  peters reports 
this question came distinctly before the
supreme court of the united states
the constitution of mississippi bad
prohibited the introduction oi abves
i i into that state after a certain day
slaves were taken there and sold on a
credit after the time allowed by the
constitution of that state suit was
commenced on the note gjven in con
sideration of the slaves the defence
set up that the contract was illegal and
void under the constitution of that
state which prohibited the sale therein
of slaves from without the state the
reply to this was that slaves were pro
perty and therefore the state of miss
issippi had no power to prohibit their
introduction intb the state as the power
to regulate commerce between the
states belonged only to congress
in deciding the law judge mclean
said
by the laws of certain statesslaves
are treated as property and the con
stitution of mississippi prohibits their
 being brought into that state by citi
zens of other states for sale or as mer
i chandise merchandise is a compre
hensive term and may include every
article ol traffic whether foreign or
domestic which is properly embraced
by a commercial regulation but if
j slaves are considered in some of the
states as merchandise that cannot di
vest them of the leading and controll
ing quality of persons by which they
are designated in the constitution
the character of the property is given
them by the local law this law is re
spected and all rights under it are pro
tected by the federal authorities but
the constitution acts upon slaves as per
sons and not as property
if slaves te property slave markets
may be opened in boston and massa
chusetts will have no power to prohibit
t here the revolting scenes which are
witnessed in this city if the doctrine
contended for by southern men be cor
rect no tate c ah exclude slave mar
kets from ho territory of consecfate its
sosi to freedom well becomes south
ern gentlemen to examine this subject
before they base themselves upon the
principle that slaves are property let
that be established and congress will
have the power to prohibit the internal
slave trade at its pleasure we may
then take slaves from their masters as
we do other property
gentlemen from the slave states be
ing accustomed to regard slaves as pro
perty under their state laws draw no
distinction between the laws of the
slave state and those of the federal
government persons educated in the
slave states coming into the office of
president or into either of the execu
tive departments or into either house
of congress are likely to bring with
them the views imbibed in such states
thus we find that in some instances the
president of the united states and oth
er officers of the government have at
times without examination regarded
slaves as property and in some in
stances have paid the public funds for
such slaves not only without authority
of law but in opposition to the spirit
and the letter of the federal compact
the same officers after having their
attention called particularly to the sub
ject have seen their error changed
their practice and refused to regard
slaves as property so also in some
of our treaties slaves are referred to
in connection with other property
such language is used in the treaty of
ghent to which i called the attention
of this committee in the early part of
my remarks but in these cases the
language was employed without refer
ence to the relation which slavery holds
to the federal constitution as contra
distinguished from the character it pos
sesses under the government of the
states in w hich it exists
but if we examine the subject a little
more closely we shall find that slaves
are not regarded merely as property in
any part of the country in every
state of the union they are punishable
for crimes tfnder the state laws such
is not the case with any species of pro
perty murder may be committed upon
slaves in any statt and the murderer
hanged therefor but no such punish
ment applies to the killing of any other
species of property slaves in such
states are however for certain pur
poses under their laws regarded as a
peculiar kind of property but the
laws of those states are local and have
no bearing upon the relations which tha
federal government holds to the insti
tution slavery is the creature of mu
nicipal law and can extend no further
than such municipal action has force
it is therefore strictly confined to the
jurisdiction creating it so strictly is
this rule of law observed by courts of
justice that if a slave escape from bis
mater on to free soil but for a moment
he becomes free forever this is the
case of forbes vs cochran et al
vise  barnwell si cress well 
baylev justice remarked slavery is
a local law and therefore if a man wish
to preserve his slaves let him attach
them to him by affix tioo or make last
the bars of their prison or rivet well
their chains for the instant they gel
beyond the limits where slavery is
recognized by the local taws they nave
broken their chains they have escaped
from prison they are free the same
principles were decided in the ease of
somerset see  vol state trials
and srs itmpiisd by tha coarts of the
u oited states and by those of nearly
aji the several states of this union
property may be taken by the ownei
from one state to another or fiom ou
nation to another bat if a man volun
tarily take h stave or send him to i
free state the moment hoenters svil
state he becomes a freeman fron
that moment the power ovei
him ceases and he can no more be eu
slaved the property in such case i
instantaneously trandforiued into a per
son but to examine this question t
little fort her suppose the slaves u
south carolina or of afl the shivi
states should rise in the plenitude
their power assert their own rights
and enslave the whites they woul
then become the owners and thei
present masters would be transformei
into property according to this slave
holding logit tbothutk n
time to pursue this part of the eujec
further
i the gentleman from maryland mr
chapman has cited a case where tin
twentyeighth congress passed a law
directing payment to be mad to lc
peyster and another for a slave lost ii
the florida war this case is cited a
a precedent to show that we have re
cognized slaves as property i un
self advocate the observance of pre
cedents as strongly as any member o
this house i would deal out equa
justice to all who pray for it it is there
fore proper that we should look to th
former practice of this body in relation
to the question
after the close of the late war wit
england in the year  ft a law wa
passed allowing compensation to own
era of property lost or destroyed in tin
public service during the existence o
hostilities pending the bill an amend
ment was offered providing for the pay
ment of slaves lost in the public ser
vice after discussion the amendnien
wes rejected in committee di tin
whole only thirty rising in its favor
yes sir at that time only thirty mem
bers of this house regarded slaves a
property
many petitions were sqbsequentlj
presented calling oh congress to pai
for slaves killed in the public service
but no committee could be found wht
would report in tavor of such a claim
in  the case of dauteirc
came before the cmumiftee of claims
tbe petitions owned a slave a hurst
and a cart on the day of the battle
of new orleans they were pressec
into the public service the slave am
horse were killed and the eart destroy
ed by the cannonshot of the enemy
the owner then applied to cbngres
for compensation the committee re
ported in favor of paying for the hors
and cart but against paying tar tin
slave when the bill came up in the
house an amendment wasoffered giv
ing compensation for the slave the
subject was debated for weeks those
who opposed the amendment based
their objections upon the distinct prin
ciple that slaves were not property
and the bill was finally laid upon the
table by a latge majority
at a more recent period in 
francis larcbe of new orleans pre
sented a claim precisely similar to that
just quoted and it was referred to the
committee of claims the committee
in reporting upon the case say that
they had caused examination to be
made at the treasury department to
see if slaves who had been killed in
public service during the revolutionary
war had been paid for and they learned
that no such instance could be found
they also cite many cases in which
compensation bad been refused those
cases were of the character to obtain
the most favorable consideration but
no committee could in that day be found
wtiling to admit the moral and constitu
tional absurdity that under our federal
compact slaves could be regarded as
property yet sir they had not the
advantages which we possess the
madison papers setting forth the
views of those who framed the consti
tution were not then published nor
had the subject at that time been adju
dicated in the supreme court i wish
the ear of every member of this body
when i assure them and the country
that from  down to  the com
mittees of this body uniformly rejected
all claims for slaves lost in the public
service regarding them as persons and
not as property
in the th congress the claim of
james watson for slaves was commit
ted to the committee of claims of
which l was myself a humble member
the friends of the claim by some means
learned that the committee had ad ways
reported against the payment for slaves
they therefore obtained the transfer of
that case to the committee on indian
affairs who reported a bill to pay for
the slaves claimed by watson that
report made six years since was the
first in favor of paying for staves as
property so far as my knowledge ex
tends ever made to this body under
our present constitution or prior to its
adoption during that congress out
other of the like character was made
by the committee on territories the
bill last mentioned was rejected on a
call of the ycaa and nays after full di
cossion only thirtysix votes being
given ia its favor no final rote was
ever taken on any ocher case of the
kind except the one referred to by the
gentleman from maryland mr chap

at this port yesterday morning haying sailed
from port au prince on the bth inst she
brings a connected history of the events which
have taken place in that eity the main
partiulars agree with those already published
it seems tha the source of all the troubles
was in the hatred which the blacks entertain
towards the mulattoes and that this hatred
and prejudice broke forth on the lh day of
april the day for the weekly parading of the
guards and the army a large number of
mulattoes were shot in open conflict with the
troops and several as traitors by order of the
government
a frcoch corvette was lying in the roads
and the french consul with a boldness
becoming bis dignity demanded of the presi
dent an annesty on threat of bombardment
this had its effect and a proclamation was
issued granting pardon to all except twelve
whose names were given in the proclamation
this notice enabled the twelve to escape in
disguise on board vessels in the harbor
another proclamation was issued calling
upon the citizens to open their doors and
resume business but so little confidence was
felt in the sincerity of the president that
very little attention was paid to the procla
mation a letter dated may th concludes
as follows
it no further disturbance has since taken
place yet very little cunfieence is felt that
the peace will continue many weeks the
president has sot out on a tour through the
south with a large force to restore order
and until he returns w further demonstration
nil be made
the commercial ageat of the united
stater hoisted his flag in the early part of
the troubles and his bouse in eoawion with
the other consulates became the asylum of
the persecuted mulattoes
commerce is at s stand and the boost of
the country depreciating every dsy many
families have embarked and others are pre

the north star
rochester june  
the presmeuer
l when will the patient north learnwhat
has been ao long known and proclaimed by
intelligent abolitioniststhat they have no
r power or voice in deciding through either of
the great political parties who shall be nomi
nated to preside over the destinies of these
united states and that the great and all
controlling political influence of this nation is
concentrated in the hands of three hundred
thousand menstealers when will they learn
that these two great parties the whig and
the democratic are chained to the bloody car
of slavery and that every man in them ia but
a pitiful packhorse with bit in mouth to be
guided by the rein and urged on by the whip
of his southern masters the democratic
and whig national conventions are but places
where northern men go once in four years to
give the lie to all their former professions
the little moral capital which they manage
to accumulate during the interval of four years
is carried there and blasted at a blow the
office of these conventions is to whip and
browbeat northern men into apostacyand
most successfully do they accomplish their
object the recent nomination of general
taylor for the presidency by the whig na
tional convention at philadelphia is sufficient
proof of the trafh of our assertions the
nomination of crenesil taylor was obviously
a slaveholding measureintended to secure
slaveholding support and in turn to support
slavery it was made in view of the wil
mot proviso and to unite determined oppo
sition to that measure it was made with a
view to conciliate the south and under the
impression that the dull and servile north
eould be gulled beaten into sup
poit of slavery and a desertion of all their
pretended regard for human freedom in this
nomination we learn the exact estimate which
southern men place upon northern integrity
honor and fidelity we learn from this that
they look upon northern men as the most
pliable matqpal in the worldwithout firm
ness without principleand without self
respectready to bow and cringe in any way
their southern masters may elect it is im
possible that a man could have been selected
more opposite to all the professions of the
whig party at the north than is this same
general taylor
they claim to be the true peace virtuous
humane intelligent religious and liberty
party of the countryand they have as their
candidate a fierce and bloody warrior whose
only recommendation is the success which at
tended his recent work of human slaughter in
mexico they are the virtuous party and
they have as their candidate a man who
winked at the most horrid rapes and robberies
committed by our brutal soldiery on the wives
and daughters of a neighboring republic
they are the intelligent party and they have
as their candidate a man notoriously ignorant of
all the great questions of national interest
who declares that his life has been spent in
the field and that he has never given the
questions that now divide parties of this coun
try sufficient attention to give an intelligent
opinion upon any one of them they are the
idigious partyrepresenting the moral and
religious sentiments of the northand they
have as their candidate and representative a
man notorious for bis impiety profanity and
blasphemy when on the battle field of 
buena vista when men lay scattered bleeding
and dying around him  give em hell
give em hell was the outpouring of his
obdurate heart they are the humane party
and they have for their candidate the cruel
monster through whose agency bloodhounds
were introduced into florida to hunt men
women and children and tear them in pieces
they are the liberty party of the country
and they have selected as their candidate a i
villain who is the every day robber of hun
dreds of his fellow creatures of their rights i
and liberties oh shame everlasting
shame upon noithero whigs if they can de i
grade their souls by idvocating and support i
ing such a man for the presidency how
can they support him without sumping them
selves as the most miserable of demagogues
and worst of hypocrites it remains to be seen i
whether they are ready to do this we hope
not and yet we greatly fear they will
what a commentary ia the nomination of such
a man as general taylor
locmia mott
we learn with unfeigned pleasure that
this distinguished friend of the poor bond
man is now in a neighboring town and that
the ts intending to riait rochester on sunday
next it ia hoped that she will a rail herself
of our mooting on that day to open her
mouth for the dumb we are sure that a
good word from her en this subject would
remote mountains of prejudice existing espe
cially among those ef the mm faith with
herself
i john van bares
this distinguished gentleman and ditomibei
of the pm of the democratic party favored
our good city with his presence on monday
last and addressed a large audience in the
courtboom yard m the subject of the wil
t proviso a  the present aspect of ameri
can politics irum what we had heard of his
principles and ability we expected much of
him ia the way of powerful oratory and noble
sentiment and we were not disappointed
his speech was a most able aad eloquent per
formanceabounding in clear and conclusive
arguments truthful sad lucid statements ele
vated and manly sentiments in tempered with
biting sarcastic irony wanned with generous
homer aad enlightened and vivified with bril
liant hashes of wit from beginning to end it
was jost the speech for a popular assembly
it was a discourse to the men before whom it
was delivered and not to men in the distance
it was a plain straightforward speech which
the people could understand at once and they
did understand it the whole audience seem
ed in sympathy with the speaker and manifest
ed their interest in the man and his address by
frequent demonstrations of applause it was
highly gratifying to see that the most radical
thrusts at slavery were the most warmly ap
plauded showing that the audience were even
with the speaker on this subject if not in ad
vance of him
it is hardly necessary to say that we do
not attach much importance to the wilmot
proviso as a means of staying the desolating
curse of slavery while we regard it as a
step in the right direction and hail it as a most
hopeful sign of the times it is but a sign a
mere sign of a radical principle which must
one day force itself into practice to that
principle we must cling it is not only hos
tility to the extension but unrelenting hostility
to the very existence of slavery this prin
ciple it is the appropriate work of abolitionists
to fling among the people they can not and
ought not to be turned aside from this substan
tial work by pursuing signs shadows and
secondary objects we look upon the wil
mot proviso and its supporters as indications
of the presence of a great principle in the na
tional heart which by putient cultivation will
one day abolish forever our system of human
bondage we are interested in the barn
burners and other advocates of the  wilmot
proviso simply because they are at issue
with the slave power to be at war with
this power in this form is of great advantage
to the antislavery causeit serves to keep
he subject of slavery before the peopleto
deepen their hatred of the systemand to
break up that harmony between the northern
white people and southern slaveholders
which has so long been the safeguard against
an uprising of the slaves against their cruel
masters we therefore say to john van
buren and all others who have only attained
tis light come along in this glorious cause
say not to us come back to you but come
n yourselves and if we mistake not you will
soon find broader ad more substantial issues
vith slavery than ym have yet discovered
hie attempt to kick you out of the dcmo
rratic national convention and its success
ught to lead you to examine thevalue of
 our glorious union if new york can
stand without the union of the democratic
arty she can stand without union with slave
holders and if need be stand without the
rnion of these states
hopeful signs
political parties and ecclesiastical organiza
tions are crumbling the north and south are
falling asunder northom whigs and north
ern democrats are fraternizing and a grand
rally is to be made against the slave power in
the coming political campaign the con
science whigs of fthe east the barnburners
of this state and men of all parties in ohio
are avowing their determinaton to present an
opposing front to the impudent nominations of
the whig and democratic conventions it is
evident to all reflecting men that northern
men and opiuions can never be respected in
either of the great political organizations of
this country while slavery exists parties
must therefore be broken up the salvation
of the country the slave and the national
honor require their utter destruction and if
we do not very much misapprehend the signs
of the times the hour of their destruction
draweth nigh it is impossible that persons
so opposite principles so antagonistic can
long continue in political union and good fel
lowship there must and ought to be a
breaking up of parties the issues present
ed at this time are broad and distinct the
south claims the right to introduce slavery
into free territory necessarily to the exclusion
of free labor and has succeeded in compelling
both political parties to nominate men favora
able to her schemes while the north is
weaponless and left to the alternative of
either succumbing to southern domination or
like men to rise up and snap their chains
we wait to see which course they will
choose
niagara falls
it is no part of our intention to attempt any
description of this stupendous wonder it is
beyond the power of talent poetry or genius
to describe it the jpinute and descriptive
pen of scott would fail in such an attempt
while the wildest and grandest flights of by

comparison of the awful thunders of this eter

visit and the fact that we bad the privilege of
addressing quite a large audience in the bap

sunday afternoon and evening the oppor
tunity was one that we scarcely expected
knowing the slaveholding influence ever set

slavery character we are happy to state
that a great change has evidently come over

i hare also been ta ripley  miles ahor
cincinnati in brown county where i he
ooe meeting in the church of the famous di

firm friend of the panting fugitive hi
bouse has been made the resting place for th
wayworn and weary fa years in the grot
chagrin of the sbveoerata of hit neighboi
hood and the slaveholders of kentucky
one friend informs me and it certainly ap
pears like an overestimate that he hasknowi
as many aa forty to be there at a time
packed away in the underground depot
this depot as a matter of course is not ii
the house of dr rankin but situated in s
cavern about two miles south of the wherea
bouts of which none but abolitionists an
aware this accounts for the great mistaki
on the part of the soulseekers who fre
quently or at least have at different times b
brute force entered the house of this age
gentleman whes they knew him to be unpro
tec tedhis eldest son being absent sod non
but children and females at homein searcl
of their victims but without success twa
well it was the house of rev john rankii
they dared enter and not some i wot ofyea
very well
in ripley throgh a small village there re
side several cdored families all of whom
are industrious and welldoing one of whom
is an undertaker one had a ropewalk anoth
er a brickyard in which many hands are em
ployed several carpenters stonemasons and
bricklayers all of whom are industriously
employed at their several vocations they
are nearly all freeholders and have or are
in the act of building neat and comfortable
little cottages which do them much credit
with the assistance of an excellent and tal
ented young gentleman of literary qualifica
tions who ieeently left cincinnati and has
taken up his residence there much good may
and will be done among the faithful few of
ripley they have a church and a literary
society there and colored and white children
go to the same schools
our professed antislavery friends at ripley
are not prepared to hear the declaration of
the whole counsel and the truth spoken
as it should be in god and i am much in
clined to think with perhaps but one or two
exoeptiens their antislavery finds enrreney at
par on the credit of rev mr rankiir whose
solvency in that particular i believe to be be
yond a controversy and the old gentleman
faithful being abaqpt at the time may rea
sonably account for the detection on my jsart
f the fictitious article which only required
his presence to give it credit i called at his
house and saw his sons and tfyighters
frank familiar and intelligent though plain
and unpretending should have been pleased
to see and shake hands with the old gen
tleman faithful
i return again to speak of cincinnati iu
which place i find many things of interest
i there are more many more mechanics in
this city than i was aware of and it requires
lime to find out the facts indeed there are
many of the most intelligent citizens of hoth
classes who are not aware of it and the re
ality is only known when an interested
stranger or public man comes into the
city whose business it is to make such inves
tigations
in addition to other mechanical and profes
sional enterprises named in my last there are
some colored men engaged in chemical estab
lishmentsone in particular in which the
principal chemist in the establishment is a
colored man there is also an extensive
blacksmithing establishment carried on by an
aged colored gentleman in walnut streetwho
has a number of hands white and colored
working for him he standing at one fire
who has contracts on hand with the first re
sponsible men of the city of from one to six
hundred dollars occupations such as these
bring men into intercourse with the first busi
ness men of the place and establish an ac
quaintance and secure a confidence that noth
ing else will it gives men a credit for both
money and means or articles of trade and
business commodities men of business mer
chants and others will seek an acquaintance
with men of this description because accord
ing to business policy and the laws of com
mercial economy an interchange of trade
being necessary for the sustenance of the
system it is their interest to do so as well as
duty
there is also i learn about to be estab
lished a large and fashionable staple and
fancy shoe store by a large capitalist and
very active gentleman of business tact and
habits associating with him a competent me
chanic and one of the best workmen in the
cityboth colored of course all this to me
is news the most cheering it is that wnich
will raise the colored class in this country as i
by enchantment from degradation to entire
manhood and actual equality with those who
now dispute their susceptibility for the higher
attainments
the young women of cincinnati of the
colored class are far in advance of those
of any other place that i have visited
nearly the whole of them have trades and
have continually as much employment as they
can attend to those who are not employed
by others and do not employ take bostoeaa
into their own houses mod thus gain a re
spectable livelihood with ad the advantages
of domestic comfort and social happiness
there is scarcely such a class to be found as
colored servant girls in cincinnati from the
fad that nearly all have trades the white
girls such as those of oriental extraction
are tbs complete monopolists of female me
nialism in this city nor do the young wo
men find say difficulty in getting employment
in establishments controlled and owned by
white persons these is ooe establishment
in particular perhaps the largest sad finest

gee the elevation of our race in general

aim and whatever respectfully and honora
bly contributes to this end is among the
i means to be used for its accomplishment i
i cannot agree with some writers that great
matters or ia other words great things ex
pressed by great words are alone worthy of
f great minds or the notice of great persona
we are a small peopleoccupy a small
sphereconstituting a small number com
ii pared with those by whom we are surrounded
j also the gieater part of whom at present
have but a small conception of things now
 to my mind the greatest effort that can be
i made is td suitably adapt ourselves to their
underslanding imparting to them a correct
knowledge of things though the language
may appear homely aed void of refinement
but proper you know i care little for pre
cedent and therefore discard the frivolous
rules of formality conforming always to
principle suggested by conscienceand guided
by the ligftt of reason
the cincinnatians i mean the colored are
a highly susceptible and very interesting peo
ple they have been misrepresented in many
particulars and it requires an actual acquaint
ance with them before their true character can
be known
they have themselves a wrong conception
of the people in many other places especially
their pittsburgh neighbors all for the want of
an actual acquaintance there are some of
the noblest and best spirits to be found among
our people in this city and they only want
the encouragement and approbabation of the
leading minds and master spirits of other pla
ces to give them an impulse which like tbe
ushering of bodies into space shall continue
forever in motion i believe and expect
much good will be accomplished among the
colored citizens of cincinnati and they are
fully determined that nothing on their part
shall be wanting they are willing and
ready to bear the expenses of competent per
sons to come and counsel with them indeed
i found myself much disappointed instead
of that spirit of selfishness and bigotry with
which the hare bepn chargedl
found to thq contrary that they are kind
hospitable sociable and unassuming in the
extreme always ready and willing to give
merit its due and indeed they extend their
courtesies to the utmost extent of the desires
of the most insatiable for such favors per
haps from the kindness of their hearts they
sometimes extend it where it is not dueat
least where it may not be merited they
are indeed a very grateful people and this i
conceive to be saying much i opine and
that not w ilhout the best of reasons for saying
so that if the north star continues to be

instructive organ that its conductors will al
ways meet with a most hearty welcome from
the citizens of the quen
the whites in the main of this place are
kind and courteous and the principal reason
of the distance between them and the colored
citizens is as expressed by an intelligent col
ored gentleman because the colored people
themselves have never taken advantage of the
opportunities they haveof being sociable with
them this  believe mainly to be true and
is an eggregrious error on the part of the col
ored citizens they must come forward
confront opposition and manfully though
prudently it may be maintain their rights in
every particular this being done the cin
cinnatians must become among the greatest
and foremost in our country the miserable

one word more to the young men i men
tioned in my last that they were not doing
their part it is true that there are some
yes an honorable fewwho are found at the
cabinet in the carpenters shop at the shoe
makers bench the anvil and so on and
these i respect as honorable exceptions but
by far the greater part coqtent themselves
with inferior situations to these many of
them have steamboating as a principal occu
pation and after having worked studiously for
several months they come off the river with
money sufficient to keep them respectably
jntil they could qualify themselves ia pen
manship and arithmetic sufficient for counting
house purposes or sufficient to purchase them
selves a hundred and fifty acres of good land
in michigan or elsewhere or to set them up
in a respectable small trading boat ness of
some kind or support them comfortably for

it will be gratifying to the readers of the
north star to learn that this gathering of the
friends of humanity was in do neaped behind
those of former years one thing is certain
nerer were bolder and sterner truths enunci
ated or argued or their appropriate eloquence
more effective upon a thronged and intelligent
audience
the convention held its day session at the

the resolutions submitted by the business

and their discussions were highly interesting

other speakers william lloyd garrison

douglass wm h channing charles lenox
remond parker pillsbury william w
brown stephen s foster charles c bur
leigh adin ballou john pierpout edwin
thompson and other well known advocates
of a righteous but persecuted cause
the topics embraced in the resolutions
were of the usual character only improved
as in the opinion of the movers the signs ol
the times demanded the proslavery fea
tures of the constitution and duty enjoined
upon all abolitionists to withhold their alle
giance while it was the formidable obstacle in
the path of emancipation the support guar
anteed to slavery by the american church re
ceived its due share of attention the posi
tion of political parties their promnnent candi
dates each engaged the thought and voice of
the convention expressions of sympathy
for sayres drayton and english now in the
prison at washington for aiding  slaves to
escape also were embodied as were several
other departments of the great subject of
american slavery
frederick douglass at the opening of the
meeting expressed the hope that there would
be no lack of speech especially at a time
when there was so much love of freedom and
hatred of slaveiy and called upon james n
buffum to narrate some of the incidents of his
recent visit to washington who detailed the
treatment meted out to the three men above
mentioned and hie interview in particular
with captain drayton whom he considered
the man of the occasion the moving spirit on
board the pearl he found him resigned to
his fate though subjected to very hard prison
discipline a message from his wife excited
the lively gratitude of his heart he con
fessed that nothing else had troubled him but
solicitude for those near and dear to him
the demonstrations of kindness on the part
of visitors touched even the officers of the
prisonone of whom acknowledged his convic
tion that the antislavery people were doing
something the visit to the national prison
had tended in an eminent degree to increase
his mr bs opposition to slavery and
nerve him with seal for its removal from the
capital and the country
mr garrison commented upon some ex
tracts from an english paper relative to a
recent meeting in kingston jamaica among
the former planters at which time an address
was delivered by a distinguished clergyman
replete with antislavery sentiment aud which
was received by the residents with unanimous
applause he announced that before he
w ould have slavery reestablished in jamaica
he hoped the island would sink to the bottom
of the ocean that the institution was a foul
blot it was his abhorrence he uttered bis
indignation in view of america being the
strong bold of slavery
edwin thompson of walpole suggested
an inquiry for many honest persons whether
slavery could not be abolished without de
stroying the american union this gave
rise to as animated discussion between messrs
garrison phillips pierpont douglass bur
leigh and mellea as to the constructions
placed upoo the constitution and what re
sponsibilities were enjoined by yielding it
obedience the majority of speakers and
of the convention were confirmed in the be
iktf that honest antslavery men could not vote
or take office under a consthution which to
all intents sanctioned and fostered the odious
system by which three miukas of americana
were held in chains
frederick douglass alluded to the letter
from jamaica and believed that the demon
stration there was but a rose to gain anti
slavery infiumce in england in the course
of his remarks a tribute was awarded hun j
r gkillings for his recent brilliant speech in
congress an an indication of antislavery pro
gress but a few years since sentiment
uttered there fhr lean radical or pouted bar
subjected him to expulsion hut that new
southern members had lsatnnd that anti ah

ratling topic for bought and discussion that
aay of its gatherings whether held in spa
cious halls or in ekarebes a village school
boueee or m the gtevecods first temple
they are always prolific with internet im
i fining sometimes looked for but
i seldom obtained at aay other meetings this
is specially characteristic of the new england
antislavery convention where the devoted
band of tree men and women assemble from
all over the country to lay their offerings on
freedoms ahar and inhale inspiration to be
developed on returning to their immediate
spheres of inflaence it has been and long
may it coalman thus the aatialaveiy mecca
to which like he eastern devotees to their
chosen city the boats feel boand to perform
an annual pilgrimage
i am not rain enough to attempt a report
of the discussions elicited by the aeries of
resolutions but will allude to a few prominent
individuals and speeches whic hmajr convey
birdseye view of a scene replete with hope
and encouragement to the slave on the son th
em plantation in another column it baa
been already intimated that the evening mo
aions were held in faneud hall where the
crowded attendance was an appropriate tribal
to the eloquent arguments submitted by the
galaxy of talent and worth unsurpassed oa
aay other platform
the proslavery character of the america
constitution was frequently discussed and the
remarks thereupon were listened to with un
precedented attention frederick douglass
commenced his speech at faneuil hall by re
minding the audience that he stood before
those who were the enslavers of himself and
brethren and that what he might feel to
offer would not be agreeable to the venerators
of the constitution but it was them who
said through that instrument if you slaves
dare to rise and assert your freedom we of
the north will come down vpon yoa like an
avalanche and crush you to pieces he
met the taunt of cowardice charged upon the
slave by tebukbig its proslavery authors aa
coming with an ill grace from them they
being eighteen millions strong the slaves ig
norant degraded unarmed and but three
millions the crushed bondman appeals to
you northern men to stand away from the
southern slaveholder and give us fair play
you should say to them if yeu will im
brue your hands in the blood of your biethren
do it at your own risk and peril there are
noble spirits among the slaves who would
appreciate such a position and assert their
rights to freedom it you give them instead
of their oppressors your sympathy mr
douglass alhded to nathaniel turner the
hero of southampton who endeavoredto
gain liberty for himself and brethren by the
same means employed by the revolutinary
fathers when captured he was stripped
and compelled to walk barefooted  yards
on burning coals and then fell pierced by a
hundred bullets i call upon you said mr
douglass to refuse being the body guards of
slavery and no longer render support to the
tyrants
i know said he you look upon the colored
man as necessarily degraded as beneath you
but despite all that we arc men you may
pile up statutes against our manhood heaven
high but we are menyour brothers for all
that this expression was received with
loud cheers the audience were reminded
that once the anglosaxon race in england
were subject to their norman conquerors
though they now claimed superiority all
others and the right to plunder and enslave
them all and over france too this superiority
was claimed infidel france you term her
but infidel france whet emerged from at
monarchy to a republic emancipates hex
slaves and the delegation of colored people
who waited upon the minister creimeux in
paris were treatednot with indignity aad
contemptnot rejectednot asked to show
their free papessbut responded to as meni
and brothers i would not he regarded as an
infidel to christianity but commend me al
ways to tht infidelity which strikes off the
chains in preference to that religion which
rivets them m
charles c burleigh in a speech of much
eloquence and power alluded to the imprist
onment of capt sayres and companions at
washington contrasting the united staten
with algiers though compelled to seknowk
edge the position of the lattes an the most
commendable for there slavery waa abolish
ed while washington ouv national
was yet a slave marl
in speaking ef the reeent revolutionary
scenes in paris he asked if it was noble in

m consequence of our sins we are suffer

reference to the term no union with slave
bolders not being understood by some
because wo cannot establish complete non
intercourse are we justified by a connection
w hich holds the slave secure in his t j a
it not time to proclaim no union with slave
holders answer it to your mark in ts
william h chansing reminded the meet
ing that two years ago when the abohuon

they were called traitors but thank god

 great countryand do so with the more
freedom that i know it to be an interesting
subject to all classes in the old worldespe
cially to those who are looking around them
wuh hopeful philanthropy fot every m ans

aid in solving the problem of human progres

hension the operation of the free institutions
of this republic the infidel points with the
finger of scorn to the distressed restless
and uneasy condition of entire christendom
and says whh a sneer behold your chris
tianity what has it done  the aristocratic
asi selfish upholder of feudalism and serf
dom in the plenitude of his selfcomplacency
points to the american constitution and then
to american slavery under that constitution
and saysheboid your republicanismwhat
las it done  most miserably mistaken both
il w net christianity but the want of it that
sanctions or encourages the many evils and
sorroire under which christendom suffers it
is not republicanism but the want of it that
sanctions or encourages the grievous wrong
of slavery now eating like a canker into the
very heart of the social system of this entire
community poisoning and polluting all the
streams of right sentiment and feeling
well after all this is a great country
it is great in extentgreat in fertilitygreat
in beautiful and picturesque scenery how
great as an illustration of the tiuism that
a most mean practice may coexist along with
the expression of a most sublime theory
said a foxhunting clergyman of england
whec reproved by one of his parishioners for
setng out on a hunting expedition on sun
day morning shortly after he had preached a
sernaen on the duty of observing the sabbath
ximnt do as i do but do as i saw the
united states may very well be allowed
t be a model republic if her illustration
f republican principles can be understood to
btur itkie construction dont do as i do
but do as i say she is great in theory
miserable paltry despicable in fact the
dwotnine of human equality which she so
proudly boasts is a noble grand and beauti
ful doctrine but the reverse of noble grand
and beautiful is the american illustration of
it of belief in this doctrine there is little
of the genuine spontaneous feeling there is
still less aristocracy here is as overweening
selfish and selfsufficient as in the old
world america is not an el dorado of
brotherly sympathy and love liberty
equalityfraternity are not vet engraven
on her escutcheonprobably never will be
so long as the illassoited connection between
the northern and southern states continues
sime my last i have been out on another
ramble through the romantic scenery of this
wild country the object of this excursion
was a visit to the worldrenowned niagara
there were a party of us of whom frederick
douglass was one e went by steamboat
on lake ontario from the landing near the
mouth of the genesee about three miles
from rochester immediately below the lower
falls of the genesee which were sparkling
bright and manvcolored in the suns wniii
rays the banks of thp genesee below the
falls as far the lake are high sloping and
covered with uncultivated verdure reflecting
beautifully on the glassy surface of the water
as we sailed late in the evening we had
but lmle opportunity to see the lake but so
far as w did see it before it became shrouded
under the cover of a dark night it was
smooth and unruffled as a sea of glass with
v irv a rt lple to disturb its calmness the
eapum and boats company of the cataract
w n courteous and attentivea circumstance
 lc inore deserving of notice since
m r informed me it was a rare j
t ling or him as of course for every other
person of color however fight the shadethe
deeper thet shadethe more ramtobe treated
with any degree of civility he strives vi
gorously however agaiuhi most dastardly
and despicable system of american injustice
and despotism with admirable courage and
resolution tolling them in p ain hig
estimate of their character hewing hisway
without mercy into their mean and cowardly
souls it wiu strange to you as it
certainly does to me that a man of superior
intellect and character like frederick doug
lass should be subjected to insult and be
liable to be ejected from the cabin of tfi
steamboat on no other account but that there
p a portion of afo o blood hi his veins
while miserable tobaccochewing scoundrels
into whose sensual souls ray of intellectual
light has never penetrated ignorant though
they my be of all the decencies of civilised
life are allowed without question to do about
just as they please what aa empty boast is
j this american human equality how des
picably ridiculous is the theory of equal rights
when illustrated by the light of such a fact as
this this system prerails throughout all
the northern states in the steamboats
hotels and all places of public resort and
evea when the captain of the steamboat or
the landlord of the inn would be willing that
 colored men should he admitted on equal
terms with those of paler complexion empty
headed puppies and vulgar blackguards who
know nothing but to smoke cigars and grow
whiskers are ready with their coarse ribaldry
and insulting taunts for the saucy nigger
out upon such republicanism it u one of
the northern fruits of southern slavery let
the american name be held op to the world
a a hissing a byeworj and a reproach till
this foul system of injustice and oppression
only a little lens foul than slavery itself is
blotted out entirely and for ever
after leaving the steamboat we went by
railroad to niagara this road for several
miles is cut along the side of a range of hills
of considerable heightprobably about the
same elevation as your pentland range occa
sionallv steep rugged jnd barren but for
the more part sloping gradually and wooded
to the very summit the tiew over the ver
dant valleys lying below was at many points
exceedingly picturesque and beautifuldotted
here and there wih a white farmhouse or a
cluster of venerable trees the remains of the
forest which not many years since as ap 
pears by the stumps which still stand firm
and sound reigned in undisturbed and silent
solitude over tins entire district of country
the village of niagara consists of some four
or five small streets with nothing particular
in them to attract attention some of the t
houses are large and aristocraticlooking but
the business of the village is hotelkeeping 
there arc many hotels several of which are
very extensive for the accommodation of the
numerous transient visitors who come merely
to see the falls
e were fortunate in enjoying fine wea
ther and bright sunshine which doubtless
added greatly to the picturesque grandeur of
these wild scenes i had heard and read
much about niagara and had always enter
tained some vague apprehensions that the
magnificence of the falls was overstated
but here exaggeration is impossible no
description can give any adequate idea of their
thrilling grandeur and sublimity the boil
ing waters must be seen and their wild roar
beard ere the inexpressible emotions which
are experienced while looking at and listen
ing to them can be appreciated
now as for ages pit boiling gushing
foaming ever rolling on continually like the
car of time to which are lashed the per
turbed spirits of the restless and the wicked
stirring up strife enmity and divisioncre
ating deadly feuds wars and commotions
and at length hurried headlong over the i
fearful precipice into an abyss of hideous
destruction
boiling gushing foaming ever onward
and on like the car of eternity to wliieh are
lashed ten thousand furies struggling
struggling with all the energy of a last
effort to release themselves from the chains
by which they are bound and at length 
hurled impetuously as by the aim of omni
potence into the hissing gulf of unending
torment
boiling gushing foaming ever while the
morning sun sliinos forth bright and glorious
and the dewdrops glisten on each blade of
grass like a cluster of the purest diamonds 
and the birds warble out their early song of
love and the farresounding woods echo and
reecho the joyous melody till it dies
away in softlysootliing murmurs in the far
distance
boiling gushing foaming ever while the
noonday sun looks down in dazzling splendor
upon the modest wildflower at the rivers
brink and the soft breath of summer gently
moves like an unseen spirit among the leaves
of the forest and the rushing waters as they
roll on and on in their ceaseless toil and
bubble sparkle and glitter in the suns
bright rays like immense blocks of quartz or
crystal which aie forced by some powerful
and unseen energy over the dizzy height
boiling foaming ever while the
moon shines forth iu silvery brightness and
the btars twinkle in the deep azure and all
else is calm and hushed and the voice of god
seems to whisper in the ear of listening na
turepeace peace peace to the troubled
breast rest for the wicked hope for the op
pressed
boiling gushing foaming ever in cloud
and in sunshine in storm and in calm onward j
and on ceaseless resistless as the hours ofi
time wing their flight into the bosom of
eternity
the river immediately above the falls is
divided into two branches by a cluster of
small islands which are connected with the
american side by numerous bridges on
these islands the visitor spends many hours
in a kind of bewildered ecstaey listening to
the raging waters and looking at the clouds
of spray as they ascend from the boiling
gulf the canada fall is much the most
magnificent for several yards in the centre
it descends bright and radiant as a polished
emerald contrasting beautifully with the
white and foaming surface which the rest of
fall presents in order to sec the fall from
below it is necessary to descend by a long
winding staircase following the guide and
well enveloped in an oilskin covering there is
little danger either of slipping or of getting
wet the footpath for a portion of the wav
is sufficiently wide for two to walk abreast
narrowing off to a mere ledge of the rock
and terminating in a rugged precipice which
overhaugs the hell of waters but a des
cription is impossible i have not tlui hardi
hood to attempt it suffice it to say that the
distance in the bend of the curve including
iris and prospect islands which divide the
american from the canada falls is 
yards and that the depth of the fall is from
 to  feet i can acarcely find in my
heart to find fault with the man who it isj
said from motives of miserly selfishness
preserves the rapids from the clatter of the
mill and tho manufactory the day how
ever is probably not far distant when tha ap
peuaooe of niagara will be greatly changed j
but now h may be truly said of iv the ey t
is not milled with seeing nor the ear with
hearing
we returned to rochester by way of buf
falo the distance between niagara and
bufialo is not more than twenty miles and
takes but a short time to travel by railroad
buffalo about twenty years mass was a
mere village of  inhabitants now it is a
large and rapidly growing city of not lem
than  it is one of the most remark
able instances of the mushroom growth at
american cities lying on lake erie it is
the connecting link between the east and the
west there is a considerable amount at
shipping in the harbor small brigs and large
steamboats i should not suppose from the
appearance of the steamboats that very se
vere storms are expected on those lakes
standing high out of the water with cabins
on the deck like floating wooden houses
they do not appear capable of enduring a
heavy sea the journey to chicago which
forms the western emporium on the lake
shore is about  miles and rifces nearly
four days a great portion of the country
around buffalo is still uncleared and on the
railroad ibr many miles nothing is to be
seen but deep and gloomy forests into which
the sun has never penetreted but even
now how different must be the appearance of
this country from what it was half a century
ago the steam engine is rapidly hewing a
way through these wild forests implanting
civilization and commerce and the hum of a
teeming population ere many years elapse
i doubt not the land around will be all
cleared and cultivated and towns and villages
rising up in all directions this change
would be produced even more rapidly were
it not for the shortsighted and selfish spirit ol
speculators who having purchased large
tracts of land are anxious to obtain high
prices and thus those who wish to purchase
are driven off to the far west where they
can obtain it at government price and the
population being thus scattered far and wide
are deprived of the means of improvement
and many social advantages this evil is
extending itself rapidly if legislative au
thority is of any use at all it is in such a
case as this and here it ought to be exer
cised monopoly of the soil is the worst and
most unnatural of all monopolies it is one
of the most grievous curses of the old
world and will unless some preventive
measures are adopted be so likewise of the
new some of the new states are agitating
measures which will to some extent provide
a remedy and others will in all probability
follow their example
the presidential election is now beginning
to be the chief topic of interest the popu
lar men of all parties are already in the field
with reference to the whig and the demo
cratic candidates one feels involuntarily forcec
to exclaim
oh that slfli difference there should lie
fbvixt rveeiledum and twcedledee
after all i a n rather disposed to the con
elusion that the election of a president is bu
little more than a party alair and that the
qualification principally required is the possi
bility of obtaining preferment
yours truly j d
lovdon may g isb
dear sir however much we may
rejoice in the progress of liberty indicated by
the recent french revolution it is impossible
to conceal from ourselves the fact that french
liberty is exposed to many dangers from the
irregular manner of its birth you will
probably have received ere this reaches you
full particulars of the mad attempt made bv
blanqui barbes and other fanatics assisted
i fear more or less by louis blanc albert
and others from whom better things might
have been expected to overturn the present
government which being established on the
broad basis of universal suffrage is certainly
ii not the best possible government at least
the government best entitled to rule in france
 lie example of the th of february seems
to have put into the heads of these men the
foolish notion that in order to rule it is only
necessary to get possession of the building
where government is conducted accord
ingly on the th may under pretence of a
demonstration of sympathy with poland they
invaded the national assembly dissolved it
took possession of the hotel de ville pro
claimed themselves a provisional govern
ment and were in the act of publishing other
decrees levying contributions on the rich for
the benefit of the poor and introducing thus
a system of general distrust and terror which
could end in nothing but civil war tyranny
and despotismwhen the national guard hav
ing absolutely rushed together as one man
with an enthusiastic determination to support
their own chosen representatives they were
arrested in the government offices and now
wait the trial and punishment due to their
criminal attempt the national assembly
again met and i think it will be found if the
government is not carried away by fear or an
ger from the moderate and conciliatory and
liberal course which lamartine appears to
have chalked out to any hasty or violent
measures that it has been strengthened by the
attempt the chief thing to be feared now
is that the assembly disgusted and terrified
by this display of popular ignorance and vio
lence may be led to distrust the mild and
broad principle on which fcamartine seems to
wish to rule the people indeed it has been
already rumored that he and ledru rouin are
about to resign their seats in the executive
committee in consequence of the want of
confidence manifested by the assembly
in the meantime so much disorder migns
in france and in the assembly itself that the
ardor of the friends of freedom in this coun
try who immediately after the revolution
addressed to the french nation loud and
warm expressions of admiration and sympa
thy is somewhat cooled we thought that
the revolution in france would accelerate pro
gress in this country and no doubt it has done
so but alter all we must rely entirely on
the justice of our cause and the strength of
our arguments for there is no country in the
world whether it be in the shape of a mon
archy or a republic to which we can point as
an example worthy of imitation it is now
several years since reformers id this country
who used to quote america as an instance of

see attending them to cause to be proclaimed
from the capital at washington the glad and

the war between lombardy and austria

the sites for churches scotland bill
passed the second reading some days since by
a very large majority in the house of com
mons it is called for by the circumstance
that some of the landholders in scotland pos
sessing very extensive tracts of country abso
lutely refuse pieces of land for chapels for the
free church congregations of course if
such tyranny were common and unchecked
it would amount to a virtual repeal of the act
f toleration uhe bill is liberal and cotnpre
hensive providing that under the circum
stances described any hundred persons re i
quiring ground for the building of a chapel
without reference to sect can compel the
landholders to let them have a site on fair aud
just terms the same principle ought to be
acted upon with regard to many other mat

exercise
mr ilumc was to have brought forward

london is always alive in the month of
may with its great meetings of religious and
philanthropical societies the religious that
j is home and foreign missionary and educa
tional societies meetings are now over and
 passed off without any novel incident the
only thing remarkable being the frequent in
troduction of radical sentiment in some of the
speeches and the warm leception given to it
by the meeting at the meeting of the
j antistate church association thespeak
ers generally expressed themselves in favor
of throwing most of their energy at present
into the movement for reform of parliament
as the shortest and surest road to all other
ameliorations the antislavery society
held its meeting on monday evening and
passed off well a colored gentleman i
j whose name i do not recollect from the unij
ted states was present and spoke and was
as usual well received the peace society
held its meeting on tuesday when some
dreadful exposures were made of the horrid
cruelties perpetrated during our chinese and
your mexican war a crowded meeting was
held last night in the londontavern in con
nection with the peoples league a new
organisation having for its object a reform of
parliament on the basis of universal or
as it is now called manhood suffrage
col thompson was in the chair and the
meeting was addressed by burnett mr gard
ner m p for leicester mr miall ac
tire physical force chartists had succeeded
to some extent in packing the meeting
but everything went off with great enthu
siasm and harmony until the lat resolution
had been proposed when they moved
not their usual amendment i but simply
a negative to the proposed resolution which
i regret to say seems to have been carried
this conduct proves them to be mere ob
structives
it mav perhaps be taken as a curious indi
tion of the effect produced is out court by the
recent events on the continent that prince
albert who has for four years been president
of the society fat improving the condition
of the laboring classes and has hitherto j
presided at the meetings by deputy thought
proper last week to do so in person the
change is by no means to be regretted for be
delivered a speech full of good sense and good j
feeling of which i give you a sentence or two
as a specimen depend upon h he said j
it ia to the advantage of those classes who
are so often contrasted hot whose interests
are identical p anile and it ia cofy ignorance
which prevents them from uniting fee each
others benefit to dispel that ignorance
ud to show the means hew mu ran hel r
mu notwithstanding the complicated state at
chitixed society ought to be the aim of every
philanthropic person hear but it h
moot peculiarly the duty of those whs undei
the blessings of divine providence enjoy us
lion wealth ud education cheers let
them be careful to raoid any dktatioaal inter
ference with labor and employment which
frightens awsv capital destroys that freedem
of thought ud independence of actios which
most remain to every one if he is to work
out his own happiness loud cheere and to
repose that confidence in each other on which
alone the enjoyment and mutual benefit of
mankind rest this is sufficient to give you
an idea of the spirit of the speech and surely
your southern slaveholders might take a les
son from the example of the occupant of a
throne an institution which no doubt they
regard as a relic of tyranny and which cer
tainly does seem to imply imperfect liberty
expressing his anxiety for the dispelling of
ignorance and the maintenance of freedom of
thought and independence of action among
the laboring classes the objects directly
aimed at by the society arc the erection of
model lodging houses the establishment of
loan fuuds and the allotment of cottage
lands in order as the prince said that the
working classes may learn with economy to
combine advantages and comforts to which
they have hitherto been strangers
in consequence of the suicide of mr
redhead yorkc one of the members of par
liament for the city of york there has been
a new election in that city at which mr vin
cent polled  votes in opposition to 
united votes of whigs and tones who after
all have sent up a man who has declared in
favor of household suffrage and the ballot
this certainly is a cheering evidence of pro
gress
sir henry lytton bulwer our ambassador
at madrid has just arrived here having been
sent away at  hours notice by the spanish
government in consequence of the cavalier
manner in which lord palmerston and he
urged upon them the adoption of a liberal
policy this incident will probably give rise
to a long paper war but it is to be hoped
nothing more as far as we are concerned
y ith regard to the spanish themselves i
presume hereafter we will be more disposed
to let them fight for liberty in their own way
and keep it if they can and lose it if they
cannot which probably will be no great loss
to them if only all the european powers can
be persuaded to act on the same principle
an insurrection is stated by the prcsse
french newspaper to have taken place at

killed and a large part of that beautiful town
reduced to ashes
the prussian national assembly has met
for the purpose of forming a constitution for
prussia the king opened the assembly in

formally published a general assembly of
delegates from all the german states is also
sitting at frankfortonthemaine for the pur
pose of forming a great germanic con
federation on the basis of a union of
people not as formerly of mere princes
at the opening of the prussian assembly
the king of prussia expressed the hope that
the war between prussia and denmark would
be terminated on the mediation of this
country
i regret to state that the house of lords
last night threw out the bill for the admission
of jews into parliament the numbers were
noes  ayes ijs majority  this
is much to be regretted as it shows that
intolerance and bigotry are still dominant in
that house and able to perpetrate injustice
under the cloak of christianity hut it may
perhaps stimulate the movement for the reform
of parliament yours c

the other day two exchange papers came
to our office at the same time the zions
herald and the cleveland true democrat
the herald contains a letter from hev c
collins of krnorv and henry college vir
ginia giving a rather heated account of a
controversy on calvinism now jroing on in
east tennessee this controversy is con
ducted on the presbyterianside by rev
frederick a ross through the pages of a
periodical called the calvimstic magazine
mr collins seems to feel it necessary to
turn aside from the merits of calvinism to
a consideration of the persoual affairs of
his leading opponent in the following para 
graph
as a matter of curiosity to many of your
new england readers it may not be amiss
to mention a fact in the personal biography
of mr ross he is by common consent
at the head of the presbyterian church in
east tennessee and is a man of learning
and talent he is also a fullblooded mu
latto the son of an old virginian planter by
one of his slaves i mention not this fact
by way of disparagement either of the man j
or his cause the merits of controversy 
rest on other foundations could a roan of 
his color and origin by any possibility 
reach the same position of influence in new
england how much he is indebted tor
his position and influence to the great wealth
he inherited from his father is not easy to
show every one can form ids own judg
ment on this question
the other paper has a letter from hon j

under a deep and abiding impression of the
duty we owe to god and our fellow beings
the antislavery women of rochester feel
i constrained to continue to persevere in their
efforts for the oppressed and suffering bood
men who still remain toiling unrequited in the
i southern prison house we are frequently
brought painfully to remember that not only
b their labor wrested from them unremunera
ted not only do they suffer from intense hun
i ser and cold not only are the fern lies oyn
sisters subjected to the cruel and passionate
outrages of their tyrannical masters and over
seers hut there are daily instances of sun
dering the dearest tics in nature thus sepn
rating them forever and can we expect any
thing bettercan we look for benevolence hr
fine feelings from a system  joul and fiend
ish as slavery it would be unreasonable
because a corrupt tree cannot bring forth
i good fruit therefore knowing that with
out associative action we cannot render effi
cient aid to this holy cause we affectionately
invite the cooperation of the eitizens of roch
ester and the public generally we ask them
to bear in mind the injunctions of jesus all
things whatsoever ye would men should do to
you do ye even so to them remember
also the beautiful parable in which he calls
our attention to the sick and to those who are
in prison and concludes by the forcible asser
tion inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the
least of these my brethren ye have done it
unto me we feel assured all that have
hearts to feel and arc careful to attend to the
monitions of conscienceall who are deter
mined to live for the good of our race instead
of devoting all their time to their own per
sonal easeall who feel bound to improve the
precious time allotted to them here by pro
moting as much as possible the cause of truth
and righteousness in the earth will come for
ward in the work of laboring to banish forever
the demon of slavery from our land and in
so doing instead of an example of corruption
and wickedness we should be a light to the
world
we hope no one will feel too poor nor any
too rich to enlist in this holy cause the
christians influence in whatever situation is
always salutary and will certainly produce its
good effects we ask for the aid of men and
of women we call on the old and the
young the farmer the mechanic and the
merchant we ask all and every one to give
us their help to devote what they can spare
either of money or of the fruits of their la
bor to the work of restoring men and women
to themselves to their manhood to the rights
and blessings with which they were endowed j
by our creator
for litis object vve propose holding a fair
in december next we ask the females in
the adjoining towns and country around us to
get up sewing circles and prepare bitch arti
cles as will be most saleable and to come fur
nish tables give us their company and help
us not only in selling those things thus pre
pared but in convincing the public mind of
the necessity of our perseverance and fidelity
and thus be helpers in hastening the day of
emancipation

tht is a well written pamphlet published
by the author at the request of a committee
of the sicietv before whom h was delivered
fhe author has repeated the discourse in
various places aud we believe to general
acceptance e would gladly publish the
address entire but have room for only the
following extracts
in order to pursue mv subject i
must for the sake of distinction use
 some of the improper terms of our
times i shall therefore speak of
races when in fact there is but one
race as there was but one adam
by an almost common consent the
modern world seems determined to
i pilfer africa of her glory it is not
enough that her children have been
scattered over the globe clothed in the
garments of shame humiliated and
oppressed but our enemies weary
themselves in plundering the tombs of
our renowned sires and in obliterating
their worthy deeds which were in
scribed by fame upon the pages of
 ancient history
the three grand divisions of the
earth that were known to the ancients
were colonized by the three sons of
 noah shcm was the father of the
asiaticsthe africans descended from
ham and japheth was the progenitor
j of the europeans these men being
the children of one father they were
i originally of the same complexionfor
we cannot through the medium of any
law of nature or reason come to the
conclusion that one was black another
was coppercolored and the other was
white adam was a red rnan and by
j what law of nature his descendants
became dissimilar to him is a problem
which is yet to be clearly solved the
fact that the universal father has va
ried the complexions of his children
docs not detract from his mercy or
give us reason to question his wisdom
moses is the patriarch of sacred
history the same eminent station is
occupied by herodotus in profane his
tory to the chronicles of these two
great men we are indebted for all the
information we have in relation to the
early condition of man if they are
incorrect to what higher authority
shall we appeal and if they are true
then we may acquaint ourselves with
the history of our race from that period
when yonder pbere sublime
pealed their first notes to sound the march of time j
ham was the first african egypt
was settled from an immediate descend
ant of ham who in sacred history is
called mesrairn and in uninspired his
tory he is known by the name of
menes vet in the face of this histor 
ical evidence there are those who
affirm that the ancient egyptians were j
not of the pure african stock the
gigantic statue of the sphynx has the
peculiar features of the children ofj
ham one of the most celebrated
queens of egypt was nitocris an
ethiopian woman yet these intel
lectual resurrectionists dig through a
mountain of such evidence and de
clare that these people were not
negroes
we learn from herodotus that the
ancient egyptians were black and had
woolly hair these people astonished
the world with their arts and sciences
in which they revelled with unbounded
prodigality they became the masters
of the east and the lords of the he
brews no arm less powerful than
jehovahs could pluck the children of
abraham from their hands the
plagues were marshalled against them
and the pillars of cloud and of fire
and at last the resistless sea then
the horse and his rider sank like lead
in the mighty waters but the king
dom of the pharaohs was still great
the most exalted mortal euiogium that
could be spoken of moses w as that he
was learned in all the learning of the
egyptians it was from them that he
gathered the materials with which he
reared that grand superstructure par
taking of law poetry and history
which has tilled the world with wonder
and praise mournful reverses of fof

away the moon has left the sky
and all the constellated stars have gom
down forever so the bright dreams o

flight of timeand live forgetful ir
light and joy and hope only to returi
and weep in darkness more dark ant
loneliness more lonely but mary oui
darkness like the clouds must have it
sunny side for god takes blessing
from us only where their absence is thi
greater blessing sorrow sanctified

ly once to look along the pages of a
book and i have heard you say mary
you would rather see the flowers than
all the world beside but oh i i wore
to be blessed with one moment l sight
i would pray lot me look iro the luce
of a cherished friend a pair of soullit
eyes beaming with intelligence and
love whose spiritglances imagination
cannot picture and things so holy un
sanctilied memory may not treasure
saddened feelings steal upon us when
w ith ravished ears we listen to descrip
tions of paintings on the walls and
rainbows on the clouds but mary
have you never thought the angels are
always nearer there to bear our
thoughts away where light is that
fades not where the painter with his
brush of divine art dipped in colors
native well sketches holy imagery
scenery of heaven where deathless
flowers bloom by living fountains and
the fair forms of the blest where day
springs fragiant dews hang impearled
upon their seraph locks here the
poet seated upon some blissful mound
writes while the inspirations of holy
genius burn along his lines where
truths into which we here look and
grow bewildered with their depth we
shall there explore invited by the voice
of him who sits in majesty enthroned
and sways oer earth and heaven his
potent rule whose creating hand
moulds worlds and tosses them into the
fields of aether pencil hung clothes
the lillies of the field and tempers the
winds to the shorn lamb
mary life is what we make it shut
out from all that is external we are
pretty much the creators of the world
we live in let us see to it then that
we be good creators since day anc
night are the same we can as well peo
ple our minds with the beams of the
one as the clouds of the other as wel
call back images of joy and gladness
as those of grief and care the latter
however may sometimes be our guest
to sup and dine but let them never b
permitted to lodge with us we came
forth in childhoods morn to gatliei
flowers and because on our way wc
have dropped a few we will not si
down and weep over the lost but rath
er amuse ourselves by counting and
admiring those we have left blindness
makes us painfully dependent but got
forbid our hearts murmur or our lips
complain the earth is the lords
aud the fullness thereof the cattle
upon a thousand hills are his running
waters and green pastures are in his
hands and even now he may be lead
ing us hither by ways wc have nol
known in the love and sympathy o
friends who every where hasten to d
us kindness we have a wellspring o
pleasure inexhaustible as the good
feelings of the human heart cora is
an angel of patience mary or i hac
not written you so long a letter hei
little hand must be weary thiugh she
says no and when i complain of trou
j bling her she folds her am arouiu
my neck and w hispers afflicted frjends
are our ministering spiritsfor us the
languishfor us they die
mary it is four by the clock and 
fancy myself again in the inslitutior
parlor drumming a piano lesson as i
noise were its only object now opem

all in tbe same breath exclaim mr
dean mr dean no he has not
come yet now they are not mistaken
his well known tread in the ball the

jgo away now my children to play
i while  read a little to these larges
girls bless bis heart some choici
book we know perhaps just from th
press and as we sit encircled round
hour after hour goes unheeded by til
late in the evening we bid him gooc
night at the yard gate it is a lon
walk to mr deans mansion but hap
py thoughts like good society alwayi
annihilate time and distance oh
mary is it not heartrending to live
over in after time scenes of such rid
enjoyment i often wonder who comes
to read for you on sabbath evenings
now our good friend mr murray has
j made his home in oswego we aevei
forget thoae to whom we have beer
truly kind so we will hope thoughts ol
those whom his frequent visits made sc
happy will come to him sometimes even
there mary every body is kind to us
and why is it so yesterday two ca
naries were presented to me one j
shall bring to you and the other to ann
their voices are equalled in sweetness
by none but your own pardon me il
i flatter but i could not complimeni
their musical powers more or describe
them to you better remember me
kindly to all in the institution and say
in the month of roses i shall again be
with them good bye mary

importance of listening
well
it seems paradoxical to observe that
the art of listening well forms a duty
of conversation to give up the whole
of your attention to the person who ad
dresses himself to you is sometimes a
heavy task but it is one which we
must pay for the privileges of social
life and an early practice will render it
almost an involuntary act of good breed
ing whilst consideration for others
will give this little sacrifice a merit and
a charm of which the lowest proof of
christian feeling can never be devoid
to listen well is to make an uncon
scious advancement in the power of
conversing in listening we perceive
in what the the interest in what the
failure of others consist we become
too aware of our own deficiencies
without having them taught through
the medium of humiliation e find
ourselves often more ignorant than we
could have supposed it possible e
learn by a very moderate attention to
the sort of topics which please to form
a style of our own the ait of conver
sation is an unph a ant phrase the
power of conversing well is least agree
able w hen it assumes the character of
an art in listening a wellbred gen
tlewoman will gently sympathise with
the speaker or if needs nmst be dif
fer us gently much character is
shown in the art of listening some
people appear to be in a violent hurry
whilst another speaks they hasten on
the person who addresses them as one
would urge on a horse with yes yes
very good ah others sit on the
full stare eyes fixed as those of an
owl upon the speaker from others
a loud and long laugh is at intervals
produced and all the company turn
round to see what was the cause of the
merriment but all these vices of man
ners may be avoided by a gentle atten
tion and a certain calm dignity of man
ner based upon a reflective mind and
humble spirit hints to yeung ladies

hamburg 
i felt a sincere and deep respect for
the old city which the narrow streets
and thronging masses of the people
helped to sustain i really believe our
coachman drove us up one street and
down the other in order to show us the
imposing greatness of the town for it
lasted almost an eternity before we
came to the hotel de baviere in
neue jungfernstieg where we de
scended here within the city itself it
looks well as the alster which is
broad and large separates as it were
the old town from the new the high
towers are reflected in the water where
the swans glide along and the boats
rock with their loads of welldressed
persons the jungfernstieg is
crowded with promenaders and along
here where the one hotel lies by the
side of the other the doorways are
thronged with waiters upperwaiters
and upperwaiters upperwaiters
we will however not tarry here
but reserve our visit until the evening
when all is lighted up although it can
well bear being seen by daylight we
will venture into the crowd amongst
hackney coaches shouting retailers of
ail kinds flower girls from vicrlanden
and busy monied inen from change
it looks as if it were but one single
shopso thickly do they press on each
other the streets cross one another
and down towards the elbe we find
some to wiich the entrance i  through
a lobby and where scarcely any one
can live that exceeds a certain circum
ference unless lie live in them contin
ually i stuck my head into one of
them but durst not go further for they
reminded me of a dream  once bad
how the houses iu ostergade east
street copenhagen where i wa
walking also began to walk but with
their fronts towards each other so that
the streets had the appeal ance of these
hamburg streets and as they made
another stepl sat squeezed in between
the walls and could neither get forward
nor backward which was rather un
pleasant
yet a swarm of children played about
in them quite pleased and satisfied in
that half obscure hamburgerworld
a poor man who was buried four
men bore the coffin and the wife fol
lowed they had some difficulty in
passing through the narrow lane the
way was straight not a sunbeam found
its way down hereit vy only when
they emerged into the broader streets
that the sunlight fell on the bumble
 coffin i heard a story about this fw
oeral which ia as poetically touching
as it is true
within this narrow street high uj
in an equally narrow chamber lay this
poor corpse the wife sat and wep
over it she knew of no expedient u
get it buriedshe had no means th
window stood open when a canarybirc
flew into the room and settled by its
head of the corpse where it began t
sing it made a strange impression oi
the woman she could weep no longer
for she imagined it must have come
down to her from the lord the bin
was tame it allowed itself to be caughl
j directly and as she related the circum
j stance to a neighbor and showed bet
the bird the woman remembered thal
she had shortly before read an adver
tisement in the newspaper about a ca
narybird that had flown away from it
home
i it was the smio bird and the wo
man on restoiiug it to its owners found
there human hearts who rendered hef
such assistance as enabled her to bury

vocal music
the hutchinsons we consider an
exception to modern performers and
their singing a fine specimen of what
vocal music ought to be w hat is it
that adds such a mighty charm to their
music that attracts such full aad
crowded houses upch a general rush
wherever they go some may answer
it is the power melody and harmony of
their voices but these alone would
 not do it these qualities it is true
are essential but something more is
necessary which they always have to
witsimplicity all ostentation and
display all affectation or pretending to
be what they are not is loathed and
abhorred by them nature truthsim
plicity springing from purity of heart
motive principle these added to the
natural gills of voice furnish the mys
terious popularity it was simplicity
which threw around these unpretend
ing americans such a halo of splendor
in europe it was this which first at
tracted the attention and admiration and
enlisted the active exertions and power
ful influence of william and mary
howitt and many other people of virtue
and distinction in old england in favor
of our unassuming neighbors had
tiiese plain vocalists laid aside their
simplicity which still so gracefully be
fits them and put on airs of style and
fashion and superiority all their melo
dy and splendor of voice would have
availed t ein nothing affectation never
reaches the heart natire truth sim

the gold watch
i have now in my hand a gold watch
which combines embellishment and
utility in happy proportions and is
usually considered a very valuable
appendage to the person of a gentle
man its hands lace chain and case
are of chased and burnished gold its
gold seals sparkle with the ruby the
topaz the sapphise the emerald i
open it and find that the works with
out which this elegant chased case
would be a ineie shell those hands
motionless and those figures without
meaning are made of brass i investi

spring by which ail taese arc put in
motion made of lam told it is made
of steel i ask what is sleet the
reply is that it is iron which has under
gone a certain process so then  find
the main spring without which the
watch would be motionless and its
hands figures and embellishments but
toys is not of goldthat is not suffi
ciently good nor of brass that would
not dbut of iron iron is therefore
the only precious metal and this
watch an apt emblem of society iu
hands and figures winch tell the hour
