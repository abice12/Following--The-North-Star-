from the pittsburgh saturday visitor
sale of a white girl
mrs j g swtsshelm the peruj
gal of the journal which you so ably
edit has been a source of much en
joyment to me since i became a resi
dent of this city i seek it with avidityl
and read it with a gratification  have
not the ability to describe
the iirst half hour which i spent
reading some of your spirited articles
anent real liberty shed a feeling of
you in my heart that i can compare to
the delight the miserable victim of ty
ranny feels when the sun pours its glo
rious rays through the narrow window
of his dungeon i had been living
down south where the probability of
my adorning an awning post was more
than once hinted to me on my making
inquiries for an amislavery newspaper
which a friend as verdant as myself
sent me through the post office
during the earlier part of my sojourn
in this country i lived in a slave state
there every saturday my ears were
assailed with the indian voice of the
wicked and inhuman auctioneer as he
shouted the remunerative qualities of
the wretched being on sale while the
villanous speculators in the souls for
which the son of god gave up his life
on the cross handled and felt the poor j
victims bodies and queried warrant
them sound exactly as one would do
if buying a horse my god how 
blushed for my kind pray observe
that i was in a place where according
to the whigs slavery existed in its
mildest form in fact i was in one of
the strongest whig cities in the union
and yet i was eyewitness to a scene
enough to freeze your very soul with
horror the atrocity of which no one
can conceive who has not been a wit
ness of the like
one day i noticed the slave market
rather more crowded than usual it
was directly opposite the store in which
i was engaged curiosity led me to
swell the number of the audience and
o god i shall never forget the scene
which presented itself to my view a
beautiful girl about yearsof age as
white as the fairest belle in pittsburgh
stood drowned in tears and wofuliy
dejected beside the devil incarnate
whose business it was to dispose of her
body and soul to the highest bidder he
spoke long loud and lasciviously of her
charms but could not entirely quench
the latent spark of human feeling
some few cried shame he could
not excite the bestial passions of the
lustful to entrench upon their pockets
to the extent he wished not even the
brutal traders in female purity from
new orleaiih were satisfied with his
exordiums of her excellence they
should know more an aged gentle
man bid soo and there it stopped
the old mans eye glistened and he
drew up his attenuated form to its full
height he thought the prize was his
and that before tomorrows sun had
sunk m the west the fair flower that
now bloomed before him would be
blighted and blasted forever but not
so the skilful auctioneer of gods
image saw that he had raised as much j
as he could with the poor girls present
appearance as she had clothed herself
as nearly as they would allow her he
crying gentlemen you know not what
a prize you let slip pulled off a turban
which she wore and a magnificent
head of loog hair fell down about her
shoulders as dark as night and wavy
as the sea when fanned by a gentle
breeze the southern rascal bid oo
the old one oo and again all was fair
for the hope of the septuagenarian j
the north star
iwhen with dastard band the ruffian
salesman tore asunder the dress which
covered her bosom and exposed to the
libertine gaze around him a bust in
beauty and purity never surpassed by
painter or sculptor i turned away
and went home sick at heart forgive
me o god if i almost doubted your
justice i was informed some few
hours after that the poor girl swooned
and while in a state of insensibility
wsa examined bid for and at last
bought by one of th southern traders
may god have pity on her
on inquiry  found that she had been
raised and educated by an old lady
whose property she was and who died
i suddenly intestate for the purpose
of division among her heirs her real
estate and slaves were all sold by auc
tion undei an order from some court
of law i had lived for many years
lin a country where law and not jus
tice ruled had seen much of the m
quity of the system but never was so
 thoroughly disgusted as in this instance
i remained but a few weeks in tennes
see and without the slightest feeling of
regret although i left many dear rela
tions behind came here a comparative
stranger to all around me but have
now made many dear friends all of
whom have as great a repugnance to
the horrible traffic as myself
having witnessed all  have just re
lated can you wonder if the perusal
of a paper such as yours should
give me infinite pleasurl the only one
in this country at the time of my arri
val which advocated the rights of man
as a journal professing antislavery
opinions should
can it surprise you that i should use
expressions of admiration to yourself
when i say that to your exertions  at
tribute a vast deal of the antislavery
spirit which i find infused in the minds
of the young men with whom business
or choice leads me to associate rea
son common sense will tell you that
flattery is neither my forte at any time
nor my object now i have never seen
you yet i know respect and admire
you and ever shall for the sake of
the glorious principles you so nobly up
hold
your exposition of the case of the
edmonson girls in last saturdays visi
ter induced me to send you the pre
ceding sketch trusting if you con
sider it worth publication it may have
some influence on the minds and purses
of the ladies of pittsburgh in their fa
vor to the fate of that poor girl the
pious edmonsons may not comenay
will not for i am sure that among the
pureminded ladies of this city alone
the sum necessary would be raised
sooner than the horrible sacrifice should
be consummated v
but there are hundreds of beautiful
and gifted creatures in the south who
undergo day after day the same bru
tally degrading exhibitionand for whom
no cry is raised
mothers i conjure you by the guar
dian care of the honor of your children
wives i abjure you by the holy love
you bear your husbandsdaughters
i entreat you by your hallowed feelings
have no fellowship with a slavehold
er or anything in the shape of man
who countenances the vile doctrine that
slavery is right where its exists by
law his touch is contamination and
his honor a mockery in fact he is a
living lie and as such should be
scouted from all honorable society
and from any participation in the affec
tions or interest of a true woman
fully confident that you will as ever
i do your duty in the good fight and
wishing you all the health and happi
ness you deserve  remain madam

testimony against slavery
the new york observer of novem
ber  contains a memorial from the
synod oi cincinnati to the triennial
assembly it is said to have been
adopted by a unanimous vote the
conclusion of this memorial is as fol
lows
natural and inalienable rights are
derived from god and are defined and
protected by his authority and no
human authority individual or national
is at liberty to abrogate or abridge
them or to extenuate or justify their
violation and to attempt to do so is
rebellion against the divine govern
ment
in one half thestates of this uuion
there are laws which deny to a part of
the population the control of their per
sons and just compensation of their
labor which in some cases prohibit
intellectual cultivation making it penal
to instruct slaves to read thus virtually
depriving them of the personal use of
the word of god which totally disre
gard the marriage relation and subvert
the family institution violating its in
tegrity rendering it impossible to pre
serve its purity and frustrating its
grand design by refusing parents due
opportunity to exercise tbeir rights or
discharge their duties which make all
the facilities for obtaining a knowledge
of religion as well as the entire out
ward practice subject to the will f the
master which supersede the moral
government of god by tbe substitution
of physical force for the guidance of
conduct and formation of character
and whioh attempt to establish human
legislation with reference to personal
rights in opposition to that which ia
divine
the system of servitude upheld and
perpetuated by these laws is both in
its principles end practice essentially
different from that recognized and sanc
tioned in the old ar new testaments
the old testament securing certain
personal political aod religious rights
which the american system totally de
nies and the new testament requir
right is of no sextruth is of no ooloilgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren
ins masters to forbear threatening
and to give their servants as the
dreatures of god and not of lav or
corrupt custom what is just and
equal a requisition which if followed
would at once annihilate the assumed
right of property in od elevate
the slaves to the dignity and right of
men
we are glad to know that the kind
feeling and moral principle of the com
munity prevent the full exercise st the
despotic and cruel power conferred by
these laws and lead to many efforts to
ameliorate to a limited extent the de
graded and wretched condition of those
held in this bondage yet we are con
strained to believe that a considerable
number of the officers and members of
our churches exact and receive the
services of tbeir fellow men under these
laws and claim and exercise the power
thv in an doing tfo jf nye in
volved in the guih of this system and
assist to perpetuate it by the sanction of
their example and influence if they
donot defend it as scriptural and right
in view of this whole subject there
fore
resolved that this paper be for
warded as an expression of the views
of this synod to the general assembly
at its next meeting in may next and
that we memorialize that body in behalf
of our whole church to bear its solemn
and decided testimony against these
practices as inconsistent with a chris
tian profession and requiring the exer
cise of church discipline and against
the countenance encouragement or
defence of the system by which they are
produced and upheld

respected sir  hope you will
pardon me for addressing you this note
yet imperious duty compels me the
young man who subscribed to your pa
per for me doubtless forgot that he was
doing what is expressly forbidden by
the laws of maryland respect for
those laws induces me to respectfully
request you to discontinue sending your
paper to me were lin a state where
the bright star of freedom sheds its
inspiring rays on the white as well as
those of our color then  would read
your paper with delight again allow
me to reiteratel hope you will par
don me for addressing you this note i
would have paid the postage for this
note but our postmaster is so very in
quisitive
respectfully your obedient servant
what a comment is this upon our
stereotyped boasts of liberty of speech
and of the press as existing in the
united states here is a man who
desires to read a particular newspaper
but the law of a sovereign state inter
poses and says you must not read
that paper it you do we shall fine
or imprison you it is hostile to the
institution of slavery and does not
hesitate to express its opinion with
frankness and boldness we cannot
permit it to come within the limits of our
authority is there in russia a worse
despotism than this we know it is
alleged as an excuse for such laws that
they are intended to prevent insurrec
tions but this is all a fudge as every
well informed person knows how in
expressibly mean and vile must be that
institution which can only live by sacri
ficing the freedom of the press
against it who that has a soul will not
wage eternal hostility philadelphia

public meeting of colored

at a public meeting of the colored
citizens of this borough convened in
the schoolhouse on monday evening
nov th  for the purpose of
taking into consideration the subject
matter contained in a circular received
from the colored citizens of alleghany
county pa respecting the right of
franchise the meeting was called to
order by the appointment of william h
wilson president and john williams
wm whipper and h h webb sec
retaries after which the following pre
amble and resolutions in connection
with others were adopted
whereas we delight in honor that
righteous maxim in american juris
prudence which declares that mil just
governments derive their power from
the consent of the governed and
whereas this sublime and fundamental
principle of legislationso dear to ev
ery american heartso admirably just
and benevolent in its features so
beautifully illustrates the republican
principles of the early founders of the
ancient and honored commonwealth of
pennsylvania that it was to us a source
of deep regret that her progressive his
tory should be marked by either the
denial or obliteration of rights and pri
vileges in our persons that have from
the foundation of the government been
regarded as the birthright claim of the
nativeborn citizen therefore be it
resolved that we will respectfully
petititioo the legislature of this state
at the ensuing session and ask our fel
lowcitizens to petition for the repeal of
this antirepublican feature from the
constitution of pennsylvania
resolved thst we sre unwilling to
believe that the people end lawgivers

settlements foe colored men
some very praiseworthy attempts have
been made in various parts of the state
of new york it b well known to es
tablish settlements for colored men
and we believe with some success we
learn now that a new effort is to be
made in the town tof florence oneida
county colored men having had several
meetings upon tbe subject in which
they have been making efforts to induce
the colored citizens of boston albany
new york and philadelphia to follow
farming or mechanical pursuits in the
new settlement rather than be barbers
servants c as they are in the cities
in florence it is said there are wa
ter privileges for sawmills and indeed
everything necessary for a flourishing
settlement
one great cause if not the great
cause of the degradation of the colored
men at the north is no doubt the way
they crowd together in cities and any
project therefore which can take them
out of the cities and turn them into
tillers of the soil is calculated to
their condition here in tbe cifflß
ambition can hold out to them no ade
quate temptation for the accumulation
of property or for instructing the miad
but in a settlement of their own
where all are on terms of equality there
will be the same inducements to wok
study and that the white
men have in their various spheres of
society all such projects as these to
better the condition of the colored race
have our warm and hearty support

suffrage
in the times of saturday there is a
pithy and well written article by one of
our disfranchised colored men upon
the subject of universal suffrage the
argument is well put and put exactly
in the right place too the young
democracy of the city are framing
their creed and if they have the
courage of reformers and the candor of
honesty they will put planks enough
into their platform for all men to stand
upon the old democratic party is
especially responsible for the apostacy
of pennsylvania from the faith ot the
fathers and they never will be able to
say that their souls are their own till
they repair that great wrong taxa
tion without representation was the
exact fact by which britains king
lost states thirteen and the princi
ple that all governments derive their
just powers from the consent of the
governed was the very fulcrunof the
revolutionary lever which overthrew
the tyranny of the past ages can the
democracy of pennsylvania any longer
sin against its own soul will it hesi
tate any longer to vindicate its own
truth the race that is set before it
cannot be run unless it throws away
every weight and the tin that so easily
besets it we demand justice for the
oppressedwe demand it from the men
who inflicted the wrongwe demand it
from the men who profess to be tbe
red reisers of all wrong sod we tell

j g palfreys liberation of
slave property
we publish the following account of
mr palfrey act of philanthropy in
liberating slaves which he inherited
it is taken from the lowell courier of
november th  and was written
by william schouler esq editor of
the boston atlas who at that time was
editor of the courier it is a truthful
account of the whole affair and con
tains in addition some remarks which
show an appreciating estimate of mr
palfreys character we commend it
to the people of district no  as being
quite as likely to be correct as any
thing they will be likely to get from the
same source during the present can
vass
in advocating mr palfreys election
we may frequently have occasion to
make use of the editorials of the lowei
courier of the fall of  we shall
be saved the trouble of writing articles
of a similar character and shall com
pliment our neighbor over the way by
giving the productions of his better days
to the public
ho job g palfexy we trust
that our whig friends io the fourth
district will not suftertheir organization
to get out of order before they have
had one more trial to elect a member of
congress the defeat of the hon
john g palfrey at the hud trial was
deeply regretted by the whigs through
out the state we knew the man and
we knew his popularity in the district
and we believed be would he elected on
the first trial but we were mistaken
the liberty party vote was larger than
we anticipated it would have been mr
palfrey made however a glorious run
he went ahead of his ticket no whig
ever came so near an election in the
district on the first trial last year
the majority against gov briggs in the
district was fifteen hundred now mr
palfrey comes within about four hun
dred votes of an election this should
encourage our whig friends to make a
strenuous effort at the next trial they
have but to pot forth their whole
strength and n glorious triumph will be

one word in referenoe to the greet
thllsmurfsenr which appeared
in the the week
bstf phiitntkpipy
which graces the life of john g pal
frey and which will be spoken of and
applauded long after tbe present con
test is ended aod forgottenwe mean
of course the liberation of the slaves
which fell to him by inheritance and
the manner in which the act of libera
tion was accomplishedthe freeman
told the people that there was no pe
cuniary sacrifice made by mr palfrey
because he was a man of great fortune
being possessed of some two or three
j hundred thousand dollars never was
there a grosser error promulgated about
a candidate mr palfrey is far from
being a rich man he is dependent
upon his salary of secretary of state
for his present means of living and we
koow that he entertained doubts whe
ther he could afford to sacrifice the in
come which his present office gives him
i for the more uncertain pay of a mem
ber of congress but mr palfrey ac
ceded to the wishes of the whigs of
his district and accepted of the nomi
nation
we regret that circumstances render
it necessary for us to touch upon mat
ters of this description in speaking ot
the claims of candidates for the suf
frages of the people it is contrary to
our practice but we think it due to
mr palfrey due to the whig party
and due to truth and justice that the
statement in the freeman should be
corrected
we have said but little of the act ol
philanthropy during the late canvass
which the freeman sneers at and tries
to belittle it was a noble act nevei
theless and evinces a warm heart and
liberal mind the slaves who owe their
liberty to him were worth in new or
leans ten thousand dollars they were
w at he inherited and we believe all
that he inherited from the estate of his
father he immediately proclaimed
them freemennay more he made a
journey to louisiana and brought the
liberated slaves with him to free massa
chusetts at his own expense and found
places for them where they could earn
decent livelihoods and live freemen
this was all done without parade and
without a desire that the act should be
known and we venture to say so little
had the matter been bruited abroad
that at the time of his nomination noi
onefourth part of the voters of his dis
trict ever heard of the act mr pal
frey takes no himself for the
part he took he says he only did his
duty and no more when some gen
tlemen called on mr palfrey two years
ago and asked that his name might be
used at the convention aa a candidate
for the nomination they referred to the
tact of liberating the louisiana slaves
and told him that it would be a popular
theme and would greatly facilitate his
eleelioh he refused to allow his name
to be brought forward and said that he
could not bear that that act should be
spoken of as a claim upon the people
for their votes any one acquainted
with mr palfrey will readily appre
ciate the motives which influenced him
and bow a gentleman of his highly cul
tivated acutely sensitive and finely
balanced mind would shrink from the
idea of having one of hi benevolent
acts even though that act be one tak
ing everything connected with it that
has as we believe no parallel in new
england paraded before the public as
something which is to be remunerated
by a seat in congress
we mention these facts because of
the unfounded and we may add almost
unparalleled slanders which have been
circulated through the freeman edi
torially and by the address of the de
mocratic district committee in refer
ence to mr paltrey but it is not from
these facts that we ask the intelligent
voters of the fourth district to vote for
mr palfrey they are only meant to
influence the public mind so far as they
show the character of tbe whig candi
date we ask the people to vnte for
mr palfrey because he is an able and
truehearted whig a man deeply
learned of spotless reputation of high
and commanding talents a vigorous
writer and an eloquent speaker he is
an advocate of human progress in its
broadest and most comprehensive sense
not tied down to the dead letter of the j
past his mind is filled with hopeful as
pirations of the attainment of a higher
civilization a truer libertyone capa

family of man whatever may be the

be said that he twice failed of an elec

a steamboat running between n york

having found a man who was divest

wretched state of health in conse
quence of drinking he induced him
amidst the discouragements of the tav

fonnd him to sign the temperance
pledge for one year the landlord
prophtcted that be would not keep the
pledge n year or that if be did he
would never renew it an the year

at his stomach and of various evils
among which was a bad lump on one

number of months ah said the
landlord did  not tell you it would
kill you to break off drinking so sud
denly  wonder you bare lived
as long as you have come wbat will
you take and suiting the action to
the word he placed a decanter befor

what a fool said the landlord
if you go on as you have done you
will not live another year
do you really think so landlord
certainly come what will you
take
oh no landlord  have sigoed
the pledge again and then this terrible
lump on my side ido not believe that
drinking will make it auy better
it is all because you left off drink

a bigger lump than that oo the other
side before long if you continue another
year as the last
do you think i will well then
so be it i will not violate my pledge
for look here landlord pulling out a
great purse with a hundred dollars in
silver shining through the interstices
that is my lump which has been growing
for so many months and as you say it m
is all in consequence of signing the

had if i had not signed it and if i
have a bigger one than that for 
years i will not go to drinking again

human hydrophobia
one could almost suppose that hy
drophobia in a certain modified form
was an endemic in human society as
well as amongst dgs the lower por
tion of the community in particular
seem to consider themselves as having
a prescriptive right to suffer from it
the diagnosis of the malady in the
human patient does not point to a ca
tastrophe altogether so abrupt and tra
gical as in the canine but it is attended
by circumstances quite as sinister
dirty faces dirty clothes dirty houses
dirt all over are the symptoms which
most forcibly arrest attention and yet
bad as these are know that there
are worse effects underneath the sur
face for where physical dirt goesthere
also resides moral degradation
we know of no country in europe
where there is so little disposition on the
part of the people as in ours to give
themselves even that exbiluatiag hipd
of ablution which is derived from bath
ing at the present season the trav
eller on the continent finds the rivers
alive with swimmers and we remember
when sailing down the loire to nantez
observing the steamer frequently sur
rounded more especially when nearing
the great manufacturing cuy with
crowds of black heads and white
shoulders in russia where the peo

an appeal for justice
the undersigned a committee appointed a
a meeting held in faneuil hall in the mom
of may last to take measure for the defence
of daniel drayton now confined in prison in
the district of columbia on the charge ol
stealing rlaves beg leave to make the follow
ing statement
there was and we suppose still is in the
distrist of columbia if not already sold oil
to the south a numerous family of colored
persons by the name of bell moses bell
the father of this family obtained his free
dom by a decision of the supreme court ol
the united stales on the ground that he hat
been brought into the district contrary t
law bells wife and children claimed thei
freedom also under the will of her forme
owner a suit vim brought to enforce thi
claim which faileo as we are informed oi
account of some informality or other defect ii
the will expecting that his wife and child
ren would be speedily sold off to the south
bell went to philadelphia to solicit funds foi
their redemption a large sum would be re
quired for that purpose these person
eemed equitably entitled to freedom and th
idea was started of sending a vessel to wash
ington to bring them away without anj
privity on the part of bell the case of hi
family was mentioned to captain drayton
and believing the bells to be free in equity i
not in law drayton volunteered on the pay
ment of the necessary expenses to procure j
vessel and to go with it to washington t
bring the bells away
information of what was intended wai
communicated to a person at washington if
order to give notice to the parties interested
and being aware of the edmonson girls
those girls lately brought to the public notice
and redeemed from slavery and threatenec
prostitution by the liberality of some person
in new york he thought it would be i
good opportunity for them to escape also hf
communicated the opportunity to them and tc
several others they communicated it to theii
friends and when captain drayton came tc
sail instead of having sevm passengers as he
had expected he had ten times that number
drayton was pursued overtaken anc
brought back to washington he had beer
guilty if of any offence of the simple offence
of transporting the slaves out of the district
but not content with finding seventyfour in
dictments against him on that ground thf
grand jury of the district under advice of thf
district attorney found fortyone additions
indictments for stealing slaves from as manj
different owners
the trials of two of these indictments con
sumed upwards of a fortnight and anothei
fortnight was taken up with the trial of othei
cases connected with the matter contrary
to an express decision lately made in ala
bama and other cases leaning the same way
in other courts of the slaveholding states
and without the shadow of any authority tc
support him the presiding judge of the crim
inal court thomas h crawford late oi
pennsylvania instructed the jurythat tc
constitute stealing there need not be any
design to convert the article taken to the
takers use that any incidental gain to any
body was enough that to help slaves tc
escape from their masters was stealing if the
person so helping enticed or induced the
slaves to go and that in the present case
the freedom to be obtained by the slaves was
a sufficient technical causa lucri f but even
under this most extraordinary ruling by
which the best settled principles of the law ol
larceny were disregarded and set aside there
was no case made out against the prisoner
there was not the slightest evidence that
drayton had enticed or induced the slaves or
any slave to run away in fact he had never
seen one of the company till he found them on
board bis veaael et two juries under the
pressure of the outside mob and the mobo
crauc exhortations of the prosecuting officer
after befog out each time some twentyfour
hours brought in verdicts of guilty on which
ihe judge sentenced drayton to twenty yen
imprisonment sayers the master of the
vessel charged also with stealing wsr tried
on two indictments on the very same evidence
and acquitted when the other thirty nine in
dictments against bun were abandoned
draytons case fo till open to review by
the superior courts the honor ofthe natto
demands that such perversion of all law should
t set aside the funds hitherto contributed
tor the purposes of this case and others con
nect with it amounting to w in all
have been exhausted as much more i
needed to carry the matter to a sucesaaful
conclusion and for that sum the committee

citizen legislators before speaking to
you of the condition of the republic it ia of
great consequence that the causes which hare
brought about this condition should be anal

you know gentlemen a criminal faction
the audacity of which has increased in pro

opposed it has attempted within the past year
to revolutionise the country in order to sup
pics the bursting forth of fatally excited feel
ng the people became aroused and enormous
sacrifices followed the amount of public ex
penses wan immeasly increased at the same
time that our receipts are diminishing this
is tbe necessary consequence of the loss of la

tinue to abandon their fields in order to guard
the safety of the country
the new cabinet having been absent four
months from the capital they hare not yet had
opportunity to prepare in detail a statement of
the financial condition of the country extra
ordinary expenses caused by extraordinary
circumstances will be submitted to your ex

your entire approbation and the government

the want of fidelity in haytiens who have con
spired agaiust the public good in other ways
than by force af arras in all these circum
stances have brought about the financial and
commercial crisis which agitates the country
the sufferings of the people from the high
price of all articles of consumption fixes and
absorbs all the attention of government and
it hopes gentlemen that you will join in the
same sentiment so as to endeavor by wise
and wellcombined measures to relieve the
people from the burdens which press so
heavily upon them
economy in all branches of public service is
a duty binding upon government it has no
hope of filling up at once the deficiency but
it will consider much to have been done for the
country when it shall have succeeded in stop
ping the emission of paper money and in es
tablishing a just equilibrium between its re
ceipts and its expense
agriculture is still suffering in consequence
of troubles which have afflicted the country
meanwhile in those places which have not
been the theatre of insurrection labor has pro
gressed in a satisfactory mannei the state
f our finances must improve under the favor
able auspices of peace and government will
hasten as soon as circumstances will permit
to establish a different agricultural district
mills and machines in order to facilitate in
those regions the improvement of their pro
duce
in time manufacturing industry wil become
nationalized among us government has for
this a strong desire the establishment of
workshops for the manufacture of powder of
soap of paper etc shall be encouraged we
shall draw from it the double advantage of
employing a greater number of hands and of
freeing ourselves from a portion of the taxes
which we are obliged to pay to the foreigner
the army is faithful to its trust having no
other object of devotion than its country it has
ever remained deaf to the appeals of crime
and has ever been found at its post where it
was needed in order to insure the supremacy
of order in regard to it government has
only eulogies to utter
public instruction is making progress the
people comprehend the advantage and neces
ity of its extension meanwhile the system of
teaching must be modified and there are con
ditions to be establiseed in order that the
young haytiens may equally participate in
the benefits of gratuitous education which the
state grants to them very particular atten
tion will be paid to the choice of those who
shall compose the body of teachers for it is
necessary to be guarded against confiding to
men without fidelity to government and with
out devotion for country the delicate task of
directing youth enlightening the mind of the
young and implanting within them the noble
sentiments of rights and of duty
experience of tbe past proves that private
interest often becomes paramount to general
interests in this case the intervention of gov
ernment in certain transactions becomes a ne
cessity government will claim of you this
right of intervention in order to use it as a
protection against that class who defend all
extravagant exigences
laws uniting all the conditions which re
late to taxes will be presented to you gov
ernment will propose to you the abrogation of
laws of arrangements of laws whose execu
tion is recognized either as disastrous to our
finances subversive of that spirit and concord
which should sxist between agriculturists
the legislature will also be occupied with
considering the protection of property the en
cooragment of labor and in improving tbe
morals of the people by laws for the repres
sion of theft and vagrancy
manifestations in this capita and from a
majority of the people indicate that our con
stitutional compact is not the exact expres

faithful to its promise of the th of april
government will be occupied during its ses
sion with the modification of those articles of
which a revision may be considered neces
sary
it is not consistent with the dignity of gov
ernment to speak toyon gentlemen of the
conduct of those unnatural haytiens who have
abandoned the country after having bathed it
with the blood of their brethren in their
chagrin at the actual order of things they are
striving vainly however to mislead foreign
nations in the formation of their opinions as to
the political events which have just taken place
here
government has the satisfaction of anmtotro
ping to you gentlemen that its external rela

joices to beliere that nothing will happen to
mar this state of things i has applauded with
so much the more earnestness the revolu

place of a monarchy in france inasmuch as
this revolution has proclaimed tbe emancipa

st thomas church philadelphia
a defence of the position of this church on
the subject of american slavery was at
tempted in a long letter signed w d pub
lished in the north star on the th of no
vember it will be remembered that the
same writer undertook a defence of the two
other churches in philadelphia a few weeks
since but for some reason not given by him
but easily inferred he s has abandoned his de
fence of those churches and has bent his
efforts and energies to a desperate defence of
his ownst thomas may we not hope
that the same good sense which led this gal
lant defender to abandon the defence of
stephen gloucesters church may lead him
to give up the defence of st thomas church
also he can certainly have no stronger rea
son fur abandoning the one than the other
unless it may turn out that our hero is defend
ing his own castle
we have little to say in reply to this letter
and that little would have been said simulta
rarnsly with its publication had we been at
home at the time our numerous readers in
philadelphia will excuse the unavoidable de
lay and what might appear to them a reluc
tance on our part to grapple with the argu
ments presented by w d the subject
under consideration is one requiring more
honesty than logic to enable us to arrive at an
intelligent conclusion with respect to it the
real question at issue between w d and the
north star is not whether a meetinghouse
sanctuary ought to be reverenced it is
not whether ordination is right nor is it
whether christ was in favor of or opposed to
a religion of forms and ceremonies upon
these questions severally it may yet be proper
to expend some discussion at present how
ever we think it best to confine the contro
versy to the real question at issue the
question is this is st thomas church
philadelphia by its practice and position hos
tile to the antislavery movement we affirm
that it is w d denies the charge and de
mands the evidence upon which we base the
charge he says he must have something
more than mere assertion and treats all that
we have said before as mere assertion unsup i
ported by evidence in the following sin
gular demand he gives us what in his judg
ment constitutes evidence which will satisfy
him of the truth of our charge
has it been shown that the episcopal
church either inher general or diocesan
conventions has ever declared herself hos
ile to antislavery this must be done first
and after that is done the particular link must
be pointed out which holds st thomas
church in the same hostile position all this
must be shownbefore anything hke a strong
case can be made out
with all kindness to w d we most say i
that this demand is most extraordinary and is
as much opposed to all the just modes of rea
soning as it obviously is to every dictate of
common sense can it be possible that a
man of w ds intelligence has never sus
pected that a body of men may be opposed to
a righteous movement without in so many
words declaring its opposition are we in
charity bound to suppose him ignorant that i
some of the most refined villains i
trod the earth have been persons who have j
never declared those vil lames or themselves
villains shall we try to thik that w d
has lived these forty or fifty years among a
people so honest and upright that they were
never guilty of any crime that they did not
declare themselves in favor of and that be
himself has come up so pure and guileless
that he imagines it impossible to make out
a strong case against any set of criminals
unless they shaft declare by resolution that
they arp such
but mere and still more to the point may
not aimer itself be a crime dm he not
know that some of the moat brutal outrages
and monstrous crimes ever committed by na
tions and individuals against the authority of
god sod the happiness of mas bare been
committed not only without a declaration in
their fe or but against the moat pinna declare
tiooa of the actors take for inetaoce ou
own boasted republic solemnly declaring
that it holds these truths te be arlf iridant
that all mao ere created equal end endowed
by their cvim vtk cotibhi
rights and that emoeg then am fife liberty
end the permit of boppomu and at he
mme time holding in most cruel bondage
three milhoos of mu brethren wow
it ant be as proper to ash as fno if the ro
alaaary character rf this neiiofe to
the protestant ffimiipej caussrues
we taoj bare already demonstrated the ab
aatdky and tfirimwoty of w da position u
the aatiafectioa of meet of oar readers but as
this position is the keystone of his argument
and defence we may be allowed to press oar
inquiries on thjt point a little further he
affirms that theprotestant episcopal church
baa never either in her diocesan or general
contentions declared berself against anti
alavery indeed most innocent man
he complains that we do not eten allow that
church the advantage of a neutral neither hot
nor cold posit ion she has stood an nnirter
ested spectator of the whole stidggle between
slavery and freedom this is tacitly admitted
and in our judgment could thui be proved in her
favor which we deny she would yet remain
a corrupt traitor to the cause of god and man
and be deserving of the burning reprobation of
all who wish well to the cause of righteous
liberty for a body of men to stand by and
aeo n fellowmen perish by flood or flame and
refuse to lend any assistance towards rescuing
him from the jaws of death and then piously
fold their arms and say they never took
sides one way or the other v ould be as richly
to deserve the baiter as any feloqp that ever
swung between earth and sky
the protestant episcpal church has we
admit remained less moved by the antislavery
agitation than any other large communion in
this country she has in her associative
form maintained almost perfect silence with
respect to the whole subject of slavery her
character therefore is to be determined by
what she has not done rather than by what
she has the great head of the church and
author of christianity has been pleased to
give us two rules with which to test the char
acter of men the one is a positive and the
other a negative rule and either of those
is sufficient in the case before us the first
is by their fruits ye shall krune them and
the other is inasmuch as ye did it not unto
the least of these my brethren ye did it not
unto me in the light of these rules we fix
the brand of hostility to the antislavery move
ment upon the character of the protestant
episcopal church and also upon her children
st thomas church included the protest
ant episcopal church has never treated sla
very as a sin it has never refused to fellow
ship slaveholders as christians it has never
expressed the first word of sympathy with
the antislavery movement or even thanked
god foi its existence or expressed a hope
that the movement would succeed though
from all the likelihoods of the case that
church is aware that three milhops ofpeople
in this land are robbed of themselves and all
that pertains to man as a responsible being
compelled to live in ignorance of the great
end for which they were created and not even
allowed to learn to read the scripturesdenied
the family relationvirtually forced into con
cubinage yet this church with all its pre
tend regard for the benign religion of the
new testament and its love of purity has
never uttered one word against their brutal
enslavers it is of such a church that st
thomas claims to be a branchit is liom
such a church that the minister of st thomas
church holds his authority to preach the gos
pel of christ it was from such a church
that he received bis ordination and it is in
such a church that he is by proxy represent
ed but more and still worse it is a noto
rious fact that slaveholders and slavetraders
are welcomed not only to the communion of
this church but slaveholders and slavetraders
are ordained as ministers of jesus christ it
is now almost equally notorious that bishop
meade of virginia is not only a slaveholder
but defends that infernal system from the
bible
now to say that such a church is not hos
tile to the antislavery cause is equal to say
ing that slaveholders are not hostile to eman
cipation if it be true that no man can serve i
two masters that there is no concord between
christ and belial and that liberty has no
fellowship with slavery then is the american
protestant episcopal church in favor of sla
very and hostile to the antislavery move
ment since slaveholders and slavetraders are
in every department of that church from
bishopric to laity and since that church has
never uttered a single word in condemnation
of slavery all this would be proof enough
against that church to any unbiassed mind
bot this is not all mach more can be pre
sented which ought to put to shame if not to
silence any man who ventures a defence of
that cage of unclean birds we should as
soon consider a den of wolves as a standing
type and representative of jesus christ as
such a church from the crown of its head
to the feet there is no soundness in itbut it is
full of wounds and putrifying sores
w d wants something more than negative
proof let him read then the following tes
timony wfa member of the protestant epis
copal church and then let him ask himself if
he ought not to be ashamed to be in christian
fellowship with a body of men who are such
respecters of persons and are so filled with
the common american hate towards persons
of our complexion that they will not
tolerate the minister of st thomass church
to represent that church an the floor of their
diocesan conventioo of all proslavery

and worms revel on the mouldering remains
of manliness and beauty where pride andj
pomp and power have doffed their trappings
and lave said to corruption thou art my
father and to the worm thou art my mother
and my sister where the voice of passion is
forever stilled and the heart that has ceased
to beat is cold as the marble beneath which
it reposeseven here among the tombs
prejudice has his dwelling like the demoniac
of old and caste under the sanction of the
church rears his hideous and revolting form
how many similar instanoes there may be we
know not that we cite has come undei our
immediate notice the vestry and wardens
of au episcopal church in the diocese of new
york a few years since accepted a deed for
a cemetery which was demised to them upon
the express condition unbodied in the inden
ture that they should never suffer any colored
person to be buried in any part of the same
and all the subsequent conveyances on the part
of tlie chotch of vaults and burialplaces
are subject to the same condition
what will w d do with this statement of
facts will it be evidence to his mind ot the
proslavery or antislavery bharacter of the
protestant episcopal church or will he say
that it is no evidence at allpronounce it
mere assertionor will he say if evidence
at all it is defective evidence insufficient to
convict that church of hostility to the anti
slavery movement or will he come forward
and honestly own as he ought to do that his
mother church is a corrupt old ptoslavery
hag and not to be regarded as the church ol
the living god wbb is the god of the op
pressed and not a respecter of persons if he
does not say so it will be owing to no want of
testimony against that church but a failurei
on his part to appreciate that evidence
in reply to what w d says about ordina
tion it is enough to say that he misrepresents
the point at issue we have never uttered a
word in ridicule of ordination what we
said bn this point merely had respect to mak
ing ordination the absolute condition upon
which persons are allowed to speak in episco
pal churches and this he must have known
if he read with care our remaks on this
point we say now as we said before that i
this rule strictly carried out would admit the
devil into the pulpit of st thdkias church
could he appear in holy orders while christ
unordained would be rejected this we say
is the practical working of a rigid adherence
to this rule
x you have experienced it in that while
you would not admit frederick douglass
martin r delany or charles lenox remond
into st thomas church to speak for the
slave the reverend mr allen a notorious
slaveholder has been repeatedly an occupant
of the pulpit of that church the case is
made out against that church and we leave
you to your conscience and to your god in
the light of whose teachings we humbly
hope you may be guided onto all truthr d j

l tme patriotism
patriotism consists not in a mere professed
lore of country place of ones birthan
endearment to the scenery however delightful
and interesting of such country nor simply
j the laws and political policy by which such
country is governed but a pure and unso
phisticated interest felt and manifested for
manan impartial love and desire for the pro
motion and elevation of every member of the
i body politic their eligibility to all the rights
and privileges of society this and other
than this fails to establish the claims of true
patriotism
from periods the most remote the most
improper application has been made of the
endearing term patriot whether the most
absolute monarch crowned with the heredi
tary diadem armed with an unlimited sceptre
the most intolerable despot bearing the title
of sovereignthe most cruel and heartless
oppressor and slaveholder under the boasted
title of presidentthe most relentless butche
and murderer called oommanderinchtef
the most haughty and scornful aristocrat who
tramples upon the peoples rights in the halls
of legislationthe most reckless and unprin
cipled statesman ri oting upon the spails of a
plundered revenue whether phillips cur
ran or grattan in defence of irish constitu
tional libertyemmet upon the scaffold re
fusing to let his epitaph be written until ire
land was freewilliam tell under sentence
of death balling the schemes of the german
tyrant gedlerthe french baron lafayette

tune to share in common the fate of the
struggling american washington as the
leader of his countrys destinyoconnell as
the liberatorthomas jefferson patrick
henry or john quincy adams standing in
the frontal ranks as defenders of american
rights or mitchell and obrien who sacri
ficed their ail being forever divorced and ex
iled from the most tender ties of domestic
affections by the severity of the laws of their
country for daring to discard provisions
deemed pernicious to the welfare of their
countrymen all have laid equal claim to a
share of popular gratitude and been endowed
with the loved title of patriot
a patriot may exist whether blessed with
the privileges of a country favored with a
free constituency or flying before his pursu
ers roam an exile the declared outlaw of the
power that besets him love to man and un
compromising hostility to that which inter
feers with his divine godgiven rights are
the only traits which distinguish the true pa
iriot to be patriotic is to be philanthropic
 to be which is necessary to love nil men
regarding their humanity with equal im
portance
much has beenthe interest felt and mani
fested in this country in every movement
with exceptions to be named whether borne
or abroad in favor of human liberty and
thqpe who were foremost in the struggle be
queathed their names to present and future
time to become the subject of the poet and
the theme of the historian spain italy
greece poland germany france england
scotland and ireland of modern date all
have bad their patriots each of whom in suc
cession has shared largely of americas
eulogium and of all who have scanned the
ordeal before them there were none perhaps
for whom there has been expressed more sym
pathy than the late victims of british dis
pleasure the irish patriots sad convicts
mitchell aad obrien especially tho latter
the severity of whose sentence aroused every
feeling and expression of opposition to the
execution of the sentence
to witness the public demonstrations as
manifested in favor of the irish struggle in
which mayors of cities judges of courts
sons of exprestdeots and exgovernors par
ticipated and the universal interest felt in the
result ta well loaded to deeeive and betray
into the idea those not otherwise advised that i
this aation is a nation of justice but how i

to none are they more common than america
and in no country they meet with fa
acceptance than in this republic ever pro
fessing the roost liberal principles proclaiming
liberty and eqaality to all mankind their
policy give a glaring contradiction
to their pretensions and the lie to their pro
fessions
prone as they are to tyrannise and despot

by the finger of scorn he at once becomes
the mock of the scoffcr and hiss of the re

downtrodden oppressed american might

ent miserable unhappy condition
among them have existed and there do
exist those who are justly entitled to all the
claims of true patriotism but proscriptionas
infamous aa it is wicked has stamped the seal
of degradation upon their brow and instead
of patriots they become the felon and outlaw
anticipated and preconcerted by an inquisition
of prejudice and slaveholding influence the
colored man of this confederacy especially
the bondman is doomed to ignominy what

though in a professedly republican and free

though they speak act petition remon

thirteenth annual meeting of the rhode

convened in mechanics hall providence
november th  at  oclock a m
the president in the chair meeting opened
with prayer by mrs sophia l little of
newport
remarks were made by mrs little touch
ing the encouraging aspect of the causeby
rev martin cheney founded upon the report
of a speech made by rev h w beecher
at a recent meeting held in broadway taber
nacle new york on behalf of certain fe
males members of the methodist episcopal
church who were claimed as slaves
two oclock p m meeting addressed by
rev j s mewry mr m urged the im
portance of a decided testimony on the part of
clergymen and others on the subject of sla
very and other reforms mr m was follower
by mr j b sanderson of new bedford
who very forcibly and eloquently illustrated
the proposition that colored men have a
peculiar interest in the antislavery move
ment that he is a walking living speak
ing monument of the influence of slavery
e also urged ist upon ihe colored people to
be vigilant active diligent in making them
selves in deed and in truth proficient in all
things pertaining to civil and social life d
consistent political action d to separate
themselves from the proslavery spirit of the
communityand identify themselves thorough
ly with the friends of the slave and the slave
himself
rev martin cheneyhad found it difficult
to identify himself with ilie colored man
supposed that it was difficult for others lie
thought the persons who came nearest to it
were win l garrison and gerrit smith it
looked as though some of the colored people
found this rather hard nowhere can this
lie done except in this poor despised hooted
antislavery movement it is not that
the colored people do not come with us it is
a despised place must all rise above circum
stances not be enslaved by them where is
the hope of the slave ist has he any hope
from the attitude of government not so
much as from the north star no hope from
the constitution its influence has been to
fasten the slave in his chains d is there
any hope from a change of government
the free soil party may produce some fa
vorable changesjut doubtful  is there
any hope from the church it is difficult to
produce any change or reform here whence
then have you hope for the slave from the
aritislavery influence that is abroad as seen
in the disturbed state of church and stateas
seen in the late buffalo convention gods
eye is upon the slave hence there is hope
the slave will be redeemed for the truth will
raise him up in closing mr c paid a 
beautiful and eloquent tribute to the editor of
the north star
mr reddendid not feel like censuring
the colored people as fiercely as some of the
a  friends we exjiect too much of them
expect them to spring at once from their
degradation uuo full growu men their
progress for the last two years has been won
derful lo elevate them we must respect
them and acknowledge their equality
jb sandersonwe do not ask the whites
for pity give us our rtghit we ask noth
ing more take aay the obstacles you
have thrown in our way then if we do not
rise let u sink to oui proper place mr 
strongly urged the colored people to identify
themselves with the abolitionists
seven oclock p mremarks by mr
ingalls slavery results from an inequitable
division of the rights of labor the aversion
of the northern laboring classes to etnanetps j
tioo suae from tins notion that laborer willi
be unduly increased no country has abol
ished slavery from tine m a
tendency in all eouaiwas as ehrraae and in
crane capital eoabttag it to eras the laborer
this will always be the ease until slsvsry is
abolished from principle land monopoly is
a greater evil than staverj than ia a prin
ciple st work that will destroy slaverypopu
lation wili increase in such a ratio that hind
labor w ill be cheaper than bought i would
enlarge the a  platform these were
the principal point is mr ia speech
f douglass ia reply to mr ingalls said
this a time when firm derided and
scathing testimony shook be given on the
subject of slavery the love of power is tbe
fundamental element of slavery not love of
wealth these most be kept distinct let
each stand on its own bean to annihilate
the distinction between free labor and slave
labor is to annihilate tbe distinction between
persons and things

f ifouglaas attributed the defection of

the free soil movement and the buffalo con
vention as a pledge of northern freemen
against southern slaveholders yet not a
movement in which he as an abolitionist
could enlist they aim ta localize slavery
that would be a good thing we wanted a
victory over the slave power tbe south
has always beaten us the people are dis
couraged and think that they cannot succeed
we w ant to gain one victory this victory
cannot be obtained by tbe free soil move
ment the free soil party are a much for
availability as the zack taylor party
us rally for a true free soil party ltiis must
lie done by the promulgation of antislavery
principles we must go on and lead the

f douglassthe convention of  le
gislated for slavery the resolutions are
based upon the entire action of the federal
government from its commencement to the
present limeupon the admissions of all the
political parties not excepting the free soil
party this doctrine has been admitted by
all statesmen and jurists and until within a
few years has never been doubted it is the
duty of all to say that they will not be parties
to these compromises it is said that the term
slavery is not there art ist sec d
threefifths of all other persons must re
fer to slaves art  sec d it is admitted
that a person is a slave and a slave is a per
son in this clause the term person must
mean slave apprentices are everywhere
held to service and labor wherever found
slaves owe service under the laws of the
state where they are held chattels are held
to service slaves are held to service in the
same sense
geo bradburnl national justice only
lawnothing else can be  the applica
tion of certain legal rule pf interpretation
i would make the constitution an antislavery
instrument viz  seek its meaning from
its own words  when susceptible of two
meanings that must be given which will fa
vor honesty  deny that slavery ever was
legalizedcould not be legalized under the
charter for they contained clauses prohibiting
slavery it is a mistake to suppose that
massachusetts abolished slavery by the adop
tion of the constitution it was abolished by
the judiciary the constitution finished the
work perhaps  there is nothing in tlie
j state constitution establishing or legalizing
j slavery  the instrument itself art 
sec  not a word in it about slavery
must go out of it this conflicts with the
j rule held to service sic this is a
i legal holdingapprentices are thus held
no statute requiring service of a slave ser
vice is not a characteristic of slavery
under the laws thereof everything
called a statute not a law must be according
to the constitution in the other terms sla
very is not clearly meant benj franklin
j did not so understand it nor patrick heory
 art  sec it this were read by one who
j is a stranger to the situation of the country
would he suppose that onesixth of the peo
ple were held as slaves no frederick
douglass himself will not admit it other
per sous may refer to many other classes than
slavesforeigners ac the word free is
not a correlative of slave h denotes per
sons endowed with certain political privileges
as was the custom m rhode island a few
years since we are not to give it this coo
struction if an honest one can be found in all
gods creatioo art  sec  importa
tion applied only to slaves authority
agaiust this interpretation see dan webster
refers to importation of foreigners spooner
choate and other lawyers might be quoted to
the same effect if it refers to slaves it
makes the couotry form a conspiracy against
the rights of foreign freemen there art

with the exception of the disturbance
above alluded to made by those friends of or
der and liberty the zach taylorites the
meetings passed off quietly were well at
tended rim evening sessions being extremely
crowded and it is believed exerted a most
beneficial influence upon public sentiment
of the following resolutions nos  and 
were laid on the table the rest were
adopted
 resolved that the constitution of the
united states by allowing the slaveholders to
be represented in congress and in the elec
toral colleges for their human chattels by its
provision for the return of the fugitive slave
to his master and by pledging the free states
to aid in putting down slave insurrections in
volves all who swear to support it or who
vote to place in any office a man who must
before entering upon the discharge of its du
ties take an oath to sustain it in the guilt of
supporting an infamous proslavery compact
 resolved that the friends of god and
liberty if they would absolve themselves
from bloodguiltiness in this matter must
withdraw their support from the union of the
states as at present constituted and establish
a government tree from the contamination of
slavery and which shall maintain the equal
rightsof all who dwell under its jurisdiction
 resolved that the principle of chattel
jbinary nrkwk lro cvutb dcmiujb dts
tinction between a man and a beast crushes
the aspirations of the soul the strongest evi
dence of mans divine paternity is tbe same
with the spirit of prejudice against the free
people of color at the north which makes
their condition but little better than that of the
slavedenying to them the elective fran
chise refusing to treat them as brethren in
the house of worship closing against them
the seminaries of learning and thus shutting
out from their minds the light of knowledge
ia obstructing the development of their will
and ingenuity degrading and treating them
with all manner of contumely practices which
implicate the people of the north in the re
sponsibility of giving the most efficient sup
port to slavery
 resolved that this society again re
news its oft oftrepeated and solemn testimony
against the slaveholding position at present
occupied by the american church and clergy
and again renews its oftrepeated pledge nev
i er to relinquish that oftrepeated testimony
while the religions bodies referred to continue
to fellowship slaveholders as christians to
i fraternize with them for the spread of tbe
 gospel to unite with them in efforts
to send the bible to tbe heathen abroad
while they deny that book to three millions of
heathen at home and by maintaining a
studied silence respecting tbe awful sin and
crime of slavery do thus award that horrible
system the most profound religious sanction
and support and tbat we call upon all who
would free themselves from responsibility for
slavery to abandon at once those slaveholding
churches and atone for their past wrong to
the slavery devoting themselves unreservedly
to promoting in every christian way the im

 resolved that we rejoice in the rapid
spread of antislavery principles as evinced
in the recent formation of tbe free soil party
and while we cannot regard its platform as
sufficiently broad for aboiiudhists to stand
upon we nevertheless hail it as tbe harbinger
of the downfall of the alavepower and the
i slave system in our land

in accordance with the recommendation of
the resolution adopted at this meeting the
state central committee have issued the fol
lowing call
convention of colored citizen
a mass convention of the colored citi
zens of ohio will be held in columbus
commencing january th  the object j
of this convention is out elevation moral
intellectual and political encountering us
in the first step of our march stand ohios
black laws they must be repealed it
is true stripped as we are of all political
power we have only a moral power over
them bnt it is only necessary to wield this
power aright and it is mighty to the pulling
down of the btrongholds of oppression and j
wrong therefore let us not be slothful but
diligent doing all we have the ability to do
so that if we must be made longer to bleed
beneath the cruel inflictions of ignorance
prejudice and heathenish proscription we
may at least amidst our sufferings have this
consolation that we have exerted our
selves to the uttermost to escape the bloody
scourge
to the county committee you gen
tlemen are expected to cooperate with the
central committee in bringing together to
form this convention a body of independent
fearless and talented menmen in whose
hearts burns unquenchably the love of liberty
and who will permit no surmountable obstacle
to work any intermission in their efforts to
come at once into the most complete enjoy
ment of that liberty wbichdhey love there
are such men and reasonable exertion will
suffice to assemble them together hitherto
our conventions have been made up of men
who had received the suffrage and been sent
up by the authority of their constituents
under that arrangement there is reason to
suspect that in very many instances those
most roughly acquainted with our griev
ances and the best qualified to remedy them
have from their faithfulness in reproving what
ever evil they have seen prevailing in their
respective communities incurred the dis
pleasure of their fellowcitizens and been re
pudiated by them as busybodies meddlers in
other mens matters while those who have
stood by cordially assenting to the shouts of
the multitudes knowing nothing about the
interest of the people and caring less are sent
up to do business for our oppressed people
in order that this as well as other evils re
sulting from the old order of things may be
averted we have proclaimed a mass conven
tion thus affording every man who feels the i
weight of the yoke and is tired of wearing it 
and has sufficient intelligence to contribute
aught to remove it a fair opportunity to do so

a lad vu toiling up s hill near tb
city under the weight of a heavy baa
ket on the afternoon of a sultry day in
august he had been sent home will
ome goods to a customer who lived a
short distance la the country the boy
was lightlr built and bis burden seemed
almost beyond his strength many
times had he sat down to rest himsell
on his way up the hill bat it seemed
as if he would never reach the summit
bach time he lifted the basket it feh
heavier than before
the boy was about halfway up the
hill with his basket when a gentleman
overtook and passed him he had noi
gone on many paces when he stoppec
and turning to the lad looked at him i
moment or two and then said kindly
thats a heavv load you have come
let me help you
and the gentleman took the baske
 and carried it to the top of the hill
there do you think you can ge
along now said he with a smile ai
he sat the basket down or shall j car
ry ita litte further r
oh no thank you sir returned th
boy with a glow of gratitude on hii
fine young face i can carry it now
very well and am very much obligee
to you
you are right welcome my little
man said the gentleman and passec
on
twenty years from that time a care
worn man well advanced in life sal
motionless in an old arm chair wit
his eyes fixed intently upon the glow
ing grate he was alone and ap
peared to be in a state of deep abstrac
tion in a little while however the
door of the room opened and the light
form of a young and lovely girl glided
in
papa said a low sweet voice and
a hand was gently laid on the old mans
arm
ls it you dear he returned with a
sigh
yes papa and the young girl leaned
against him and parted with her deli
cate fingers the thin grey locks that
lay in disorder about his forehead
i would like to be alone this evening
florencesaid the old man i have
a good deal to think about and expect
a man on business
and he kissed her tenderly yet
sighed as he pressed his lips to hers
the girl passed as noiselessly from
the room as she entered the old man
had been calm before her coming in
but the moment she retired he became
agitated and arose aud walked the
floor uneasily he continued to pace
to and fro for nearly half an hour when
he stopped suddenly and listened the
btreetdoor bell had rung in a little
while a man entered the room
mr mason he said with a slight
perceptible embarassment
mr page returned the old man
with a feeble quickly fading smile
good morning and he offered his
hand
the visitor grasped the old mans
hand and shook it warmly but there
was no pressure in return
sit down mr page
the man took a chair and mr ma
son sat down near him
you promised an answer to my pro
posal tonight said the former after a
pause
i did returned the old man but 
am as little prepared to give it as 
was yesterday in fact i have not had
an opportunity to say anything to flor
ence on the subject
the countenance of the visitor fell
and something like a frown darkened
upon his brow
there was an embarassing silence ol
some minutes after which the mac
called page said
mr mason i have made an honor
able proposal for your daughters hand
for weeks you have evaded and dc
still evade an answer this seems sc
much like trifling that i begin to feel
as if just cause of offence existed
none is intended i do assure you
replied mr mason with something de
precating in his tone but you musl
remember mr page that you have
never sought to win the young girls
affection and that as a consequence
the offer of marriage which you wish tc
make to her will be received with sur
prise and it may be disapproval i wish
to approach her on the subject with
proper discretion  to be too percipi
tate may startle her into instant repug
nance against your wishes
she loves you does she not inquired
page with a marked significance ol
manner
a child never loved a parent more
tenderly replied mr mason
give her then an undisguised his
tory of all your embarrassment show
how your fortunes are trembling on the
brink of ruin and that you have but
one hope of relief and safety left the
day she becomes my wife you are re
lieved from dangerwill you do this
the old man did not reply he was
lost iri a deep reverie it is doubtful
whether he had heard all that the man
had said
will you do this replied page and
with some impatience in his tone
mason aroused himself as from a
dream and answered wjth great firm
ness and dignity
mr page the struggle in my mind
is over i am prepared for the worst
i have no idea that florence will favor
your suitand i will not use a stugle ar
gument to influence her in that matter
sh must remain perfectly free ap
proach her as a man and win her if you
have the power to do so it is your
only hope
as if stung by a serpent page started
from his chair
you will repent this sir he angrily
retorted and repent it bitterly i came
to you with honorable proposals for
your daughters hand you listened to
them gave me encouragement and
promised me an answer tonight now
you meet me with insult sir you will
repent this
mr mason vsnturad no reply bat
merely bowed in token of his willing
ness to meet and bear all consequences
jut might come
for a long time after this angry viat
or had retired did mr mason crew
ind recross the floor with measured
at last be rung the beu am
the servant who cane to my
to florence be wished to see ber
when florence eano she was sur
prinl to see ber fhthsr so strongly agr
tsfed
sit down dear be said in a trem
mng voice i hive something to tel
you that most be no longer concealed
florence looked wonderingly into bei
fathers face while her heart began u
sink
just then a servant opened the dooi
and ushered in a stranger he was i
tall fine looking young man iuut in the
prime of life florence quickly retiree
but net before the stranger fixed hii
i eyes on her face and mailed its sweet
expression
i pardon the intrusion sir be said
as soon as the young girl bad left the
room but facts that i have learned
this evening have prompted me to call
on you without a moments delay my
name is greer of the firm of greer
miller co
mr mason bowed and said
i i know your bouse very well and
now remember to have met you more
than once in business transactions
yes you have bought one or two
bills of goods of us replied the visitor
then after a moments pause he said
in a changed tone
j mr mason i learned tonight from
a source which leaves me no room to
doubt the truth of the statement that
your affairs have become seriously em
barrassed that you are in faot on the
very verge of bankruptcy tell me
frankly whether this is indeed so i
ask from no idle curiosity nor from a
concealed and sinister motive but to
the end that i may prevent the threat
ened disaster if it is in my power to
do so
mr mason was dumb with surprise
at so unexpected a declaration he
made two or three efforts to speak but
his lips uttered no sound
confide in me said the visitor
trust me as you would your own bro
ther and lean on me if your strength
be indeed failing tell me then is it
as i have raid
lt is was all that the merchant
could utter
how much will save you mention
the sum and if within the compass of
my ability to raise you shall have it to
morrow will twenty thousand dollars
felieve you from your present embar
rassment
fully
then let your anxiety subside mr
mason that sum you shall have
tomorrow morning i will see you
good evening and the visitor arose
and was gone before his bewildered
auditor had sufficiently recovered his
senses to know what to think or say
in the morning true to his promise
mr greer called upon mr mason
and tendered him a check of ten thous
and dollars with a note of hand for
thirty days for ten thousand more
which was almost the same as money
while the check and note lay on the
desk and ere he had touched them mr
mason looked earnestly at the man
who had suddenly taken the character
of a disinterested selfsacrificed friend
and said
my dear sir l cannot understand
this are you not laboring under some
error
oh no you once did me a ser
vice that i am now only seeking to
repay it is my first opportunity and
i embrace it eagerly
did you a service when
twenty years ago replied the man
i was a poor boy and you was a man
of wealth one hot day  was sent a
long distance with a heavy basket
while toiling up a hill with the hot sun
upon me and almost overcome with
heat and fatigue you came along and
not only spoke to me kindly but took
my basket and carried it to the top of
the hill ah sir you did not know
how deeply that act of kindness sunk
into my heart and i longed for the op
portunity to show you by some act of
kindness how grateful i felt but none
came often afterwards i met you in
the street and looked into your face
with pleasure but you did not re
member me ever since i have regard
ed you with different feelings from those
i entertained for others and there has
been no time that i would not have put
myself out to serve you last night i
heard of your embarrassment and im
mediately called upon you the rest
you know
mr mason was astonished at so
strange a declaration
do you remember the fact so which
i refer asked mr greer
it had faded from my external meu
ory entirely but your words have
brought a dim recollection of the fact
but it was a little matter and not entit
led to the importance you have given
it
to me it was not a little matter
returned mr greer i was a weak
boy just sinking under a burthen that
too heavv when you put forth
your hand and carried it for me i
could not forget it and nw let cue
return at the first opportunity the
favor by carrying your burden for you
which has become too heavy until the
hill is ascended and you are able to
bear it onward again in your own
strength
mr mason was deeply moved
words failed him in his efforts to ex
press his true feelings the bread
caat upon the water had returned to him
after many days and he gathered it
with wonder and thankfulness
the merchant was saved from ruin
nor was this all the glimpse which
mr greer had received of the lovely
daughter of mr mason revealed a
character of beauty that impressed him
deeply and he embraced the first op
portunity to make ber acquaintance
a year afterwards he led her to the
altar

have been expected that three revolts
in pafis fighting in the streets three
hundred thousand men engaged and
dreadful slaughter should have taken
place without creating wildness and in
sanity among many classes to a great
extent as soon as the revolution broke
out in february the hospitals began
to fill dr borsmont states that
the first patients were generally sad
melancholy and desppndent their
fancies were of a heartrending descip
tion as they expressed a constant fear
of being slaughtered aud assassinated
the patients of this class mostly be
longed to the respectable trading part
of the community and many of them
had by industry and perseverance suc
ceeded in amassing some property in
order to escape the misfortunes they
dreaded some of these patients tried
to destroy themselves and the most
careful watching was necessary to pre
vent them from doing so two starved
themselves to death in spite of every
precaution a short time afterwards
another description of patients were
received whose derangement might be
fully attributed to the working of the
new political ideas these were not
dejected and sad on the contrary they
had proud gay and enthusiastic
and were very loquacious
constantly writing memorials coastiyu

great men the deliverers of the coun
