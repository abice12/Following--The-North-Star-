fellowcitizen of the senate and uoiieeof
repreeentalivee
under the benignant providence of an almighty
ciod representative of the states and of the peo
ple are again brought together to deliberate for
the public the gratitude of the nation to the
sovereign arbiter of all human event should be
commensurate with the boundless blessings which
we enjoy peace plenty and contentment reign
throughout our borders and our beloved country
and presents a sublime ami novel spectacle to the
world
the troubled and unsettled condition of some of
ihe european powers has had a necessary ten
dency to check and embarrass trade and depreciate
prices throughout our commercial relations but
notwithstanding these causes the united states
with their abundant products have felt their effects
less severely than any other country and all our
great interests are still prosperous and successful
in reviewing the great events of the present year
and contrasting the agitated and disturbed state
of other countries with our own tranquil and happy
condition we may congratulate ourselves that we
are the most favored people on the face of the
earth while other countries are struggling to
establish free institutions under which man may
govern himself we are in the actual enjoyment ot
thema rich inheritance from our fathers while
the nations of europe are convulsed and distracted
by civil war and internal strilewe settle our politi
cal controversies by the peaceful exercise of the
rights of freemen j at the ballot box the great
republican maxim so deeply engraved on the hearts
of our people that the will of the majority consti
tutionally expressed shall prevail is our sure safe
guard against force and violence
it is a subject of just pride that our fame and
character as a nation continues rapidly to advance
in the estimation of the civilized world to our
wise and free institutions it is to be attritaled that
while other nations have achieved glory at the price
of suffering distress and impoverishment of their
people we htfve won our honorable position in the
midst of uninterrupted prosjierity and ot an in
creasing individual comfort and happiness
i am happy to inform you that our relations
with all nations are friendly and pacific advan
tageous treaties of commerce have been concluded
within the last four years with new grenada
peru the two sicilies belgium hanover ol
denburg and mecklenburg schwemng
pursuing our example a more liberal commer
cial policy has been adopted by other enlightened
nations and our trade has been greatly enlarged
and extended with all the governments on the
continent our relations it is believed are now
on a more friendly and satisfactory fooling than
at any former occaaion
to continue to occupy this proud position it is
only necessary to continue at peace and faithful
ly adhere to the gteal fundamental principles of
our foreign policy of noninterference with the do
mestic concerns of other nations we recognize
in all nations the rights we ourselves enjoy to
reform their political institutions according to their
own will and pleasure
hence we do uot look behind existing govern
ments capable of maintaining their own authority
we recognize alt such as actual governments not
only from the dictates of true polcy but from a
sacred regard for the independence of nations
while this is our settled policy it does not follow
that we can ever be indifferent spectators of the
progress of liberal principles the government
and people of the united states hailed with en
thusiasm and delight the establishment of the
french republic aa we now hail the efforts to
unite the states of germany in a coigederacy in
many respect similar to our own teaeral l nion
if the great and enlightened german fctates oc
cupying aa they do a central and commanding
position in europe shall succeed iu establishing
uch a confederated government securing si the
same tunc to the citizens of each state local gov
ernments adapted to the peculiar condition of
each wnb unrestricted trade and intercourse with
each other it will be an important era in the his
tory of human events whilst it will donsolidate
and strengthen the power of germany it must es
enuady promote the cause ol peace commerce
civilization and constitutional liberty throughout
use world
with all the governments on tins continent oui
relations it is believed are now on a more friend
ly and satisfactory footing than they have evei
been at any iormer penod
since the exchange of ratifications of the treaty
ol peace with mexico our intercourse with the
government of that republic has been of the most
friendly character the envoy extraordinary
and minister flenipoteuiury ot the u staten to
mexico has beeu received and accredited and a
diplomatic representative from mexico ol sinuiai
rank has been received and accredited by this go
vernment the amicable relations between the
two countries which had been suspended have
been happily restored and are destined i trust to
be long preserved the two republics both situ
ated ou this cootinem and with cotertaioou ter
ritories have every motive of sympathy sod of m
ureal to bind them together in perpetual amity
this gratifying condition of our foreign rclaoou
the north star
render it onettmif for me to call your atten
tion more specifically to them
it baa been my constant aim and desire to el
tfrate peace and commerce with all nation
tranquility at hnmased peaceful relations abroad
constitute the tme permanent policy of oar coun
try war the aconrfe of nation some times be
comes inrrhame bat h always to be avoided when
it can be done consistently with the rights and
honor of the nation
ne of the moat important results of the war
into which we were recently famed with a neigh
boring nation is the demonstration it has afforded
of the military strength of our country before
the late war with mexico european and other
foreign powers entertained imperfect and errone
ous views of oar pbywcal strength as a nauon and
of our ability to prosecute war and especially a
war waged out of our own eooatry they aaw
that our standing army on the peace establishment
did not exceed ten thousand men accustomed
themselves to maintain in peace large standing ar
mies for the protection of thrones against their
own subjects u well aa against foreign enemies
they had not conceived that it waa possible for
a nation without wylj an army well disciplined
and of long aeivcto wage war aocmanfally j
they held in sow rafftte oorinmtja and were ttr
from regarding them as aa effective force unless
might be for temporary defensive operations when
it invaded on our own soil
the events of the late war with mexico have
not only undeceived them but have removed er
roneous impressions which have prevailed to some
extent even among a portion of our own country
men that war has demonstrated that upon
the breaking out of hostilities not anticipated and
for which no previous preparation had been made
a volunteer army of citizen soldiers equal to veter
an troops and in numbers equal to any emergency
can in a abort period be brought into the field
unlike what would have occurred in many other 
countries we were under no necessity of resorting
to dralta or conscriptions on the contrary such
was the number of volunteers who patriotically
tendered their services that the chief difficulty
was in making selections and determining who
should be disappointed and be compelled to remain
at home
our citjgen soldiers are unlike those drawn
from the population of any other country they
are composed indiscriminately of all professions
and pursuits lawyers farmers physicians mer
chants manufacturers mechanics and laborers
this not only among the officers but also anion
the private soldiers in the ranks our citizen sol
diers are unlike those of any other country in oth
er respects they are armed and have been ac
customed from their youth up to handle and use
fire arms and a large portion of them especially
in the western and more newly settled states are
expert marksmen they are men who have a
reputation to maintain at home by their good con
duct i  the field they are intelligent and there is
an individuality of character which is found in the
tanks of no ether army in battle each private man
as well as every officerfights not only for his coun
try but for glory and distinction among his fellow
citizens when he shall return to civil life
the war with mexico has demonstrated not
only the ability of the government to organize a
numerous army upon a sudden call but also to
provide it with ail the munitions and necessary
supplies with despatchjonvenience and easeand to
direct its operations with efficiency the strength
of our institntions have been not only displayed in
the valor and skill of our troops engaged in active
service in the field but in the organization of those
executive branches which were charged with the j
direction and conduct of the war while too
much praise cannot be bestowed upon the officers j
and men who fought our battles it would be un
just to withhold from those officers necessarily sta j
tioned at home who were charged with the duty j
of furnishing the lymy iq proper times and in
proper places wiffi all the munitions of war and
other supplies as necessary to make efficient the
commendation to which they are entitled the
credit due to this class of officers is greater when
it is considered that no army in ancient or modem
timeß was ever better appoinied or provided than
our nmiy in mexico operating in an enemys
country removed two thousand miles from the
seat of the federal government its different corps
spread over a vast extent of territory hundreds and
even thousands of miles apart from eah other
nothing short of the untiring vigilance and extra
ordinary energy of these officers could have ena
bled them to provide the army at all pointsa nd
in proper season with all that was required for the
most efficient service
it is but an act of justice to declare that the of
i fleers in charge of the several executive bureaus
all under the immediate eye and supervision of the
secretary of war performed their respective du
ties with ability energy and efficiency they
have reaped less of the glory of the war not hav
ing been personally exposed to its perils in battle
than their companions in arms but without their
forecast efficient aid and cooperation those in
i the field would not have been provided with the
ample means they possessed of achieving for
i themselves and their country the unfading honors
which they have won for both
when all these facts are may cease
to be a matter o so much amazement abroad
how it happened that our noble army in mexico
regulars and volunteers were victorious upon
every battle fearful the odds against
them
the war with mexieo has thus fully developed
j the capacity of republican governments to prose
cute successfully a just and necessary foreign war
with all the vigor usually attributed to more arbi
trary forms of government it has been usual for
writers on public law to impute to republics a want oi
that unity concentration of purpose and vigor of
j execution which are generally admitted to belong
to monarchical and aristocratic forms and this
feature of popular government has been sup
i posed to display itself more particularly in the
i conduct of a war carried on in an enemys
country the war with great britain in 
was to a great exnt confined within our own
limits and shed but little ligbt on this subject but
the war which we have just closed by an honora
ble peace evinces beyond all doubt that a popular
representative government is equal to any emer
gency which is likely to arise in the affairs of a
nation
the war m mexico has developed most striking
ly and conspicuously another feature in our insti
tions it is that without cost to the government
or danger to our liberties we have in the bosom
of our society of freemen available in just and
necesaary war virtually a standing army of two
million of armed citizen soldiers such as fought
the battles of mexico
but our military strength does not consist alone
in our capacity for extended and successful opera
tions on land the navy m an important arm of
the national defence if the services of the navy
were not so brilliant as those of the army in the
j late war with mexico it was because they had no
enemy to meet on their own element while the
army had opportunity of performing more coiwpic
uous service the navy largely participated in the
i conduct of the war both branches of the service
performed their whole duty to the country foe
j the able and gallant services of the officers and
j men of the navy acting independently as well a
tu cooperation with our troops in the conquest of
t j the californians the capture of vera crux aod the
seizure and occupation of other important poemooi
r on the gulf and pacific coast the highest praise u
due
r their vigilance and skill rendered the most ef
fective service in excluding munitions of war and
r other supplies from the enemy while they secured
j a safe entrance for abundant supplies for our own
l array our extended commerce was no where
t j interrupted and for this immunity from the evil
of war the country is indebted to the navy
i i high praise is due to the officers of the several
r bureaus navy yards and s tattoos connected with
the service li under the immediate direction el
f the secretary ef the navy for the industry fore
 sight and energy with which every thing was di
i f rected and furnished to give efficiency to that
branch of the service the same vigilance existed

the great remits which hare hgeo developed

duties and our repotbilities to ouraelres and to

will be the more obvious when we consider the
east additions which have recently been made to
our territorial possession and their great import
ance and value
within lesrf than four years the annexation of
texas to the union hts been consummated all

have been acquired by treaty this area of these
several terruories according to a report carefully
prepared by the commissioner of the general land
office from the most authentic information in his
possession and which is herewith tranraittedcoq
taius one million one hundred and ninetythree
thousand and sixiyone square miles or seven hun
dred and sixtythree million and fifty mine thou

remaining twentynine states and the territory
not yet organized into states eastof the rocky
mountains contains two millions fiftynin
thousand five hundred and thirteen square
miles or thirteen hundred and eighteen millions
one hundred and twentysix thousand and fif
tyeight acres these estimates show that tern
tores recently acquired and over which exclusive
jurisdiction and dominion have been extendedcon
stitute a country more than half as large as ail
that which was held by the united states before
their acquisition if oregon be excluded from the
estimate there will still remain within the limits of
texas new mexico and californiaeignt hundred

eight square miles or fie hundred and fortyfive

ty acres being an addition equal to more than one
third of all the territory owned by the u states
before their acquisition and including oregon
nearly as great an extent of territory as the whole
of europe russia only excepted
the mississippi so lately the frontier of our
country is now only its ctntre with the addi
tion of the late acquisitions the u s are now esti
mated to be nearly as large as the whole of europe
it is estimated by the superintendent of the coast
survey in accompanying report that the extent of
sea coast of texas on the gulf of mexico is up
wards of four hundred miles of the coast of up
per california on the pacific of nine hundred
and seventy miles and of oregon including the
straits of fuca of six hundred and fifty
king the whole extent of sea coast on the pacific
one thousand six hundred and twenty miles and
the whole extent on both the pacific and gulf of
mexico two thousand twenty miles the length
of the coast on the atlantic from the northern
limits of the united states around the capes of
florida to the sabine on the eastern boundary of
texas is estimated to be three thousand one hun
dred miles so that the addition of sea coast in
cluding oregon is very nearly twothirds as great
as all we possessed before and excluding oregon
is an addition of  miles being nearly
equal to one half the extent of coaat which
we possessed before these acquisitions we
have now three great maritime frontson the
atlantic gulf of mexico wd the pacificmak
ing in the whole an extent of sea coast
exceeding five thousand miles this is the ex
tent of the sea coast lf the united states not in
cluding the bays sounds and small irregularities of
the main shore and of the sea islands if these
be included the length of the shore line of
coast as estimated by the superintendent of the
coast survey in his report would be thirtythree
thousand and sixtythree miles
it would be difficult to calculate the value of
these immenseaddilionsto our territorial possession
texas lying contiguous to the western boundry of
louisiana embracing within its limits a part ol the
navigable tributary waters of the mississippi and
an extensive sea coast could not long have remain
ed in the hands of a foreign power without endan
gering the peace of our south western frontier
her producers in the vicinity of the miseissppi
must have sought a market through these streams
running into and through our territory and the
danger of irritation and collision of intert
i tween texas as foreign state and ourselves would
have been imminent while the embarrassments in
the commercial intercourse between must
i have been constant and unavoidable had texas
i fallen into the hands or under the influence and
control of a strong maritime or military foreign
power as she might have dooethese dangers would
have been still greater they have been avoided by
her voluntary and peaceful annexation to the
united states texas from her position was a
natural and almost indispensable part ot our terri
tory fortunately she has been restored to our
i country and now constituted one oi the states oi
our confederation upon an equal footing with the
original states the salubrity of climate the fer
 ti ity of soil peculiarly adapted to the production
of some of our most valuable staple commodities

this abundance of gold and the ailengrossing

california among other signal advantages
which would result from such an establishment
would be tlut of raising the gold to ils par value
in that territory a branch mint of the united
states at the great commercial depot on the west

the gold derived from our own rich mines but al
so the bullion ind specie which our commerce

best mines in mexico new grenada central a
merica cbili and peru the bullion and specie
drawn from these especialy from those
of western mexico and peru to an amount in value
of many millions of dollars are now annually di
verted and conveyed by the ships of great britain
to her own ports to be recoined or used to sustain
her national bank and thus contribute to increase
hor ability to command so much of the commerce
of the world if a branch mint be established at
the great commercial point upon that coast a vast
amount of bullion and specie would flow thither to
be recoined and pass thence to mworleans
newyork and other atlantic cities the
amount of our constitutional currency at home will
be greatly increased while its circulation abroad
would be promoted it is well known to our mer
chants trading to china and the west coast of
america that great inconvenience and loan are
experienced from the fact that our coins are not
current at their par value in those countries
the powers of europe far removed from the west
coast ot america by the atlantic ocean which inter

tbe vast importance and commercial advanta
ges of california have heretofore remained unde
veloped by the government of the country of which
it constituted a part now that this fine province
is a part of oar country all the states of the
union and some more immediate and directly
than others are deeply interested in the speedy
development of its wealth and resources no sec
tion of our country is more interested or will be
more benefited than the commercial navigating
and manufacturing interests of the eastern states
our planting and farming interests of the union
will be greatly benefited by it as our commerce
and navigation are enlarged and extended our ex
ports of agricultural products and manufacturers
will be increased and in the flew markets thus
opened they cannot fail to command remunera
ting and profitable prices
the cquision of calafogoia and new mexico
the settlement of the oregon boundary and the
annexation of texas extending to the rio grande
are results which combined are of greater conse
quence and will add more to the strength and
wealth of the nation than any which have preced
ed them since the adoption of the constitution
but to effect the great results not only califor
nia but new mexico must be brought under the
control of regularly organized governments the
existing condition of california and of that part of

the immensely valuable possessions of new

advantagesand the salubrity of the climate emi
grants from the older states in great numbers are
already preparing to seek new homes in those in

shall the dissimilarity of the domestic institu

viding for them suitable governments these
institutions existed at the adoption of the constitu

overcome by that spirit of compromise which is
now invoked in a conflict of opinions or of in
terests real or imaginary between different sec
tions of our country neither can justly demand all
which it might desire to obtain each in the true
spirit of our institutions should concede something
to the other
our gallant forces in the mexican war by whose
patriotism and unparalleled deeds of arms we ob
tained those possessions as an indemnity for our
just demands against mexico were composed of
citizens who belonged to no one state or section
of our union they were men from slaveholding
and nonslaveholding states from the north and
the south and from the east and the west they
were all companions in arms and fellowcitizens
of the same common country engaged in the same
common cause when prosecuting that war they
were brethren and friends and shared alike with
each other common to toils and dangers and buffer
ings and now when their work is ended and
when peace is restored and they returned again
to their home put off the habiliments of war take
their ia xrieiy aft rosoffie tfieir ptrrwn
in civil lifesurely a spirit of harmony and conces
sion and of equal regard for the rights of all sec
tions of the union ought to prevail in providing
governments for the acquired territorythe fruits
of their common servicesthe whole people of the
united states and of every state contributed to
defray the expenses of that war and it would not
be just for any one section to exclude another from
all participation in the acquired territory this
would not be in consonance with the just system
of government which the framers of the constitu
tion adopted
the question is believed to be rather abstract
than practical whether slavery ever can or would
exist in any portion of the acquired territory even
if it were left to the option of the slaveholding
states themselves from the nature of the cli
mate aud productions in much the larger portion
of h it is certain could never exist and in the re
mainder the probabilities are it would not but
however this may be the question involving as it
does a principle of equality of rights of the sepa
rate and several states as equal copartners in the
confederacy should not be disregarded
in organizing governments over these territories
no duty imposed on coogress by the constitution
requires that they should legislate on the subject
of slavery while their power to do so is not only
seriously questioned but denied by many of the
soundest expounders of that instrument whether
congress shall legislate it or not the people of the
acquired territories when assembled in convention
to form state constitutions will possess the sole and
exclusive power to detremine for themselves
whether slavery shall or shall not exist within
their limits if congress shall abstain from inter
fering with the question the people of these terri
tories will be left free to adjust it as they may
think proper when they apply for admission into
the union no enactment of congrew could re
strain the people of aoy of the soverign states of
the union old or new north or south alavehold
iag or nonslaveholding from determining the
the character of their own domestic institutions as
they may deem wise and proper any and all the
states piwsrwr this right and congress can not de
prive them of it the people of georgia might if
they choose so alter their constitution as to
abolish slavery within its limits and the people
f vermont might so alter their constitution as to
admit lavery within its limits both states would
poasem the right though as all know it is not prob
able would exert it
it is fortunate for the peace and harmony of the
union that this question is in iu nature temporary
and can only continue for the brief period which
will intervene before california sod newmexico
be admitted as states into the union from the
tide of population now flowing into them it is
highly probable that this will soon occur
considering the several states and the citizens of
the several states as equals aad entitled to equal
righta under th eoosqtmioa if this were an origi
nal question it might well be insurfed oa that the
principle of nontalerferenee is the tnia doctrine
aad that congress could not in the absence of any
expressed grant of power interfere with heir rela
tive righta upon a great emergency however

the iwcn its harmony and oo continued prosper
ity as a nation to adjust at its present session this
the only dangerous question which lies n oar path
if not in some one of the modes suggested in i
some other which may be satisfactory
in anticipation of the establishment of regular go
vernments over the acquired territories a joint
commission of officers of the army and navy has
been ordered to proceed to the coast of california
and oregon for the purpose of making reconnois
ances and a report as to the proper sites for the e
reetkm of fortifications or other defensive works on
land and for suitable situations tor naval stations
the other information which may beexpected from
a scientific and skilful examination ot the whole face
of the coast will be eminently useful to congress
when they come to consider the propriety of mak
ing appropriations for these great national objects
proper defences on land will be necessary for the
security and protection of our possessions and
the establishment of navy yards and a dock for the
repair and construction of vessels will be impor
tant alike to our navy and commercial marine
without such establishments every vessel wheth
er of the navy or of the merchant service requir
ing repairs must at great expense come round
cape horn to one of the atlantic yards tor that
purpose with such establishments vessels it is be
lieved may be built or repaired as cheaply in i
california as upon the atlantic coast they would
give employment to many of our enterprising ship
builders and mechanics and greatly facilitate and
enlarge our commerce in the pacific
as it is ascertained that mines of gold silver j
copper and qdicksilver exist in new mexico and
california and that nearly all the ands in which
they are found belong to the united states it is
deemed important to the public interest that pro 
vision be made for a geological and tninera
logical examination of these regions measures
should ire adopted to preserve the mineral lands
especially such as contain the precious metals for
the us of the united suites or if brought into
market to separate them from the farming lauds
and dispose of them in such manner as to sei
cure a large return ol money to the treasury and
at the same time leave to the development of
iheif wealth by indivieual proprietors and purchas
era to do this it will be necessarry to provide
for an intermediate survey and location of the iots j
if congress should deem it proper to dispose of
the mineral land they should be sold in small
quantities and at a fixed minimum price 
i recommend that surveyors generals be au
thorized to be established in new mexico and cal i
ifornia and provision made for surveying and
bringing the public lands into market at the earli
indisposing of these lands i recommend that j
the right of preemption he secured and liberal
grants made to the early emigrants who have et
tied or may settle upon them
it will be important to extend our revenue lawsj
over these territories and especially over califor
nia at an early period there is already a con j
siuerable commerce with california and until ports j
of entry shall be established and collectors ap
pointed no revenue can be received
if these and other necessary and proper measi
tires be adopted lor the development of the wealth
and resources of newmexico and cahfornia and
regular territorial governments be established over
them such will probably be the rapid enlargement
of our commerce and navigation and such the ad
dition to the national wealth that the present gen
eration may live to witness the controlling com
mercial and monetary power of the world trans
ferred from london and other european enmori
unis to the city of newyork
the apprehensions which were entertained by
eome of our statesmen in the earlier periods
of the government that our system was incapable
of operating with sufficient energy and success over
largely extended territorial limits and that if this 
were attempted it would fall to pieces by its own
weakness have been dissipated by our experience
by the division of power between the states and
federal government the latter is found to operate
with as much energy in the extremes as in the cen
ter it is as efficient in the remotest of the thirty
stale which now compose the union as it was in
the thirteen slates which formed our constitution 
indeed it may well troubled whether if our pre
sent population had been confined within the liiints
of the original thirteen states the tendencies to j
centralization and consolidation would not have i
been such as to have encroached upon the essen i
tial reserved rights of the states and thus to have
made the federal government awidely different
one practically from what it is in tlieory and was
intended to be by its framers so far from enter
taining apprehensions of the safety of our system
by the extension of our territory the belief is con 
fidently entertained that each new stale gives
strength and additional guarantee for the preserva j
non of the union itself

of the treaty of peace friendship limits and set j

congress at its last session having made no pro
vision lor executing the th article of the treaty
by which the united states assumed to make natis
faction for the unliquidated claims of our citi

jefferson barracks in missouri and to prepare to
march to oregon an soon aa the necessary provis
ion could be made shortly before it was ready
to march it was arrested by a prorurion of the act
passed by congress on the last dav of the iaat m
ioo which directed that all the noncorumisaioned
otherm musicians sad privates of that regiment
who had been in service in mexico should sp
un their application be dwehargrd the ef
fect of the provision was to disband the rank

far advanced that it wad laspractfoabie for it to pro
ceed until the opening of tk ext spring
in the month of oeotr iaat the
communication was received frun he governor ot
oregon giving information of the otuaace  f
the indian disturbance and of the deutitute and
defenceless condition of the inhabitant orders
were immediately transmitted to the commander
of our squadron in the pacific to despatch to their
assistance a part of the naval forces in that station
to furnish them with arms and ammunition and to
give them such aid and protection as the navy
could afford until the army could refch the coun
try
it is the policy of humanity and one which has
always teen pursued by the united states to cul
tivate the good will of the aboriginal tribes of this
continent and to restrain them from making war
and indulging in excesses by mild means rather
than by force that this could have been done
with the tribes in oregon had that territory been
brought under the government of our laws at an
earlier period and had suitable measures been
adopted by congress such as now exists in our
intercourse with other indian tnbes within our
limits cannot be doubud indeed the immediate
and only cause of the existing hostility of the in
dians of oregon is represented to have been llie
long delay of the united states in making to them
some presents in sach articles as they wanted for
the country now occupied by our emigrants which
the indians claimed and over which they formerly
roamed
this compensation had been promised to them
by the temporaly government established in or
egon but its fulfilment had been postponed from
time to time for nearly two yean while those who
made it had been anxiously wailing for congress to
establish a territorial government over the country
the indians became distrustful of their good faith
and sought redress by plunder and massacrewhich
finally led to the present difficulties a few thou
sand dollars in suitable presents as a compensation
for the country which had been taken possession
ofoby our citizens would have satisfied the indi
ans and have prevented the war
a small amount properly distributed il is
confidently believed would soon restore quiet to
ihu ludian war our fellow chitons of oregon
have been compelled to take the field iu heir
own defence have performed valuable military
rervicesaad have been subjected to expenses which
have fallen heavily upon them justice demands
that provision should be made by congress to
compensate them for their eervices and to refund
to them the expenses which they have incurred
i tf lenees f
to co agism that provision be made for appoint
ment of a sufficient number of indian agents te
reside amongst the different tribes of oregon and
thata small sum be appropriated loanable these
agents to cultivate frieudly relations with them
if this be done the presence of a small military
force will be all that n necessary to keep them in
check and preserve pesos
i recommend that similar provision be made
as regards th tribes inhabiting northern texas
new mexico california and the extensive region
lying between our aettlemente in missouri and
these possessions as the most effective means of
preserving peace upon our borders and within the
recently acquired territories

of this convention is our elevation moral
intellectual and political encountering us
in the first step of our march staud oliios
black laws they must be repealed it
is true stripped as we are of all political
power we have only a moral power over
them but it only necessary to wield this
power aright and it is mighty to the pulling
down of the strongholds of oppression and
wrong therelurelet us not be slothful but
diligent doing all we have the ability to do
so that if we must be made louger to bleed
beneath the cruel inflictions of ignorance
prejudice and heathenish proscription we
may at least amidst our suflerings have this
consolation that we have exerted our
selves to the uttermost to escape the bloody
scourge
to thk county committee you gen
tlemen are expected to cooperate with the
central committee in bringing together to
form this convention a body of independent
fearless and talented menmen in whose
hearts burns unquencbably the love of liberty
and w bo will permit no surmountable obstacle
to work any intermission in their etlorts to
come at once into the most complete enjoy
ment of that liberty which they love there
are such men and reasonable exertion wil
suffice to assemble them together hitherto
our conventions have een made up of men l
who had received the suffrages and been sent
up by the authority of their constituents
i mlrr that arrangement there is reason to
suspect that in very many instances those
most thoroughly acquainted with our griev
ances and ihe best qualified lo remedy them
have lioni their faithfulness inleproving what
ever evil they have seen prevailing in their
respective communities incurred the dis
pleasure of their fellowcitizens and been re
pudiated by riiom as busybodies meddlers in
other mens matters while those who have
stikul by coidially assenting to the shouts of
he multitudes knowing nothing about the
interest of the ieople and caring less are sent
up to do business lor our oppressed people
in order that this as well as other evils re
sulting from the old order of things may be
averted we have proclaimed a mass conven
tion thus affording every man who feels the
weight of the yoke and is tired of wearing it
and has sufficient intelligence to contribute
aught to remove it a fair opportunity todo so

among f he occupants of the american
i pulpu dongg the lust t months has been
h rev avtfcander king r dublin ireland
a man of popular eloquence and rmtsidera
able intellectual vigor he han bad tec bn
object the convemon of ireland from fapacy
to proteetanusm through certain insttumen
uhtiec and of course haa met with a cordial
welcome from episcopalians methodwu
baptists ongregationaliata ac on the
evening of the slat ultimo a meeting wta
held at the mount vernon church in this
cttjr to take a farewell leave of this gentle
man and to  express to him the confidence
and chtwttan affection of the churches in
boston ihe rev mr kirk gave the open
ing address this is the gentleman who
labored so strenuously and so successfully in
the london evangelical alliance to prevent
that body from excommunicating slave holders
from the pale ofhnatiaa communion he
ta a kind of religious beau brummeilele
gant exquisite and sentimental he referred
ibe present degradation of ireland to the rile
of papacy will he tell us to what the
degradation of the stavebotding south is
owing not to papacy certainly amd is
it not incomparably more appalling than that
of ireland l he thought no political change
would be of any permanent benefit to ireland
ill she became a nation of freemen in jesus
christ but where will he find such a nation
undoubtedly hi beau ideal on tt is this  land
of the free in which there are only three
millions of slaves held by protestant masters
he said the repeal needed for ireland was a
repeal of the papacy a repeal of the union
with rome perhaps sobut what does he
 think of a religious and political union with
those who traffic in human flesh r is he in
favor of its repeal not he give ireland
i ihis be said  give her an open bible and
j then we may hope she will take her place
among the nations of the earth fine decla
mation lilts but is it not disgusting cant to
come from the lips of a man who sees millions
of his own countrymen deprived of the bible
by law and who is in religious fellowship
with those who make and enforce the law
lie should wear a mask m the pulpit and
never show bis real face again until he
regents
the immortal discoverer of the innocency
of  organic sins rev edward beecher
followed mr kirk it is the policy of the
devil he said to keep up the distinction of
nations and castes to have parties and sects
c this looks like an attack on  the star
spangled banner and on the army and navy
which are quite national but the dr is
shrewd enough to make no application of his
language ho represents the policy design
and tendency of religion to be to bring men
togetherto unite themgive them a com
mon master a common service a common
hope how strikingly illustrated is this
doctrine in the thousand jarring religious
bodies in this land we believe it is true ot
the spirit of primitive christianity that w hich
he declares to he true of religion in the ameri
can sense and which is not true
rev mr king next addressed the assem
bly he had heard much of america  her
free institutions c but it did not appear
that he had ever heard of a certain  peculiar
institution at the south for he made no men
tion of it but eulogized our country as though
she were without spot or wrinkle since tie
has been among us he seems to have avoided
alt contact with the abolitionists so far as
we can learn and to have attached himself
wholly to those who are decidedly inimical to
the antislaverv movement we have never
heard nor seen reported from his lips a single
word against that  abomination of desolation
slavery as expressive of ins feelings on this
subject this has been the more inexcusable
on his part as his theme has been the value ot
the bible and the importance ot ptocunng tor
it a free circulation in ireland while he
knows it is a sealed and prohibited book to
nearly one half of our southern population
sealed and prumuiua t uy n hnpp no
the romish church but by protestants of his
own stamp by the very sects by which he
was so warmly received episcopalians con
gregationalisms baptists methodists c c
we trust his behavior will not escape the
notice of our antislavery friends in ireland
especially in dublin
if wc might be allowed to whisper in the
ear of this politic theologian we could tell
him that there is a better way of convening
ireland from papacy than lor him to appeal
for aid to a nation which deals  in slaves and
souls of rneu to an unparalleled extent and
which professes to derive irom the bible ita
highest sanctions of this horrible iniquity
let lum say little or nothing about papacy
until he lias testified in thundertones against
that mean plundering despotic persecuting
brotesiaimsin in ireland which though
numerically feeble compels by the terrible
power of the british government seven mil
lions of talboltcs to support ftby a direct tax
in violation of the sacred rights of conscience
in defiance of every principle of justice to
think of converting people to a religion which
they are forced to support at the potut ot the
bayonetand irom which they utterly dissent
as equally spurious and tyrannical is an
absurdity
the rev mr blagden of the old south
church next  offered a fervent prayer to

meaning the politic mr king about to tempt
the dangers of the ocean c as mr blag
den is unscrupulous in his appeal to the bible
in defence of slaveholding and does not
hesitate to maintain even in his pulpit the
scriptural right to enslaye men women and
children it was singularly pertinent that he
should offer the prayer on the occasion alluded
to what  lantastic tricks before high

the closing address was made by the very
reverend and very notorious matthew hale
smith who somewhat boastiugly informed
mr king that  our government is now the
most stable government on the face of the
earth seeing that slavery is its cornerstone
and that beneath it lie crushed three mil
lions of people very stable indeed
and a matter of pious congratulation but
if this be stability what is insecurity be
not deceived mr smith whatsoever a
nation sows that shall it also  reap  they
that lead into captivity shall go into captivity
 with what measure ye meie it shall be
measured to you again boast as we may
of the this government it stiff
remains fearfully true that the lord hath a
controversy with the inhabitants of the land
because there is no truth nor mercy nor
knowledge of god in the land by swearing
and lying and killing and stealing and com
muting adultery they break out aud blood
toucheth blood therefore shall the land
mourn  thus saith the lord god o tvrus
thou hast said  am of ujdect beauty thine
heart is lifted up because tby beauty thou
has corrupted tby wisdom by reason of thy
brightness thou bast defiled thy sanctuaries
by the multitude of thine iniquities by the
iniquity uf thy traffic therefore will i bring

little brains as tu believe that these lipservie

us can aid or hasten the abolition of slavery
in the united states is it not wouderfui that
fools enough can be hunted out to support that
t negro buffoon fred douglass and his north
star in his abuse vt the country that gave
him birth and his laudation of every thing
english it is very easy for some phtiau
tnropic souls among us who would hetroeti
cally seal their pockets when a sixpence is in
danger of escaping from them to talk of a
southern planters giving up what he has all
his life been taught toennstder as justly and
as morally his property as is his house or his
lands without the least renumeration or even
the thanks of the north it is very easy to
talk of getting rid of slavery in a dayof
turning twoaud a half millions of negroes ig
notanl and unused to contend w ith the world
out upon the community to rob to hot
and to fill our northern prisons and alms
housesand it may he very consoling to
these philanthropists to know that their prat
tle is echoed hy such abusive scamps as fred
douglass and george thompsonbut we
opine it is not quite so easy to propose a just
and equitable and safe plan to do away with
the evil if these gentlemen are sincere in
their professed love of the negro let them
propose some feasible plan to the south for
the abolition of slavery and strive to enforce
it in a wise conciliatory spirit and the south
w ill give them a hearing it is all very fine
this highsounding declamation this poetical
imagery this talk of  hundred headed hy

mr editor it is thanksgiving dav and
l at this moment i can say i am truly thankful
not because the day is so very beautiful
friends kind and plenty of smiles upon the
board but because i have had the privilege of
i listening to a noble and manly rebuke of wrong
injustice and oppression w hen i listen to
such words as  have to day  have a more
opinion of man and my heart is made
stronger and better the burning w or u
the faithful preacher of righteousness one
who has a soul that cannot be bought and
isold increases my faith that the day will come
when principle will triumph over expediency
and love of gain
the preacher i have heard today is mr
higginson the pastor of the unitarian society
jof this tow n he took for his text the words
of christ man shall not jive by bread alone
i but by every word that procetxleth out of the
mouth ol god he remarked in his introduc
tion that our na ion was not given to fighting
as some others nor so licentious as some oth
ers c but of its great sin is a love of tem
poral good of temporal blessings living by
alone this was the idea but i have not ex
pressed it in his beautiful and earnest words
alter speaking of the fact that in the estima
tion of society the substantial tnan is he wht
 has an abundance of temporal blessings he
proceeded to remind his hearets that a veai
ago last august he told them that an effort
was being made to place another slaveholdei
in the presidential chair that effort has beer
successfu slavery has again triumphed
the ultra slaveholding candidate has been ele
vated to the highest political office within the
gift of any people in the face of the facts
said the preacher that gen taylors nomina
tion was not fit to be madethat he pos
sessed riot one qualification for the officethat
he was first nominated by slaveholders of all
parties as the available southern candidate
that he was first urged upon the whig con
vention and sustained by southern menthat
the convention after having nominated him
adjourned without expressing a single prin
ciple rejecting the v ilmot proviso with con
temptyou have voted for him and since
his election you have united in celebrating his
triumph you have endorsed the triumph of
slavery and the reason why gen taylor
was supported by the nonh was because the
people live by bread alone they gave up
principle and freedom for a tariff
in the course of his remarks he alluded in
an eloquent and feeling manner to frederick
douglass  wish i could give his intensely
stirringand thrilling words but the w ish is
vain and  shall not try i will simply give
the idea he said that when he listened a
few evenings since to douglasss terrible and
volcanic icbukes of this professedly free and
christian nation and thought that this man
bis body soul powerful genius all were ooce
under the powet of slavery and thought of
the millions who are now in bondage he felt
it a great wrong to lei even one sabbath pass
by without saying something fur the slave
and said he by the helpofgod i never will
in his closing temark he said that the owner
of three hundred slaves a warrior by trade
had been considered by some as a very good
antislavery and peacecandidate when if it
had not been for these things he never could
have been a candidate and elected
when it is remembered that mr higgin
sons congregation is composed almost entirely
of rich taylor men hts manly boldness and
independence appear in their true light his
scorching rebukes must have been terrible to
some of them lie told them thavvbed
dyuglass came a man of power eloquence
and genius very few bid him welcome be
was not received with honors and but a few
testified their approbation but when the
oame of gen taylor is mentioned the name
of one you do not know without genius and
eloquence eminent for nothing but brute
force then your acclamations are loud and
long you illuminate your bonnet and cele
brate bin triumph but i will not write morn
thanks for such men as mr higginson

peace plenty and contentment is
this true does peace reign throughout oui
borders and is there no cause for alarm
there is no peace to the wicked saith mj
god lay not therefore ibis flattering unc
tion to your guilty soul there are scattered
throughout your borders a sable army ol
three millions whose multiplied wrongs crj
aloud to heaven by day and by night for ven
geance on this bloody land the peace which
you enjoy is the stillness which precedes the
earthquake a cloud overhangs your bor
ders charged with a fiery tempest a mag
azine is in the midst of you which only need
the match of a foreign foe to shatter the na
tion into fragments rest not we beseech
you upon this deceitful peace you are feed
i ing an army in your midstraising up a foe at
your own doois whose dark arms may yet
i spread death and devastation throughout youi
borders whips and chains will not always
avail you there are heaving hearts beneath
your feet more terrible than volcanic fires
there is upon your walls a man like him
who stood upon those of ancient jerusalem
whose daily cry is woe woe woe to
this guilty land you may beat him with
reeds and bind him with cords but this cry
you can never silence till you break the fetters
of the plundered bondmen until this is
done you will walk upon slippery rockswhile
fiery billows roll beneath instead of crying
peace the president as the watchman upon
thd wall of state should sound the alarm and
awake the nation to a sense of its insecurity
and call upon them to avert the impending
destruction by doing justice to these enslaved
and insulted millionsto seek peace with this
mighty army of internal foes
our beloved country presents a sublime
moral spectacle to the world f if to he dis
tinguished for hypocrisy lying slaveholding
and slavetrading is to present a sublime
moral spectacle james k polk is right
for we are preeminent in all these respects
we are a sublime nation sublime in our lave

sublime in oui notions of human brotherhood
sublime in our professions of religionsub
lime in our geographical extent we are
enveloped in sublimity and exalted far above
all other nations on the habitable globe how
unutterably disgusting is all this parade about
the sublimity of our position before the world
when there is not an intelligent man in all
europe who does not feel that as a nation
we are a band of the most unjust and hypo
critical people on the globe who that
reads the newspapers does not know hat we
aie a hissing and byword among european
nations and hat scarce a man ventures from
the shores of this boasted land of libertywho
has any shame left hot is ashamed to say
that be is an american but here is another
hodfuli
it is a subject of just pride that our fame
and character as a natron continues rapidly to
advance in the estimation of the civilised
world to our wiaa and free institutions it is
to be attributed that while other nations have
achieved glory at the price of the suffering
distress and impoverishment of their people
we hare won our honorable position in th

character of these new acquisitionsthe duty
of the present congress to provide territorial
governments for california and new mexico
the missouri compromise is recommended
slavery is pronounced the only dangerous
question about establishing letritoria govern

a general argument is urged against inter

and the veto power is defended the liter

and our readers will do well to read it not
withstanding its length f d
the annual meeting
the call for it is in another column and the
i
time for holding it is at hand we look for
ward to it with much interest the present
agitated state of the public mind and the
general posture of public affairs with respect
to slavery makes it unusually important for
the friends of the slave in western new
york to meet and take counsel together and
to give to the world the result of their con
sultation while the minions qf slavery are
active and energetic contending for slavery
and chains not only within fifteen states oi
this union but are greedily clamoring foi
having their foul curse extended to territory
now free while the church is extending the
right hand of fellowship to slaveholders and
the pulpit is dumb over the wrongsf fettered
millions while the greeneyed monster pro
judice against color is excluding innoceni
children from respectable schools in our vert
midst and asserting its right to degrade the
character and blast the hopes of unborn gen
erationsit is meet that every man who hat
a heart within his bosom should be awake
and up and doing to arrest this tide of injus
tice and sea of wrongs the annual meeting
will afford an opportunity for striking a blow
in this cause let us then rally at rochester
on the st of december and do true mans
work for humanity and freedom the times art

we scarcely need say to our country
friends that the homes as well as the hearts

rochester antislavery fair
among the many expedieuts adopted to
raise the needful funds withwhich to carry
forward humane and reformatory objects none
have been more abundantly successful than
fairs there is something in the taste skill
and industry displayed by those active in get
j ting them up which commands the respect
 even of those who have little or no sympathy
with the objects they are designed to promote
there is something in the human beau in its
lowest condition that must respond to earnest
sincerity though it may be evineed by thoee
to whom that heart is opposed when be
nevolent women meet and work during eight
and nine months in the year turning away
from fashionable pleasures refusing to spend
their leisure to serve their own interests and
devote themselves in obscurity to advaneing
the wellbeing of the degraded and neglected
slave they give evidence of sincerity that
ought and must receive encouragement in any
enlightened community this is tbc secret of
the success of the boston and philadelphia

the lynn pioneer
the following is from the lynn pioneer
and herald of freedom edited by george
brad burn esq mr bradbum does us no
more than justice to acquit us of intentional
misrepresentation the heads of bis speech
were published last week in the north star
copied from the minutes of the secretary
and we may safely say from those minutes
that at least one person who heard his speech
besides ourself received the same impression
of his remarks which we we attempted
no report of mr brad burns speech but
merely stated the proposition which he aimed
to prove and one of the rales by which he i
attempted to prove it
with respect to what we said of mr in
galls speech we do not see that mr ba j
statement of tbe case at all mends the matter
or convicts us of misrepresentation mr
bradbum says that he did not understandj
mr ingalls as making an effort to show that
wages slavery was as bad as chattel slavery
but that he did understand him to say that
wages slavery is potentially as bad as chattel
slavery
with all respect to mr bradbnrn we
must say that we are unable to see the dis
tinction here attempted and must wait for
more lightr d
another account or the providence
meetingsee in another column tbe ao
count given by the north star of the late an
nual meeting of the r i antislavery so r
eiety we cannot exclaim how brightly j
shines that star oo this subject but we
do assure our readers though we are quite
aware of tendering the assurance almost at
the expeaee of seeming to think they must
have fancied onto have lost what little of
common sense we ever had that our speech
m that meeting was better understood and
better appreciated by some others who did
n the honor of listening to our remarks than
it would seem to have been by mr douglass
sad had say of those ethers  attempted a re
port of it we will not permit ourselves to doubt
that the speech had boon better reported also
wo do not affirm that mr ds shabby ac
count of our remarks was intentional we
ptefer to believe he gave little attention to
what we said we would certainly forswear
til farther speaking in public did we suppose
missives likely to be so ill understood by any
considerable number of our hearers as we ap
kr t have been by the editor of tbo north
r
mr ingalb of the new york landwerk
the gentleman alluded to in be article on
which we are remarking os a mr logits
editor of young america fcree ecarre bet
ter than our bumble tdm at the bands of
mr douglass to oa it waa not an exceed
ingly difficult to think the speaker booeet
and we are very ante he showed himself to be
any thing but a fool if any arrant non
sense waa uttered in that meeting we hare
a notion it came from another quarter we
did not understand mr ingalls as making an
effort to show that wages slavery is as bad as
chattel slavery we did however tinder
stand him to say that wage slavery
potentially as had aa chattel slavery and to
place the wroog not of ones owning or oc
cupyinga piece of bod but of bedmonopo
ly on the same footing as holding property
in man and we freely acknowledge that
we listened to both of those statements with
out feeling that either was a prodigious tav
oo oar patience indeed our causality is
not big enough to sec why if bedmono poly
or wages slavery is a wrong it should nut
in common with every other viilany bn
placed on the same footing an holding prop
erty in man neither do we sec with great
dearness though aided by the steady ligh tof
the north star that mr ingalb sinned enor
mous against common sense in suggesting
that truthfulness to the principle of justice on
which abolitionists professedly base their
action against negro slavery demands that
they endeavor something for the removal of
other atrocious viobtknw of that principle
nay it seems to us that the poor white man
is well nigh justified in cherishing the fancy
many such a man is known to cherish that
the philanthropy is a little partial which
makes such a terrible for negro
emancipation while laming up its benevolent
nose at the efforts of those who seek a more
universal emancipation but it is no part of
our business to defend the editor of the land
mark he is of age and can speak for him

dear douglass i arrived here last eve
ning from lancaster county pa and shall
hold a meeting among the colored people to
morrow evening there being no earlier oppor
tunity to do so in the meantime i shall call
upon the tew professed abolitionists in the
place and solicit subscribers to the north

on the th st and d i held meetings
in york pa assisted by rev john j moore
an excellent man where a fine feeling and
excellent interest was awakened in the condi
tion of our people and the sustenance of iht
north star the people in york are quite
industrious and intelligent many of them be
ing freeholders and several excellent mechan
ic doing business for themselves two oi
the best bool and shoemakers in the place ire
colored men and it is conceded by many
that as good a tailor in every respect as the
town affords is a young colored mechanic
who was raised and learned his trade in york
these mechanics  have seen and examined
many of their workmanship and
o far as my judgment goes in the style sod
oca loess of work they were inferor to none
that i have seeu anywhere there is also u
carpenter among our brethren in this place a
fine workman
one colored gentleman mr guodridge tn
additidn to other small branches of business
carried on owns a train of eight or ten freight
cars of the first dans running between york
and philadelphia doing good hustossn and a
small warehouse in the former place in s de
pository for merchandise
there is a good sehool here taught by
mr g  good ridge who w also eierk for
his father and quite ayouogmao but one of
excellent deportment and highly exemplary
character the pupils under the charge of
mr good ridge were examined on several of
the minor branches and promise well for fu
ture usefulness and should mr g who ias
f y intelligent and wellqualified gentleman
but persevere and keep paoe with the march
of improvement and reform be may prove a

female pace weu
though at domestic temce they may he now
that the long nights of winter hare com
menced instead of going from place to place
n search of company with whom to while
away their evening hoar to gather in groupj
of foui six or more a courenithcy will ad
roli of each leisure evening in the week for
the purpose of mental and moral improve
ment these groups each should form an
entire class and should consist of about six
voting women the nearest neighbor to each
other by which arrangement they would not
he nceitated to go far from their dwelling
places at night who should severally meet at
the house of either of the company for the
purpose of reading and studying books of use
ful knowledge it doe not matter whether
the place of meeting be a chamber or kitchen
so that th information sought is obtained
let them meet with this understanding avoid
ing useless light and frivolous conversation
and there is no family with whom they may j
live who would deny them this small though
laudable privilege so far from denying they j
would rather encourage it  should advise
them to begin with the spellingbook the
most approved of course localise good
orthography is the foundation of all good
scholarship and for another reason that
through false pude and misguided ambition a
great number of persons especially among
our aspirants for the pulpit commence their
course of qualification in the classics and sci
ences who when they put their hands to
paper are frequently unable to spell the most
ordinary or common w ords of whatever com
bination of syllables i would advise these
young women to commence with the spelling
book obtaining the most convenient assist
ance taking their lessons by columns until
they have mastered english grammar at
least sufficiently to w rite sentences correctly
which may be done in a short time by atiy
intelligent reader i would recommend ros
well c smiths english grammar as the
most simple and comprehensive to the young
beginner by the collegian and academician
this book may be condemned and sneered at j
but  do not care for that nevertheless 
have but one object which is to accomplish
certain ends and the means as common sense
suggests which will bsst accomplish those
ends are the best means to lie made use of
hence i recommend this simplified grammar 
because it cettainly is the best adapted to the
comprehension of the undisciplined inind i
m not of those who would only acknowledge
euclid as it had been handed down from
an alexandrian museum or an athenian
grammar school without improvement or
modification nay verily but shall judge ac
cording to true merit and estimate according
to liitiinsic valuewith every amendment
and modification let the author lie whom he
rnny
our young women can also do much in the
way of learning trades which they should as
soon as possible tailors mantuamakers
and milliners care hut little what the color ofj
the person is to whom they give their work
those who work best will always be sure to
get employment this much i deem it my
duty to say for the encouragement of our
young women though by the highborn high j
headed mtvjuc it nrfay be considered bad
taste lot an editorial letter to which i have
but to reply that the opinions of such perj
sons will not redeem our downtrodden and
oppressed brethren in this country from de
gradation and bondage
york is a handsome town of about 
inhabitants who are very civil aside fiom

very salutary effect iion the w hole colored
population round about the neighborhood mr
burrells a gentleman formerly a laboring hand
in their employ has now some ten fine freight

by white men in western pennsylvania and

with whitedigging ore boating coal stand

to see and is what will make men respected

messrs smith aud whippet keep
slantv employed some nineteen or twnty
hands chiefly colored men besides the hauls
tng from their extensive coal and lumber
yard which gives employment more or lere hi
every white mao who nuts a team cart or
drag shout the lows such men as these
truly beneficial to any community ia which
they may live and i would that we had more
of them
you can scarcely imagine the effect it would
have over the proslavery feeling in this
slaveholding country if in addition to the
few business men we bare there were in new
j york city philadelphia boston eves bal
timore richmond norfolk washington city
and all other ports of entry where colored
men are permitted to reside and buffalo
which ha one colored mercantile house
cleveland detroit which has another
milwaukee chicago ciocionst and pitts
burgh and many other places but one ship
pinghouse wholesale or retail store the pro
pnetor or proprietors of wjjich were colored
men and one extensive mechanic of any de
scription of trade such indisputable evi
dence as this of the enterprise and industry
of the colored roan compared with that of
the white would not admit of controversy
it would bear with it truths as evident as self
existence truths placed beyond the shadow
jof a doubt and this  hold is precisely that
which our capitalists should do with their
means if they be not qualified themselves
they should have their sons and daughters
qualified for active practical business life and
thus invest their capital thereby doing good
not only to the community and the time in
which they live but also to the rising genera
tionbequeathing to posterity a legacy more
beneficial in its tendency by example than
actual wealth in dollats and cents as it is
now with but few exceptions our fathers
make fortunes only to change hands at their j
death heirs it is true they may leave to its
enjoyment but mostly unqualified and unac
customed to business pursuits there is but
little estimate in general placed upon it by
such ersons hence it is on squandered
away in lavish profligacy or becomes an easy
prey to the envious and more advantageous
rival of the unthinking colored legatee
hence in the accumulation of fortunes by our
fathers it seems but an effort on their part to
gain strength while living which to transmit
to our enemies thereby making them the j
more powerful to oppress after their death
there are now hundteds of avenues to in
dustry and enterprise opened to our young i
men and capitalists such as the west india
and trade to the coast of africa all of which
i have much to say about hereafter it ap
pears to me to be silly in the extreme for us
to shut our eyes against the truth and per
mitting the whites to usurp these trades and
enrich themselves while we are standing still
contending about the propriety of doing it
so lucrative i am informed has already been
tliis trade that in one years time from the
first sailing of the african trading company
packet from baltimore that they found it ne
cessary to build another vessel and the trade
increases at a ratio of more than one hundred
per cent per annum i expect to be at the
pennsylvania state convention of colored
freemen at harrisburgb on the th ult
when i hope to secure some action in favor of
t the north star onr people everywhere
should at once adopt this paper for their or
gan as experience has taught me that it is
possible in the present state of our circum
stances to support more than one efficient pa
per in this country devoted particularly to the
cause of the oppressed dependent on them
i for support
j  should have observed that more young
j women in york subscribed for the paper than
i in any country town in which i have yet been
i there is also in columbia a firstiate boot and
shoemaker a colored gentleman who has two
sons quite lads sitting at work as steadily as
men each of whom is able to do good work

dear douglass my present purpose in
wiiting to you is to say that the people in
this part of the vineyard have been invigor
ated by a discourse long eloquent and argu
mentative by your manly and distinguished
colaborer m r delany
his subject was the present condition of the
colored people and he did ample justice to it
occupying the major part of three evenings m
 delivering it was it good l ls he inter
esting are the first questions ihe curious
will put which  will answer in this wise
i have you heard him t if not take the first
opportunity to do so and last to persons
lj who know anything about our people here
i know they are tiot very attentive to meetings
of any kind and to inform them that the two
i last evenings his audience was greatly in
i creased they will at once conclude he was
i j interesting
i j the dr speaks well clear distinct and to
j the point he commenced his address by
t saying that it w as not his intention to speak
f of the cursed mstgution of slavery with its
crimes woes and miseries but he intended
to stick to the text and confine himself to
 such considerations as will make man proud
i j of himself he then went on to prove the
importance of man which was done in a
f manner creditable as alike convincing he
ij then passed to a review of the present eondi
jtion of our people in which he dealt out
 some homethrusts at our religious aspira
i lions not with disparagement at our truly
 pious notions but of the sacrifice we make of
our temporal duties aad the irrational extent
to which wc carry our religion cues he
r contended and wiaely too that our temporal
duties were as esaenliil to our elevation as our
j religious ones wets to oar future happiness
tad my oly hope it flat there pomti rew
r never be loet eight of by all who have been
him at least this idea of treating in god
for everything fond an exeellent ifiretratim
in the anecdote of thore taro om genilereaa
these position took up sb of the that eve
i ning
r yesterday evening i area re unfortunate
j as to mire hearing all of hie discourse bet
r j was informed it wa dot inferior to the one
of the previous evenirg he then showed
i the difference between c hnstiauity and reti
ijgioo ah this was the trying ume and
mow of his audience were looking for a rash
i attack upon religion commonly applied but
i when thoy were informed by him that chris
j tianity was likeuess unto christ and religion
j only to adhere to a confession of faith there
was an evident recoil quite a new field of
thought was here suddenly opened to their
view some struggling to resist the condo
sioq found their only consolation in the
couplet of hoses bigelow

are commonly called pot wrestler foe
which failed iot to have effect i assure you
by the way was it not opoo this subject that
the dr sadly insulted some dignified gentry
of our quaker city and barely escaped their
vengeance
wednesday evening as before i was be
lated and just got there as he was speaking of
the investment colored people should make in
this country the profitable advantages it would
render out elevation the esteem we would ne
cessarily command at the hands of onr op
i pressots the ease with which any young
lady could with a little economy purchase a
small quantity of public land at government
prices and thereby secure an investment
showing too the possibility of a sale of the
same land at double the price paid thus se
curing another destderafttm
he also spoke of the necessity of our peo
ple securing for their children a good educa
tionnot that they should seek after a col
lege course but a good practical business
education while such a course collegiate
would not b objected to provided it were
j attainable and not bent on extremes as
much learning makes men mad

dear sir one of the most important
lawsuits has been going on in this city dur
ing the last three weeks which has ever been
brought before the people of this slate in
relation to the capture of fugitives from
southern slavery it is not yet decided and
will not be perhaps for several days to come
we are not lawing against kentucky alone
but against the combined powers of slavery
detroit river is the line between us and
canada and it is also the great depot of the
j northern underground railroad and if the
slaveholders are encouraged with a verdict in
this case they will doubtless make this point
their slavehunting ground
this day saw a person who is claimed
j as a runaway slave called upon the stand as
l a witness in this case against his master in
 the u s district court of michigan an
hour before the witness appeared the court
j house was literally crammed with people of
color who knew the fugitive was to appear
on the stand against the kentucky slavehold
ers when the name of adam crosswaite
was called the courtroom door was opened
and he walked into the witness stand to be
sworn
the slaveholders looked with astonishment
for this was unexpected to them just at
this moment much excitement prevailed
among the witness friends suppoing that the
j slaveholders might attempt to pounce upon
their prey but not a dog of them offered to
lilt his tongue or hand to interfere except
the plaintiffs counsel who himself must be
identified with the african race judging from
his external appearance he objected to mr
crosswaites testimony on the ground that
j kentucky laws do not allow a slave to testify
against his master bui it was shown by the
defendants counsel that the slave laws of
kentucky do not extend over michigan so
mr crosswaite proceeded he stated tha the
was born in kentucky the slave of his own
father and was sold by him he came to
this state in  and resided in the village
of marshall moved thence to canada in
 where he now resides the plaintiffs
counsel asked witness no questions at all
j at the time witness left the stand a rush was
made to the door with mr crosswaite by the
colored citizenswho soon conveyed him across
the detroit river into canada
adam crosswaite is a bright mulatto man
about fortyfive years of age and his wife is
about fifty the slaveholders have stated
under oath in this court that the above fa m
ily was the property of francis giltner ol
carroll county kentucky and that they are
runaway slaves frauds troutman esq
was sent as the agent of mr gilmer to bring
them back into captivity he found them in
this state but swears that he was prevented
from taking them by an abolition mob this
is the basis upon which they have entered this
suit against certain citizens of this state for
the sum of twentyseven hundred dollars
worth of property
ever true to the cause of freedom

a dark placethe days of mob viol
ence are not over in illinois great as has been
the progress of some portions of the state in
liberal sentiment there seem to be some
barbarous spots there yet we learn from
the western citizen that a clergyman named
milton smith was recently pelted with rotten
eggs while preaching a sermon in mchenry
county as he was a stranger to the people
mr s supposes the outrage was intended for
the regular preacher of the place with whom
he had exchanged and who had often fear
lessly exposed the sin and infidelity of the
corrupt proslavery religionists of the place
it is probable the rabble were instigated by
i these cowardly sanctimonious ruffians to their
violence it is thus ihat free speech and
conscience are treated by proslavery piety
in this case the preacher resolved not to be
driven from his post and went on through his
sermon and triumphed over the mobocrats

 invite attention to the recommendation of
the secretary of the navy on the subject of the

i and those designated were necessarily dismissed
i bat without any alleged fault i concur in opin
ion with the sectary that the service would be
improved by reducing the number of landsmen
and increasing the marines such a measure
would justify an increase ol the number of officers
to the extent of the reduction by dismissal and
t still the corps would have fewer officers than a

fed and half clad operatives were not only in ab
ject poverty bot were bound in chains of oppres
sive servitude for the benefit of fovorrd classes
wbo were the exclusive objects of the ears of tha
government
it was not possible to reconstruct society in tbo
united states upon the european plan hare
there was a written constitution by which orders
and titles were net recognixod or tolerated a
system of measures was therefore devised calcu
lated if not intended to withdraw lower gradu
ally and ailaotly from the states and the mats oi
the people and by construe lion to approximate
our government to the european models substi
tuting an aristocracy of wealth for that of orders
aud titles
without reflecting upon the dissimilarity ofoor
institutions end of the condition of the people and
those of europe they conceived the vain idea of
building up in the united slates a system similar
totlliat which they admired abroad great brit
ain had a national bank of large capital in whose
hands was concentrated the controlling momen
tary aud financial power of the nation an insti
tution wielding almost kingly power and exerting
vast influence upon all the operations of trade
and upon the policy of the government itself
great brisaiu had an enormous public debt and
it had become a part of her public policy to re
gard this a public blessing great britaiu had
also a restrictive policy which placed fetters and
burdeua on trade and trammelled the productive
industry of the inass ol the nation by ber com
bined system of policy the landlords aud other
propertyholders ware protected and snriched by
the enormous taxes that were levied upon the la
bor of the country for tbeir advantage
imitating this foreign policy the first step in es
tablishing the new system in the united states was
the creation of a national bank no foreseeing
the dangerous power and countless evils which
such an institution might entail on the country nor
perceiving the connexion which it was designed to
form between the bank and the other branches ol
the miscalled american system but feeling the
embarrassments of the treasury and of the busiuess
ot the country consequent upon the war some ot
our statesmen who had held different and sounder
views were induced to yield their scruples and
indeed settled convictions of its unconstitutionally
and to give it their sanction as an expedient which
they vainly hoped might produce relief it was a
inot unfortunate error as the subsequent history
and final catastrophe of that dangerous and cor
rupt institution have abundantly proved the
bauk w ith its numerous branches ramified into the
states soon brought many of the active political
and commercial men in different sections of the
country into the relation of debtors to it and de
pendants upon it for pecuniary favors thus diffus
ing throughout the mass of society a great number
of individuals of power and influence to give tone
to public opinion and to act in concert in cases ol
emergency the corrupt power of such a political
engine is np longer a matter of speculation having
been displayed in numerous instances but most
signally in thk political struggles   in op
position to the public will represented by a fearless
and patriotic president
but the bank was but one branch of the new
system a public debt of more than one hundred
and twenty millions of dollars existed and it is
not to be disguised that many of the authors ol
the new system did not regard its speedy pryment
as essential to the public prosperity but looked
upon its continuance as no national evil whilst
the debt existed it furnished aliment to the nation
al bank and rendered increased taxation nessesa
ry to the amount of the interest exceeding seven
millioni of dollars annually
this operated in harmony with th next branch
of the new system which was a high protective
tariff this w r as to afford bounties to favored
classes and particular pursuits at the expense oi
i all others a proposition to tax the whole peo
 pie for the purpose of enrichiug a few was too
monstrous to be openly made the scheme was
therefore vailed under the plasible but delusive
pretext of a measure to protect home industry
and many of our people were for a time ied to
believe that a tax which in the main fell upon labr
was for the benefit of the laborer who paid it
this branch of the system involved a partnership
between the government and the favored classes
the former receiving the proceeds of the tax
imposed on articles imported and the latter the in
creased price of similar articles produced at home
caused by aubh a taa
it is obvious that the portion to be received by
the favored classes would as a general rule be
increased in proportion to the increase of the rates
of tax imposed and diminished as those rates
were reduced to the revenue standard required by
the wants of the gouerument the rates required
to produce a sufficient revenue for the ordinary ex
penditures of ovemment for necessary purposes
were not likely to give to the private partners in
this scneine profits sfficient to satisfy their cupidi
ty and hence a variety of expedients and pretexts
were resorted to for the pupose of enlarging the
j expenditures and thereby creating a necessity for
keepiug up a high protective tariff the effect
of this policy was to interpose artificial restrictions
upon the natural course of the busioess and trade
of the country and to stance the interests of large
capitalist an monopohßs at the expense of the
great mass of the people who were laaed to in
crease their wealth
another branch of this system was a compre
hensive echeme of internal improvements capa
ble of indefinite enlargement and sufficient to
swallow up as many millions annually as coaid
be exacted from tbe foreign commerce of the
country th a was a convenient aud uecemary
adjuuct to the protective tariff it waa to be the
great absorbent of any surplus which might at
auy time accumulate io the treasury and of tbe
taxee levied on tho people not for necessary rev
enue purposes but for the avowed object of affor
ding protection to the favored classes
auxiliary to the same end if it waa not an es
sential part of the system ilself was tbe scheme
which at a later period obtained for distributing
tbe proceeds of the sale of tbe public land among
th stale other expedients war devised to
tak money out of the treasury and preveut its
coming in from any other source than the protec
tive tariff the authors and supporters of tho
system were the advocates of the largest expend
itures whether for tecaseary or useful purpose
or not because the larger tbe expenditure lb
greater wee the pretext for high taxmia tbe form
of protective duties
these several measures were sustained by pop
ular name and plausible arguments by which
thousand were deluded the beak wee repre
sented to be indtapeneible fiscal agent for the gov
ernment was to equalize eachankes and to regu
late and furnish a sound currency always and
every where of uniform value the protective
tariff was to give employment to american labor
at advance prices was to protect home industry
and furnish a steady market for tbe farmer in
ternal improvements were to bring trade into every
neighborhood and enhance tbe value of every
mans property the distribution of the land
money was to enrich tbe states finish tbeir pub
lic works plaot schools throngtout tbeir border

for every dollar taken out of tbe public treasury

effect of thi whole eyetem were to encourage
large and extravagant expenditures and thereby
la increase the public patronage and maintain n
rich and aplendidigovernment at the expense of n

it ie manifest that thiaacheiim of enlarged tax
ation and expenditures had it continued to pre
vail moot aoon have converted tha government
of the union intended by ita framers to be a
a plain cheap and aimpia confederation of sutes
united together for common protection and charg
ed with a few specific duties relating chiefly to
ear foreign affairs into a consolidated emp ire
depriving the states of their just power and con
trol in the adminiatratiou of their government in
this manner the whole form and character of the
government would be changed not by an amend
ment of the constitution but by resorting to an
nnwarrantable and unauthorized construction of
that inatrament
the indirect mode of levying the taxes by a
duty on imports preveuls the mass of the people
from readily perceiving the amount they pay
and has enabled the few who were thus en
riched and who reek to wield the political power
of the country to deceive and delude them
were the taxes collected by a direct levy upon
the people as in the case of theslates this could
not occur
tha whole system was resisted from ita incep
tion by many of our ablest statesmen some of
whom doubted its constitutionality and its expe
diency while others believed it was in all its
branches a flagrant and dangerous infract iou of
the constitution
that a national bank a protective tariff le
vied not to raise the reveune needed but for
protection merely internal improvements and
the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the
public lands are measures without the warrant
of the constitution would upou the maturet con
sideration seem to be clear it is remarkable
that no one of these measures involving such mo
mentuous consequences is authorized by an ex
press grant of power in the constitution no one
of them is incident to as being necessary and
proper for the execution of the specific powers
granted by the constitution the authority un
der which it has been attempted to justify each
of them is derived from inferences aud construc
tions of the constitution which it letter aud its
whole object aud design do not warrant
is it to be conceived that such immense
powers would have been left by the framers
of the coostituiion to mere inferences aud
doubtful constructions mad it been intended
to confer them ou the federal government it is
bnt reasonable to conclude that it would have
been doue by plain and unequivocal grants this
was not done but the whole structure of which
the american system consisted was reared on
no other or better foundation than forced implica
tions and inferences of power which its authors
assumed might be deduced by construction from
the constitution
but it haa been urged that the national bank
which constituted so essential a branch of this
combined system of measures was not a new
measure and that its conktilutionality had been
previously sanctioned because a bank had been
chartered in  and had received the official
signature of president washington a few facts
will show the just weight to which this precedent
should be entitled as bearing upon the question
of constitotfonalriy
great division of opinion upon the subject ex
isted in congress it is well known that presi
dent washington entertained serious doubts both
as to the constitutionality and expediency of the
measure and while the bill was before him for
his official approvalor disapproval so great were
his doubts that he required the opinion in wri
ting of the members of bis cabinet to aid him in
arriving at a decision his cabinet gave their
opinion and were divided upon the subjectgen
hamilton being in favor of and mr jefferson and
mr randolph being opposed to the constitutional
ity and expediency of a bank
it  well known also president washington retain
ed the hill from monday the fourteenth when it was
presented to him until friday the twentyfifth of feb
ruary being the last moment permitted him by the con
stitution th deliberate when he finally yielded to it his
reluctant assent and have it his signature it is certain
that as late as the twentythird of februarybeing the
ninth day after the bill was presented to himhe bad
arrived at no satisfactory conclusion for on that day
he addressed a note to gen hamilton ia which he in
torois him that this bill was presented to me by the
joint committee of congress   oclock on monday the
mlh inst and he requested his opinion to what pre
else period by legal interpretation of the constitution
can the president retain it in his possession before it
becomes a law by the lapse of ten days if the proper
construction was that the day on which the bill was
presented to the president and the day upon which his
action was had upon it were both to be counted incln
sive the if the time allowed him within which it would
be competent for him to return it to the honse in which

day the twentyfourth day of february gen hamit
ton on the same day returned an answer in which he
slates  give it as my opinion that you have ten days
exclusive of that on which the bill was delivered to yon

that he signed the bd thus all uding conclusive proof
that he had atlas obtained hit own consent to sign it
not without great and almost insuperable difficulty
additional light has been recently shed aipon
the serious doubts which he had upon the subject
amounting at one time to a conviction that it was

against the bill for incorporating a national bank
the bill being then before them
among the objections assigned in this paper to
the bill aad which wee submitted for the consid
eration of the president are the following
i object to the bill because it is aa easetitial
principle ot the government that power not dele
gated by the conoutuuoo cannot be rightfully exer
osrd because the power proposed by the bill to
h exercised ia not expreariy delegated and be
iause i cannot satisfy myself that it remits from an
express power by fair and sale rates of interpreta
tion

would restore public credit and aland relief to
tbejtovemmeut and ihe business of tbe country
lw of our public men who opposed the
whole american system at ns commence
merit and tlinxiftlioul iu progress foresaw and
predicted ilimt it was fraught with incalculably
miarhiefs and tnum result in serious injury to
the best interests af the country rot a senm
of years their wise counsels were unheeded and
tbe system was established it was soon appa
rent that its practical operation was unequal and
unjust upon diderent portions of the country and
upon the people engaged in dimereui pursuit
all ware squally entitled to the favor and pro
tection of the government it fostered and ele
vated the money power and enriched the favor
ed lew by tiling labor and at the expense ot
the many its effect was to make the rich
richer and tbe poor poorer it tendency was
to create distinctions in society based on wealth
and to give to the lavored classes utfdue control
and sway in ohr government it was an organ
ized money power which resisted the popular
will and songht to shape and control the public
policy
under the pernicious workings of this combin
ed system of measures the country witnessed al
ternate seasons of temporary apparent prosperity
of sudden and disastrous commercial revulsions
of unprecedented fluctuations of prices and de
pression of the gteat interests of agriculture nav
igation and commerce of general pecuniary suf
fering and of final bankruptcy of thousands af
ter a severe struggle of more than a quarter of a
century the system was overthrown
the bank has been succeeded by a practical sys
tem of finance coo ducted and controlled solely by
the government the constitutional currency has
been restored the public credit maintained unim
pared even in a period of foreign war and the
whole country has become satisfied that banks
national or state are not necessary as fiscal agents
of the government revenue duties have taken
the place of the protective tariff the dsiribu
tion of the money derived from the sale of public
lands has been abandoned and the corrupting sys
tem of internal improvements it is hoped has
been effectually checked
i entertain the solemn conviction that if the internal
improvement branch of tbe american ytem be not
firmly reunited at this lime the whole series of measures
composing it will oe speedily reestablished and the
country be thrown back from its present high state of
prosperity which the eiisiing policy has produced and
be destined again to witness all the evils commercial re
vnlustons depression of prices and pecuniary embarrs
ments through which we have passed daring the inst
 years
to guard against consequences so ruinous is an ob
ject of high national importance involving in my judge
ment the continued prosperity of the country
 have felt it to be an iinerative obligation to withhold
my constitutional sanction from two bills which had paw
ed the two houses of congress involving the p tnclple
of the internal improvement branch of the american
system and conflicting iu their provisions with the
view here expressed
it is not doubted that if this whole train of
measures designed to take wealth from the many
and bestow it upon th few were to prevail the
effect would be to change the entire character of
the government one only danger remains it
is the seduction of that branch of the system
which consists in internal improvements holding
out as it does inducements to the people of par
ticular sections and localities to embark the gov
ernment iu them without stopping to calculate the
inevitable consequences this branch of the sys
tem is so intimately combined and linked with the
others that as surely as an effect is produced by
an adequate cause if it be resuscitated and revived
and firmly established it requires no sagacity to
foresee that it will necessarily and speedily draw
after it the reestablishment of a national bank the
revival of a protective tariff the distribution of the
land money and not only the postponement to the
distant future of the payment of the present nation
al debt but its annual increase
the power conferred upon the presidency by
the constitutiont i have on three occasions during
my administtation of the executive department of
he government deemed it my duty to exercise
and on this last occasion of making to congress
an annual communication of the state of the
uuion it is not deemed inappropriate to review
the principles and considerations which have gov
erned my action i deem this the more necessa
ry because after this lapse of nearly sixty years
since the adoption of the constitution the propri
ety of the exercise of this undoubted constitution
al power by the president has for the first time
been drawn seriously in question by porition of
my fellowcitizens
the constitution provides that every bill
which shall have passed the house ef represen
tatives and the senate shall before it become a
law be presented to the president of the united
states if he approve he shall sign it but if not
he shall return it with his objections to that house
in which it shall have originated who shall enter
the objections at large on their journal and pro
ceed to reconsider it
the preservation of the constitution from in
fraction is the presidents highest duty he is
bound to discharge that duty at whatever hazard
of incurring the displeaaure of those who may dif
fer with him in opinion he is bound to discharge
it as well by his obligations to the people who
have clothed him with his exalted trust as by his
oath of office which he may not disregard nor
are the obligations of the president in any degree
lessened by the prevalence of views differing from
his own in one or both houses of congress it is
not alone hasty and inconsiderate legislation that
he is required to check but if at any time con
gress shall after apparently full deliberation re
solve on measures which he deems subxeroive of
the constitution or of the vital interests of tbe
country it is is solemn duty to stand in the breach
aud resist them the president is bound to ap
prove or disapprove every bill which passes con
gress and is presented to him for his signature
the constitution makes this his duty and he can
not escape it if he would he has no election
in deciding upon any bill presented to him he
must exercise his own best judgment if he can
not approve the constitution commands him to re
turn the bill to the house in which it originated
with his objections and if he fail to do so within
ten days sundays excepted it shall become a law
without his signature
right or wrong he may be overtiled by a vote
of twothirds of each house and in that event
the bill becomes a law without hie sanction if
his objections be net thus overruled the subjsct
is only postponed and is referred to tbe statee
and the people for their consideration and decision
tbe presidents power is negative merely and
not affirmative he can enact no law the only
effort thereforeof bia withholding his approval of a
bill passed by congress is to suffer tbe existing
laws to remain unchanged aud the delay occa
sioned is only rbat required to enable the states
ond tbe people to consider and act upon the seb
jeet in tbe election ef public agents who will car
ry out their wishes and inatructioua any at
tempt to coerce the president to yield bis sanction
to measures which he cannot approve would bo
a violation of the spirit of the eonstitatimi palpa
ble and flagrant and if succeaafol would break
down the independence of tbe executive depart
ment end make the president elected by the peo
pie aud clothed by the constitution with power to
defend their rights the mere instrument of a ma
jority ef cs agrees
a surrender en hs part of the powers with
which the coostitoliea has invested bis office
would effect a practical alteration of that instru
ment without restoring to tbe prescribed process
of amendment
with the motives or eensideratiena which may
induce congress to pass any bill tbe preaidsat
can have oothieg to do he amet presume them
to he ae pure as his own and look eoiy to the prac
ticable effect ef their eseaaores whew compared
with the eoaeuauoa or the public good
but i  has been urged by those who object to the
oxemse of this undoubted constitutional power
that it assails the representative principle and the
capacity ef the people to govern themselves that
these is greater safety in a numerous representa
tive body d m the am fie execethre created by
the eoastitnrieo and that the executive veto is a
one manpowerdespotic in he character te
expose the fallacy ef tins objection it is only ne
cessary to mnrijrr the frame and tree character of
our system ours is not a consolidated empire
but a confederated anioo the stales before the
adoption of the constnuiim were co ordinate co
equal and separate independent sovereignties and
by its adoption they did not lose that character
they clothed the federal government with certain
pwvi and reserved afl others mdadtag their

mioaaof tbe infirmities of tbeir lepreaenumre
and in delegating to them the power of legiota
tion bore fenced them around with check to
gmrd against the effect of booty action of error
qf combination and of possible corropuoo er
ror selfishness and faction bare often sought to
rend wonder this web of checks and subject the
government to tbe control of fanatic and sinister
mkoces but these efforts have only satisfied the
people of tbe wisdom of the checks which they
base imposed and of the necessity of preferring
them unimpaired
the true theory of oar system is not to govern
by the acts or decreet of any one set of representa
tives the constitution interposes checks upon
ail branches of the government in order to give
time for error to be corrected and delusion to
p away but if the people settle down into a
firm conviction different from that of their repre
sentatives they give effect to their own opinions
by changing their public servant the checks
which the people impose on their public servant
in the adoption of the consgintion are the best
evidence of their capacity for aelfgovemment
they know that the men whom they elect to
public stations are of like infirmaties and pass
ions with themselves and not to be trusted with
out being restricted by coordinate authorities and
constitutional limitations who that baa witness
ed the legislation of congress for the last thirty
years will say that he knows of no instance in
which measures not demanded by the public good
have been earned who will deny that in th
state governments by combinatione of individu
als and sections in derogation of the general
interest banks have jbeen chartered systems of
internal improueman adopted and debts entailed
upon tbe people repressing their growth and im
pairing tbeir euergies in years to come
after so much experience it cannot be said that
absolute unchecked power safe in the hands oi
any one set of representatives or that the capaci
ty of the people for self government which is ad
mitted in its broadest extent is a conclusive argu
ment to prove the prudence wisdom and integri
ty of their representatives
the people by the constitution have command
ed the president as much as they have command
ed the legislative branch of the government to ex
ecute their will they have said to him in the
constitution which they require he shall take a
solemn oath to support that if congress pass any
bill which he cannot approve he shall return it to
the house in which it originated with his objec
tions in withholding from it his approval and
signature he is executing the will of the people
constitutionally expressed as much as the con
gress ahat passed it no bill is presumed to be
in acdordance with the popular will until it shall
have passed through all the branches of the gov
ernment required by the constitution to make it a
law a bill which passes the house of repre
sentatives may be rejected by the senate ami so a
bill passed by the senate may be rejected by the
house in each case the respective houses exer
cise the veto power on the other
congress and each house of congress hold un
der the constitution a check upon the president
and he by the power ot the qualified veto a check
upon congress
when the president recommends measures tt
congress he avows in the most solemn form hii
opinions gives his voice in their favor and pie dg
es himself in advance to approve them if passet
by congress if he acts without due considers
tion or has been induced by improper or corrup
motivesor if from any other cause congress o
either house of congress shall differ with him ii
opinion they exercised their veto upon his recom
mendations and reject them and there is no ap
peal from their decision but to the people al th
ballot box these are proper checks upon th
executive wisely interposed by the constitution
none will be found to object to them or to wial
them removed it is equally important that th
constitutional checks of the executive  ion th
legislative branch should be preserved
if it be said that the representatives in the pop
ular branch of congress are chosen directly by the
people it is answered the people elect the presi
dent if both house represent the states and the
people so does the president the president rep
resents in the executive department the whole peo
ple of the united states as each member of the
egislative departmentrepresents a portion of them
the doctrine of restriction upon and
executive power while a well settled public opinion
is enabled within a reasonable time to accomplish
its ends has made our country what it is and has
opened to us a career of glory and happiness to
which all other nations have been strangers
in tne exercise of the power of tbe veto tbe president
is responsible not only to an enlightened public opinion
but to tbe people of tbe whole union who elected him
as tbe representatives in tbe legislative branches who
differ with him in opinion are responsible to the people
of particular states or districts who compose their re
spective constituencies to deny to tbe president the
exercise ot this power would be to repeal that provision
of the constitution which confers it upon him vo charge
that its exercise unduly controls the legislative will is to
complaint of tbe constitution itself
ii the presidential veto be objected to upon the
ground that it checks and thwarts the public will
upon the same principle the equality of represent
anon of the states in the senate should be strick
en out of the constitution the vote of a senator
from delaware lias equal weight in deciding upon
the most important measures with the vote of a
senator iroin newyotkl and yet die one repre
sents a state containing according to the existing
apportionment of representatives in the house of
representatives hut one thirtylourth part of the
population of tire other by tire constitutional
composition of the seuate a majority ol that hotly
from the smaller states represent less than one
lourth of the peopled the lnton there are thirty
states and under the existing uiqortionment
of representatives there are two hundred and
thirty members in the house of representatives
sixteen of the smaller slate are represented in
tbii house by but fifty members and yet the
senators from these states constitute a majority of
the senate so that the president may recom
mend a measure to congress and it may receive
the eeuctiou and approval of more than three
fourths of the house of representatives and of
all the senators from large atatee containing more
thin three fourths of the whole population of the
united states and yet the measure may be de
feated by the vote of the senators from the
smaller states none it is presumed can he
found ready to change the organization of the
senate on this account or to strike that body
practically out of existence by requiring that its
action shall be conformed to tbe wit of the more
numerous branch
upon the same principle that the veto of the
president should be practically abolished die
power of the vice president to give the casting
vote upon an equal division of the senate should
be abolished also the vice president exercises
the veto power effectuilly by rejecting a bill by
his casting vote aa the president does by refusing
to approve and tiga h this power has been ex
ercised by the vice president in a few instances
the mom important of which was tbe rejection of
the bill to recharter die bank of the united state
in  it may happen that a bill may be pann
ed by a large majority of the floase of repre
sentatives and may be supported by tbe senator
from the larger states and tbe vice president may
reject it by giving hie vote with the senator from
the smaller states and yet none it it presumed
are prepared to deny to inin the exercise of thw
power under the constitution
but it is ia point ot tact untrue that an act
poased by congress is conclusive evidence that h
lean emanation ot the popular wilt a majority
of tbe whole number elected to each house of
congrero constitutes a quorum ad a majority of
that quorum is competent to pass laws it might
happen that a quorum of the house of represen
tatives consisting of a single member more than
half of the whole number elected to that house
might pass a bill by a majority ofs stagle vote
sad in that ease a fraction more than onefourth
of the people of the united state would be rep
resented by those who voted for it it might hap
pen that the same bill might be turned by a ma
jority of one of a quorum of the senate com
posed of senators from the filteen smaller states
and a angle senator from a sixteenth slatand if
the senators voting for it happened to be from the
eight of the smallest of these states it would be
pissed by the vote of senator from states hav
ing but fourteen representative in the house of
representatives and coo taming less than one
mxteenth of the whole population of the u states
this extreme case is stated to illostrato the
font that the mere passage of a ml by congress
no conclusive evidence that thorn who passed
it represent the majority of the people of the u
states or truly reflect their will if snob on eg
uomn earn is set likely to beppn eases that ap

out must lead to thie rsmt
one great object of the constitution in confer
ring upon tho president a qualified negative upon
the legislation of conor was to protact minor
ities from injustice and oppression by majorit
the equality of their rapreee elation in the sen
ate and the veto power of the prceident are the
constitmional guarantiee which the smaller stats
have that their rights will ha respected with
out these guarantiee all their interests would be
at tho mercy of majorities in congress represent
ing the larger states to tbe smaller and weak
er states therefore the prrvatiou of this pow
er and its exercises upon proper occasions de
manding it is of vital importance they ratified
i tho constitution and catered into tho uuioo se
curing to themselves an equal representation with
the larger stales in the sonata and they agreed
to be bound by all laws passed by con grass upon
the express condition and none other that they
should be approved by tby president or paeaed
his objectiou to the contrary notwithstanding
i by a vole of two thirds of both houses upon
this condition tbay have a right to insist as a par
of the compart to which they gave their assent
a bill might be passed by congress against the
will of the whole people of a particular state and
against the votes of its senators and all iu rep
resentatives however prejudicial it might be to
the iutereets of such state it would be bound by
it if the president shall approve it or it should be
passed by a vote of two thirds of both house but
it has a right to demand that tho president shall
exercise his constitutional power and arreet it if
i his judgment is against it if he surrenders this
power or fail to exercise it in a case where ho
cannot approve it would make his formal appro
val a mere mockery and would be itself a viola
i lion of the constitution and the dissenting stats
would becoins bound by a law which had uot beeu
i passed according to the sanction of the constilit
tiou
the objection to the exercise of the veto power
a founded upon an idea respecting the popular
i will which if carried out would annihilate
state sovereignty and substitute for the present
ij federal government a consolidation directed by a
supposed numerical majority a revolution of
l the government would be silently affected and
the slates would be subjected to laws to which
i they had never given their constitutional consent
the supreme court of the united states is io
vested with the power to declare and has de
dared acts of congress passed with the concur
i rence of the senate the house of represents
lives and the approval of the president to be
i unconstitutional and void and yet none it is
presumed can be found whr will be disposed to
strip this highest judicial tribunal under the con
stitution of this acknowledged powera power
necessary alike to its independence and the rights
of individuals
for the same reasons that the executive veto
should according to tbe doctrine maintained be
rendered nugatory aud be practically expunged
from the constitution this power of the court
should also be rendered nugatory sad be sxeuug
ed because it restrains the legislative and execo
live will and because the exercise of such a raw
er by the court may be regarded as being in con
flict with capacity of the people to govern them
j selves indeed there is more reason for striking
this power of the court from the constitution thau
there ia that of the qualified veto of the president
because the decision of the court ia finaland can
never be reversed even though both houses of
congress and tbe preeident should be unauimoos
ia opposition to it whereas the veto of the presi
dent may be over ruled by a vote of twothirds
of both houses of coogr or by the people at
the polls
it is obvious that to preserve the system established by
the coditiluuoo each of the coordinate branches ol tbs
governmenthe executive legislative and judicial
must be left in the exercise of hs appropriate powers if
the executive or the judicial breach be deprived of po
ers conferred upon either aa checks on the leglsuilvs
tho preponderance of ihe latter will become npropr
tionate and absormns and the others impotent for tire
accomplishment of the great objects for which they wen
established organised as they are by the constitution
they work together harmoniously for the public good it
ihe executive and the judiciary shall be deprivedof iba
constitutional powers invested in them and of their dus
proportions the equilibrium of the system must be det
troyed and consolidation with the moot pernicious is
suits must enauaa consolidation of unchecked des
potic power exercised by majorities of the legislates
branch
the executive legislative and judicial each
coustitutea a separate coordinate department ol
thi government and each ia independent of the
others in the performance of their raptrlivi
duties under the constitution neither can in it
legitimate action control the others they each
act upon their several responsibilities in their res
pective spheres but if the doctrines now maintain
ed be correct the executive must become practi
cally subordinate to the legislative and the judi
ciary must become subordinate to both the legis
lative and the executive and thus the whole
power of tbe government would bo merged in s
single department whenever if ever this shall
occur our glorious system of wellregulated self
government will crumble into ruinsto be sue
ceedeti first by anarchy and finally by mouarchy
or despotism lam far from believing that the

which it will be my duy to administer the execo
