selections
from the christian contributor
meeting at the tabernacle
we gave a brief notice last week of
a meeting held recently in new york
for the purpose of redeeming two girls
from slavery the season is described
as of surpassing interest let us con
tract this meeting with the scenes of
fifteen years ago and thank god for
the progress of truth and pray and
labor more zealously and cheerfully
than ever powerful speeches were
made on the occasion one of which we
give preceded by a few remarks from
the true wesleyan
it appeared that the father is a man
of good character and that the two
daughters about to be sold are virtuous
and devoted members of the m e
church it also apppared from corre
spondence read that the girls were
about to lie sold bemd all doubt for
prostitution and that two thousand two
hundred and liftytwo dollars is the
least sum for which they can be re
deemed dr peck having concluded
his history of the case rev h w
reecher was introduced to the audience
and spoke as follows
i a dies and gentlemen
although i am not wont to feel
embarrassed from facing a large as
sembly  must ireely contess that i
have approached this meeting with a
great deal of shrinking in my voca
tion as a preacher of the gospel i have
sometimes felt that i could preach best
from a poor text there are some
texts too great for me they are so
clear so great with meaning and so
sublime and so far transcend any ser
in m i could build upon them that i
dare not preach from them they are
each a sermon in themselves so great
that i dare not place one of my ser
mons in contract with them so i feel
tonight that  have got a text that fair
ly overmasters me if i had to con
struct an argument against slavery i
could do it fearlessly and perhaps
well if  were to delineate its cor
ruptions and corrupting influences upon
the community i could do it and not
falter rut it is a simple matter of fact
l have to present we have not come
here tonight to make a general assault
upon slavery though we must allude to
it we have not come here to discuss
the general question of slavery now
everywhere to be discussed great
applause whatever we may believe
in relation to the general subject of sla
very whether a or r should be free i
have this confidence of heart that we
shall all be of one mind in relation to
the tact which has called us together
tonight it is a plain question of hu
manity and will admit of hut one an
swer i am aware that there may he
objections in some ot your mindsob
jcctions which you may he ashamed to
uiler lest ou should he thought want
ing in the common sympathies of hu
manity let me then state them tor
you arid endeavor to remove them
these girls attempted to escape tvom
bondage they were on hoard that ill
fated vessel the pearl on which they
with others attempted to escape h
was overtaken and they carried buck
i know that the idea of crime m
eiuted in the minds of some with an
attempt to escape from slavery the
israelites attempted to escape from
bondage and when they were pursued
by their oppressors and held in on both
fe ds by the mountains with the red
a before them god hade them go
forward and parted the waters before
them when these poor girls attempt j
ed to escape there was no hand of god
the north star
to guide them or to defend them and
tbev were taken and returned into the
bosom of slavery this attempt on
their part to escape instead of being an
objection is what wakes up my sympa
thies for them and makes roe desire to
relieve them suppose i were told that
these girls were willing to stay where
they arethat they preferred to be
slaves and were contented and happy
in their house of bondage and had no
desire to leave it i would not contri
bute one cent to purchase them but
when i am informed of their attempt to
escape and see them willing to peril
their all for liberty i say they are not
slaves only in name applause i
fear not to submit the case to you for
decision if you will only make it your
own i come home to you with the
question venerable old man young
man maiden suppose that you were a
slave i ask if you could by any logic
frame an argument strong enough to
satisfy you that you ought not to try to
escape would not the love of liberty
bum in your heart and would not
visions of freedom occupy your thoughts
by day and fill your dreams at night
would not a ceaseless vigilance attend
you ever watchful ever watching un
til the longed for chance to escape
should present itself and would you not
hazard your all on the first chance
however slight and attempt to seize
the priceless boon suppose that 
had a son he adventures the sea is
wrecked enslaved suppose that i
hear from him that he pines in his
chains that he is sick at heart that his
choeks become hollow with grief that
life is a burden oh then with my
fathers feelings shall i not bewail his
captivity shall i not suffer even more
than he but suppose that some one
should inform me that he was contended
and happy that he grew fat upon it
that he said he had less work to do
there than at home with plenty to eat
and drink what should las a father
say i should exclaim he is not my
son he was changed in his cradle
great applause if he were my son
instead of being contented in his bond
age he would resolve to be free or die
in the attempt this is not only ame
rican it is human and when a man has
fallen below this he has sunk so low
that he has no right to me great and
longcontinued applause
there is one other point and that is
the price asked for these girls alas
i could wish it less for their sakes
but when it is achieved for your sake
shall thank god it was so much i
should be ashamed if it were written
lown that such an assembly was gath
red here of more than two thousand
oids and that an appeal was here
nade in such behalf to deliver chris
ian girls from worse than heathen
bondage and that the poor pittance of
 could not be raised the man
that would fear such a result must be
craven
but there remains still another ob
jection to be answered suppose that
all this could be done and that this sum
were raised and paid over will there be
no end to such solicitations although
we may have generous sympathies
ought we not to act on some principle j
are we of the north to undertake toj
buy all the slaves that they of the south
may choose to put in the market this
is in truth a question worth considering
and we ought to consider it i am
perfectly agreed with you that we canj
not become purchasers of slaves as a
general practice the money is not to
be had it does not exist in all the
coffers of the north for such a purpose j
for so long as purchasers are found i
men will not be wanting to put up their
fellowmen to the highest bidder j
therefore in respect to the general
principle it cannot be asserted nor
acted on and if this were not a spe
cial case i would not plead it but i
do not remember another case in all
points like this nor do i suppose it will
often happen that it will find a parallel
a sale by human flesh dealers of chris
tian girls i love to repeat that epithet
christian girls the edmonson
girls does very well but christian
girls christian slaves it seemed
to me as i first uttered these words as
if i could hear a scoffing jeering fiend
of hell echo them with a grin of de
rision
besides this there is something else
to be observed it helps to give one
a deeper insight into the system of sla
very itself many a man contemplates
it merely as a particular form of work
enforced by certain appeals to occa
sional severity you think at most of
the brawny arms bared to the lash
vou think of so much work and of so
much food this is the mere shell
the rough bark of slaverythe outer
wall on the dingy side of which the sun
may shine and give it a sort of sombre
glory you may say they are happy
and contented you may say as i once
heard one say they are happy as my
hogs are still you have only the outside
of slavery but that which marks this i
system in the eye of heaven and in the
eye of refined humanity as the very
outbirlh of hell appears when it comes
to deal with hearts and souls and un
derstandings it is not the galling of
the w rist nor the ancle which moves the
deepest current of human sympathy
but that of the soul
i will now coine to the case as it pre
sents itself to us and now i say that
 cannot conceive of anything more
difficult to render into speech than the
emotions which it arouses it seems to
me sometimes aa now there were no
words to express intense emotionas if
all words were spirits which hover
around one and mock his desire to
speak  feel thus whenever l would
express the interior of slavery
fellowcitixens do you know that all
that goes to make a man except his
right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren
deathless love of liberty goes to make
him a better slave the strength of
limb the roundness of muscle mind
tender affection sympathy all this is so
much fat laid upon the limbs of slavery
here at the north to be of comely
presence is considered a blessing there
at the south sew much money is made
of it in the market a slave will bring
all the more for being such a finelook
ing man i droop to think what an
abominable use is made of such a re
commendation if the slave chances to
be a woman she will sell much higher
on the stand because she is handsome
that which excites among us the pro
foundest respect goes there to aug
ment her valuenot as a wife not as a
sister but for purposes from the bare
idea of which the virtuous soul revolts
in the slavegirl beauty refinement is
not matter of respect but profit and
suppose you add thrift skill intelli
gence here at the north we take
all this as so much added to the man
but there the more there is of thrift of
skill of intelligence of enterprise the
higher their price in the market and
then if in addition to all he is only
docile if he will be a planning ma
chine and not a runningaway machine
he is the very perfection of a slave
there are great advantages in slavery
but nimble legs are a great drawback
upon its profitableness it is unlike
other property in this respect you
may place a bale of cotton or a box of
sugar upon the wharf you will find
them there the next morning but
slaves are not always found where they
are left a slave has all these excel
lent properties and no love of liberty
is there nothing else to be desired
yes there is what is it what else
can you desire when you bring him
on the stand he goes up to oo you
describe his physical perfection he
touches  he is intelligent skil
ful docilehe goes up to oo then
add he is a pious member of the me
thodist episcopal church in good and
regular standing and boo is bid
tremendous excitement in the audi
ence can i describe this scene and
not feel as a man i like to hear this
music it makes me think that i am
talking to men
i will not detain you much longer
but to come to that which i spoke of
and which i promised to return to
though i am among methodistsno i
am nothere the speaker pointed to
a venerable methodist brother and ex
claimed he is not a methodist tonight
he is a man i know no names of
baptist methodist or presbyterian i
know men and christians that is all
that i know and now letus suppose
that wo apply in this case the rule that
christ gave us do unto others as
you would that others should do to you
there are fathers in this housewhat
would you wish done were your own
daughters slaves i saw this old man
the father of these girls i was not
ashamed to look at him because he was
black his seemed to me just as good
grief as any other and it struck me
that if he was black he seemei after
all to act very naturally for a distressed
father
and now please to imagine your
daughters or sisters in bondage sup
pose them so comely that no price less
than three thousend dollars would pur
chase them suppose all this and act
as you would act then
now but one word more and i
will close and that is this color
makes no difference in bereavements
the poor when they are bereaved are
bereaved indeed we have a thousand
sources to which we can turn to ward
ot the keen edge of affliction from the
most vital parts but imagine the
poor man who has but one only child
that loved child that always runs out
to meet him after the weary days toil
and greets his return to his humble
home death comes and takes that
child away and lays it in the grave
it was the breath of his life the life of
his heart his very soul the boor
have no other heritage but their affec
tions and when you invade that very
sanctuary of feeling the poorer they
are the worse for them what have
they left look at this poor old man
his sons are long ago sold as slaves to
labor on southern plantations his
daughters unless we can do something
to detain them must go too to a worse
fate but i trust in god and  trust in
you that it shall not be heard from new
york that an appeal like this was not
made in vain and that you will make it
heard that these girls must not shall
not be slavesthat they shall be free

the working of emancipation
in jamaica
the great british emancipation act
which on the first of august  con
verted  west india slaves into
free men was a new era in the history
of human freedom and its results have
been watched with intense interest
from both sides of the atlantic differ
ent representations have been made
according to the different opportunities
which writers on this subject have had
for forming a correct judgment no
where have we seen statements which
seemed more candid discriminating and
intelligent than in the october number
of the new euglander hie write
rev c s renshaw we suppose
speaks from extended personal observa
tion having resided some time in ja
maica as a missionary he confines
his attention to this island as giving
the most full and fair view of the work
ing of emancipation
jamaica be states is about 
square miles in extent or about as urge
i as the state of massachusetts and has
i a population of about half a million
i this population is divided into three
classes viz white brown and blackj
rochester n y friday november  ijb
the brown men gradually rose if
wealth and influence and after a se
vere struggle obtained for themselves
equal rights eight years before the
emancipation of the blacks
the progress of this class has been
very rapid immediately after theii
enfranchisement two of their numbei
were returned to the local legislature
and others have been added at each
successive election until about one
third of the whole representation is by
colored members
the condition of the emancipated
blacks their domestic habits improve
ments c are matters of special in
terest and of these the writer thus
speaks
the whole rural population have
homes for the most pirt they live
in the same places and perhaps in
the same huts in which slavery left
them these are very low small rude
tenements of from ten feet square divi
ded into two rooms to fourteen feet by
twentyfour divided into three or four
the posts of the house are fastened into
the earth which is slightly raised and
beaten hard for a floor the sides are
made of bamboo cut and split to the
sizeoflaths which is daubed or plas
tered with mud on one side or both
and rubbed till smooth and hard and
by successive rubbings and filling up
the cracks this process makes a neat
wall the roof is thatched with long
grass or with the leaves of the cocoa
nut tree it is often afoot thick reach
ing nearly down to the ground the
under surface is smoked to a glossy
black to protect it from the vermin
with which the island abounds
many thousand huts have been built
since the emancipation and they are
uniformly better than the slave huts
higher larger better ventilated a
few are boarded up more are shingled
and manv are floored all manifest an
improved taste style and manner of
living about twenty thousand of the
peasantry have become freeholders
not only have the people homesthey
have the means of a comfortable sub
sistence every man and woman and
halfgrown child has a provision ground
in which they cultivate yams cocoas
a root somewhat resembling a beet
but of a much finer firmer texture
plantains sugar cane cassada coffee
corn beans c c which they sell
or barter for bread biscuit butter su
gar cheese lard fish meats soap
candles c
much has been done in a religious
way for the elevation of the freed men
the number and denominations of mis
sionaries in jamaica is thus stated by
our author
since the decree of emancipation
the missionary bodies of england have
vied with each other in their efforts for
the moral elevation of the freed men
in  there were perhaps fortyfive
ministers of religion in jamaica some
of these were state paid hirelingssev
enteen were dissenting missionaries
in  there were nearly one hundred
ministers fortyfour of whom were dis
senters there are now not less than
two hundred and ten ministers of whom
about one hundred are of the establish
ed churches of england and scotland
thirty are wesleyans twentysix bap
tists sixteen presbyterians thirteen
independents fifteen moravians five
wesleyan newconnexion four
american congregationalists besides
these there are three jews five cath
olics twentyfive native baptists
there is a large amount of other in
formation in the article before us which
goes entirely to set aside the objections
which have been urged against the
working of emancipation and to show
the benefits which have resulted to all
classes and are still to result in an in
creasing degree from the opening of
prison doors to so many thousands
we have room however to add only
the following conclusion to which the
author is brought by his close observa
tion and inquiry
the question is often asked what
will be the influence of the present em
barrassments upon the future historyof
jamaica can the island recover
from them
we may hazard an opinion that its
future history will be its most fruitful
most peaceful and most happy the
estates must pass from the absentees
who now hold them for a mere moiety of
their estimated value under the colonial
system when they enjoyed the monopo
ly of the euglish market and come in
to the possession of thrifty resident pro
prietors who will manage them without
the intervention of attorneys and over
seers the enormous governmental
expenditure and weight of taxation will
be greatly reduced by the action of the
rising yeomanry at the ballotbox or
hustings competition will reduce the
price of living and the thrift and econo
my that have already been induced by
the spirit of freedom will rid the island
of its greatest curse the recklessness
and extravagance of slavery
franklins petition for the
abolition of slavery
the following memorial of the penn
sylvania society for promoting the
abolition of slavery the relief ol
free negroes unlawfully held in bond
age and the improvement of the condi
tion of the african race was presented
and read
the report respectfully sbowetb
that from a regard for the happiness
of mankind an association was formed
several years since in this state by a
number of citizens of various religious
denominations for the promotion ofthe i
abolition of shivery ami for the relief
of those unlawfully held in bondagel
a just and acute conception of the true
principles of liberty as it spread thro
the land produced accessions to their
numbers many friends of their causej
and a legislative cooperation with their
views which by the blessings of divine
providence have been successfully di
rected to the relieving from bondage a
large number of the african race
they have also the satisfaction to ob
serve that in consequence of that spirit
of philanthropy and genuine liberty
which is generally dimising its benefi
cial influence similar institutions are
forming at home and abroad
that mankind are all formed by
the same almighty being alike objects
of his care and equally designed for
the enjoyment of happiness the chris
tian religion teaches us to believe and
the political creed of americans fully
coincides with the positions your
memorialists particularly tnggh ia
attending to the distresses arising from
slavery believe il their indispensable
duty topresent this subject to your no
tice they have observed with real
satisfaction that important and salutary
powers are vested in you for promot
ing the welfare and securing the bless
ings of liberty to the people of the
united states and as they conceive
that those blessings ought rightfully to
be administered without distinction of
color to all descriptions of people so
they indulge themselves in the pleasing
expectation that nothing which can he
done for the relief of the unhappy ob
jects of their care will be either omit
ted or delayed
from a persuasion that equal lib
erty was originally the portion and is
still the birthright of all men and in
fluenced by the strong ties of humanity
and the principles of their institution
your memorialists conceive themselves
bound to use all justifiable endeavors to
loosen the bands of slavery and pro
mote a genera enjoyment of the bless
ings of freedom under these impres
sions they earnestly entreat your seri
ous attention to the subject of slavery
that you will be pleased to countenance
the restoration of liberty to these un
happy men who alone in this land of
freedom are degraded into perpetual
bondage and who amidst the general
joy of surrounding freemen are groan j
ing in servile subjection that you will
devise means for removing this incon
sistency from the character of the ame
rican people that you will promote
mercy and justice towards this distress
ed race and that you will step to the
very verge of the power vested in you
for discouraging every species of traffic
in the persons of our fellowmen

slavtbadinti in georgia
a correspondent of the independ
ent democrat writing from atalanta
georgia says
when i came to this place from
savannah i stopped at a foggy little
town built on the south carolina side
of the savannah river called hamburg
notorious as a human market the
state of georgia prohibits the intro
duction of slaves into the state for sale
and the consequence is hamburg was
built up just opposite augusta for the
purpose of furnishing slaves to the
planters of georgia augusta is the
market to which the planters of upper
and middle georgia bringtheir cotton
and if they want to purchase negroes
they step over into hamburg and do j
so there are two large houses there
with piazzas in front to expose the
chattels to the public during the day
and yards in the rear of them where
they are penned up at night like sheep
so close that they can hardly breathe
with bulldogs on the outside as senti
nels they sometimes have thousands
here for sale who in consequence of
their number suffer most horribly
while at hamburg i saw a
drove of these human cattle pass
ing along through the street towards
the markethouses they had been
brought up in the country and were
destined for texasthat democratic
addition to the area of freedom
they were brought to this place to ship
on board of the cars for mobile it
was the most sickly sight i ever wit
nessed and god kuows i have seen
things often before that vmre enough to
soften a heart of adamant many of
them were youngmere boys and girls
and had travelled barefoot over the
sharp burning sands of south caro
lina until their feet were literally cut
to pieces leaving blood at almost every
step they took added to this was the
lash of their cruel drivers the gnaw
ings of hunger and other hardships
usually experienced in such a tramp
which had made them the most misera
ble looking objects i ever saw one
beautiful young creature who would in
the land of freedom pass for a while
person was among the number she
observed me gazing with attention upon
her and undoubtedly thought that 
wanted to purchase and clasping her
hands and fixing her tearful eyes upon
me with a look of the utmost supplica
tion she said fer the love of god
massa do buy me i good cook nurse
ironer washercheap at eight hundred
dollars do buy me i afterwards
learned that they asked eight hundred
dollars for her which was probably on
account of her being white i think
it would have been a deed of charity to 
have bought her even to make a slave
of to have redeemed her from the
haryfa of such monsters as these negro
traders usually are  never felt the
misfortune of being poor so keenly as 
did at that moment all of them ap
peared anxious to be sold and when a
purchase was made of one of them he
appeared to be pleased at his prospects
while the rest seemed to envy himl
many of them whites sad mulattees
are intended for the brothels of new
orleans aad mobile where a girl
from sixteen to twenty years of igt
will bring from one to two thousand
dollars m i
vvhen i left hamburg for this
place there were lift or sixty of these
wretched creatures in the same train
of cars going on towards the south
west probably to the lone star
they were huddled into an old box
car without seats or any accommoda
tions whatever and fastened in so that
none might escape at the stopping
places or throw themselves out of the
cars and destroy their lives in a fit of
desperation such things occur often
when not properly guarded against
sometimes they will even starve them
selves to death to escape the tortures
of this barbarous system
the moon the moon when close
ly examined by powerful telescopes
has the aspect of a dislocated and
shattered world and that part of the
terrestial globe from which darwen
supposes it to have been projected
abounds more than any part with tre
mendous volcanoes and has even of
comparatively late years been subject
to the action of earthquakes which
have raised considerably above any
level its more extensive line of coast
the condition of the moon has been
completely laid open to us by the tele
scope of lord kosse which renders
perfectly visible every object of the
height of a hundred feet edifices
therefore of the size of york minster
says dr scoresbv or even the ruins
of whitby abbey might be easily
perceived if they existed but there is
no appearance of that nature neither
is there any indication of water or an
atmosphere there is a vast number
of extinct volcanoes several miles in
breadth through one oi them there is
a line in continuance of about one hun
dred and fifty miles in length which
runs in a straight direction like a rail
way the general appearance how
ever is like one vast ruin of nature
and many pieces of rock driven out of
the volcanoes appear to be laid at va
rious distances rocks and masses of
stone are almost innumerable from
these circumstances and especially
from the want of an atmosphere it
seems impossible that any form of life
analogous to those on earth could sub
sist there but on the supposition that
the mo n has inhabitants the earth
must present to them the appearance of
an immense moon but almost immova
bly fixed in their sky while the stars
must seem to pass slowly beside and
behind it our earth to them will ap
pear clouded with variable spots and
belted with equatorial and tropical
zones corresponding with trade
winds and it may be doubted whether
in the perpetual change ot these the
outlines of our continents and seas could
ever be clearly discerned wonders of
astronomy
robberv iv london during the
reign of george i robbery was carried
on upon a fearful scale in the streets of
london even by daylight house
breaking was of frequent occurrence
by night and every road leading to the
metropolis was beset by bauds of reck

predations into the very heart of the
town respectable women could not
venture in the streets alone after night
fall even in the city without risk of
being grossly outraged in the begin
ning of  we learn from the pa
pers that ladies of condition when
they out in their chairs at
night to the court end of the town
were often attended by servants with
loaded blunderbusses to shoot at the

highwaymen about london struck ev

could go about strongly guarded a
poor rnan was stripped of his pence

having robbed a laborer of i  d the i

at night with so little money in his
pocket on the d of january a pro
clamation came out offering a reward
of xlut in addition to the previous in
ducements for the capture of any
waytnan within five miles of london
the main effect of which was to place
considerable sums of money in the
pockets of the notorious jonathan
wild who secuied several offenders in

space of two or three weeks of these

indian corn in england the
european news says mr h cand
sdell a scientific american agricul
turist has arrived here from wisconsin
where he has been making many ex
periments with numerous varieties of
indian corn in a climate the mean
temperature of which during the sum
mer months varies vere little from that
of england in the hope of being
able to raise a crop here he has brought
over one hundred varieties and prince
albert has given permission for the va
rious experiments to be made on his
doinain at windsor mr cansdell says
admitting the grain should become ac
climated it will be possible lor a poor
man to raise on one rood of land from
fifteen to twenty bushels of corn in
addition to and without in any way
interfering with his ordinary growth of
potatoes cabbages or beans beside
finding nearly enough fodder to keep
a cow in winter mr candsdell also
says the usual plan of the farmers in
america is to plant an under crop of
saccharine pumpkin of which twenty
tons an acre is frequently raised in
adition to the usual crop of maize and
which is considered to contain a larger
amount of fattening matter than either
swedes or mangold worzel should
the issue of the experiments be success
tul it will be of incalculable benefit to
farmers and the laboring classes in
england and particularly in ireland
and will be the greatest agricultural
achievement since the introduction of

in the supreme courtul tennessee in 
there came up for adjudication the f
case to wu frederck of
ton of the o carolina line with hit
master roneil eoliated and fought througf
ne war of the revolution it seems that m
the bth day of august  as frederick
name was found on the muster rji a warrant
was issued giving him the molniers bounty
of  acres of land the question belorc
the court was whether that thousand acre
of land hjlonged to ftedeuck or bia master
the decision of judge catron it in these
words fiederick the slave of col pat
ton earned this warrant by bta services m th
continental line what it earned by th
slave belongs to the master by the commor
law the civil law and the recognized rule
of property in the slavebolding states of thu
inion of course the land went not u
frederick but to the heirs of col patton
to the fanatical thia seems to be i
tather hard case but then frederick was i
black inan and a slave and as that class o
person are supposed to possess no right to rut
away from slavery to liberty i suppose h
had no right to fight for liberty at any rate
i presume the decision of judge catron ac
cording to the slave code is correct
the law allows it and the court award it

the purpose of calling public attention ti

slavery at war with the interests of
the free laboring classes an english
correspondent of the liberator says and
truly
the real object of slavery is to depress
the wages of the working classes to with
hold from the working community white or
black the just rights of laborto deprive the
workman of the money to which his labor
entitles him and the possession of which
would enable him to spend it in the necessaries
or comforts of life and also contribute his
hare to the national and local taxation and
to the national circulation of wealth
and what are the advantages of slavery
that the slave owner may retain in his own
pocket the honest earnings of the working
people depriving the nation of its circulation
interfering with the just rights of labor by
generally depiessing the price of it and by
extorting from the workman at the cost of a
few cents only the labor which really des
erves a dollar or upwards sacrificing the
national interest the national character with
foreign countries the national consistency
and the national honesty all for the private
interest of the slaveowner alone

and fraud upon the rights of the laborers is

boston nov  
my dias readers although i have
heen absent from rochester during three is
sues of the north star thia  presume will
be the first intimation given of the fact the
cznty editorial matter which i have tent to
hf papr for the past two weeka has been
written on the wing aod in the mute of paas
ing engagement you will sympathize with
me w hen i tell you that i find it neccaaary to
go abroad in person to secure the number of
subscribers requisite to the support of our pa
per this ought not to be and would not be
the case if suitable agents could be obtained
who would enforce the claims of the paper
upon the public and secure subscribers aod
subscriptions for it but theae we have not
and in consequence find it necessary to go forth
myself i regret this only on one account
and that is it deprives me of the time and
means of making the paper what i desire
and w hat it ought to be this difficulty i
hope will not much longer exist i hope
soon to be able to say that the north star is
on a firm foundation with a living subscrip
tion list there is one advantage in being
i compelled to travel thas it affords me many
opportunities to plead the cause with the
tongue as well as the pen and keep alive a
wider interest than the paper alone could pos
sibly create i found some difficulty in get
ting up meetings in this state during the ex
citing canvass just closed and have had many
opportunities of attending political meetings
especially those of the free soil party i
attended one of these last night in faneuil
hall and heard speeches by charles francis
adams amos walker and richard h
i dana the latter is the author of the fa
mous book entitled two years before the
mast he is small of suture but large in
intellect and made a speech last night of
great power and clearness his subject was
robert c wmthrop and so far as i could see
he did that subject ample justice he showed
that mr winthrop w as but a bind of the slave
power was an untrustworthy person on the
subject of slavery and that through his means
more than any other mr websters claims
in the philadelphia convention were slighted
and general taylors nomination accomplish
ed he proved clearly that winthrops rea
son for epposiug the adoption of a resolution
embracing the wilmol pioviso in the great
w log convention of massachusetts was not
as he hal said frum a fear of injuring daniel
websters claims to a nomination by the
whig national convention but a fear of
committing the state against the nomination
ot zachary taylor it w as easy to see after
listenii g to the candid epetch of mr dana
that a more compromisive creature than mr
wimhrop dots not breathe the whigs
made a great hue and cry against mr palfrey
because he refuted to vote lot ills tool of the
slave power but i think uo candid person
howmuchsovet of a partisan would have
found fault with mr palfrey could he have
known the course of mr wmthrop as it was
exposed last night by mr dana the
speech of mr walker was able and inter
esting the old cotton whigs of this state
are very much annoyed by the free soil vote
and the defeat to which that vote subjected
them winthrop bad already in the con
sciousness of strength peculiar to him pre
dicted that general taylor was able teflput
down disunion whether it come in the
shape of free soil at the north or free trade
at the south this hint at the interference
with the freedom of speech by the national
government was turned with good effect by
mr dana
since i left home i have spoken in spring
field lynn and new bedford mass i am
to speak in lowell tomorrow and sunday
and next week i shall attend the annual
meeting of the rhode island antislavery
society the cause of the slave is evidently
onward but it will require great vigilance and
devotion to principle to prevent the cause from
falling into the hands f compromisers who
nay do more harm than open opponents the
true and invulnerable ground for this cause is
an entire separation from this bloodstained
union our free soil friends are hampered
at every step by this very union and consti
tution and will sooner or later have to yield
to the slave power or go for a dissolution of
this unhallowed union

to make your innocence apparent yon havt
now had a fair opportunity tbe issue
i freedom or slavery hat been clearly aobmiuet
to you and you have deliberately chaser
slavery
general taylor and general cass were th
chosen and admitted southern and slavery
candidates for the presidency martin van
buren though far from being an abolitionist
yet in some sort represented the antislavery
idea of the north in a political formhim
you have rejected and elected a slaveholdei
to rule over you in his stead when the
j question was whether new mexico and cali
j forma shall be free or slave states you have
rejected him who was solemnly pledged tc
maintain their freedom and have chooen a
man whom you knew to be pledged by hie
 position to the maintenance of slavery by
your votes yon have said that slavery is bet
ter than freedom that war is better than
peace aad that cruelty is better than human
ity you have given your sanctum to slave
rule and slavery propagandistn and inter
posed whatever of moral character and stand
ing you possess to shield the reputation ol
slaveholders generally yon have said thai
to be a man stealer is mo crimeto traffic in
human flesh shall be a passport rather than a
barrier to your suffrages to slaveholders
you have said chain up your men anc
women and before the bloody lash drive them
to new fields of toil in california and new
mexico to the slave in his chains you have
said be content in your chains and if you
dare to gain your freedom by force whethei
in new mexico or california in numbers in
dicated by our votes our muskets shall find
you out in a word you have again renewed
your determination to support the constitu
tion of the united states in its parts of free
dom to the whiles and slavery to the blacks
if general taylors slaves run away you
have promised again to return them to bond
age while general taylor is the well
known robher of three hundred human beings
of all their hard earnings and is coining their
hard earnings into gold you have confpired
upon him an office worth twentyfive thousand
dollars a year and the highest honor uithii
your power by this a t you have endorsed

said that the most available and suuatile per
son in all this great nation to preside over
his model republic is warrior slave
holder swearer and bloodhound importer
during the campaign just ended your leaders
have dubbed this manstealer as an honest
man and many uf you have shouted over tbe
lik as being a truth thus destroying ali
moral distinctions to talk of a veracious
liar a pious blasphemer a righteous robber
a candid hypocrite a sober drunkard or a
humane cannibal would be quite as just and
rational as to call an admitted manstealer an
honest man yet in the wildness of a wicked
enthusiasm you have given your countenance
and support to this
now is it too much to say that you have
made his crimes your ffwn and that the blood
of the slave is on your garments you have
covered his theft with honesty his blasphemy
with piety and as far as in your power you
have rendered the blows intended to destroy
slavery nugatory and innoxious before high
heaven and the woild you are responsible for
the blood of the slave you may shut your
eyes to the fact sport over it sleep over it
dance over it and sing psalms over it but so
sure as there is a god of justice and an un
erring providence just so sure will the blood
of the bondman be required at your hands
an opportunity was presented to you by which
you could have fixed an indellible mark of
your utter detestation of slavery and given a
powerful blow to that bitter curse this you
have failed to do when christ and barabbas
were presented you have cried out in your
madness give u  barabbasthe robber in pre
ference to christ tbe innocent the perish

hearts implored you in the name of the god
you profess to serve and the humanity you
profess to cherish not to add this millstone
to the weight already crushing his heart and
hopes but he has appealed in vain you
have turned a deaf ear to his cries hardened
your hearts to his appeal turned your back
upon his sorrows and united with ihe tyrant
to perpetuate his cnslavemeot the efforts
made in your presence to impress yon with
the awful sin of slavery and to awaken you
to a sense of your duty to the oppressed have
thus far been unavailing you continue to
fight against god and declare that tnjusfto

and the road muddy it reminded me ol

rage by t calking and hading the horses
in this city there is little or nothing do
ing in the cause of antislavery i be
lieve i am safe in saying that i never saw it
i at so low an ebb as now true there are
some efforts being made by our ever active
 co ored brethren here towards petitioning the
ensuing legislature for the elective franchise
i or the restoration of that free suffrage of
t which they were so shamefully and unjustly
robbed in  bv a mock democratic so
called reform better deformed state
convention which acts were sanctioned by a
few senile proslavery whigs who accus
i tomed to basely bend their knees to thedark
j spirit of slavery could not resist to do the
dirty work in obedience to the commands ol
their southera lords and masters i have
somewhere oo record the names of this motley
gang and may hereafter publish them as an
item of curiosity
bnt aside fiom this action i believe there
is very little interesi felt in the antislaven
cause even by the colored citizens i an
informed that wfien h c wright and c c
burleigh were here so little interest was felt
that temperance hall which was crowded t
overflowing by s and a k foster also by
yourself and garrison was not more than a
third filled at any of the meetings of thes
distinguished philanthropists and oratois th
colored people probably composing a grea
part of these what a falling off is here j
have held no meetings here yet as i intent

and on my way hack to the west i shall hole

rui it required these meetings principally
wu i be held among he colored people as out
people must ho aroused to a proper sense oi
their own condition in this country and th
means necessary to change that condition
in order effectually to accomplish this w
must meet them and converse with them fact
to face and thereby become acquainted with
them and they with us i am satisfied fron
experience and otherwise that we must act
and do for ourselveswe must in order t
accomplish so desirable an end as our eleva
tion morally religiously and socially become
our own representatives none can properly
represent us but ourselves the man who
falls the victim of affliction is the person best
to describe his feelings and the exact loca
tion of the disease the physician who
would prescribe a remedy can do little with
out the aid of the sufferer in the first place
such then are we the colored people
are the sufferers let them loudly call for
and demand assistance representing their
own malady the lawnay public opinion
is the physician who is bound to apply the
remedywhich by proper attention on our
part must eventually prove successful
in philadelphia up to the time of my
leaving the meetings continued with unabated
interest on friday evening the th ult
the last meeting  held in the shiloh church
assisted by that distinguished patriot and ora
tor henry h garnet which like all pre
ceding meetings w as filled to the utmost ca
pacity the st mary st colored presby
terian church continues her meanness keep
ing hei doors closed against the cause of their
suffering brethren under false pretext and
while i would here mete out to a few of her
petty despots socalled elders and trustees
who prevent the church from being opened
i have every reason to believe that the greater
part if uot the whole of the congregation
desire antislavery meetings to be held in
that chuich the pastor rev b f tem
pleton has not the control of the building
else there is no doubt the bouse would have
been granted when those hypocrites come
down to a dying bed when probably too late
they may see their error i forgive those
misguided deluded brethren with all my
heart and in the earnestness of my soul cry
out faiher forgive them they know not
what they do
i would here remark that i do not mean to
implicate all of the elders and trustees of st
mary si church but tloae who meanly de
clared against tbe sanction of all the rest
hat we never should by their consent have

what astonishment did they gaxe as they list

mandegrading beareodanog manthieves
of this mock republic and when peal after
peal in words of living truth the tones ot
eloquence escaped the lips of the distinguished
henry h garnet it was a proud day foi
these our brethren and one of them whispered
in our ear as he grasped our hand with grati
tude we only want such men as you and
mr gsrnet iu the south to head us iname
these facts in order to show the manthieves
that idie slave fias still a soul within him sod
we forewarn them to be careful how they at
tempt longer to trifle with and trample upon
the unsubdued spirit of manhood we fore
warn him to look to europe and profit by the
example there set we beseech him to
stop before it be too late if he will continue
bis infamous deeds of outrage upon humani

peration the slave will nse in tbe majesty of
manhood and the grandeur of his naturewhen
a terrible day it will be to the evildoer and
despoiler of his rights
i intend everywhere to induce and urge the
necessity among our people of the formation ot
antislavery societies for the assistance ol
newspapers and competent lecturers among
us while we do not mean to be exclusive
it is necessary to make our people dependant
upon themselves and cease to look to others
to do for them i would that they could all
see and understand this principle as they
should
i want our ladies in particular to under
stand this matter properly among our white
antislavery friends the ladies by their in
dustry and perseverance hold fairs annually

to w h day esq
secretary of the national convention of col
ored citizens held at cleveland ohio sept
a 
dear sir on looking over a synopsir
f the proceedings of the convention as pub
istied in the north star i find that you have
iot reported me correctly and aa i neithe
peak write nor act without having a specific
tirjectwhieli object is to effect good espe
cially among our oppressed brethren and at
ihe present position in which lam reported
may have a different tendency you will there
fore do me the favor as chairman of the
business committee of that interesting as
semblage of freemen to make the following
corrections which you will report in your
official proceedings to be published in pam
phlet form my absence when the report in
ihe north star was published will account
for the error in that paper
 observed in the course of my remarks
before the coflfcention that rather than
willingly submit to and with any degree of
allowance tolerate and encourage on the part
of my own family such as menial pursuits
i would prefer to receive a telegraph dis
patch c in regard to the resolution cen
suring the barbers it is but due to the busi
ness committee in consequence of the se
verity of the language therein made use of
to say that the resolution was altogether sus
tained by gentlemen of that profession
messrs burnham of zanesville watson of
cleveland and lott of sandusky city and
although i am among the last to shrink from
duty however arduous when justly required
to be performed it is also but justice in this
instance to state that the iesolution did not
originate in the committee having been hand
ed in and rejected by that body which gave
the author the prerogative of offering it di
rectly to the convention which was done as
its number would indicate after the business
had been mainly disposed of and this gentle
man was also one of that profession there
was opposition to tbe resolution bnt it pre
vailed
yours for the elevation of our oppressed
race by selfexertion

what doe all ibis oeatinsal arriving to
like other meto ami like other menn
xt like other men amount to we are aj
jfraid of each otherof ourselves even
there are but few in these day who have th
courage to apeak oo their own authority
why ia this  why should ws live upon the
past why should the man who teaches
theology go to college and learn what war
tbe opinion of this and that man who lived
perhapa centuries ago their thoughts were
doubtless good and noble for then and fix
those who livd ut their days but are they
so for us cannot we originate for our
selves better sod truer thoughts than those
of st augustine oi erasmusbetter even
than all the colleges of the schoolmen of the
middle ages the sun of today does not
need to ask the sun of yesterday bow to shiqf
the ocean in the storm swells and ragesin
tbe calmstngs the same melancholy song as a
thousand years tgo but it is no imitator nor
does it require any precedent
he who would be a man at all must be an
independent man he must cease to trouble
himself about what other people think just
imagine paul asking what will men think of
me if ido or say this or that when a man
knows that he has a truth to communicate it
i the veriest blasphemy for him to ask what
people will think of it it concerns not him
but them what they think of it they are
the losers by not adopting the troth which he
utters he does not cherish hts truth one
whit more or less on that account so when
a man has a truth to act why should he
trouble himself about what people think and
say of his action it must be good and na
tural if it be true no action is good and
natural that is not true this is the difference
between honesty and hypocrisy the true
honest man does wbat is right and asks no
odds of any one the hypocrite does wbat
is right not in his own opinion but in the
opinion of the publicthat is the newspaper
the minister the popular authority af
ter all it is not true but false truths are
of doubtful value unless they either influence
or are carried into action it does not matter
much to us although it be true that the fog
was dense on the banks of newfoundland the
day before yesterday or a week since we
an easily credit the man who teils us this
but it does not in any way affect our present
r our future action it is not a new discovery
hat fogs prevail there and if we were about
io cross the atlantic we should be neither
he better nor the worse prepated to encounter
he fog than if we had not heard of this new
illustration of an old and familiar fact
the man who submits to and practises un
truthful customs just because they are p
ilar and he has not courage to be singular
dthough convinced that they are false
md consequently mischievous is like the inar
n the ptay who sold hunself to the devil wilt
is eves open he need not be surprised it
ie finds he has got a bard master and one
vhmn it is impossible to satisfy yield one
jetnand today and be assured you must viejo

ows why it may ba that you ate in
wardly despised for your poltroonryout
wardly perhaps spoken well of as a man
who is not opintonative and is willing to be
instructed by those who know better than
himself poor pay for becoming despicable
in your own eyes more than that follows
the silly world that ie all the time trying to
make itself believe that wrong is right and
right wrong because it is fashionable so to do
s by the influence of your example confirmed
in its foolish course of selfdeception and so
the ball goes round each man doing bis best
to befool his neighbor by and by an inde
pendent man starts up and says no  will
not do this thingit is wrongit is wicked
it is mischievous the probability is that
men hate curse and throw him
while he is living and do just as he wanted
them aftei he is dead
he who would be wholly an independent
roan must be as independent of his former
self as of all other men it will not do for
him to say because i said so and so a year a
month a week since therefore i must say the
same now np such thing he is under no
such compulsion if be gets wiser what
profit is there if his present wisdom must give
place to his former ignorance let him speak
now what he thinks at this present let him
speak a year hence the thoughts that are
present to him then this is the true theory
of progress a man eannot and should not
be expected to bind his mental any more than
his physical existence last year mayhap
he lived a good and useful life and had good
and useful thoughts he cannot live that
identical year over again though he may live
many like it he need not expect to entertain
the identical thoughts over again though fre
quently many like them a man cannot be
a thinking man without changingunless
indeed you suppose him to have arrived at
perfection what more absurd then than to
accuse him of inconsistency because he
thinks today differently from what be thought
yesterday is the thief inconsistent who
some tints since thought that it was right oi
at all events had no perception that it was
morally wroog to take what belonged to an
other but who now acts on the principle of
honesty i be inconsistent whose mouth was
once full of cursing and bitterness but who
now speaks without an oath and tn the spirit
of mercy
oh for mora true men who do not hesitate
to think boldly and apeak boldly and act in

with which we suppose you are well acquaint
ed we are friends of the union and the
constitution as it is
this extract wears an aspect of honest in
quiry and therefore deserves a candid reply
which we shall make vety brief as many
words are not needed in so plain a case
to the question what shall be done
with the negroes  we answer let the op
pressed go free and break every yoke
every human being possessing inaliwnable
right to liberty to object to un re rioted
general emancipation is to deny that man is
manto assume that slavery is right and just
to obliterate all distinctions between thos
w ho are created in the image of god and the
lieasts of the field to talk of the probable
extirpation of the blacks in consequence ul
such emancipation is equally absurd and
monstrous what is it we propose thai
the slave should be immediately put in pos
session of himself his wife his children ah
his stolen rights and employed as a free
laborer in kentuckyis this unretsonable
as to the consequences let this inquirer read
the th chapter of isaiah and see the cheer
ing results of such an act explicitly declared
the exercise of the elective franchise is to be
settled on other grounds and other basis
a kentuckianhimself probably a slave
holderwho denies that the victims of a
crushing tyranny ought to be liberated now
and who thinks that the emancipation and
extirpation of the slaves must go together
very naturally declares that he and his asso
ciates are friends of the union and the con
stitution as it is of course we are

dering the dearest ties in natute thus separ

fine feelings from a system so foul and fiend

because a corrupt tree cannot bring forth

give these descriptions
v feature of the cave ii
thm it consists of an irregular passage
of  with rooms and in some
cases suites of rooms opening at irreg
ular distances on each side the
width of the entry is about twenty feet
and the roof varies from five to sixty
feet in height the floor is in some
places even though generally it is cov
ered over with masses of fallen rock
and disfigured by yawning caverns
which it required much care to pas
over in safety the ceiling is in no
place smooth but there hang from it
short stalactites which can be compared
to nothing better than a washerwomans
smoothing irons fastened by the handle
to the roof and hanging an inch or twe
apart
down this entry the party passed foi
half a mile until they came to where it
swells out to large dimensions and de
scends very abruptly for quite a hun
dred feet forming a huge and unsightly
chamber terminating their explora
tion in this direction here they retraced
their steps about four hundred yards
from the entrance however is to he
found the most attractive part of the
cave through which they passed
here a noble and lofty dome with all
its proportions perfect spanned the en
tire passage on the right to our com
ing from the entrance and immediately
under the dome about ten feet from the
floor there is a deep recess formed by
a bold curve of the wall on each side
the back ground of this recess is filled
up by the appearance of a splendid
grecian temple which would not suffer
in comparison with the parthenon in its
best days aided a little by the excite
ment of the visiter and by the shadows
cast by the lights the facade is perfect
a little back of the regular line of the
wall extends a row of massive fluted
columns pediment and all while in the
rear still appears the body of the tem
ple the door in the right place and of
the right dimensions and all the pro
portions perfect
on the left of the passage and under
the same dome ascends the regular
winding stairway about five feet in
width the walls are of stalactite for
mation in some places as smooth as
glass in others grooved and in others
still plastered and they glittered in the
torchlight like polished diamonds
when they had ascended this stairway
some thirtyfive feet they came to a
wall which closed it up at right angles
in the middle of this wall arid about
three feet from the floor there is an
opening about a foot arid a half in di
ameter through which they crawled
and here they entered into a suite of
rooms gorgeous beyond description
the first was a small antechamber
about twelve feet in diameter the walls
of stalactite and the floor of stalagmite
and the ceiling so high that with all
three of their torches together they
could not get a glimpse of it
on the farther side of the chamber
near the entrance to the next room
were two splendid columns each about
two feet and a half in diameterthat on
the right seemed to be made of translu
cent shell resembling those beautiful
shells that ornament the mantles of the
rich and so high as to be lost in the
darkness abovethe one on the left ap
peared as perfect a corinthian column
gorgeous capital and all as art could
fashion passing between these and
through an arched doorway they enter
ed into another large room here was
almost every variety of stalagmite for
mation that can be imagined statues
pyramids and shafts studded the floor
in splendid profusion gorgeous col
umns extended up to the ceiling and
heavy stalactites terminating below in
their curled leaves reach down to
within three feet of the floor one of
these when struck sounded like the
tolling of a large bell another gave
forth the deep tones of the largest pipes
of the organ not faintly but filling with
its loudest peal the whole compass of
the cavern while its rich note swelled
and reverberated in the arches below
the next chamber seemed to be a
regular wardrobe witfi ladies dresses
hanging all around the walls every
fold in the garments being as distinctly
marked as if they were veritable dress
es in the fourth room on a smooth
place on the wall the party wrote their
names and the date of their visit with
charcoal which has doubtless long be
fore this been obliterated to this j
suite of rooms they gave the name of

level of sea and land
the observations of science have
demonstrated the fact that the island
of great britain has been submerged
in the ocean to the depth of  feet
above the present sea level mr rob
ert chambers has recently produced an
interesting work on this subject in
which he advances and very ably main
tains the theory of the recession of the
sea in opposition to the upheaval of
the land the following extract pre
sents a condensed summary of the au
thors reasoning on the numerous data j
furnished by observation and of infer
ence deducted therefrom
it lias been my task to examine
the heretofore known examples of
ancient sea margins with a view to
ascertain if they bore any relations to
each other to follow out a chain of re
search among similar though less obvi
ous marking at higher levels and to
ascertain if these stood in any higher
relationship the final object being to
determine as far as possible the
questions above cited regarding the
mode and circumstances of relative
level
the general result is that the su
perficial formation bean the mark of
former levels of the sea and at various
intervals up to at least twelve hundred
feet thus involving the glenary terra
ces and that the markings in the sev 
eral districts examined as well as in
the neighboring coasts of france and
ireland do all of them fall into such

rors those who have read the an

degrees of cold are at this time muct
i less severe than they were formerly
i the rivers in gaul namely the loir
and the rhone were regularly frozen
over every year so that frequently
whole armies with their baggage ant
i carnages could march over them ever
 the tiber froze at rome and juvena
says positively that it was necessary
to break the ice in winter in order tc
come at the water of the river many
passages in horace suppose the street

ovid assures us that the black sea was
frozen annually and appeals for the
truth of this to the governor of the
province whose name he mentions
i he also relates several circumstancei
concerning that climate which at pres
ent agree only with norway and swe
den the forests of thrace and pan
nonia were full of bears and w ild boars
in like manner as now the forests of the
i north the northern part of spain
was little inhabited for the same cause
in short all the ancients who mention
the climate of gaul germany pan
nonia and thrace speak of it as in
supportable and agree that the ground
w as covered with snow the greatest part
i of the year being incapable of pro
ducing olives grapes and most otnei
j fruits it is easy to conceive that the
forest being cleared away the face ol
the country cultivated and the marshy
places drained the moist exhalations
which generate cold must he consider
j ably lessened and that the rays of the
sun must have a freer access to warm
the earth the same thing has hap
pened in north america since the eu
ropeans carried there their accustomed
industry the history of the north
leaves us no room to doubt that there
have been vast forests cut down and
by this single means extensive marshes

ills that too often become great ills oc
casioned by sedentary habits clos
confinement and bad air all the hy

quackery ever invented are not to b
compared to a morning walk in impart
ing health and vigor to a worn and ex

and the joyousness of nature just waking
from the repose of night have an in
vigorating effect upon the body and thi
mind that cannot be effaced by th
cares and duties of the day
health is more often sacrificed bj
women particularly by neglecting t
j take proper exercise in the open aii
than from any other cause then
seems to be among american ladies s
strong antipathy to this kind of exer
ciseat least a sufficient amount of it
to give tone and energy to the consti
tution if they walk down street twe
or three times a week they think they
have done all that a just regard for theii
health requires and certainly all that
the rules which govern fashionable life
will allow propose to them that they
should walk several indes in a day and
they are horrorstricken at once
perhaps our charge is too sweeping
we will not make it against all ameri
can ladies yet we think it can be susjj
tained against a majority of them ii
is a fact well ascertained and estab
lished that the standard of health
among females in this country is much
lower than in any other country in the
world in england women of all
classes are in the daily habit of walking
much and long distances a walk ol
several miles is there regarded as a
delightful recreationhere it is lopked
upon as an almost impracticable task
the best preventive and the only
cure of consumption is to be much in
the open air exercising briskly either
on foot or on horseback a few words

age of the most indomitable courage
without being foolhardy in its use and
of considerable personal strength he
was one of the crew of the ship henry
clay when two years ago she was
stranded on barnegat and with the
second mate of that ship who lately
sailed from boaton as the mate of the
ocean monarch and was on board at
the time of her bqping was in a boat
with four other pat men when an at
tempt was made to carry a line to the
shore over the surd the boat in which
they made thin hazardous experiment
was swamped in the rollers and four
of the persons in her perished fred
eric jerome and the present mate erf
the ocean monarch aarcd their mree
 bji swimming back to the ship as eo
other of the persons in the ship could
be induced to make a second attempt
frederick jerome and this pereon un
dertook it and on the second dangerous
effort succeeded and by means of this
line the whole of the lives of the uas
sengers and crew on board of the hen
ry clay were saved it was their only
connection with the beach which was
at a considerable distance the mate
of the ship ocean monarch at the time
of the si miles from
liverpool snowing that this lion
hearted man was on board of the ship
new world then laying to near com
ing out on her homeward voyage and
seeing no other human aid was to be
had and knowing of no other man of
like daring to wmom he could apply
thought only of him remembering his
former adventure with him to save the
fifteen persons yet remaining on the
bowsprit of the burning wreck he
therefore pot off to the new world in
a leaky boat to beg him to go along
with him to their rescue jerqpae
no sooner heard the request than he
instantly stripped himself and whether
for life or for death let himself down
from the chains and went to the
rescue
fifteen souls are now rfejoicing in
life who without his aid would be at
the present hour in eternity he got
to the ship partly by swimming climbed
by some ropes to the bowsprit to which
the helpless terrified women and child
ren were clinging like burning martyrs
i to the stakewith the devouring element
touching their very clothes and with
his own hands tied a rope round their
body one by one and let them down
into the boat which his friend the mate
kept underneath to receive them he
was the last man that left the burning
wreck

franz horn tells us in one of his
frisky litle sentences describing the
betweenity which so remarkably char
acterised the great erasmus that
erasmus was like a man who should
build a splendid church for the service
of god with a nice little chapel beside
in which he might occasionally wor
ship the devil and it is told of certain
heathen nations that they explain the
great honor they pay the latter by
saying they do not know into whose
hands they may fall after death there
is a great deal of human nature in
these stories as there is said to be by
good authority in man generically

a gentle hint a country parson
who was not over promptly paid by
his parishioners on entering the church
one sabbath morning met one of the

the loan of a dollar
certainly said the man at the

dominie put it into his pocket and
preached his sermon in most capital
style and on coming down handed the
identical dollar to the man from whom
he borrowed it
yy r hyexclaimed the lender you
have not used the money at all
it has been of great service to me
nevertheless replied the parson i
always preach so much better when 
have money in my pocket
the hint was taken and the balance
of his salary was got together on the

riding past a turnpike gate without pay

girl this is a woman and mare there

she rode off leaving him the laughing
