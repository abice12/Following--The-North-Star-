it was usual to estimate the loss in
the passage to the seashore at twenty

so sooner was the purchase com
pleted than these wretched africans
were transported in herds aboard the
ship and immediately procipitated be
tween decks where a strong chain
attached to a staple in the lower deck
was riveted to the bar before describ

pairs and handcuffed and two sailors
with cutlasses guarded every twenty
while the women and children were
tied together in pairs with ropes and
obliged to supply the men with their
provisions and the slushbucket or if
the young women were released it was
only to gratify the brutal lust of the

piped on deck and ordered to assist in
manufacturing and knotting catonine

informed was always necessary to
bring the slaves to their appetite ihe

to these his miserable children had
permitted some kindly suffocation to
put a period to their anguish it was
neither novel nor unexpected to the

after breakfast the whole ships
crew went between decks and carried
with them the provisions for the slaves
which they one and all refused to

was never seen these injured afri
cans preferring death to slavery or
perhaps buoyed above the fear of dis
solution by their religion which
taught them to look with an eye of
faith beyond the grave where they

had been torn and where no fiend

fulfill their contract unless we staid
three weeks longer our captain con

we accordingly weighed anchor and
steered for benin and anchored in the
river formosa where we took in one
hundred and fifteen more slaves the

sued here and though i frequently
assured the captain as a physician
that it was impracticable to stow fifty
more persons between decks without
endangering health and life the whole

linguist that with his dying breath
he invited his wife and a boy and girl
to follow him and slake their thirst with
him at the cool streams of the fountain
of their great father beyond the
reach of the white wild heasti the
captain was now alarmed for the suc

he ordered the hip about and we
anchored near an uninhabited part of
the gold coast tents were erected
on the shore and the sick landed

surprisingly it was affecting to see
the eftect gentle usage had upon these
hitherto sullen obstinate people as

when i was about twelve years old
 experienced religious leelings and
the belief that i owned them  regard
now as the bestto cling to everything
good and forsake all evil and i was
taught not to steal and that servants
should obey masters that is one of the
most especial of southern christian
principles now in my slave time i
frequently experienced hunger my
master w hose house was open to all
the neighbors especially the ministers
and to w hom he was very kind was
quite the reverse in the kitchen just
about this time l had my doctrine
against stealing qualified and i will
tell you how i durst not talk to any
of the delinquency of eatables on the
plantation but to one a confidant
named sandy jiggins and to him i
poured forth the pithy strains of an
empty stomach he was a religious
kind soul and in our conversations he
said tu me why is it that you never
have any money why how can
i have money  answered i toil

me to stay the slaves dying cry for
freedom with the biblethe bible will
not bring w hat he cries for but free
dom brings the bible and the means to
understand it god almighty does not
require a man to attend to his religious
duties before he has got the means tc
render those not a mockery i would
rather give shhotake a slave away
than one cent for a biblewhen you
give him a bible he cannot read it and
it acts as a salve to the conscience of
the holderbut ill let the bible alone
it mav be good bait for catching some

an illustration of slavery
the following anecdote related by
a gentleman who was himself an eye
witness is such a remarkable instance
of heroic and unshaken friendship
that i thought i worth transcribing
lest it should be lost it is from dun
laps paper n oct th 
at a late public sale of negro slaves
at santa cruz among the great num
ber that christian avarice has been
either the immediate or secondary
means of placing on a level with cat
tle daily brought to our markets there
were two about thirty years opage
whose deportment seemed superior to
all the rest what their rank had
really been they with sullen dignity
seemed resolved to conceal from every
body yet mingled with a haughty
manner towards all beside there ap
peared in every look and action the
tendered affection for each other
when the captain of the vessel which
brought them entered on the business of
distribution into lots for sale of the
captives these two with a moat sub
missive manner and eagerness that
spoke more than common feelings
clung about his knees intreating him
ito favor them so far as to permit them
ito be sold in the same lot that they
might serve the same master and en
joy the trifling satisfaction of being
companions in slavery but this poor
request was denied them yet earn
est as they were in their desire the re
fusal was received with a manly resig
nation by them both and when upon
the point of being delivered to their
masters they begged leave of having a
few words with each other which was
allowed after a lew moments talk
and an affectionate embrace they
separated about seven days after
they were both missing at the same
hour and nowhere to be found about
a week after their disappearance a
planter riding through a thicket which
laid between their mutual homes saw
to his great surprise two bodies hang

central africa
many tacts concerning this remote
country have been given by travellers
among which we may notice the fol
lowing
the people are negroes fellatahs
and arabs the first are most nu
merous but the fellatahs are tfie
dominant party their origin is not
known but it has been supposed that
they emigrated from asia they are
an intelligent enterprising race of an
olive or brown color with european
features and long soft hair travel
lers speak in admirable terms of the
fellatab shepherdesses whom they
represent as distinguished for native
dignity and sweetness of manners it
has been a common opinion that africa
is inhabited entirely by negroes hut
this is not correct the absssineans j
nubians fellatahs bechuannas and
many others belong to races quite dis
tinct from the negroes in fact it is
probable that the negroes do not form
onehalf the population of the conti
nent
agriculture in central africa is car
ried on with a surprising degree of
industry in may places the traveller
meets with extensive plantations in a
high state of cultivation producing
corn millet rice wheat cotton yams
c in great abundance
the manufactures of the country
include iron tools gold chains and
other trinkets of good workmanship
gun powder cotton cloth in abundance
very superior mats saddles boots itc
c the iron is melted from the ores
of the country and the gold is dug
from the mines and collected from the
sands of the rivers
the cities of central africa con
stitute one of its remarkable features j
many of them are of immense size
surrounded bv walls thirty or forty
miles in circuit these walls are usu
allyof clay but sometimes of brick
and one city is mentioned with walls ofj
wood plated with iron tire markets
in these cities afford immense quanti
ties of provisions and other com
modities and some of them it is said
are visited by thousands of strangers
annually
the commerce of the africans
among themselves is surprisingly ex
tensive being carried from city to city l
in every part of the country by innu
merable caravans some of these
caravans go to the shore of the medi
terranean others to the countries bor j
dering on the indian ocean and many i
to the western coast this active
intercommunication cannot fail to be
useful in the spread of the gospel inj
this country when it is once intro
duced
the religion of the fellatahs is a
kind ofmahommedanism distinguished
by its freedom from mahommedan j
bigotry and exclusiveness as proofi
of this statement we rnay notice the
fact that the women are not immured
within walls and concealed by thick
veils but they are permitted to mingle
as freely in society as the females of
the united states some of the neg
roes are still heathens but most of
them have been taught by the fella 
tahs to renounce idols and to believe
in one god numbers have gone so
far as to embrace the mahommedan
faith
the governments are despotic hut
are generally mildly administered
there is far more security of life and
property than we might expect among
barbarians travellers have seldom
felt any apprehension of danger from
the inhabitants on the contrary they
have usually been treated with respect
and often with remarkable kindness
hospitality is reckoned a virtue and to
maltreat a stranger especially a white
man is esteemed a heinous offence

a slaveholding governor in california
have emboldened the south to assume

a new phase of the slave trade has al
ready commenced and iho gold mines

original moving cause

know that american slavery was breath
ed into life by the demon of the mines
and they believe it can renew its exist

says the albany atlas from one of the
influential papers of the south the
georgia constitutionalist an asser
tion of the fitness ot the new territories
for slavery and an avowal of a purport
to colonize therein with slaves at all
hazards
the northern prints begin to indi
cate serious apprehensions that after all
the assertions to the contrary slavery
can and will exist in california we
have long believed and contended that
slav e labor will be very profitable in that
country particularly so since the dis
covery of the gold mines no labors
can be so well adapted for mining pur
poses as slave labor when the peo
ple of california ascertain this fact to a
demonstration they will insist on the
introduction of slaves into that country
for congress to interfere with thatj
right to introduce them would ho not
only unconstitutional but grossly op
pressive and unjust
in defiance of all the sinister predic
tions north and south that slavery
never can exist in california we confi
dently expect to see the southern peo
ple vet enjoying their full share of that
valuable territory for which her sons

of the free democracy
a new organization of the conven

brought from each of the two parties
the resolutions adopted are as fol
lows
resolved that liberty is a right in
herent and inalienable in man and that
herein all men are equal
resolved that to secure the bles
sings of liberty was one great object for
which the constitution of the united
states was ordained
resolved that as liberty is the
clearest right and dearest interest of
the individual and its security the
highest duty of the body politic we de
clare as the first point and article in
this organization that american sla
very is a great evil and wrong which
ought to be repented of and abandon
ed
resolved that we claim no author
ity in the federal government to abol
ish slavery in the several states but
we do claim for it constitutional power
to prohibit the introduction ot slavery
into any territory now free and to abol
ish it wherever under the jurisdiction of
congress it exists
resolved that this power ought irnl
mediately to be exercised in prohibit
ing the introduction and existence of
slavery in new mexico and california
in abolishing slavery and the slave
trade in the district of columbia on
the high seas and wherever else un
der the constitution it may be reached
resolved that no more slave states
should be admitted into the federal
union
resolved that the government
ought to return to its ancient policy
not to extend nationalize or encour
age but to limit localize and discour
age slavery
resolved that we demand for the
people a cheaper system of postage a
retrenchment of the expenses and pat
ronage of the federal government so
far as may be practicable by the peo
ple
resolved that we are opposed to
land monopoly and believe that the
public lands should be granted to act
i ual settlers in limited quantities at the
cost of survey and transfer
i resolved that the education of the
children of the state is a matter of pub
lic concern which the state ought to
care for and the property of the state
ought to pay for
resolved that we consider that the
issues which formerly divided ihe dem
ocrat and whigs in relation to an uni

tribution of the proceeds ot the public
lands have been settled and that we
are not disposed in the present posi

i to countenance their revival whatever
m ay have been our individual opinions
i heretofore on those subjects
resolved that we can support no
man as a candidate for state or nation

the law of new hampshire is sinu

that the roman atholics have kept tlie

it only at dull second hand but as the

ence to the law to dropout ot the sight
of the crowd so that the lesson to this
extent should he clipped ot its fair pro
portions but the hopeful youngsters
on the trees and the people on the
neighboring houses defeated this mod
esty of the law and had a tail view of
the whole
bv very careful and discreet inquiry
it was ascertained that the motley
crowd drunk and sober men and wo
men were almost unanimously strong
in the faith of capital punishments and
what is more they were prepared to de
fend their faith from the scriptures
do you think this is right asked
our friend
right to be sure  do replied a fe

blood by man shall his blood he shed
by gd
but do you find that in the new tes
tament added out friend
why d n it if we give up one
part of the bible we may as well give
up the wholerejoined the zealous the

indeed the whole crowd seemed pet
fectly prepared in the scripture proofs
and by quoting all the strong texts they
contrived to strengthen themselves for
the five or six mortal hours in which it
was their destiny to stand reeking m
foul air and blasphemy for thfe gratifi
cation of that feeling on which theology
relies for the safety of mans govern
ment and gods
the platform was occupied by a
number of clergymen and sheriff ol
the neighboring counties who came to
see broth ketch safe through his ugly
job lu the midst of them rlder dud

powers and the chaplain of the prison
he asked arid obtained leave to speak
and in a few words uttered in a firm
loud tone he solemnly asserted his en
tire innocence of the crime for which he
was to suffer and expressed his hope
of heaven to which he was confident
he could go from the gallows as well as
any other place sealing hi assertions
with an address to his maker the slier
iff did his cristian duty and the hie
was choked out of the clay
with armies of satisfaction and oaths
of delight the edified crowd retired to
renew their flotations at the grog tavern
and the pressure for more of the wiur

the fun grew fast and furious and all
the lower propensities held their carni

self in full force from swapping jack
knives to swapping horses and wagons
and much was the boot that passed from
the comparatively drunk to the mors

√ºba slavery and tbe slave trade
mr bryant in recent letter from havana
to the evening post stales that the slave
trade between the isand of and the
coau of africa ts earned on quite briskly and
openly ol late the government of cuba con
niving at and profiting by the atiocioua traffic
a carp of five hundred human chattels was
recently landed on the southern part of the
island and n is understood that one hundred
and seven more of the poor creatures died on
the horrid passage from their native land
dunne the partial suppression of the loreign
trade some years ago slaves advanced very
much in value and owner found it for tbeii
interest to treat them with that degree ot hu
manity supjiosed to be most conducive to vig
orous health and long life but undet the
present revival of the trade their lives will
probtblv become of less consequence to their
owners and they will again be overtasked and
worn out without pity as they are ajd to
have been formerly
hardly more than half of the island of cu
ba has ever been reduced to tillage i here
is a demand therefore for lauirers on the
part ol those who wish to become planters
end this d mand is supplied not only trom the
coast of a ft tea hut from the american conti
nent and south western ash
mr bryant saw several of the yucatan in
dians who h id been taken urisoners of war
and sold to the whiles ot juba under a pre
tended contract to serve for a certain numlier
of yers the dealers in this kind of mer
chandise were also bringing in the natives ol
asia and disposing of their services to the
planters in a similar way thcie are said to
be six hundreu ot these people m the city ot
havanna the authouues have issued an or
dinance declaring what shall be the daily ta
tiori of these new made slaves also how
many lashes the master may inflict ter misbe
havior
such savs mr bryant is the manner in
which the government of cuba sanctions the
barbarity of making slaves ot the treeborn men
of yucatan the ordinance however be
trays great concern for the salvation of the
souls of those w hum it thus delivers over  the
lash of the slavedriver it speaks ot the in
dians from america as christians already
but while it allows the slaves imported trom
asia to be flogged it dilicts lhat they shall be
carefully instructed in the doctrines ot our holy
rehg on
yet the policy of the government favors
emancipalou the laws of cuba permit any
alive to purchase his freedom on paying a
fmee fixed by three person one appointed by
ua master and two by a magistrate he may
also it he ploases compel his master to sell
him a certain portion ot lus time which he
may employ to earn the means of purchasing
his enure freedom
it is mainly owing to these laws no doubt
that theic aie so many tree blacks in the is
land and it the foreign slave tiade could be
entirely suppressed the slaves would all eman
cipate themselves ultimately the population
of cuba is now about  miter more
than half of whom are colored persons and
one out of every four of thecoloied population
is t ree the prejudice of color is by no means
o strong in cuba as in the united stales
there is little difficulty in smuggling peopl
of mixed blood by the help of legal forms in
to the white race and it they tuu rich into
good society
mr bryant thinks there is no great pros
pect of annexing cuba to the united slates
old spain will of course uni betnuud willing
to relinquish a possession from winch sin
draws an annual revenue of twelve millio s ol
dollars beside she sends there her ne d v
nobility and those for whom she would pio
vide to fill the lucrative offices the priests
the military officers the civil authorities every
man who fill a judicial post or holds a clerk
ship is from old spain
the people are not likely to take up armt
to emancipate themselves for while many ol
them would greatly prefer a union with the
united states they are by no means suffi
ciently united in that object to encounter suc
cessfully the power of the mother country
ol course says mr bryant if cuba weie
to be annexed to the united states the slavt
tiade wuh africa would cease to be carried 
a now though its perfect suppression mighi
be found difficult negroes would be import
ed in large numbers trom the united states
and pianteis would emigrate with them in
stitutions ot education would be introduced
commerce and religion would both be madt
iron and the character of the islanders wouh
he elevated by the responsibilities w inch a tie
government would throw upon them tin
planters however would doubtless adopt rep
nlatious insuring the perpetuity of slavery
they would unquestionably as soon as they
were allowed to frame ordinances for the is
laud take awav the facilities which the pres
ent laws give tiic slave lor effecting his own

some statements winch i made in my last
weeks north star on this subj ct this is
very indefinite aid can only be accounted
for by the fact that the writer could not
i point out a single statement incorrectly made
sjo keeusighied a person as mr garnet
i would not have dealt in generalities had
i he deemed it safe to have been specific
the quotations which lie gives from
speeches of mine made on the subject ot
giving bibles to the slaves are correct in
spirit if not in letter and do not contradict
the views expressed bv me in the article be
foie referred io i treated the proposition as
i impracticable and delusive and this view 
still hold that the first thing to be done for
the slave is to emancipate him is no new
doctrine but is as old as the doctrine of im
mediate emancipation proclaimed by that
j bright spirit now gone to her rest elizabeth
i herrick of england it has been left to the
j gradualists and others to tamper with tit
question of slaveiy by patching up the vile
system with preparatives education reli
gious instruction and bibles against ah
these it has ever been the course of the de
i voted friends of the slave to demand imme
diate freedom as the only foundation upon
j which the slave population can be prepared
io discharge the duties either of a man or a
christian away with all patchwoik and
moral quackery let us demand liberty for
the captive as the first obligation of the
master and the first right of the slave if is
inverting the classification of mans rights to
place his right to the bible before h s right to
himself i therefore say here as i satd in
new york first give the slave himself and
he will have the ability as well as capacity
to own a bible away with all trifling with
a mai in letters break bin chains ant let
jus have no respect for him who would give
j the slavj a bible while he would not give the
slave himself mr garnet challenges us tn
an oial discussion the question to be dis
cussed he does not slateperhaps lie does
not think it material he may be as ready
i to discuss one tiling as another since the ob
ject is discussion his duty as a preacher t
the gospel and his necessary attendance up
on ins grge parish indispose him it accept ot

of the north star but he is reidv to leave

frederick douglass vs henry bibb
a copy of the true wesleyan has been
handed to us containing an article with the
above caption animadverting upon the re
marks in reference to the speech of mr bibb
made at the anniversary of the american and
foreign antislavery society the remarks
upon him were as follows
mr bibb took the platform to second a
resolution proposing to give bibles  the
slave and made a long speech in favor of
this most absurd and extraordinary proposi
tion the speech was as absurd as the pro
position it was intended to support when
he confines himself to a narrative of his own
sufferings and those of his wife who is yet
i in slavery mr bibb is always interesting
touching and powerful beyond that he is
weak insipid and powerless
his address on the present occasion was
made up of a most illogical display of cant
phrases abut the bible its power to abolish
slavery if given to the slave c it was a
poor tiling which would do very well for
i that nambypamby class of persons in our
country who care a great deal about the souls
of men bl care nothing tor their bodies
the true wesleyan terms this an un
called for and low attack on mr bibb and
i its editor says he was present and listened
to the speech with great pleasure and re
garded his speech as an able argumentlogi
cal imptessive and animated many men
have many minds we will give a lew
specimens fiom the speech ot mr bibb in
order to show upon w hat grounds we pro
nounced the speech weak insipid anti
powerless the aim of the speech was m
the language of the resolution a recommeu
datum to ail the friends of the antisia er
cause to aid the american musiniuiy associ
ation to distribute the bible among the staves
the speech i order to have been to me
purpose should have demonstrated not mere
 lv the right ol the slave to the bible or h
j destitution of it but the practicability of ihc
measuie for about the fiist there is no qu t
tion and wuids spent upon n are miaspem
unkss it can be show n that the scheme prw
posed will accomplish the end aimed at tne
latter not beiug shown the speecn w as incon
clusive weak and ical
it seems to us that no scheme of giving
bibles to the slave while he is a slave ca
succeed without the coopeiatiou of the slave
holders themselves and this cooperaikn
mr bmb in the speech in question virtually
told the audience could never be obtained
thus involving himself in a contradiction
he said on that occasionas well migh
they expect the fox to guard the geese or in
wolf to protect the lamb as to think tha
slaveholders would circulate the word ot gm
among their slaves on this assertion
tuougit u is diametncuiy opposed to m bibb f
scheme we most fully quite and ctncluin
liom it that the first tiling to be done is t
break the power of the slaveholder as tnt
first means of giving the bible to the slave
mr bibb contrary to our experience and tb
i experience ul many others whom we haw
i consulted said theie was no plantation 
which was a considerable number of slaver

starting timber by what road ami by whai

enough to assettibe slaves right to the bible

joseph barker we observe by a letter
in the liberator and also by one in the anti
slavery standard that it is the intention ot
joseph barker a well known antislavery
writer and speaker soon to visit this country
it is also mentioned that he contemplates
making this land his future home mr

barker is an able speaker and an activr
worker and we have no doubt that should
he lend his energies to the antislavery move

highly beneficial to the cause of the slave

ttie cemetery consecrated but a year ago
while we were in that city has been found a
moat useful institution to the colored citizens oi
iliai place besides the satisfaction it affuds
die mends of the deceased to have the n in
terred m hi most respectful maimer it also
places in the hands of the colored people
ihemselves the great amount of money anuu
uy laid out for interment a colored undet
nker and furnisher is now badly wanted to
complete the cemetery institution establish
ment which when dune will place thu
colored people in this particular precisely on
a looting with their white fellow citizens
ihis however we learn has already been
et on foot arrangements now being made
for the establishment of an undertaker and
an active competent respectable business
colored man already in the city negotiating
tor the establishment
tne orphan asylum is atili in existence
but is a drag on the colored citizens we
were invited to deliver au address belore the
institution tor the purpose of increasing
miinewhat its finances but various interven
ng and unforeseen causes prevented us
irotn contributing this feeble act of charity i
vve were informed that the white citizen
generally have been as liberal as could be
xpect d uudei the circumstances whenever
called upon but at best the establishment is
poorly provided tor and bears a disparaging
and miserable likeness when compared with
mmlar uiutiona in the city established foi
me protection and cotnlort of white children
r the excellent asylum established for colored
hildren in newyoik city a burning cry
ng shame upon the slate authorities of ohio
dial there has never as yet been one dollar
tppropriaied by the slate legislature to
vards this institution of poor helpless unpro
tected indigent children although we
meerfuily give ohio credit for some liberality
oward her much wronged colored citizen
during the past year yet the last dreg of her
loathsome cup of iniquity cannot be cast out
until she redeems her character of the long
continued injustice and proscription toward
her colored children of all the sins which
man is heir to there is m neiraughi with
more fearlul consequences than injustice to
the orphan and defrauding the widow
we visited the asylum and instead of that
neatness of appearance which usually greets
the eye of the visitor when entering auch in
vtitutiooa though the apartments were not
positively dirty yet they looked cheerioe
ind neglected
frst of all the children were not we i
clad but to the contrary several of then
mere positively ragged a condition which
child io an orphan asylum should never be
permitted to sunn if an institution of this
kind cannot keep the inmates in good com
bo table clothing it requites no argument to
show that it is badly off tim matron it is
true did say that they had plenty clothes
but the condition the childten wete tn gives
an idea of what she conclaves to be a plenty
doubtleaa the matron is good and kind  the
children and we desire uof to reflect n her
but if we mistake not she is a southerner of
the oldschool notions of propriety in
such matters and those who are conversant
with things among our folks in that part of
the country especially the behindthe age par
know hr w far they fail short of our idea tf
rectitude and propriety the whole estab
lishment appcus to teem with that kind of
management behind the ageism
tne bath which was presented one year a
o by mr shiras after an address by us to the j
institution has not even yet bem fixed but j
simply stands in a loom loose h re the
children fill it with buckets once a week
and we suppose the whole bathe in the same
water w hmt emptyingthe beds instead
of presenting an airy sweet and clean appear
ance looked soiled and neglectedthe sheets
which had been white appeared as though
they were colored in the washingsallow
and unbleached
there ts no wardrobe departmentno haih
department no medical department no
school departmentno guest chamber or
visiters depaitmrnt n nothing excepting
committee room one neat parloi bed rooms
dining room and kitchen it is true the
pirloris the proper guest chamber in this
limited establishment but the present matron
is not sufficiently initiated into the modus
operand i of such matters to keep open her
front door and invite a visitor to a seat she
is good hearted and pleasant but simple and
awkward keeping her front door locked she
lets strangers in at the back door and invites
them out the same way this is rather be
hind the age and savors of the south
the colored ladies and gentlemen ot cin
cinnati have not sufficient encouragement to
give the attention to this asylum its wants
demand else we know from their spirit and
character things would he different the
present matron is not the same who had
charge last year and we doubt not for a
moment but the trustees have dene as well
as they could for the means they have to
keep up the establishmentand we should do
injustice to an excellent set of ladies and
gentlemen if we did not cleat them of any
reflections that might arise from our remarks
on this subject and here cheerfully exonerate
mem from all blame tn the matter of funds as
they have already done far beyond their
means and all reflections should be cast
upon the state of ohio that for years has
been robbing gods poor for the support of
the institutions of the opulent and wealthy
robbing the colored citizens of an immense
amount of taxes for the support of white
schools and benevolent institutions for whites
our desire and determination is to apeak
the truth and leave the event to god we
anxiously hope that the colored ladies and
gentlemen of cincinnati especially the ladies
will henceforth take a greater interest and
pay mote attention to the orphan asylum
it is the cause of the motherless and father
less infantthe cause of god and humanity
without the fostering care of womans hand
the asylum cannot succeed woman is the
proper guardian angel of all such institutions

midatne chevalier as she is called is a
dark mulatto woman of what the spanish
creoles term as sambo color aid takes her
name from a ataveholding cotton planter in
the red river county not far distant above

woman has had a young and interesting
daughter whose name we forbear to mention
at piesent lest it may hereafter become a
source of atmoya  ce to her should she as she
solemnly declares she will do if an honora
ble opportunity ever ccur come to the
north again to reside tor several yeara at
school in the city of cincinnati who during
the peuo of ithuers high school was a
pupil of that institution l is a comely
and interesting young girl now about hliceu

is a native virginian having been taken south

adopted her as his paramour fur the first time
came tocincinaali m may bringing two sons
handsome youths of twelve and lourteen with
her for the purpose of placing them at
school at obeiliu and taking her daughter
home with her aa she alleged to finish her
education in a french seminary at new
orleans
the daughter as is customary with south
erners was seut to cincinnati without the
mother the father coming and making ar
rangements in personduring which period
she has been under the protection and boarded
n the family of a very respectable colored
lady mrs t who keeps a reserved private
boarding house while her husband an enter
prising industrious man trades on the river
but an absence of nearly five years began to
give the mother impressions concerning the
daughter which she at once determined to
realisehence the reason ot her coming in
stead of the father to make arrangements
for the education of her boys altnough the
paramour and mistress being herself a
slave like the slaves generally she was un
educated and if we mistake not unable to
read consequently ao incompetent to dis
charge duties necessary in making arrange
men ts for the education of hei boys that
she declined to discharge that duty herself
employing mrs t guardian of her
daughter to lake the youths to obeilm and
make arrangements lor their education
not withstanding the ignorance and en
slavement of this woman added to which
was the double degradation of her situation in
concubinageyet this wreck of a woman
this creaturethis victim of human depravity
had great fault to find with mrs t not
for any delinquency on bct part of attention
to the daughter but foisooth because she
did not prohibit her from the company and
society of colored people altogether except
the necessary association with her class at
school with an effroi t ry only befitting that
ignorance the natural offspring of self degra

attended a convention beine liolden in harris
buig and composed ol colored persons tor
devising ways and mens whereby they could
secuie t themselves the eecuve franchise
now denied to their large and growing popu

persons present were messrs yashonwl pitts
burg b rown and williams of harrisburg
shad o westchester purvis of byberry
bias peek smith bowers weare and

ihe convention was properly made their rules

derly and harmonious the speeches able

the convention closed its session on the

among the objects proposed by ilie cn
vention were the starting of a campaign
paper to continue during the sitting of the
legislature the circulation of petitions for
signatures and presentation to the same body
the appointment and sustaining ut one or
more lecturing agents the raising ol a
fund of  in the siate for the present
year and in fiirtherence of the object and
wishes of the convention the printing of
iitooo copies in pamphlet fonu of the pro
ceedings of the convention just held with an
address to the citizens of thai state on the
tame subject and from observation i regret
to add that scarcely one of the above objects
as carried fully into effect but did almost
irumediaiely die on their birth and the only
resolves pmially prosecuted were the print
ing ot a part of ihe proceedings in pamphlets
and the circulation and forwarding of a few
petitions and those even dul not go to their
place of destination until anion was had
upon the subject by the joint committee in
the legislature and that action attnbutable
aluiom entirely to the efforts and jxtmons oi
their white friends who anticipated them very
considerably so far as time was concerned
a convention was called m the course of the
winter and held in philadelphia for the city
and county ostensibly to promote and give
effect io the deliberations of the one held in
harrisbuig but ically resulted in demon
ittating their carelessness indifference and
bek of appreciation of the elective fran
chise and iheir envy jealousy estrangement
obstjjjjtcy and opposition to each other
li kirch members and ministers would not
because some prominent men and ad
ucaies of the cause were opposed to pro
slavery churches and ministers others
k jcoa of the speakers were opposed
bodduijyw societies their tomfooleries
and extravagances thirdly and lastly ano
ther portion were so morally fastidious that
they could not eoopente in obtaining thetr
political rights because some of the officer
f the on vent ion were in their opinion ol
doubtful moral character hence the city coo
vention like the harrisburg resolutions proved
a splendid failure whereas in the judgment
ot many had the several committees acted
with spirit harmony and efficiency tbe paper
suited and sent on tu noble mission agent
appointed and properly suststoed and encour

zachary taylordear friend in ac
cordance with one of the following resolu
tion this paper is forwarded to thy address
there is a settled conviction in the minds of
he people not of this locality merelybut
of the entire north that slavery is sustaining
a relation to liberty wholly antagonisttcal and
consequently undermining our democratic in
stitutions it requires only a careful investi
gation to become satisfied of the fact
thou ar t the last slaveholder that can be an
occupant of the presidential chair of tus na
tion and this nation bids fair to be the last
whose soil will yield to the footprints of a
slave
beside the use of the elective franchise in
the direction of fteedom many are abandoning
ilie use of the avails or products of slave la
bor
it inay be objected that there is no very se
rious opposition to slavery even in the north
or zachary taylor could not now lie presi
dent
talk to ihese men who gave thee their suf
frage and they say that congress will pass a
bill to prevent the further extensian of slave
ry ind thou wilt not use the veto power as
inconsistent then as ii may appear for these
men to do as they have when opposed to
slavery as they profess still if they are
honest they expect more for the cause of free
dom from thee than from any of the opposing
candidates it remains to be seen whether
expectations of this character will be real
ized
if however thy future course should be
conformable to the spirit of these resolutions
it would be as praiseworthy as extraordinary
for the progress of truth and the extension
of freedom thy friend

there being no subject in our country
which is agitating the public mind so general

tmiiiedialely done that provision be made for
that purpose
resolved that a copy of the foregoing

it is impossible to give the names of the

oar old friends the pawnees have had a
hard time ot it during the pasi win er when
they returned from thetr hunting grounds
their trail could be followed bv the dead bodies
of those who had statved to death children
young men and women have shared this fate
now that spring has arrived their condition
will be improved they have abandoned their
old village  miles below us on the platte
and have commenced a new one at the mouth
of the saline some  miles nearer the fron
t ets of missouri their old enemies the si
oux are pressing them hard which i  prob
ably ihe c use of this step several war par
ties of both nations are on the warpath and
several scalps have already changed owners
a large party of sioux a few days since came
upon some halfdizen pawnees and took three
scalps and a small boy prisoner
this occurred some twenty miles from the
post and in the immediate vicinity of a party
of emigrants who if report be true played
anything hut an honorable part in the affair
the paw nees upon observing the overwhelm
ing force of their enemies who nu i be red a
bout  took shelter with thw train but the
gallant men composing it drove them forth
without mercy there was one squaw in the
party and the warriors finding they had to
fight told her to run for the river while they
threw themselves between her and the sioux
and died fighting bravely the squaw reach
ed the river and escaped as soon as it was
known here capt alker took twenty men
pursued and overtook the sioux rescued the
prisoner and restored him to his mother
these little indim fights which by the way
are of pretty frequent occurence and the arri
val of the emigtants have broken in pretty
effectually upon the monotony of our prairie
life
one of the men with the mormon mail is
just from ihe diggins in california and is
certainly a happy fellow for he says he has
got all the g id that he wants he showed a
stocking fi ii as a specimen and as you may
well suppose the emigrants opened wide
their eyes at the sight ol the glittering mass

cathocus or burying alive it was a breathless night in june my windows wera sil open and yet the
flame of my candle scarcely flickered i
had become deeply interested in the
pages of a new book and was heedless
of the lapse of time or the circumstan
ces that surrounded me until suddenly
a moth fluttered in the flame and the
crackling of its filmy wings attracted my
attention upon glancing at my watch
i found to my suprise it was already
after midnight i determined there
upon to read no more and shutting my
book walked across the room to
draw the curtain intending to go to
bed but the moonlight shone so pleas
antly in at my window that i was forc
ed to sit down and lean upon the sill
and gaze out upon the scene there
were a few thin whitish clouds hanging
around the horrizon like the distant
wings of an enormous spirit but other
wise the sky was perfectly cloudless
above the moon was shining peace
fully and below the world lay dream
ing in its misty shroud half obscured
save where the curving river glancing
in the moonlight shining like burnished
silver there is a strange fascination
in sitting in the moonlightand for al
most an hour i sat leaning out into the
air all was quiet save the monoto
nous musical gurgle of frogs in the
pond and at intervals the rustling
leaves as a tremulous breath oi wind
swelled gently and then died away
or the prolonged bark of some far off
dog i had fallen into a vague reverie
when i heard the bell striking one i
arose and went to bed but no sooner
had  left the window than i felt a
sharp pain shoot through my head
which after occuring at intervals
through the next half hour finally set
tled into a raging headache my brain
throbbed violently and seemed loose in
my head so that every motion added
pain it was as if an iron hand com
pressed my temples with its griping fin
gers i lay thus tossing restless and
sleepless for several hours and finally
fell asleep
 dreamed that i was lying beside a
waterfall half asleep the water rush
ed hissing down beside me as if an
ocean were loosened and hurried boil
ing fiercely down a rocky declivity
the air was dazzled with spray which
fell over me like hot sparks and the
trees above me seen through it seem
ed at times human skeletons which
bent their long bony arms down my
face and then slowly rising uplifted
themselves into the air and became nat
ural trees again a thousand circles
intertwining or interlacing dilated and
contracted incessantly then slowly the
motion decreased and they kept creep
ing around more and more gently un
til they swam into a broad sea of
smooth glassy water and fading out
of my sight left the air above me calm
and clear soon a small eye seemed
placidly looking at me that grew larger
and larger until it filled the wide ring
of the horizon then it changed into a
face which looked close into my eyes
gradually the features became distorted
into a hideous rid tinned and
then a thousand u crowded
one upon another uutil the air seemed
full of them they were huddled togeth
er and tossed about without body like
the waves of the ocean now i sud
denly seemed to be crawling on my
hands and knees over slimy and slip
pery rocks which were covered with
damp green seaweed as i groped a
long the seaweed began to change into
snakes until the rocks seemed alive
with the nauseous crawling reptiles
that rubbed their slimy sides against
my limbs and cheeks and cast over me
a chill of horror all my flesh seemed to
creep and the very scalp to move on
my skull in the midst of my horror
and torment i heard the wild ringing
of a bell i suddenly and convulsively
opened my eyes and heard the break
fast bell ringing for a moment  experi
enced the most grateful relief from this
nightmare which has more than once
affected meand no one can tell he
gush of feeling which came over me
when i found all this scene was but a
dream i lay thus for a moment think
ing of the change and then resolved to
spring from the bed and dress myself
immediately but to my surprise and
j horror i found i could not move my
body and limbs seemed rigid as marble
and of an intolerable weight i could
neither turn my head nor stir hand nor
foot my eyeballs were fixed on a
spot upon the white wall abovemy head
and  could neither turn them nor draw
down the lids in vain i strove to move
 was perfectly stiff and torpid and
without the power of motion there
seemed to be some appalling discon
nection between the mind and body
as if my living soul was chained meze
tinslike to a dead body there was no
painonly a fearful sensation as ifthe
whole air had congealed into a firm
transparent amber which held me strict
ly imprisoned
suddenly like the swift track of a
falling star the thought shot across my
mind that i was dead yes that could
be the only solution of this dreadful e
nigmal was sure that i was dead
but o god was this death had we
been always mistaken and did the soul
remain thus to haunt the body without
the ability to cast it off was it only
a suspension of power over this fibrous
j mass and these finely organized senses
and nicely adjusted muscles only the
breaking of one link in the subtle
chain that connected all the faculties
and powers of their instruments per
haps the soul was never freed until the
body had rotted off little by little into
a mass of corruption and exhaled or
fallen to dust and i was destined to in
habit this living house and feel i
slough away from me and perish ere i
could emerge into the light and beauty
of a new life this i had never dream
ed of and all the joy and luxury of ex
istence all the sense of light and sun
shine and fresh air all the thousand
fold delights with which god has strewn
the pictured world were not worth such
a price upon theae lip the worm
should feed and  could not drive him
awaytheae eves through which the
soul hid looked upon a mild glorious
world clear glasses would chauge un
til they were loathsome and corrupted
oh god the agony of such a thought
nothing i had ever imagined equalled
it in terror and when i recalled the
dead faces of thoee i had loved and
buried and remembered the benign
and placid smile which shone upon
them like the last foot priots of the
freed and rejoicing spirit as it fled
heavenward and which seemed to be
token the recognition by the sonl of a
diviner sense as it was leaving its clay
tenement and thought that perchance
even at the very moment while i was
bending over them to take a last fare
well look with this feeling in my heart
they were enduring the same fierce
burning torment the same feelings of
horror and despair that gnawed me
like a burning worm it seemed to me
as if all the joys i had ever known on
earth would not counterbalance so
dreadful a doubt
i heard my name called from below
i made another effort but my tongue
was torpid and dull as lead still i
could not resign myself to the thought
that i was dead  inwardly declared
that i would movel strove with al
most superhuman exertions but in
vain i could not take my eyes from
that spot on the wall which had be
come more accursed because i must see
it sidewise through my eyes i saw
the pleasant sunshine through the
room and over my head the busy flies
hummed and buzzed incessantly and
crept now and then across my face
how long and tedious seemed the
moments they were years to my ex
cited mindno one came an age of
torment seemed to have passed when i
heard a light tap at the doorl could
not answer it again i heard a louder
knock i knew it was my sister for she
spoke and called me by name the
door opened and she came forward
cautiously and again spoke as she ap
proached the bed she  joked a mo
ment at me and touched mel did not
speak but lay motionless with my eyes
fixed on that infernal spot she paused
a moment and then uttering a pierc
ing scream ran to the door and called
my mother instantly the horror of the
cry brought the whole family to my
bedside they lifted my hand and it
fell again upon the coverlid they felt
of my heartthere was not a flutter of
the pulses for all that it seemed to
me as if hell itself could not be worse
than the torment that i was enduring i
heard the quick convulsive sobs and
felt a soft hand smoothe the hair from
my forehead some one said
he must have died in a lit and yet
how calm his face is
yes was the answer he proba
bly suffered no pain and died almost im
mediatelyperhaps in his sleep
then the voices grew more distant
and murmuring and some on left the
room soon the door opened and the
face of the family physician intercepted
the dreadful spot for a moment now
thought i he will know that i ain not
dead and will relieve me from this sit
uation he felt of my heart and pulse
for a moment and then i heard him
say in answer to the anxious inqui
ries
yes madame i ain sorry to say
he is entirely gone my art can avail
him nothing
the voices became lower and i listen
ed in vain
it was a long dark pausethen the
butters were closed and persons trod
lightly across the floor and spoke to
each other in an under tone as if the
place were sacred the silent awe
which pervades the chamber of death
and hushes the voice as if the senseless
clay could hear had passed over their
spirits like breath stains upon glass
i heard the low confused murmur of
voices drowned through the darkened
chambernow and then the door
opened and some one bent over me and
gazed at me while scalding tears fell
upon my face then the room was
emptied of all persons and i was left
alone in the darkness and stilluess i
listened for voices for anything was
better than this dreary stillnessbut in
vain a spell was on the house its
sounds of laughter its rapid footsteps
its bustle and noise were gone and
every step was careful and slow and
every voice a whisper so went on
hour after hour and i still lay helpless
and longing for the the moment when i
should be able to move and loosen my
self from the close deathly grasp which
almost pressed the life out of the body
as i lay thus i suddenly heard a
birds gush of song from the tree be
neath my window how joyfully it war
bled unconscious of the agony so near it
and how my heart sickened within me
as  heard it
soon persons came and wrapped me
up in white linen and swathed my limbs
and made the horrible funeral arrange
ments some one said how ghastly
his eyes look and then gently pressed
down the lids over the balls of my
eyes never till then did i dream that
this accursed spot on which my gaze
had been riveted for so many hours
could become dear to me the thought
that we are viewing any object how
ever mean for the last time always
raises its importance and gives it a fic
titious value and now this spot was like
the straw to a drowning man the silver
light of sunlight in a prisoners dungeon
the last link to this visible earth i
strove in vain to keep open the lids
slowly they yielded to the pressure of
the fingers and gradually the range of
vision became more and more confined
until all was utterly out never had
the fear of being buried alive suggest
ed itself but now it came over me like
a gulphing wave i thought that i
should be laid down alive in the charn
elhouse among the decaying corpses
and stifled from the clear breath of
heaven famish if indeed i were not
dead already all the frightful stories
of such occurrences that i had ever
read came to my mind and the hope of
ultimate recovery got feebler and fee
bler
the night came and how dreary and
unending it seemed one after the
other  heard the hours struck by the
clock until at last from pure exhaus
tion i lost my senses it must hsve
been late in the morning when i return
ed to consciousness f felt kstwlg upon
methey were lifting me into the cof
in  heard them screw in screw after
crew until the lid was fastened sad
only the narrew space remained open
i felt the side of the coffin jar and rob
against my arms and i despaired that i
should sver recover my power of me
lien
the coffin was lifted and pieced upon
a table some one asked when i was
to be buriedthis afternoon wasj
the answer he has now been dead
two days i bad then been uncon
scious for the length of a whole day
now the time instead of dragging a
weary length seemed to fly with a
lightninglike rapidity the past
seemed endlessly longthe future was
foreshortened to a breath a moment
the clock ticked faster and faster and
time seemed to pour itself away in rap
id moments as a rising thunder cloud
empties its fierce heavy drops more and
more rapidly
it was afternoonthe company gath
eredthe shutters creaked beside ine j
and the window was open i felt the
warm breath of the spring air steal
over my face like e delicious odor ij
heard the birds singing among the i
branchesthe clergymans voice re
peating the first lines in the service
for the deadl am the resurrection
and the life c
his voice ceasedsome one raised
the lid of the coffin to screw it down
prior to its removal i heard a faint
exclamation from some one bending
over me
good god he must be alive yet
there are drops of perspiration upon his
forehead bring a mirror and place
it to his lips he may breathe yet
believe me those painful moments i
would not suffer again if the price
should be a showering of the wealth and
glory that the world can bestow such
suffering does not leave a man where
it finds him i arose from my bed an
altered man with my moral and mental
constitutions completely changed
anecdote burns
on one occasion says mr k
our informant burns had been in the
habit for some weeks of laying aside
a few pence weekly from his slender
earnings to purchase a book entitled
scottish melodies wnich he had read
and was anxious to own by the most
rigid economy he at length acquired a
sum sufficient to obtain the greatly de
sired work when passing by a wretch
ed cottage he heard the cry of children
for bread prompted by the generous
feelings of his heart he entered to learn
the condition of the family and found a
weak emaciated mother engaged with
her needle sewing together some rags
to cover her half naked children they
were shivering around her without food
or fire exposed to the inclemcnces of a
cold november wind which found its
way thro many an open crevice into
their miserable tenement
the woman informed him that her
husband had left them several weeks
before in a drunken frolic since which
time they had not heard from him end
that they had that morning eaten their
last meal of potatoes this was the
only kind of food they had tasted for
several days nor did they know from
what source they were to obtain more
burns could hear no more but placing
before them the few shillings he had
suffered such selfdenial to procure
without waiting for the thanks of the
grateful family except as they were ex
pressed by tears of joy retraced his
steps homeward often says mr
k have i heard him say he ex
perienced more pleasure from that act
than he should from the possession of
the best library in the kingdom
cultivate energy
many of the physical evils the want
of vigor the inaction of system the
languor and hysterical affections which
are so prevalent among the delicate
young women of the present day may
be traced to a want of welltrained and
mental power and well exercised self
control and to an absence of fixed hab
its of employment real cultivation of
the intellect earnest exercise of the
moral power the enlargement of the
mind by the acquirement of knowledge
and the strengthening of its capabilities
for effort the firmness of the endurance
of inevitable evils and for energy in
combatting such as may be overcome
are the ends which education has to at
tain weakness if met by indulgence
will not only remain weakness but be
come infirmity the power of the mind
over the body is immense let that
power be called forth let it be trained
and exercised and vigor both of body
and mind will be the result there is
a homely unpolished saying that it is
better to wear out than to rust out
but it tells a plain truth rust consumes
faster than use better a million times
better to work hard even to the short
ening of existence than to eat and
sleep away the precious gift of life
giving no other cognizance of its pos
aeasiott by work or industry of
whatever kind it may be we give a
practical knowledge of the value of life
