weeks since i saw a communication in
your paper from rev h h garnet
as our friend with yourself has fre
quently been engaged in such assem
blies and know how difficult it is to
adopt a set of measures unless they
have previously been considered and j
as the subject of moral reform has
so many ramifications would it not be
well to specify some particular branch
which it will be its objeoi to promote i
understand me to offer no objection to
the suggestion for  feel a deep inter
est in any such resolution and i think
it would be ungenerous and unreasona
hie to suppose that any man is ignorant
of the effect of concentrated action in
u community where the means of the
people individually are limited
so peculiar is the position we occu
py from a multiplicity of causesthose
causes it is not tny purpose to discuss
but  may simply assert that the
manner in which our ancestors were
introduced into this country that is as
servants and of them the most abject
not possessing any knowledge of the
language of the nation being kept in
ignorance of it and so servile for a
century or two as not to excite fear in
the bosom of the oppressor by mani
fest restlessness
that our situation is different from
that of all other men must he admitted
no other class of men is subjected to
the same species of caste consequent
ly our exodus can only be through the
establishment of new reciprocal rela
tions we want loan and trust com
panies formed of the united capital of
our people that the man of genius and
enterprise who has cultivated a knowl
edge of the sciences or mechanic arts
may have the means to engage in his
tavorite profession do we want to
engage in commercial enterprise then
will we have the facilities for forming
companies on a permanent basis there
by placing our men on the stage of ac
tion where they will have their faculties
expanded and fully developed for it is
the occupation which controls his mind
this is something worth doing how
could we face posterity if nothing is
done by us to elevate the standard of
manhood from its present degraded
situation true our parents have done
much in some instances by accumu
lating property and educating theirj
children hut what is that compared
with the obligation which rests upon us
are there any who would ask what
claims posterity can have on us let
thern look around and behold the great
disparity between us fas colored men
and the mass of men how free and
unrestrained the onehow abject and
degraded the other would it not be
well for some of our leading men to 
think of this

frederick dolglass l greatly
rejoiced in reading in ihe north star of
nov  last an article headed the
blood of the slave on the skirts of the
northern people every rational
mind laborng in the cause of human
rights must admit this to he an unde
niable fact the people of the north
like the egyptian taskmasters who
kept the israelites in bondage wield
the power that rivets the chain upon
three millions of american citizens
and lamentable to think that even
friends in the city of brotherly love
distinguished with the plain garb de
posited their votes at the recent elec
tton for a modern pharaoh as their
the north star
 ruler for the next four years i hop
the north star will boldly expose this
hypocrisy in high places for war auc
slavery though both at variance will
their creed has been unhlushinglv pro
moted by them in elevating genera
taylor to the presidency the earnest
prayer of my heart is that you inay
like the man moses be instrumental ir
releasing your brethren from thraldom
oh the guilt of this crooked and per
verse nation wiose salvation methinks
can never be effected other than by a
mighty shaking of the dry bones
america has it is true many valua
ble institutions within her borders even
for those who have the mark on their
foreheads yet  have no desire to em
brace her gifts for they will always be
covered with blood until her great sin
is washed away i cannot consent even
that my children should reap the benefit
of her public schools aud thus feast
upon the price of our brothers blood
may those intellectual powers which a
heavenly father has bestowed upon
you be daily increased with a double
portion of his spirit is the prayer of
thy brother in the cause of humanity

mr wm h topp sir i intended
to have seen you or have written you
a note in relation to mr spragues
proposition to you last friday to be
come a member of the young mens
association but have been so much
engaged in our removal to our new
store that i have been obliged to post
pone it i told messrs sprague and
naton that they had better see you at
once and have the matter withdrawn
as  should dislike to have it brought
before the executive committee inas
much as the same subject had hereto
fore been brought before them and
voted down and knowing well the
minds of the committee in relation to
itthat they would ninetenths of them
oppose it and particularly as you did
not ask to join the society hut was
asked to do so i thought best out or
respect to your feelings to decline en
tertaining the proposition subsequent
ly at the regular meeting of the com
mittee last saturday evening mr j
sprague having stated your wish to have
it laid before them the subject was
brought up and the matter disposed of
by laying it on the table
the action of the committee was
guided by the precedent as it was
opening the door fur ft subject that
would cause us much trouble you
yourself can perceive it in consequence
of the difference of opinion in relation
to the admission of colored people
allow me to say to you as  stated
to sprague and norton that to you
personally i should have no objections
hut should like to have you succeed in
all respects for i have always esteemed
you in this respect the committee ail
agreed and they did not wish os mem
bers ot the executive committee to
introduce a matter that they might be
in favor of as members of the associa
tion and which might cause the society
some trouble
very respectfully

mr geo b steele president of
y m associationsir your note of
the th is received informing inc that
the proposition of my joining the
young mens association was dis
i posed of by the laying of it upon the
table or in other words the executive
committee through whom persons are
admitted to the association refused to
admit me this i was led to expect
would be the result after the conversa
tion i had with messrs norton
sprague and other persons members
of the executive committee yet in the j
absence ot action upon the
case i could not say that i w as or
would be rejectedthat was one rea
son why i insisted upon having my name
submitted for i was anxious to know
for a certainty what would be the result
of my application now knowing
it i can treat the matter understand
ingly
sir the colored people of this coun
try have labored long and severely un
der a system of cruel oppression and
of the most unjust degradation pa
tient and enduring they have been
looked upon thought of and treated by
their fellowmen even by the lowest
grades as well as the higher classes of
society as fit subjects for them to
pour upon the most wicked abuses
they have been a hissing and by
word in town and countrythe butt
of ridicule for all whose better nature
did not restrain them from indulging in
the too common custom much very
much more than is my purpose here to
enumerate have the nominally free
colored people suffered while those uy
whom they were made to sutlerthose
by whom they were degraded heaped
upon them the more abuses for occupy 
ing the position forced upon them that
of mere outcasts from society was
this state of things always to be the lot
or condition of the colored people r
has been the inquiry of many a one
who has passed away from the earth
without seeing one ray ot light to cheer
their hearts with the hope that the fate j
of their descendants would be in the
least degree better others have died
buoyed up with the thought that how
ever man might oppress his fellowman
he was a man still and must possess a
constituent of that better nature which
when warmed into action by those in
right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren
fluences which are possessed more or
less by all gods creatures disposes
his heart to deal justly and to act upon
the immutable principle of right
thus they argued il the colored peo
pie would be respected let them re
spect themselves did they wish to be
men let them stand up in the majesty
and dignity of their manhood and de
clare such to be their determination
and acting consistently with such de
claration the time must come when
they would command the respect and
esteem of that class who formerly des
pised them
the only legacy left to many of us
is the charge enjoined upon us to be
somethingbe more than outcasts from
societyto work out our own destiny
to let it be demonstrated that we are
endowed with all the essentials to qual
ify us for usefulnessto enable us to
perform deeds of charity and benevo
lencethat we possess qualities that
dignify and adorn manthat in a strug
gle for right we have perseverance and
moral courage equal to any emer
gency in a word to force by our own
conduct that current of public senti
ment so strongly set against us to turn
in our favor and bring about an order
of things strangeand new yet in them
selves perfectly natural sir this in
juuctun has been regarded and its
truth in part realized the era which
marked the commencement of this new
order of things has passed by the in
cidents connected with the present his
tory of the colored people show that
among the great and the noble the hu
mane and the gifted of our land are
found those who do not judge of men
by the mere standard of color and
clime but by the more sure guide ol
their goodness of heart and head
colored men true to the purpose that
god intended them urged on by the
hope to realize the full enjoyment ol
equal rights and equal privileges have
buckled on their armor for a moral
warfare and they have done valiantly
did they understand the secret of their
elevation to lie in their being possessed
of whatever tended to elevate those
above them they sought for it was
it the acquirement of knowledge tem
perance virtue ned they be skilled
in the arts and sciences was it ne
cessary that they be doctors or law
yers ministers of the gospel trades
men or mechanics or farmers must
all this be accomplished by them in
spite of all the various encumbrances
which stood up on every side to embar
rass and discourage them yes steadi
ly aiming at the great good so much
desired despite of every obstacle
thrown before them they now possess
cie characteristics which distinguish
t ant good men arftengiher class
es of our fellowcitizens
bear in mind sir under what disad
vantages this has been accomplished
we wanted trades mechanic shops
were closed against usif we sought i
the higher branches of learning the
doors of seminaries and colleges the
ological and medical were barred and
afforded no admittance for us but by
patient perseverance these difficulties
are now to a large extent overcome
friend have been won on every side
on all sides are seen those who are
coming to aid in establishing justice and
equality and think you things can
stop here do you not behold in the
signs of the times that the old order o
things is passing away which doomed
colored men with equal mental capaci
ty w ith equal physical ability and posi
sessmg equally acute sensibility to
stand back while the car which con
tained white men was moving on to
fame and honor have you not ob
served that we live in an age of re
form and that the errors so tenaciously
adhered to through blind prejudice
must be abandoned and place to
that which the intelligence of the times
deems right
sir permit me with feelings of the
utmost kindness towards yourself to
remark that the institution over which
you preside proves by this precedent
here established to be far very far
behind the age of improvement the
act itself is unworthy the name of that
body and will be so regarded by all
men of expansive minds and liberal
sentiments in the country there are
other institutions similar to yours who
do not think it degrading to admit col
ored persons as members i will men
tion the young mens association of
the city of troy which voted h h
garnet who is a black man a life mem
ber and one or two lyceums of con
siderable repute in this state have
had mr samuel r ward another
black man to lecture before them and
nothing wonderful is thought cf it nor
does their reputation suffer by such a
course i have alluded to these in
stances to show you that others with
like objects with your association are
in advanceof you in this respect and i
have yet to learn that to them it has
proven any disadvantage now sir
being one of that class who have so
long felt the iron hoof of prejudice
grinding upon them i through motives
of duty and interest trusting in the
goodness and justice of god shall do
the little in my power to elevate my
self and those with whom i am identi
fied and to gain those rights which
have so long been trampled upon and
denied us
for myself personally i regard it as
of no moment to be denied member
ship in your association on the ground
of complexion for i fool myself none
the less a man bat to reflect that the
colored people in their efforts to im
prove and enlighten themselves are re
pulsed erea by their professed friends
is really discouraging to find our
friends shrink timidly from maintaining
principle which they know and ac
knowledge to be just  say it ia truly
rochester n y friday march  
disheartening and m the bitterness of
our feelings we are almost tempted to
doubt the justice of god in permitting
such things to be
sir yours is a public institution for
literary and moral improvement and as
such it ought to be sustained for it
merits nought for that it does not possess
if it is not useful in inculcating cr
rect principles into the minds of its
members if it does not carry out prac
tically the intent and object of its or
fanization then the public ought to
now it
there are those you depend upon
at home and abroad who aid to make
your institution popular by their lec
tures addresses blc they ought to
know its true character i address
you that through you i may publish
the fact through the length and breadth
of the land that the t aung mens as
sociation for mutual improvement of
the city of albany gravely refuse to
admit colored men to membership no
matter how elevated their standing may
be in the community
i thank you for your esteem of me
even that affords me some little gratifi
cation but how much greater would
be my satisfaction could the respect
you have for me lead you upon all oc
casions to vindicate the interests of my
oppressed race when you know you
would be acting upon your convictions
of right as it has always been my
desire hitherto to merit the esteem of
all good men and particularly those
with whom business or chance led me
to have intercourse with it shall be the
same in future and i hope i shall not
forfeit yours the day will come when
to see the records of this transaction
will make the blush mantle the cheek o
those who voted for iny rejection
hoping to meet with success with a fu
ture committee i conclude this note
by assuring you i shall not fail through
lack of perseverance
truly yours c

we now return into the interior of
africa to ethiopia the most distant
region of the earth whose inhabitants
are the tallest most beautiful and
longest lived of the human race
herodotus the old greek needed a
lesson from american republicans
when he spoke this praise this is
probably one of the most pleasant
healthy countries in the world it be

he proceeds until hundreds of miles
beyond the utmost limits of the kingdom
of the pharaohs he arrives at the
hoary meroe acknowledged to be the
venerable mother of thebes and mem
phis yet even the priests of meroe j
considered themselves a colony from a
people beyond the mountains of the
moon
indeed ethiopia is always mentioned
in ancient mythology with the highest
deference such as could be due to a
a nation far exceeding the rest in its
religion and merit many of the most
learned and sagacious historians
praise them as the wisest and most
civilized of men heeren the
supposition that this early glory which
even now impels travellers to seek to
penetrate the desert which renders
their country inaccessible that all this
is a fiction of poets is preposterous
these traditions must rest upon a more
solid foundation
from this region the arts sciences
and religion civilization itselt must
have proceeded to meroe and axum j
thence to thebes and memphis and
onward to the delta thus arose pow
erful states using the same language
the same writing the same religion
from these countries knowledge was
given to the greeks and through the
romans has been afforded to the
moderns

monroe michsynod on slavery
the following is the report and reso
lutions of the committee on the subject
of slavery
your committee feel that we are
called upon by the imperious voice of
the most high by everything generous
and noble in humanity and by the sub
lime moral and philanthropic move
ments of the age in which we live to
lend our influence as an ecclesiastical
judicatory great or small however that
influence may be to set aright the con
victions of our country and the world
upon the subject of human oppression
slavery even in our own country has
had time to expire could it ever find a
natural death long time have its ad
vocates been called upon to yield up
their unhappy victims every motive
connected with private and social hap
piness with mortal and immortal wel
fare has been placed before them to
induce their compliance that they
will ot how many the proofsand
obstinate no the heart of the slave
master will not relent the statutes of
the slave code will not grow dimfade
to whitenessnever unless the church
withdraw from the institution her sanc
tion and support yea till she withhold
from it her entire sympathy and place
upon it the broad bealof her strong and
universal reprobation this your com
mittee feel prepared to do and for this
purpose propose the passage of the fol
lowing resolutions
resolved that all voluntary and
determined slaveholding except where
persons are held in servitude as a pen
alty for crime is in the opinion of this
body a sin against god
resolved that we believe it the
duty of all philanthropists and of all
christians especially to avow their de
cided disapprobation of the system of
slavery as it exists in the united states
and to withhold their entire counte
nance from all who are in any way
engaged in promoting it
resolved that the voluntary ar
rest and redelivery of escaped slaves
into bondage is inhuman forbidden by
the word of god aud ought to subject
those engaged in it to disgrace and in
famy and if nominal christians to the
discipline of the church
w resolved that we sincerely de
precate the extension of slavery into
the free territories of this civilized and
christian nation and will use all our
religious and political influence and
make our fervent appeal to almighty
god the sovereign of all national des
tiny to prevent it
resolved that we greatly rejoice
in the example set before us by all
civilized nations in their efforts to abol
ish slavery and to expand the cause of
freedom throughout the world
dissolution of the union
in the massachusetts house of re
presentatives on thursday of last
week a petition was presented by mr
greeu of milton from william jenk
ins and sundry legal voters and others
of andover praying for the peaceful
secession of massachusetts from the
union for the reasons weightily therein
set forth we happened to be present
and were struck with the levity which
was exhibited by many on the an
nouncement of the petition and its ob
ject they seemed to regard it as a
capital joke what though it is a tru
ism to say that a state glorying in its
freedom ought not to be in partnership
with states glorying in their slavery
what though the colored citizens of
massachusetts on entering southern
ports are condemned to the chain
gang to fine and imprisonment and to
the auctionblockwhat though the
state is powerless and eao give them
no protection nor obtain for them any
redresswhat though the slave power
has destroyed the liberty of speech and
of the press and the rigid of petition
what though by the compromises of
the u s constitution massachusetts
is implicated in all the crimes and hor
rors of the slave systemwhat though
the government was fundamentally sub
verted by tbe unconstitutional and pro
fligrate annexation of the alaveholdieg
republic of texasto demand for these
reasons s secession of tbe common
wealth from the union excites a smile
of derision what fetoity
mr jpcaon moved that the petition be
read the speaker declared the mo
tion to be carried doubted doubt
ed cried many voices oi s anding
up to be counted however up ards of
a hundred members responded in the
affirmative and only nine in the nega
tive the petition was then read by
the clerk mr green said it dt served
grave and respectfbl consideration and
he therefore moved its refer nc e to a
select committee mr kellogg of
pittsfield moved that it be n feircd to
the judiciary committee and it was
accordingly given that directionlib
erator
from the hartford republican
postage
the prospect of a thorough reform
io postage during the present session
of congress grows each day smaller
mr dixons motion to abolish the
franking system meets with hostility
from many members and we judge
cannot pass the present house and he
must have an unusual endowment of
hope who can expect that the present
house will vote away their most highly
prized privilege to do this they must
needs be conscientious philanthropic
men and conscience and philanthropy
have but few adherents in congress
comparatively speaking at present
the franking privilege is one of the
moat powerful political engines in the
country as through it a flood of politi
cal documents are scattered over the
whole land the manuer in which cer
tain knowing ones manage the mat
ter is amusing sometimes for in
stance a leading whig in a country
town remits to the member for his dis
trict a list of the names of the doubtful
politicians within his knowledge there
are always many such in every town
and they are generally of a calibre of
mind fit to be worked easily uponthe
list is forwarded to washington and in
a few days the doubting ones are pleas
antly surprised with some public docu
ment from the hon m c for their
district in multitudes of cases this
very notice or attentionfor the rcci
cipient supposes that the congressman
thinks him a man of consequence and
to be treated accordinglysaves the
faltering whig to the party this
mode of electioneering the party tacti
cians cannot afford to lose and they
will not give it up until compelled by
their outraged constituents then the
natural love of fame conspires against
the reform many speeches are stitchec
together in the form of pamphbts a
washington that would rrur b
read were it not for their distrihutioi
among halfstarved politicians in tb
country
in england not even the queei
herself dares demand the right to sem
a single letter through the mails with
out paying even as the poorest clod
hopper her penny the members o
parliament the peers the high chan
cellors whatever else they may do
have not the effrontery to ask for sue
a gross infringement upon the rights o
the people how it is that members o
our congress can have the impudenci
to cling to this exceedingly unpopulai
privilege we cannot see notwithstand
ing the many selfish reasons therefor
the most ludicrous reason for a con
tinuation of the present system of higl
postages was presented to the house
the other day by mr cobb of ga
he said that it would flood the south
with a copper currency that the
people will not suffer the aristo
cratic south despises a copper cur
rency cents are too plebeian for them
and nothing short of silver dimes ar
allowed to cross the frontiers of thal
land of chivalry and negrowhipping
well we are certainly in favor of a
postage bill that shall discriminate in
favor of the south let them pay in
silver to the amount of a handsome
quarter if they pleasein that mannei
they may succeed in sustaining theii
own offices which they never did yet

indian lectures
a very intelligent half blood indian
of the ojibbeway nation has been de
livering lectures in relation to indian
wrongs at the tabernacle with con
siderable success when mr craw
ford of georgia some years ago pro
posed international marriage between
the whites and the indians there was
one universal shout of indignation
raised from one end of the union to
the other and yet mr crawford was
right it has since been conceded
that he was right for what we see of
education and civilization among the
indians are among the halfbreeds
the horror of such a proposition was
magnified from an apprehension that
the next step would be amalgamation
with the blacks but the uncorrupted in
dians are a race of intellectual and
brave people only corrupted by inter
course with the whites who taught
them to drink to avoid industry and to
neglect that soil which the white men
coveted and finally possessed in a
few generations these international
marriages would entirely destroy the
indian race the indian lecturer
however has no such object in view
he has no desire to see the indian race
destroyed by marriage by small pox
rum or firearms but more particularly
wishes to bave the united states give
them a permanent boom from which
they shall never be driven and to each
man a farm in the far west where
they may cultivate the arts of civiliza
tion become industrious pious sober
honest men and be represented by
delegates in congress to all of this
we say amen with all onr bearu it
is due for all we bave despoiled loom
for all the vast and valuable tracts of

j mrs hemans an essay in a late
i number of blackwood on mrs he
mans contains some interesting partic
ulars of her private history the
following is an extract
not long after the first publication
of her poems the next great event of
t her life took placeher introduction to
lcapt hemans the young poetess
was then only fifteen in full glow of that
 radiant beauty which was destined to
j fade so early the mantling bloom of
j her cheeks was shaded by a profusion
of natural ringlets of a rich golden
brown and the evervarying expres
sions ofher brilliant eyes gave a changc
tul play to her countenance which
would have made it impossible for any
painter to do justice to it no wonder
i that so fair a creature should excite the
admiration of a gallant captain and
the love on both sides was ardent and
sincere for capt hemans soon alter
their introduction was called upon to
embark with his regiment for spain
i on his return in  they were mar
 ried of their domestic happincs or
 unhappiness nothing is saidbut six
 years after in  we were simply
i told that the captain went to rome
and never returned the separated
pair never met again
to dwell on this subject says her
biographer would be unnecessarily
painful yet it must be stated that no
thing like a permanent separation was
contemplated at the time nor did it

perilous adventurea gentle
man wished to have in his posession a
living specimen of the chough or
cornish crow a bird which is now be
coming very rare and which always
builds in the precipitous sides of the
cliffstwo brothers engaged to fur
nish hirn with young birds from the nest
they accordingly provided themselves
with a rope and proceeded to a place
which they knew to be frequented by
these birds one of them tied the end
of a rope round his waist and his bro
ther lowered him over the edge of the
clift holding the rope in his hand
when he arived opposite the nest he
found that they were built under an
overhanging rock so as to be beyond
his reach nothing daunted he set
the rope swinging until he was earned
into the hollow when he held fast by the
rock but finding the rope too short to
allow him to gain the nest he untied it
from his waist climbed into the cavity
and secured his prize which he stowed
away in his bosom meanwhile the
rope had swung back to the perpendic
ular and was resting motionless with
out hesitation he called to his brother
above stand by the rope im going to
leap to it 
he did so but the rope as might
have been expected slipped through
bis hands and he fell into the sea
the brother felt the jerk and looking
over the edge of the clift saw him
neither dashed to pieces nor drowned
but rubbing the water from bis face
and exclaiming carry my shoes
round to the cove ill be round as soon
as thee and so he was bringing bis
birds safe with him this event bap

the lonj agony is orerthe conspiracy to

the inroads of slavery is signally defeated
the senate has been fairly driven from its un

ly assumedand at  oclock this morning
liic xxxth ongrcss dissolved having failed
to pass anv lull for the organization of thr
new territories and having passed the civil
and ihponiaiic ppropriation hill entirely
clean of any provision on the subject the
house bill extending the i s revenue laws
to california was finally passed by the senate
ami with the civil and diplomatic appro
priation bill signed by the president so that
all necessity of an extra session is  trust
happily averted the question of slavery in
the territories goes over is adjourned but
not like this congress without day it will
come up among the first and most unjiortant
business of the next congress at its first ines

slavery can never again be so strong as it
was last week in the eddy between an ex
piring and an incoming administration on
the whole then considering how much worse
we might have donewere almost sure to do
when the house met last evening think
we have had a good deliverance  would
not for much have the question back where it
stood one day since the chances were at

amendment of the senate w ould bv this hour

will permit the scenes and incidents of last
night m the house iwillspeak only of the
croat question leaving all beside for a future
letter
the house met after recess at c the scats
soon filled the lobbies and galleries densely
crowded it was soon known that the joint
committee of conference on the civil and di
plomatic appropriation bill had failed to
agree and as soon as the other important
bills had been disposed of a report was made
to that effect in point of fact the committee
had compromised all the numerous disagree
ments of the two houses except that on the
senates interpolation of the walker oigani
zation of california that was insisted on by
the senates committee and repudiated by
that of the house and all attempts to find
some medium ground were fruitless i re
gret to say that by the course things finally
took the house was brought to recede from
all its amendments except that rejecting the i
walker addition to the bill so that the appro
priations passed as they came from the sen
ate and not as the joint committee agreed to
modify them which throws several heavy
and in the house judgment needless andj
prodigal items of extra expenditure upon the
treasury this should have heen otherwise
hut  believe the rules made it imperative
the technical shape being that the senate
mustl while the house readed the effect
was as above stated
the subject being thus before the house
the motion first in order of the multitude
made by the members all at once struggling
in wild tumult for the floor was that propos
ing that the house recede from its disagree
ment with the senate opening the question
to farther amendment and this motion pre
vailed bv yeas  nays b pennsylvania
nnd maine voted strongly in the majority as
the yeas and nays will show mr murphy
of n y and as  understood mi clapp
of maine changed from the negative to the
affirmative after the vote had heen taken so
that the vote originally stood yeas  nays
 so the house decided to recede and
the proposition was now open to amendment
the vehement yell of mr speaker
rose from the scores who jumped on thej
instant for the floor the speaker gave it to
mr morehead of ky who briefly spoke of
the absolute necessity of some adjustment ol i
this difference and his anxious desire to settle
it on terms honorable and just to all parties i
he trusted he should be able to propose an i
amendment to the senates proposition wljicli
would render it acceptable to the majority ol
the house and that a direct vote would be
taken thereon he moved that the woidsl
west of the rio irande should liestricken
out of the senates amendment and a proviso
added to it that nothing herein contained 
should he construed as affecting in anv way
the question of the boundary of texas the
fleet of this was to organize nil the territo
rv acquiied from mexico m the same more or
bss and leave all questions ol boundary to
he adjusted hereafter lie concluded by i
moving the pievious question ilic question
on seconding was taken by tellers ami ii
was carried the south again triumphant byj
ir to io
aml now the question was raised on the
effect of the previous question mr cobh
of la and his side contended that it applied
to turning with ite scnatr as well as to the
amendment proposed by mr moiehead the
hair ruled otherwisethat it was competent
for mr m to have moved to amend and
hgioe io the senates proposition as amended
and to call ike previous question on the dou
ble motion but in point of fact lie had not
done so and the simple previous question
applied only to the amendment mr cobh
appealed hut the apjieal was not pressed to a
vuit mr morehead on being appealed to
stating that he certainly inu tided hta motion
vo have the effect of ordering the main ques
tion on agreeing with the senates proposition
as amended hut lie would not or rlid not
say that he had nude the motion in that form
so the appeal trom the speaker though a
good deal talked aitout was not pressed
tne question on ordering the main question
was taken by yeas and nays and the ayes

taken on mr moreheadb amendment which

here the efleet ot tte pievtoua question
was exhausted and the wild rush of half the
house for the floutthe universal yell of
mi speaker was renewed the hair 
gave the floor to mr k thompson of i

and who evincing much emotion proceeded
to make a speech much like mr moreheads

mad folly hey perpetrated the night wort
in declining to aeod hack the bill to the
senate as amended on mr w hnnta mo
tion many of them held out  the last
neglecting to sole or voting with the south
others voted yea protesting that it was all
wrong and that we were running into a trap
finally all but two or three were brought to

agreed toyeas  nays  and the
house having receded from all its other disa
greement with the senate the bill asamemh

house still intensely excited proceeded very
irregularly to other basmes mainly because
they must await the senates action on the
thompson substitute
i shall not follow the matter into the sen

course taken by the house was fully vindi
cated by the contortions with which the pill
was faced in that body now the disorder

resorted to by a part of the friends of i ree

seen shifted to the other side  have passed
over these as exhibited on one side in the
house and shall do the same w ith the same
course on the other side in the senate they
were unwise and illconsidered but in view
of the strong probability that the house would
accede to the senates amendment they
were not unprovoked had mr morehead i
call for tho previous question taken the
shape ot mr thompsons or had it as made
had the effect mr m intended the house
 would have been brought before midnight to
a vote on the naked question of concurrence
with the senates proposition as amended by
mr morehead and under the fear of losing
the bill altogether it uovld lace concurred
beyondpustion i can count the voles which
would certainly have carried that proposition
by six or eight majority if required e
escaped simply through that mischance of
our adversanes
at lengthafter weary watching till 
oclock in the morning when even garrulty
had exhausted itself with talking on all man
ner of frivolous pretexts and relapsed into
grateful silencewhen proflligacy had been
satiated with rascally votes oi the public
money in gratuities to almost every body con

that the senate had receded altogether from

came the senates concurrence in the house

and a message was sent witii both bills to

the constitution ami shivery
the assertion which we made five weeks
ago that the constitution if strictly con
i stnied according to its reading is not a pro
slavery instrument has excited some interest
i amongst our antislavery brethren letters
have reached us from different quarters on the
i subject some of these express agreement
j and pleasure with our views and others
surprise and dissatisfaction each class of
 opinion and feeling is represented in the let
ters which we have placed in another part of
this weeks paper the one from our friend
i gerrit smith represents the view which the
i liberty parly take of this subject and that of
mr robert forten is consistent with the
 ground occupied by a majority of the ameri
can antislavery society
whether we shall be able to set ourselves
light in the minds of those on the one side of
this question or the other and at the same
time vindicate the correctness of our former
assertion remains to be seen  one thing
however we can assure our readers and that
is that we bring to the consideration of this
subject no partizan feelings nor the slightest
wish to make ourselves consistent with the
creed of either antislavery parly and that
our only aim is to know what is truth and
what is duty in respect to the matter in dis
pute holding ourselves perfectly free to
change our opinion in any direction and at
any time which may he indicated by our im
mediate apprehension of troth unbiased by
the smiles or frowns of any class or party of
abolitionists the only truly consistent man
is he who will for the sake of being right to
day contradict what he said wrong yesterday
sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof
true stability consists not in being of the
same opinion now as formerly but in a fixed
principle of honesty even urging us to the
adoption or rejection of that which may seem
to us true or false at the everpresent now
lieforc entering ujion a discussion of the
main question it may be proper to remove a
inisajiprehension into which gerrit smith and
robert forten seem to have fallen in respect
to what we mean by the term strictly con
strued according to its reading as used by
us in regard to the constitution upon a
second reading of tiiese words we can readily
see bow easily they can be made to mean
more than we intended what we meant
then and what we would be understood to
mean now is simply thisthat the constitu
tion of the rtilted states standing alone and
construed only in the light of its letter with
out reference to the opinions of the men who
framed and adopted it or to the uniform uni
versal and undeviating practice of the nation
under it from the tune of its adoption until
now is not a proslavery instrument of this
admission we are perfectly willing u give
our esteemed fiiend gerrit south and all w ho
think with bun on this subject the fullest
benefit accompanied however with this ex j
pin nation tint it w as made w ith no view to
give the public to understand that wt bald
this construction to be the proper one of that
instiumenl and that it was drawn out merely
because we were unwilling to go before tbe
public oe an narrow an imue and ooe about
which there could be ao little raid on either
aide flaw a document would appear under
ooe construction is ooe thing but whether
that cod ruction be tbe right ooe is quite
another and a very different thing con
found leg these taro things baa led genii
smith to think too favorably of ns and robert
forteo too unfavorably we may agree with
the roman catholic that the language of
christ with respect to the sacrament if coo
at rued according to reading tooehco tbe
doctrine of iransobstantiatioo but the admis
sion is nut final neither are we understood
by so doing to sanction that tiratiooal
though literal doctrine neither roman
catholic nor protestant could attach any im
portance to such an admission it would
neither afford pleasure to the catholic nor
pain to the protestant hoping that we have
now made ourselves understood on this point
we proceed to the general question
the constitutionality of sla vest
the constitution of the united states
what is it who made it for whom and
for what was it made is it from heaven or
from men how and in what light are we
to understand it if it be divine divine
light must be our means of undrstanding it
if human humanity with all its vices and
crimes as well as its virtues must help us to
i a proper understanding of it all attempts to
explain it in the light of heaven must fail it
is human and must be explained in the light
of those maxims and principles which human
beings have laid down as guides to the under
standing of all w ritten instruments covenants
contracts and agreements emanating from
human beings and to which human beings
are parties both on the first and the second
part it is in such a light that we propose lo
examine the constitution and in this light
we hold it to be a most cunninglydevised and
wicked compact demanding the most con
stant and earnest efforts of the friends of
righteous freedom for its complete overthrow
i
it was conceived in sin and shapen in mi
quily but this will he called mere decla
mation and assertion mere heat without
lightsound and fury signify nothing
have it so let us then argue the question
w ith all the coolness and clearness of whieli
an unlearned fugitive slave smarting under
the wrongs inflicted by this unholy union is
capable we cannot talk lawyer like
about law about its emanating from the
bosom of god about government and of
its seat in the great heart of the almighty
nor can we in connection with such an ugly
matteroffact looking thing as the united j
states constitution bring ourselves to split i
hairs about the alleged legal rule of interpre
tafion which declares that an act of the
legislature may be set aside when it contra
venes natural justice we have to do with
facts rather than theory the constitution j
is not an abstraction it is a living breathing
fact exerting a mighty power over the nation
of which it is the bond of union
had the constitution dropped down from
the blue overhanging sky upon a land un
cursed by slavery and without an interpreter
although some difficulty might have occurred
in applying its manifold provisions yet so
cunningly is it framed that no one would
have imagined that it recognized cr sanc
tioned slavery but having a terrestrial and
not a celestial origin we find no difficulty in
ascertaining its meaning in all the parts which
we allege to relate to slavery slavery ex
isted before the constitution in the very
states by whom it was made and adopted
slaveholders took a large share in making it
it was made in view of the existence of sla
very and in a manner well calculated to aid
and strengthen that heavendaring crime
take for instance article ist section d
to wit representatives and direct taxes
shall ire apportioned among the several states
which may be included within this union
according to theii respective numbers which
shall be determined by adding to the whole
number of free persons including those bound
to service for a terra of years and including
indians not taxed threefifths of all other
persons
a diversity of persons are here described
persons bound to service for a term of years
indians not taxed and threefifths of all other
jorsons now we ask in the name of com
mon sense can there be an honest doubt that
in stales where there are slaves that they
are included in tiiis basis of representation
to us it is as plain as the snn in the heav
ens that this clause does and was intended
to mean that the slave states should enjoy a
representation of their human chattels under
this constitution beside the lerm fkee
which is generally though not always used
as the correlative of slave all other persons
settles the question forever that slaves are
here included
it is contended on this point by lysander
sjkioner and others that the words all
other ersons used in this article of the
constitution relates only to aliens we deny
that the words will bear any such construe
tion are we to presume that the constitu
tion which so carefully points out a class of
persons fut exclusion such as indians not
taxed would be silent with respect to an
other class w hich it was meant equally to ex
clude  we have never studied logic but it
does seem to us that such a presumption
would be very much like an absurdity and
the absurdity is all the more glaring m ben il
is lemembered that the language used imme
diately after the words excluding indiana
not taxed having done with exclusions it
includes all other persons it is as easy to
suppose that the constitution contemplates
including indians against its express de
claration to the contrary as it is to suppose
that it should be construed to mean the exclu
sion of slaves from the basts of representa
tion against the express language including
all other persons where all are included
nose remain to be excluded the rasaoniugi
of those who take the opposite view of hi
clause appears very much like quibbling to
use no harsher word one thing is certain
about this clause of the constitution it is
thisthat under it the slave system has en
joyed a large sod domineering representation
in congress which has given laws to the
whole union in regard o slavery ever since
the formation of the government
satisfied that the view we have given ol
this eltnse of the constitution is the only
sound interpretation of h we throw at oace
all those parts and particulare of the instru
ment which refer to slavery mod constitute
what we concern to be the sfeveholdgr
prontue of the coostitotien below the
reader and beg that be win look with candor
upon the comments which we propose to make
opoo them
art sth sec otbcongress shall base
power to suppress insurrections
art ist see tbthe migration or
importation of any eocb persons as any of the
states now existing shall think proper to ad
mit shall not be prohibited by congress prior
to the wear one thousand eight hundred and

not exceeding ten dollars for each person
art th sec dno person held to

shall guarantee to every state in this union a
republican form of government and shall
protect each of them against invasion ami on
application of the legislature or of the ex
ecutive wheu the legislature cannot be con
vened against domestic violence
the first article and ninth section is a full
complete and broad sanction of the slavetrade
for twenty years in this compromise of the
constitution the parties to it pledged the na
tional arm to protect that infernal trade for
twenty years while all other subjects of
commerce were left under the control of con
gress this species of commerce alone was
constitutionally exempted and why was
this the case simply because south carolina
and georgia declared through their delegates
that framed the constitution that they would
not come into the union if this traffic in hu
man flesh should be prohibited mr rut
ledge of south carolina a distinguished
member of the convention that  ranted the
constitution said if the convention thinks
that north carolina south carolina aod
georgia will ever agree to the plan unless
their right to import stares be untouched the
expectation is vain mr pinckney said
south carolina could never receive the plan
if it prohibits the slavetrade in conse
quence of the determination of these states
to stand out of the union in case the traffic
in human ilesh should be prohibited and from
one general desire to establish a union this
nintii section of the first article was adopted
as a compromise and shameful as it is it is
by no means more shameful than others which
preceded and succeeded it the slaveholding
south by that unyielding tenacity and con
sistency with which they usually contend for
their measures triumphed and the dough
face north was brought to the disgraceful
terms in question just as they have been ever
since on ail questions touching the subject of
slavery
as a compensation for their base treachery
to human freedom and justice the north were
permitted to impose a tax of ten dollars for
each person imported with which to swell the
coffers of the national trearsury thus bap
tising the infant republic with bloodstained
gold
art  sec this article was adopted
with a view to restoring fugitive slaves te
their masters ambiguous to be sure but
sufficiently explicit to answer the eud sought
to be attained under it and in accordance
with it the congress enacted the atrocious
law of  making it penal in a high
degree to harbor or shelter the flying fugitive
the whole nation that adopted it consented
o become kidnappers and the whole land
converted into slavehunting ground
art  sec pledges the national arm
to protect the slaveholder from domestic vio
lence and is the safeguard of the southern
tyrant against the vengeance of the outraged
and plundered slave under it the nation is
bound to do the bidding of the slaveholder to
bring out the whole naval and military power
of the country to crusli the refractory slaves
into obedience to their cruel masters tims
has the north unfler the constitution not
only consented to form bulwarks around the
system of slavery with all its bloody enormi
ties to prevent the slave from escape but lias
planted its uncounted feet and tremendous
weight on the heaving hearts of american
bondmen to prevent them from rising to gain
their freedom could pandemonium devise a
union m re inhuman unjust and affronting to
god and man than this yet such is the
union consummated under the constitution of
the united states it is truly a compart de
manding immediate disannulment and one
wljicli lfith our view of its wicked require
ments we can never enter
we might jtwt here drop the pen and the
subject and assume the constitution to be
what we have briefly attempted to prove it to
be radically and essentially proslavery in
fact as well as in its tendency and regard
our position to be correct beyond the jiossi
hility of an honest doubt and treat those who
differ from us as mere cavillers bent upon
making the worse appear the better reason
or we might anticipate the objections which
are supposed to be valid against ihat position
we are however disposed to do neither
we have too much resjieet for the men op
posed to us to do the former and have too
strong a desire to have those objections put in
their most favorable light to do the latter
we are prepared to hear all sides and to
give the arguments of our opponents a candid
consideration where an honest expression
of views is allowed truth has nothing to
fear
and now if our friend gerrit smith dew res
to be heard on the other side the columns of
the north star are at his service we ean
sure him that he cannot have a stronger
wish to tarn every rightful instrumentality
against slavery than we have and if the
constitution can be so turned and he eaa
satisfy us of the fact we shall readily gladly
and zealously turn our feeble energies is that
direction the case which our friend gerrit
smith put to us in his letter is a good one but
foils in s most important particular and that is
analogy the ouly likeness which ws ess
e in the supposed cane of a bargain with
brown to that of the bargain entered into
by the north sod the sooth is that there is
grom dishonesty in both so for there is a
sinking similarity but no further the par
ties that made the corutimtion aimed to
beat and defraud the slave who was not
himself a party to the compact or agreement
it was entered into asderstaodingly on both
daa they both designed to purchase their
freedom and safely at the expense of the un
brntnd slave the north were willing to

cally nor yet elaborately but simply to re
duce it to a plain easy comprehension of the
most obtuse reason though the principles
of political economy generally apply to a na
tion yet the habits of industry apply more
particularly to individuals who compose a na
tion or community
nations are but great families each indi
vidual citizen or inhabitant constitute the
members who compose that family com
munities such as cities towns villages and
counties may be compared to firms or part
nership companies
all wellbred wellregulated families have
some great fixed principle as a general rule of
conduct and high incentive as the proper
guidance of their children and the indi
vidual members of their household thee
rules being fully established the principles
fixed and the incentives to the higher attain
ments well instilled the character of the
family liecomes established which marks
each individual in his walks through life
an improper departure from rules of a well
bred family is always noticed with regret by
the observer
as it is with families so itis wilh nations
w hatever characteristics distinguish a nation
each citizen or inhabitant thereof should more
or less partake character each edi
zen of a nation should bear the same resem
blance to the great leading traits which mark
the enterprise of that people as the individual
members do to the family to which they
belong
when partnerships are formed it is in
tended for mutual benefit each memler of
the firm is required to make an investment
either of capital or laborthat is money or
work
now suppose that a b and c go into
partnership a invests eleven hundred dol
lars b ten hundred and c has no money
how can cbe beneficial to the concern  he
must give his services his personal attention
to the business m such a manner as to make
it an object with the other partners to have
tiim else he is worth nothing to them but
n order to be serviceable he must be quali
fied to do business otherwise he will be of
m use it will be seen by this that qualifi
cation siid capital or labor and money are
wt as an equivalent against each other
we then as colored peoplefor it is to
iie colored people we address ourselvesmay
regared in position taking the class for the
odividoal as the partner in a firm without
capital having made no available investment
md totally unqualified to render valuable and
eful service the other members or partners

a person signing hitßsclf an amcricar
citizen probably presuming upon the ignor
ance of the english people on the subject o
american slavery ha written a letter dated
from stoke newington to the ixindon lu
quirer in which ik says that slavery is
not au evil of grow ing magnitudein othei
words that slavery is not increasing aboli
tionists will be glad to liear this at variance
though it may be with their generally re
ceived opinion the number of slaves in the
l nion at the period of independence was
about tw there nre now not far from
 and yet the evil is net increasing
 american slavery says he has not even a
tithe of the demoralising debasing cruel ami
oppressing efforts which the slavcty of pal
estine of greece and of home and the serf
dom of kurofie either eastern or western
produced or may still be producing v here
tins  citizcu gets his data from it is dilii
cull to conceive but he must be poorly lead
in the history of the one system and must
have a very meagre knowledge of the other
if he is not aware that there are barbarities
practised lv the american slaveholder which
the homan and greek anil jew never
dreamed of where also at this present
day does he find in any portion of europe
eastern or western the operation of that
coldblooded fiendish policy which forces
ignorance and debasement upon its victims
the american slave system does this in
w hat portion of europe is it made a criminal
act to teach men to read the american slave
system does this in what stale of euiopu
is the selling of ones own progeny legalised
the american slavesystem does tins and
many other things equally hideous am re
volting by the side of which the worst lea
features of european oppression become
virtues
the citizen does not deny that there is
prejudice against color in this country he is
not sufficiently barefaced for that  but l lc
deny savs he that it is an unreasonable and
unnatural prejudice his education must
have been sadly neglected or he would have
known that the word prejudice impliei
the absence of reasoning when one comet
to exercise his reason on any given subject
the conclusion he arrives at ceases to be
prejudice it becomes an opinion hut i dcn
that any man possessed of even very mediocri
powers of argumentation can m the due a
unbiased exercise of those powers arrive a
the conclusion that the color of a mans skii
or the size or shape of his features can ii
any sense or degree allect his claim to tin
rights of manhood and citizenship let thosi
who can prove the affirmative of this hu
they must contrive to get over the  asses
bridge before they attempt ita problen
by the wav which there is reason to feu
this american citizen has not yet mas
tered albeit lie is not alone in this tribula
tion such doctrines are by no means new tc
these regions indeed american citizens ii
a like predicament are as thick as black
berries
the citizen further comparing tin
internal and external slavetrade asks in i
tone of triumph ns if he had found au ex
cuse for the slavedealer is it as immora
to transfer a slave from one person to another
as to plunge an additional human being inti
slavery this is a kind of comparison in
which iam not skilled the entire system is
so atrocious that it is difficult to say which
portion of it is most so but whether this
question is decided or not appears to he a
matter of slight moment he who can sup
press his indignation long enough calmly tc
consider tlie inquiry nmst be to sav the
least not much les callous than the proposer
of it put the question in another form
whether is it worse to si ll ones ow n pro
geny to the slavedealer or to go to africa
mid stea men in order to make them slaves
is not the hare proposal of such a question
monslious but does not liter american
slaveholder both steal and sell ins follow man
is it not a fact that every child of the slave
mother as soon as it comes into existence is
stolen and made a slave god never made
any slaves they are all manmade every
human being ha a right to freedom he
belongs to himself when he is converted
into a slave he is stolen in as complete a
sense as are the poor captives from the coast
ut africa it is all monstrous limitations
horrible
the tenor of these remarks of the amer
ican citizen may he accounted for by the
statement made lowans the conclusion of his
letter that his knowledge of slavery has
been increased by twentysix years resilience
in a slave stale he does not say in what
capacity the probability however is that
he was either a slaveholder a slavedriver or

letter from francis jackson
to the secretary f the massachusetts hum
able mechanic association
i sir lt is well known that fur a long
time the association entertained the project
of building a hall for its use as a place for
holding its meetings and transacting its irnst
ness
i w itii this view land was purchased and
 the long desired object seemed about to he
realized when a sudden and remarkable
change occurred the building of the hall was
abandoned and it was decided to erect
hotel
this has liceii done and the spacious
revere hons e was built and is now owned
by the massachusetts charitable association
at the opening of this house as a hotel
j the members of this association with their
families assembled to view the etah ishment
and partake of a collation
on this festive occasion the president of
the association in an address to the assembled
company is reported to have said this is to
be a temperance housetlufe is to be no bar
nothing will be allowed within its walls
injurious to the public morals or offensive to
good tastenor on this occasion were any
intoxicating drinks seen or served hut the
grateful spectacle was presented of tins
association ot upwards of  meinhi is by
word and deed thus publicly entering their
emphatic protest against tile demoralising
traffic in alcohol lint how lias this volunta
fry pledge been redeemed lat the fact
answer
i lie house had been leased for ten years
without any prohibition against the sale of
intoxicating drinks and it is now a mailer of
common notoriety that the whole fund of the
association upwards of  dollars ib
savings and accumulations of more than half
a century are invested in a rum tavern
yeswe arc now as a society receiving
pecuniary consideration for this imquiio
traffic and through the offie i or agents ot
the association have agreed i do so for ten
years
we have thus iu our associate eapaeitv
done that which as individuals a large por
tion of the memberswould ou uo conaidcia
lion consent to do and we can claim no other
excuse ami offer no latter reason jor uui act
than can the owners of the tippling cellars in
broad and ann streets to wit it puts
money in our piuse towards that portion
tot the association who tiel thal the traffic m
alcohol inflicts serious injury upon society
ami that ail its infimtncts arc demoralizing
this use of the common funds is highly uii
just inasmuch as the associate act is hi dirt t
j opposition to their deepest convictions ai d
most shenshed principlesthey are placed by
it in a false position amt wink on the one
hand as individuals their labour and hopes
are devoted to the cause of temperance on
the other in their associate capacity they are
pandering to the traffic in aicofioi and receiv
ing the wages of thal iniquity
for aught that can lie shown it subjects
them lo the alternative ot itoeonnng partici
pants in wrongdoing or coiiihj them to
withdraw from the association either way
a hardship not to say insult to winch in
common fairness and courtesy they should
not have been subjected
for these reasons i withdraw from the
association with which i have been con
nected for more than a third of a centuarv
and request that my name may he stricken
from tire roil of its members

frederick douglass  was not a little
surprised on learning from your note to mr
c h chase that you have upon a closer
examination of the constitution of the united
states discovered it not to be a proslavery
instrument i e you have found nothing in
the constitution proslavery without en
tering upon an elaborate discussion of this
matter permit me to direct your attention to
the following clause as a part of the written
constitution of this government no per
son held to aervicy or labor in one state
under the lan s thereof escaping into another
shall in consequence of any law therein be
discharged from such service but shall be
delivered up on claim of the party to whom
such labor may be due the question is
are any persons held to aeivice or labor under
the laws of anv of the states ceitainly
slaves arc held to service or labor under the
laws of all the slave states now the con
stitution of the united states expressly de
clares that such persons an held under the
laws of one state escaping into another
shall not be discharged from such service by
anv laws therein c it was not necessary
that iho word since should have been inserted
in the constitution in order to fix its pro
slavery character it is sufficient that the
condition of lbe pnsons referred to is that o
slavery under the laws of the slave states 
stamp it proslavery
there are two classes of persons held t
service or labor in the united states viz tlx
apprentice and the slave the former is belt
for some specific time according to agreemen
betwem the parties the latter forever
undei the above provision in the constitution
either may be retaken in case he escape frnn
the slate in which lie is held while tin
constitution does not in ao many words de
dare slavery to be right it does acknowledgi
the right to hold man as projrerty for unde
the laws of the slaveholding states person
sre held to service or labor perpetually uhicl
co nstitutes a state of slavery and the con
stitution imposes strong harriers against thi
successful escae of such persons so held 
guarantees to the master the right to claim hit
fugitive slaves and prevents any other stati
from affording him defence had the conati
lulion specified that no slave held under th
laws of any stare escaping c it coull
not more clearly have defined the right of ani
slate to hold slavei than it does under tin
provision alluded to what is a slave
is a person held to service or continual labor
unrewaid d under the laws of certain slat si
of this union it has been said that it
this clause the constitution has no direct re
ference to slaves i contend that it has i
direct but not an isclustve reference to alavei
r persons held to service or labor it refen
also to the apprentice if there is nothing u
the cotiatiiutton to justify the decision of the
supreme court then you might with pro
priety vote under it and even swear to sup
port it ihe fact of the supreme court de
nding upon a being proslavery is net thi
ri hki bat  am not disposed to vote unde
it or to swear to support it it is that tht
written constitution according to its reeding
is proslavery and had the supreme court
h luore u ultr lhln lh
oecumtun of sentim f ule aou sut
saa  not be 
lu w ort it m   d o k f rrej
remains in it confirmatory of the falsehood
nor is it in my estmstiou a good reason
not to swear to support simply because the
iramcrs of it and those who adopted it
intended to give it a proslavery character
it would matter but little to me what they in
tended were tbsre not a clause m it p ln j
selling forth that character the corollarj
is the constitution is proslavery because h
sanctions and defends those laws of the slavi
hisus which have made certain persona tub
forever ty efcrtaiu other
rvisoue f
states i e under the laws of soath caro
lina persons ere held to service or labor per
petually without their consent and are there
by rendered slaves and the cotwutuuon of
the united states provides measures for the
recapture and return of each peteeoe the
event of their escaping into another state
it would be satisfactory to mo to road yoor
views upon this subject i am anxious to
know what now light has broke in upon your
mind disclooing the fact that the constitetioa
if strictly construed according to its read
ing is not pmlavery
youn for the whole troth
r b forten
taekton n j feb sit 
faaoaaicx docqlass i see in your last
i stab a call from a correspondent for more
light in regard to a petition recently pre
sented by ibe undemgned to the legislature
of new jersey making a secession of this
state from the american union in answer
to the call i will briefly state the reason pre
sented in that petition for the proposed se
cession
 because the colored people of this state
solely on account of their color cannot visit
the southern states without being subject to
fine imprisonment or enslavement for life in
disregard of that clauae of the u s consti
tution which declares the citizens of each
state shall be entitled to al the privilege
and immunities of citisens in the several
states
 because liberty of speeeh or of th
press in opposition to slavery can be exer
cised by our citizens who visit the southern
states only with imminent peril to their lives
 because it is morally degrading politi
cally disastrous and a glaring paradox for a
state glorying in its freedom to remain in
partnership with states glorying in slavery
 because by the alliance of the north
with the south the slave power has already
been enabled to acquire large territories and
is now reasonably supposed to be plotting for
the annexation of cuba for the extension
and peipetuation of its supremacy
 but especially because by the compro
mises of the u s constitution southern
slaveholders are allowed a slave representa
tion in congress the right to hunt and seiie
fugitive slaves on the soil of new jersey
and to demand in cases of emergency the
aid of new jersey in the suppression of any
attempt by their slaves to obtain that freedom
which is their natural and moral right but of
which they are most wickedly and unjustly
deprived and ao long as the people of this
state consent to these compromises so long 
will they be morally and politically responsible j
for all the cruelties aud horrors of the slave
system
these reasons you will perceive are the
same as those for which the massachusetts
legislature was petitioned to adopt a similar
course they are to my mind conclusive and
satisfactory if the state becomes a paitici
pant in the maintenance of slavery and
makes herself responsible for its extension
and jerpetuity by continuing a member of
the uuion it is certain that she aahould se
cede from the union and thus in some de j
gree cease to do evil
that she is still criminal in other matters
that she still may be considered to some ex
tent a slaveholding state though professing
to be free having changed her slavery in
name at least to apprenticeshipthat she
still refuses to treat her colored citizens as
men and closes her seminaries colleges and
universities the bar and her legislative halls
against themdo not in my opinion consti
tute valid objections to petitioning her to
withdraw her suppoit from the peculiar in
stitution and to cease acting longer as a
watchdog for the southern plantations
at the time of the presentation of my peti
tion the legislature had before it several me
morials praying that the rights of eitixenship
the elective franchise and eligibility to office
might be conferred upon the colored men of
the state these two petitions pointed out
the way and affoided an opportunity to the
stale of shaking off the old man and his
deeds by acting in accordance with their
prayer she chooses however to occupy
her old position and while she refused to re
ceive the one declined granting the reasonalde
request of the other thus she has slmvn
her faith by her works and that faith disen
titles her to the confidence or love of any
irtend of liberty or humanity

report of meetings at rnshville
the friends of tbolition in rushville met
the th inat according to appointment to
consider the case of those in bondage and to
listen to an adddress upon the subject by
frederick douglass the wellknown defender
 of his race and the fearless opponent of sla
very in all its forms ths manner in which
he introduced the subject in the commence
ment of the meeting rendered it obvious to
the proslavery part of the audience that there
was originality and genius yet among the
longdespised race the introduction was
very edifying as were also the remarks of
john s jacobs who in a touching style
gave a brief detail of his sufferings while a
slave the manner of recital was such as to
convince all that be was one of those who by
some strange interference of providence had
escaped from the hands of the taskmaster
in progress of the meeting some remarks
made in defence of the constitution called out
an elderly gentleman formerly from maiy
land who from early association prob
ably entertained a fondness for the chattel
system he had a moat uueueceesful labor
as far as his argument was concerned and a
newly fledged limb of the law came to the
rescue not being able to maintain what his
proslavery friend had aeseited he finally left
for documents which he evidently needed bu
which when procured proved to be the esse
of what mr douglass hsd asserted the
honorable gentlemen left the floor evidently
feeling very much ae the smaller animal did
when he had the honor of contending with a
lion being vanquished consoled himself with
the reflection that it was by a lion the in
terruption was uncalled for and the audience
none the wiser for it save that it paved the
way for some interesting remarks from mr
douglass in regard to the constitution
none of the proslavery gentlemen n
seemed willing to
a uie field of debate
ose the indian mode of warfarekeep
ing up an occasional grumbling in older to
vf ty i h i
draw the attention of the audience or to dw
concert the speaker to deliver the meet
ing front any odium that may be attached
r to it i will say that the utftoontial well bred
i port of the community held then peace nod
i probably were the means of restoring other
who felt disposed to do diffinwatly
j in the evening the ntdieoee was again ad
i dressed upon the subject of slavery but the
star of the room aod some circumstance at
tendant upon warming it rendered the
so intensely cold that it was hnpoaable for th
etowd to remain quiet or for the speaker to
proceed with any degree of comfort many
bad come from a distance with the expecta
tion of hearing an eloqoent harangue and
eonld not understand why a comfortable place
could not have been procured mr douglass
addressed th meeting and was succeeded by
mr jacobs who beiog unable to proceed oo
account of the confusion retired and mr
douglass took the stand aod for several min
utes poured forth s strain of eloquence enough
to warm an iceberg every one seemed to
forget himself and to listen with increasing
interest the sm of holding the image of
i christ in bondage and of selling the human
form appeared more appalling than ever and
the character of tlioec who legalise the ain
seemed to lose the cloak that has so long hung
over it and the cloven foot of the semblance
of justice to display itself the intensity of i
the cold rendeied it imhasible for mr doug
lass to proceed and the meeting closed with
i many regrets that rt should have been a failure
in part
since i wrote the altove we have again
been favored with an address from messrs
douglass and jacobs and under the moat
favorable circumstances th chapel was
very kindly offered and the happy combination
of light and warmth betrayed the generous
spirit of those who if not aholitionials in
general are willing that otliera should speak
their sentiments upon the subject the house
was crowded to overflowing and ths care
taken by the sexton to see that all were pro
perly seated and that every corner was suffi
ciently illuminated prevented all eonfusion
and disturbance of any kind the auditory
were silent and attentive and not one dissent
ing voice was heard during the meeting it
being sabbath evening mr jacobs opened
the meeting with prayer and made some very i
befitting remarks in regard to ths time and i
object of meeting there mr douglass suc
ceeded him and by a chain of argument both
brilliant and profound left the laws and reli
gion of the south in a very perilous position
the sympathies of all were enlisted and their i
judgment appealed to the speaker in my
estimation emphatically posassaea the power
ascribed to george thompson by william l
garrisonthe faculty of thinking on his legs
in an incredible manner the moment hej
rises a perfect crowd of thoughts in the
language of byron seems to surround him
an intense feeling calls up all the resources of
his mind and the love of kindred and free
dom seems to rouse every energy that a
good effect was produced by his efforts is
very trident if we could occasionally have
an abolition lecture of like character it is
doubtful whether there would be so much in
difference upon the subject as there now ex

a novel entertainmentthe mayor
of liverpool and his lady gave a soireeo r con

evening at which about fourteen hundred lai
dies and gentlemen were present one of
the most interesting attractions of the evening
is said to have been the workings of the
elecric telegraph the introduction of which
novel invention of scientific skill had been
effected by a line of wires from the office of
the electric telegraph company to the front
of the town hall and so on through the win
dows of the centre drawingroom all the
apparatus of the electric company had been
perfectly arranged for the purpose and the
instrument was worked with as much ease
and regularity as in the office itself by this
novel arrangement guests had an opportunity
at any time during the evening of commu
nicating with their friends at manchester j
birmingham rugby or london the com
pany moreover were informed at intervals
what was taking place in the houses of par

speaking at the moment and upon what sub
jects they were addressing the legislalure
the first communication which took place at
halfpast nine oclock informed the company
that colonel sipthorpe had just given notice
of a inotiou for the reduction of the salaries of
ministers of onehalf a subsequent com
munication received at ten oclock stated
that lord john russell had given notice that
he should move for a bill to alter the oaths
to lie taken by the members of parliament
a third communication received about half
past ten was to tbe effect that sir horace
grey had moved for leave to continue the
suspension of the hapeas corpus act in ire
land ami that mr john oconnell had vehe
mently opposed it similar communications
were received during the whole of the evening
at siiort intervals and altogether the amuse

john bunyan and wm kiffan
to the names of baxter and howe
most be added the name of a man far
below them in acquired knowledge
but in virtue their equal and in genius
their superior john bunyaa bunyan
had been bred a tinker and had served
as a private soldier in the parliamen
tary army early in his life he had
been fearfully tortured by remorse for
bis youthful sins the worst of which
seem however to have been such as
the world thinks venialhis keen
sensibility and his powerful imagination
made his internal conflicts singularly
terrible he fancied that he was un
der sentence of reprobation that he
had committed blasphemy against the
holy ghost that he had sold christ
and that he was actually possessed by
a demon sometimes loud voices
from heaven cried out to warm him
sometimes fiends whispered impious
suggestions in his ear he saw visions
of distant mountain tops on which the
sun shone brightly but from which he
was separated by a waste of snow he
felt the devil behind him pulling his
clothes he thought that the brand
of cain had been set upon him he
feared that he was about to burst as
under like judas his mental agony
disordered his health one day he
shook like a man in the palsy on ano
ther day he felt a fire within his breast
it is difficult to understand how he
survived sufferings so intense and so
long continued at length the clouds
broke from the depths of despair
the penitent passed to a state of serene
felicity an irresistible impulse now
urged him to impart to others the bles
siugs of which he was himself posses
sed he joined the baptists and
became a preacher and writer his
education had been that of a mechanic
he knew no language but the english
as it was spoken bv the common peo
ple he had studied no great model
of composition with the exception an
important exception undoubtedly of
our noble translation of the bible his
spelling was bad he frequently trans
gressed the rules of grammar yet the
native force of genius and his experi
mental knowledge of all the religious
passions from despair to ecstacy amply
supplied in him the want of learning
his rude oratory roused and melted
hearers who listened without interest to
the labored discourses of great logi
cians and hebraists
his works were widely circulated
among the humbler classes one of
them the pilgrims progress was in
his own lifetime translated into sev
eral foreign languages it was how
ever scarcely known to the learned
and polite and had been during near
a century the delight of pious cottagers
and artisans before it was publicly
commended by any man of high litera
ry eminence at length critics conde
scended to inquire where the secret of
so wide and so durable a popularity lay
they were compelled to own that the
ignorant multitude had judged more
correctly than the learned and that the
despised little book was really a master
piece bunyan is indeed as decidedly
the first of allegorists as demosthenes
is the first of orators or shakspeare
the first of dramatists other aliegor
ists have shown equal ingenuity bul
no other allcgorist has ever been able
to touch the heart and to make abstrac
tions objects of terror of pity and ol
love
it may be doubted whether any en
glish dissenter had suffered more
severely under the penal laws than
john bunyan of the twentyfaseven
years which had elapsed since the
restoration he had passed twelve in
confinement he still persisted in
preachingbut that he might preach
he was under the necessity of disguis
ing himself like a carter he was
often introduced into meetings through
the back doors with a smock frock on
his back and a whip in his band if he
had thought only of his own ease and
safety he would have hailed the in
dulgence with delight he was now
at length free to pray and exhort in
open day his congregation rapidly
increased thousands hung upon his
words and at bedford where he ori
ginally resided money was plentifully
contributed to build a meeting house
for him his influence among the
common people was such that the
government would willingly have be
stowed on him some muncipal office
but his vigorous understanding anc
his stout english heart were prooi
against all delusion and all temptation
he felt assured that the proflerd tol
eration was merely a bait to lure the
puritan party to destruction nor would
he by accepting a place for which he
was not legally qualified recognise
the validity of the dispensing power
one of the last acts of his virtuous
life was to decline an interview to which
he was invited by an agent of the gov
ernment
great as was the authority of bun
yan with the baptists that of william
kiflin was still greater kiflin was the
first man among them in wealth and
station he was in the habit of ex
ercising his spiritual gifts at theii
meetings but he did not live by preach
ing he traded largely his credit on
the exchange of london stood high
and he had accumulated an ample for
tune perhaps no man could at that
conjuncture have rendered more valu
able services to the court but between
him and the court was interposed the
remembrance of one terrible event
he was the grandfather of the two
howlings those gallant youths who
of the victims of the bloody assizesj
had been the most generally lamented
for the sad fate of one of them james
was in a peculiar manner responsible
jeffreys had respited the younger
brother ihe poor lads had
been ushered by churchihll into the
royal presence and had begged for
mercy but the king heart had been
f lhc whoe
family had been great but kiflin was
m i r d he veoty
years old when he ws left destitute
the survivor of those who should have
survived him the heartless and venal
sycophants of whitehall judging by
themselves thought that the old man
would be easily propitiated by an
aldermans gown and by some com
penflttiofl in nouey for the irofiht
which hi graixios had forfeited
peon wo employed in urn work of
seduction but to no purpose the
king determined to try what effect hi
own civilities would produce kiffin
was ordered to attend the palace he
found a brilliant circle of noblemen and
gentlemen assembledjeases ansae
diatelv came to him spoke to him very
graciously and cooduded bv saying
i have pot you down mr kiffin tor
an alderman in london the old man
looked fixedly at the king burst into
tears and made answer sir i am
worn out  am unfit to serve your
majesty or the city and sir the
death of my poor boys broke my heart
that wound is as fresh as ever i shall
carry it to my grave the king
stood silent for a minute in some con
fusion and then aaid mr kiffin 
will find a balsam for that sore as
suredly james did not mean to say any
thing cruel or insolent on the contrary
he seems to have been in an unusually
gentle mood yet no speech that is
recorded of him gives so unfavorable
a notion of his character as these few
words they are the words of a hard
hearted and lowminded man unable
to conceive any laceration of the affec
tions for which a place or a pension
would not be a full compensation
macauleys history
the russian clergy
i ah the writers of every nation and
creed with whom we are acquainted
are unanimous on one point all de
clare una r oce that to appreciate or
even to imagine the k moral or social
degradation of the russian clergy it
is necessary to have lived among them
the very proverbs which are current
in russian society of every class
and which are heard in russia alone
reveal their true character son of
a priest is the last insult to which a
man has recourse in reviling an enemy
am i a pope that i should eat
twicer is the disdainful allusion to the
habits of the half famished clergy
 like pastor like flock is the com
ment upon the irregularities of laymen
and these are only specimens
like the fallen priesthood of syria
and armenia the chief characteristics
of the russian clergy appear to be
habitual drunkenness profound igno
rance and the lowest habits of a sordid
and animal existence the vice of
drunkenness is so common among
them says theiner that it excites
no observation in the ships of the
navy he adds where they always re
ceive an increase of salary the
commanders usually place the chaplain
under arrest twentyfour hours before
divine service to make sure that he
will not present himself drunk at the
altar
their general character may be
gathered from the official and annual
reports of the holy synod itself
in the report for  it appears that
during that single year one in fifty of
the whole russian clergy was under
condemnation by the public censure of
the various tribunals since that pe
riod the moral state of the clergy if
we may believe the reluctant testimony
of the synod has steadily deteriorated
thus in  comparing the number
of condemnations with the total num
ber of clergy it appears that these
amounted for the whole empire to one
in twentyfour in  to one in
twentythree and in  to one in
twenty in the four years from 
to  the synod reports that 
or onesixth of the  ecclesias
tics of every rank and grade were
under judgment and that as the su

canine sagacity
we referred incidentally a few days
ago to the remarkable instance of as
gacity and feeling in a dog which is
the subject of the following circum
stantial statement politely furnished at
our request for publication it comes
of course from an authentic source
and must be reckoned among the most
striking of the many facts in illustra
tion of the reasoning faculties of dogs
in the summer of  my son at
that time  years old was visiting in
the country having occasion to
cross the held of a neighbor the lad
was pursued by a large fierce dog and
as he looked back over his shoulder to
see if the dog was gaining upon him
he stumbled and fell down upon a ledge
of rocks and broke his leg he lay
j helpless of course and the dog came
up in a moment in full cry ready to
pounce upon him as he came up he
seemed to understand that something
had happened to the boy and after
looking at him jong enough to learn
the precise state of the case he set off
i toward the house which was far beyond
the reach of the childs cries but the
dog went only within call aa if fearful
of leaving the boy alone and there
barked for some time without attracting
attention failing in his purpose he
went home and by his incessant bowl
ing and running in the direction from
which he came he succeeded at last
in persuading some of the family to fol
low him to the spotwhere the suffering
child was still lying
now the point of special interest tn
this fact is this the dog unusually
fierce pursued the boy as an enemy
trespassing on his masters grounds
but the moment when he saw his enemy
down and in distress his ferocity was
turned to pity and with far more of
christian principle than most men ex
hibit be resolved to do him good he
sought to save the life which he seemed
bent to destroy instances are numer
ous of dogs displaying great sagacity
for the aid if those dear to them but
this is the only case that has come to
my knowledge where a brute shoved
merry on one whom he regarded as a
foe the best of us may learn a lesson
from this dog who had more heart and
head than any dog of whom i ever
beard or read jycuark dmtiq juw
a night in hindofitan
we came to anchor on the third
morning after quitting kedgeree under
the walla of fort william and found
her majestys d dragoons encamped
on the glacis aboutlour in the after
noon the beat having considerable
abated we disembarked and marched
into the fort where quarters had been
provided for our men though hobo for
the officers as the brigade major ia
formed oa at tho same time stating
that as a difference of opinion existed
on that subject between himself end
the fort major we most wait until be
of the queen had craftily overcome
him of the companys and induced
the latter individual to boose as
there is an old proverb about a man
between two stools being likely to come
to the ground which was felly illustra
ted in our case for both of our sup
porters for a nights test in fort wil
liam having given away we came to
the earth though fortunately in the
tents of the d dragoons immediately
under the walls of the fort where our
foil eras kindly broken by cloaks spread
on the ground to receive us
i was composing myself to sleep as
comfortably as circumstances would
permit when suddenly a volley of
screams as though proceeding from
the lungs of ten thousand demons
caused me to start on my feet suppos
ing the camp to have been invaded by
the infernal regions my host lying
in the opposite recess of the tent being
a man of some days and experience
begged me not to disturb myself as it
was only the jackalls but they are
pretty nearly enough to murder sleep
i thought as i laid myself down to
await the cessation of their intolerable
howls silence at length ensued and
i was just falling asleep when a low
gurgling noise arose close to my ears
and continued with the most monot
onous regularity good heavens
i cried after listening intently for a
few minutes that must come from the
diabolical bandicoots of which i have
often heard from old indians i drew
my sword and awaited their advance
in a violent perspiration for i have an
insuperable abhorrence to the whole
rat tribe but they had no intention ef
coming to close quartersno their
cursed pipes sounded the advance un
heeded by the main body my ene
mies nevertheless seemed to be mus
tering for the gurgle was taken up by
a reinforcement from the opposite tent
interupted occasionaly by a low mut
tering sound i submit it is impossi
hie to sleebp through this interminable
persecution and a mans days in this
climate must be necessarily short with
out rest thus i exclaimed as
jumping up i threw my cloak aside
and paced the tent in a teves saluted
incessantly by the unearthly gurgle
my friend lay on the opposite side
sleeping as calmly as if there were no
such things in the world to torture us
as bandicoots the morning was just
breaking and i stepped out of the tent
in the hope of being taken for a ghost
by the jackalls and thus retaliating by
fright on a portion of my enemies
when lo the veil of mystery was with
drawn and there sat two hindoos
smoking the pipes of the country com
monly known by the name of hubble
bubble which noisy instruments i had
mistaken all night for the bandicoots
this was too absurd i burst into a fit
of laughter which awakened my friend
who hastily joined me when i related
my grievance having silenced the
smokers i soon enjoyed the rest i had
almost despaired of attainingadven

a gold diggers experience a
correspondent of the honolulu sand
which island friend who was survey

the rest of them to gather the root
of all evil gives his experience as

i found digging gold by no means
the enchanting employment many might
dream it to be but a initteroffact
backaching wearisome workmost
nearly resembling for all the world
the heavy toil of a multitude of labor
ers excavating a canal or millrace
the climate of the gold region fron

life in the mountains with plenty to
eat and a good appetite produced by
hard work for sauce is not so repulsive
a thing as one only accustomed to in

but for my part gold digging is a busi
