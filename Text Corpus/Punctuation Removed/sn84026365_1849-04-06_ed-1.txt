the kev lr durbin in his account
of his tour in the east describes a visit
to the slave market of alexandria
where beautiful girls were exposed for
examination and sale like cattle he
concludes the narrative with the re
mark i turned with horror at the
scene before me where virtue had not
even the privilege of contest nor the
apology for temptation are such
scenes any less horrible in the united
states than in egypt or did the pious
dr spend all his sympathy on the nu
bian girls in the alexandrian markets
that he has no word of rebuke for the
similar exposure of american females
in the flesh markets of washington
and baltimore and new orleans or
do the fogs of our atmosphere hide
these enormities from his vision or is it
that he stood in egypt as a man wilhin
the reach of human sympathies and on
his return he has again risen into the
cold eminence of his doctorate away
from the sound and sight of human
wo
dr durbin cannot be ignorant of the
fact that the slave market in the na
tional capitel which daily exhibits
scenes no less shocking to feeling
hearts than the one he describes exists
by the toleration and support of con
gress and the people of the north
vet he professess to preach the gos
pel to this people to be u minister ot
him who came to proclaim deliverance
to the captiveand what word of re
buke does he ever speak against the a
boininations of american slavery and
the slave trade what carnast appeals
does he ever make the men and
women of his own church to unite their
efforts to put away the sin and shame
from ur country and especially from
the capital of the nation we under
stand that the pacha of egypt has pro
hibited the slave markets within his
borders hut they remain in washington
and the american alexandria again
we ask why do we hear no cry of hor
ror no word of rebuke from this great
methodist divine at these inhumanities
in our midst and under our sanction
are shames which mohommedanism
cannot endure to be cherished bv
christians shall cruelties too mon
strous for a despotism and shelter in a
republic and christian minister cry
alls well while the stench of those
pollutions fills the land alas for our
religion which delivers heresy over to
eternal damnation which imprisons
poor newshoys for selling papers on

over heathen and slaves in other lands
but tolerates or licenses the traffic in

tiik case
marshall michigan
jan ist  s
sir  hre or four years previous
to january tih  resided in mar
shall calhoun county michigan a
colored family consisting of adam
cross white his wife and live children
the youngest lmr in marshall
cross white was sober industrious
honest and intelligent and had won
the regard of all by whom he had been
employed his w ife was a member of
the methodist episcopal church and
his children were regular attendants
on the public and sabbath schools
early ill the morning of the day
abovementioned a rumor rati through
the village of marsha that the house
of crossvthite had been forcibly entered
by three or four men from kentucky
the north star
i and that they claimed and were about
to remore him and hia family as fugi
tive slaves
the rumor in a short time drew
i round the house ot crosswhite a crowd
variously estimated as consisting of
from one to two hundred people some
of them were drawn thither from
friendship some from curiosity merely
and others including the responsible
defendants were actuated by their in
terest in the cause of liberty and by a
desire to preserve the peace and order
of the neighborhood undisturbed
they found at or near the house
francis troutman and three other
persons who represented themselves
as agents of francis giltner the
former master and owner of the unfor
tunate family
j among the first of the citizens of
marshall that arrived at the house was
calvin hacket a colored man who
approached with the intention of enter
ing but mr troutman with a pistol in
his hand ordered him back
in regard to what was actually said
by the people at the time the accounts l
given by different witnesses are vari
ous and contradictory
it is not pretended that any violence
whatever was offered to mr troutman
or his associates except by one or two
of the blacks who approached trout
man in a menacing manner but as soon
as they were observed others inter
fered to check them and they desisted
and this took place before the crowd
were apprised that troutman was pres
ent under a claim of right
the crowd was somewhat evcited
the general impression was that the
proceedings of mr troutman were not
authorized by law and it is conceded
that mr troutman was given to under
stand that any but a strictly legal inter
ference would not be tolerated
while the people were conferring
with each other and the kentuckians
hacket had obtained a w arrant against
troutman for an assault upon his per
son and crosswhite a warrant for a
trespass upon his house
mr troutmans associates left the
neighborhood of the house and a large
part of the crowd at the same time went
away mr troutman continued in
conversation with ihose who remained
but finally upon his suggestion the
crowd separated and retired
the trial of the complainants upon
which the warrants were issued occu
pied the remainder of the day and a
part of the next
in the course of tnb intervening
night crosswhite procured a team
proceeded with his family to jackson
and there the next morning they took
the railcars for detroit and thence es
caped into the british dominions
the summer following the claimant
instituted a suit against several of the
individuals that constituted the crowd
for the purpose of recovering damages
occasioned by obstructions to his
agents in their attempt to recover his
slaves
the suit was founded on a statute of
the union passed in  j and was
brought in the circuit court of the
united states it was commenced
against thirteen defendants one was
not served with a process and against
five a discontinuance was entered and
among those retained the only ones of
pecuniary responsibility were charles
t gorham jarvis hurd and oliver
c comstock jr and upon whom the
whole burden of liability was throw n
the cause was tried for the first time
at the term of june  when the
jury after a long hearing were unable
to agree
a second trial was had at the term in
november last and a verdict was ren
dered for the plaintiff assessing his
damages at nineteen hundred and
twentysix dollars
this sum added to the taxable costs
of the plaintiff and the expenses in
curred in the defence will swell the
amount which the defendant will be
forced to pay to six thousand dollars
in addition to the serious loss they have
already encountered in the attention
which they have been obliged to devote
to their defence for more than a year
and the neglect of their personal busi
ness which has necessarily followed
the defendants are able to meet this
amount from their own resources but
of course not without personal incon
venience and embarrassment
their friends believe that there are
circuinstaoces in the attitude of the
defendants that cannot fail to awaken
general sympathy in their behalf
the statute on which the suit is
founded is in opposition to the spirit
and tenor of the common law and in
the opinion of many inconsistent with
the rights of the free states
the statute rigorous in itself has
been in the preseut instance rigorously
applied the testimony relating to
that part of the case from which the
liability of the defendants was deduci
ble was directly contradictory it
was natural in a case resting on such
evidencereasonable doubts would haye
been entertained and that these dolsii
being allowed in conformity to a fa
miliar principle of law to weigh for the
defendants would turn the balance in
their favor
the worst imputation that can be
laid to the charge of the defendants
taking the facts in the light most unfa
vorable to them as detailed by the prin
cipal actor and witness troutman
is that they were less sensitive to the
mandates of an odious and oppressive
law than they were to the dictates ol
humanity
the friends of the defendant per
suade themselves that very many of the
community will be glad of an oppor
tunity of manifesting their respect for
the meritorious motives that actuated
them and their sympathy for the pe
right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of ds jblnd all we are brethren
t culiar hardships to which they have
been exposed by contributing each
according to his means to relieve them
from the heavy responsibilities they have
incurred
with these views a large and re
spectable meeting of the citizens of
i marshall assembled on the th ulti
mo adopted the resolution a copy of
which is subjoined and appointed the
undersigned a committee of corre
spondence to submit the claims of the
defendants to the community
in pursuance of the duty with which
we have been charged we take the
liberty to transmit this circular to your
address to solicit you a contribu
tion towards the rz f of the defend
ants and to ask your influence in ob
taining a similar contribution from
others in your vicinity in such a man
ner as you may think best
the judgment in the case will not
probably be enforced till after june
and an obligation to contribute within
i the intervening period will be as avail
i able as money
for the fund that may be created by
the expected contributions george f
i porter esq of detroit has consented
to act as treasurer and contributions
forwarded to him will be promptly ac
knowledged
it has been suggested that a record
of subscribers names and of the do
 ings of all public meetings on the sub
ject be preserved and a copy trans
mitted to the committee of corre
spondence in order should circum
stances make it expedient that they
may hereafter be published

hovey k clarke dear sirl
thank you for the printed circular i
passed through detroit time of the
trial last june to which the circular
refers what atrial whether cer
tain persons were slaves was one of
the decisive questions what a ques
tion to be entertained by a court of
justice in the middle of the nineteenth
century such a court admitting that
slavery which is the greatest of all
outrages is capable of legalization
detroit was unmoved by the abom
inable scene which was passing in her
court house my spirit was stirred
in me as much as pauls was at the
delusions of the athenians never
had i felt so strong a desire to lift up
my voice i earnestly hoped that the
abolitionists of detroit would invite me
to do so i sought out a few of them
but i found that they were not aboli
tionists of my stamp they were all
for john p hale and moderation i
had an interview with the defendants
good and true fellows they appeared to
be i entreated one of their counsel
to secure an easy and glorious triumph
by going straight to the hearts of the
jurors with irresistible antislavery
truth i burned to have those jurors
told that law is for the protection and
not for the destruction of rights and
that it is no more absurd to talk of le
galizing the enslavement of god him
self than the enslavement of beings
made in his image and redeemed by
the blood of his son no more absurd
to talk of converting god himself than
of converting man into a chattel a
thing but not only were the counsel
unprepared to take this view but alas
they were not so much as prepared to
deny that the clause in the constitution
respecting fugitives from service refers
to slaves
all should admit that whilst the
language of this clause can easily be
interpreted to refer to other classes of
persons it cannot possibly be inter
preted to refer to slaves but the
clause is one of the compromises of the
constitution out upon that lying tra
dition what however it it were one
of such compromises that would not
determine its meaning the clause is
selfdetermining and we have there
fore no right to go back or aside to
learn its meaning but there is no
evidence that it is one of such compro
mises on the contrary there is abund
ant evidence that it is not
the convention which framed the
constitution closed its labors the lth
of december nothing had beeu said
in it respecting fugitives from service
until th august on that day says
mr madison mr butler and mr
pinckney moved to require fugitive
slaves and servants to be delivered up
like criminals objections were
raised to the motion and it was with
drawn the next day mr butler re
newed it but with the word slaves
left out it was adopted without one
word of debate and without one dis
senting voice the most antislavery
inan in the convention did not fear that
slavery could profit by such a motion
how amazing that men of sense and
candor should persist in calling the
constitution proslavery ido not de
ny that there were a few persons in the
convention who framed it they were
very few however who sought to
smuggle slavery into it but what they
undertook was utterly impracticable
inasmuch as it was in the face of the
foregone conclusion that the constitu
tion must be an instrument avowedly to
secure the blessings of liberty an i in
asmuch too as the convention would
not only not suffer the idea of property
in man to pollute the pages of the con
stitution b would not suffer the word
servitude to remain in it this word
denoting iu the judgment of the con
vention the condition of a slave
 will not blame the defendants tho
i hope that the next time they will em
ploy men of more courage heart
manliness the obtaining of ajudg
meat against then because of their hu
rochester n y friday april  
manity toward their poor brothers mod
sisters whom devilmeo were endeav
oring to replunge into slavery was a
very cruel and wicked wrong i deeply
sympathize with them and send them
the within draft toward making up their
loss of six thousand dollars many i
hope will contribute to the same end
very respectfully
your friend
gerrit smith
from ilie true westerns
fugitive in canada
when  closed my numbers under
this head i thought i should not trou
ble the readers of the wesleyan further
with the wants of tms interesting peo
ple but i have just received informa
tion of the entire approval of my plans
by the board of missions of the wes
leyan methodist connection which in
duces me to make another appeltothe
friends of humanity for aid to carry
those plans into effect
the education of the colored youth
of that province is the subject i wish
to notice there are five or six schools
in operation for colored children and
youth but we want three or four times
that number and if our friends will do
what they easily can do we can have
that uumber in a short time more we
can have every colored child in can
ada in school if the parents are willing
and there will be very few cases of un
willingness as i stated in my num
bers the government has appropriated
 per annum to support common
schools but no school section or as
we call it district can draw its share
of that fund unless it raise at least an
equal amount sections may raise as
much more as they please but they
cannot draw public money unless they
raise as much for school purposes as
they draw from the government the
sections must build their own school
houses and raise as mucn as they rei
ceive from the government this the
colored settlements are unable to do
my plan is to assist them to draw their
proportion of the public money by
aiding them to build schoolhouses and
to make up the required amount and
to place the schools now in operation
under the schoollaw in this way we
can secure to the colored children of
canada the same advantages the whites
have educate them with the whites
in the same schools where they will
not be crushed by any sense of inferi
ority but as equals under equal laws
enjoying equal advantages receiving
equal education take their place as
citizens of a emwnmmißwrtty there
we can make the the colored man all
he is capable of being here is a green
spot in the mighty desert and i want it
cultivated f
but some may have their fears that
the colored children would be neglect
ed in these schools we can place
our own teachers in these schools
teachers who will do the colored child
ren justice this matter i fully in
quired into when in canada we can
do all in government schools for the
colored children that we can do for
them in independent schools such as
we now have without having the
children feel degraied by having to
go to a school in which white children
will not stoop to enterto a jim crow
school
the colored population of that pro
vince is according to the best informa
tion i could get  what an
object to educate the youth of such a
number and prove the colored mans
capability of moral civil intellectual
and religious elevation and demon
strate the safety of freedom to the
slavethe most important thing in
the great and mighty antislavery en
terprise
but what will it require to effect this
great object comparatively a small
sum far less than some of the mission
boards of this country have expended
on the outfit of a single mission i
think i could connect the whole colored
population of canada with the govern
ment schools with  and continue
them in schools the second year for
half that amount and a less sum every
succeeding year until fittle or no aid
would be required i mean 
would get up the schoolhouses and
keep them in school one year it might
take some more it might not take as
mucha small sum lor so great an i
ohject i have thought of several
ways to raise this sum and do up the
matter at once and have concluded to
propose the following
let one hundred persons give 
each and one hundred  each this
would be looo or onehalf the pro
posed sum by six hundred individuals j
then let all the rest raise the other
half cannot one hundred persons be
found in all the land who will give 
each and five hundred who will give
each surely this number can be
found i have made this proposition
in a few places and have on my sub
scription books five  subscriber
paid and sixtynine  donations i j
propose further to open a place in the
books of the present board to record j
the names of these contributors and
not only the five and one dollar con
tributors but the names of all those
who will give fifty cents or any amount
for this object t
what say you friends to this
shall it be carried into effect or shall
these longinjured robbed and crushed j
ones go still unblessed heaven for 
bid and ie n the people say amen
the way is oow openfly to the relief
of these longinjured ones send in
your contributions at once i should
like to have this matter off my hand as
soon as possible these schools might
all be gotten up this year my health
is now pretty good and the church of
the living god baa demands on me in
anodme direction and so has the bleed
ing stare i want to answer to those
demands as soon as tbe fugitives are
cared for and tbeir wants supplied o
brethren and friends act as once a
i short time since i passed by tbe graves
mouth and thought my race was nearly
run but  have been restored to pretty
good health and providence has di
reeled my course to the fugitive and
has opened the way to bless them for
ever i waut to see it done and done
at once shall it be done it is with
you to say may i anticipate your
answer and say it shall be done
iet each one who may read this ar
ticle fix in his heart before he lays
the paper down what share of this
great work he ought to perform and
resolve to do it at once could i visit
every antislavery neighborhood and
make an appeal in person i am confi
dent from the trials i have made that
twice the sum i have asked for would
be forthcoming but this is impossible
i shall visit as many places as i can
but i shall have to spend part of my
time in canada a dollar given with
out hearing the voice of the agent will
do the fugitive as much good and re
ceive in the great day as much re
ward as one gotten by me or any other
agent oh friends take hold and
bless and lift up this people in the
name of the mighty god and for the
sake of the crushed and bleeding slave
and the human race

the distict of columbia
a correspondent of the concord
la intelligencer has compiled the
following statement of the action taken
at various times in congress in refer
i ence to the abolition of slavery in the
district of columbia it is an inter
esting historical paragraph
in  john randolph of roan
oke brought forward a resolution fora
committee to inquire into the traffic
of slaves in the district of columbia
and lor legislative measures to put a
stop to the same it was adopted
without a division on the th de
cember  mr barney of mary
land offered a memorial for the re
striction of slavery in the district
which on his motion was ordered to
be printed mr mcduffie of south
carolina objected to printing but ex
pressly admitted the right of congress
to grant the people of the district
any measure which they may deem ne
cessary to free themselves from this
deplorable evil on the th of jan
uary  mr miner of pennsyl
vania offered a resolution instructing
the committee on the district to in
quire into the expediency of abolishing
slavery within the same and the vote
was ayes  nays  mr mark
alexander of va reported in sub
stance that slavery could not be abol
ished in the district without the con
sent of the people thereof the same
committee likewise reported a bill dej
daring negroes brought into the dis
trict free in  a memorial
signed by  of the citizens of the
district was presented praying for the
abolition of slavery there and the pro
ject was decidedly popular on the
d january  mr john tyler
then a senator from virginia in one of
a series of resolutions conceded the
right of congress to abolish slavery in 
the district with the consent of the
slave owners therein
progress
every part of the civilized world
bears the most unmistakable marks of
human progress it is seen in every
branch of the mechanic arts in labor j
saving machinery in matters of prac
tical science as applied to the every
day wants and labors of the race and
in everything else pertaining to the
material interests of mankind there
is more learning and more extended
intelligence among tbe masses of the
people they read more and reason
with more logical acuteness than dis
tinguished the generations of some fifty
years since but with all these ad
vances one cannot see but little evi
dence that the people are happier
they have more luxuries but at the
same time they have more requiring
tastes to gratify they read more but
the more they read the more certain
they are to find the comparative pov 
ertyof their intellectual attainments
and the almost hopelessness of ever
getting beyond the confines of ignor
anceso vast tbe prospect beyond
tneir immediate ken still if partial j
knowledge does not make mankind hap
pier as a whole it has one good effect
it brings up some men to a point of
manly selfdenial and independence that
makes them willing to throw aside the
love for power place and emolument
and stand up in the face of tbe giant
follies fanaticisms and hypocrisies of
the world and rebuke them in words
fifing to their enormity it learns men
that the physical waots are but few and
tbat there are higher gratifications than
result from a free use of the mere
luxuries of life it teaches men that
selfdenial and sometimes suffering if
experienced in sustaining a great nigral
or political principle is happiness it
raises up men of bone and sinew enough
to battle with and conquer tbe great
popular fallacies in politics religioo
trade and morals these men are an
index or guideboard to a better stale 
society and they mark the different
steps of progress of tbe human race
upon the great road to happiness
though tar in advance of the actual
crowd to them we owe the reforms
of tbe church and stale partial and
unsatisfactory it may be hut still pro
gressive to them we owe every hu
manizing and benevolent move made in
society they are scoffed at and hoot
ed in their day and generation but the
next following deifies them
statues crowned with laurel and the
tablets of history are filled with their
golden deeds the advance made in
the slavery question in the united
i states the movement made for the
homestead law and of every other
sensible reform mark the influence of
these men on society and mark too
its progress
but the progress of the physical scil
lences should attract some share of our
attention hardly a day passes but
some new discovery is heralded to the
world that promises to become an impor
tant element in its future one day it
was a steam engine another a railroad
another the magnetic telegraph and to
day a new method of illumination
which at an expense of a couple of pen
nies an hour will give the light of a
thousand wax candles tomorrow per
haps a flying machine and the next day
something so much more wonderful
that we now hesitate to name it in sober
earnest all this shows the wonderful
activity of the human mind and the or
der of that human intellect whose
higher powers are yet to be developed

of peace at the moment when we are
preparing for the congress at paris i
requested an audience of him which he
granted immediately presently m
de lamartine appeared w ith a smile on
his lips and invited me to take a seat
on a chair which he drew towards me
this great man this poethearted de
mosthenes welcomed me w ith a smile
if i presume to present myself before
you said i it is because l have be
hind me more than  voices from
england and america who address you
in the name of humanity and what
are those voices they are those ot
the friends of peace and i have come
on their behalf to demand the support
of your genius and eloquence but
sir answered he peace has always
been my favorite thoughtmy
cherished dream i am the most fer
vent apostle of peace peace it is tea
sonpeace it is of god for ex
ampleat the commencement of the
revolution of february the warlike
instincts which had appeared for a
long time to have slumbered in france
reawakened in an instant there
were many causes from without for
that revival but i stifled those
ebullitions of which the consequences
might have been terrible the con
vulsive agitations which have shaken
france from within occasion me less
anxiety even now than those warlike
tendencies and it is to coutrol these
that i have from the first employed my
efforts and i have succeeded and if 
had done nothing but this for my coun
try i should congratulate inyscit but
the moment is come to strike a decis
ive blow to give the ideas which are
everywhere confusedly floating a defi

is arrived for organizing peace have
you been long in paris sir i re
plied i am a frenchman and a repre

propose coming very soon themselves
to paris to hold a congress well
tell them to make haste tell them that
the peace societies ought according
to my advice to have a delegate in

abolition or slavery in england
macaulay in his history ol eugland
gives the process hy which the slaves
in our mother country gained their
freedom as follows
it is remarkable that the two great
est and most salutary social revo
lutions which have taken place in
englandthe revolution which in the
thirteenth century put an end to ty
ranny of nation and that revolution
which a few generations later put un
end to the property of man in man
were silently and imperceptibly effected
they struck contemporary observers
with no surprise and have received
from historians very scanty measure of
attention they were brought about
neither hy legislation nor hy physical
force moraf causes noiselessly effaced
first the distinction between norman
and saxon and then the distinction
between master and slave none can
venture to fix the precise moment at
waich either distinction ceasedsome
faint traces of the old norman feeling
might perhaps have been found lie in
tbe fourteenth century some faint
traces ol the institution of a villanage
were detected hy the curious so late as
the days of the stuarts nor has that
institution ever to this hour been abol
ished by statute
it would be unjust not to acnowledge
tbat the chief agent in these two great
deliverances was religion it may pr
haps be doubted whether a purer re

fifteenth annual meeting of the antislavery society
american antislavery society will be held
in the tabernacle broadway new york on
tuesday the bth day of may neat
the anniversary at the tabernacle repre
sents to the country at large the progress the
efficiency and even the existence of the anti
slavery cause it is to vast numbers of peo
ple the only sign of the continued real and
spirit of the abolitionists whose local meet
ings they never hear of
the business meetings of the society
have always brought together in counsel a
larger number of abolitionists frjjn various
parts of the northern stales than is ever con
vened on any other occasion the general
interests of the cause command at that time i
s consideration which at no other can be given
them
it has never since the formation of the
society been more apparent than at ihis mo
ment that the antislavery cause is left
where it ever has been in the hands of the
members of the american society there is
as yet no reason to suppose that slavery will
ever be abolished except through its efforts
the general importance of the annual
meeting and the aspect of the cause at this
moment which gives us every thing to hope
for if we persevereeverything to fear if
we falterappeal alike loudly to abolitionists
all over the land to make the ensuing annual
meeting of the american antislavery socie
ty one that shall do more even than any pre
vious one has done to drive the south to
despair in defence of its felonious system of
society and the north to a more determined
attitude than any portion of it has evet yet
ventured to assume in defence of its own
rights and the assertion of the rights of the

extension of suffrage in new jersey
we learn with pleasure that the colored
people of new jersey are beginning to call
for their rights as men and citizens of the
state the following appropriate petition has
been circulated and sent into the legislature
but has been laid on the table without action
our friend the rev charles w gardner
from whom we receive it informs us that
through the coming summer they hope to
send lecturers into the field to stir up the state
on the subject and procure a more general
and united action we hope the design will
be executed and will result in a greatly in
creased interest in the subject among all
classes of the people penn freeman
to the senate and house of assembly of the
state of new jersey at trenton assembled
gentlemen
we the undersigned petitioners of the
state of new jersey being free colored
citizens of the a bovementioned state have
for a long time felt grieved that we are by a
provision in the laws of this our state de
prived of the elective franchise and therefore
do most respectfully petition and earnestly
pray your honorable body to take the subject
into consideration at your present session and
use your influence to have the laws so altered
in respect to us as to remove the disability
and grant us the right of elective franchise
in common with and under the same provi
sions of other free taxable citizens of this
state
and we are induced respectfully to ask
this right upon the following considerations
first because we are taxed in common
and equally with other citizens which tax we
have paid and are willing so to do without
complaining
second we ask it because our ancestors
were among the pioneers of our country and
we are native born citizens and have never by
insurrections mobs or tumults committed l
any act whereby the public peace or safety
was endangered
third because we are now making as
rapid improvements in moral intelleetuafand
political science as any other portion of the
laboring class in the state by maintaining
churches schools temperance and beneficial
societies giving support to the general diffu
sion of knowledge by contributing to support
the nress in the expenditure of several thou
sand dollars annually throughout the state
for newspapers periodicals e
fourth because it is a right granted to
foreigners of the same class who have been
in the country fiom two to five years and
whose situations and prejudices in favor of
the land of their nativity does not permit them
to lie as well acquainted with republican in
stitutions as we the native born citizens of
this state
fifth because it is contrary to the genius
and prosperity of any republican country to
oppress her own home born sons it being a
law in the universal government of god that
he who doeth a wrong lo his neighbor shall
receive an evil to himself and inasmuch as true j
republicanism is based upon the laws of uni
versal suffrage it is a violation of this lawi
and consequently pernicious to the fundament
al piineiples of republican institutions to
withhold a common light ftont any class or
portion of an unoffending people
sixth because it is unconstitutional the
framers of the constitution having pledaedi
their honor lives and property never to sub 
mil to taxation without representation having
carefully guarded this right by so article pro 
hibiting any state in the union from tuakino 
it legal to disqualify any of her taxpaying l 
citizens for the exercise of the right to choose 
their representatives j i
seventh and lastly we ask it from a full i
conviction that the improvements of the age j 
the philanthropy of the state and the good 
sense of out rulers have all fooked forward
for such a movement and were only waiting 
for those most concerned therein to enter
upon the measure and the work would be
accomplished all of which we must res i
pectfully submit lo the wisdom justice and
truthfulness of your honorable body and we
shall most sincerely prsy god save the eom

ne of the moat intereating and it may yet
one of the meet important circumstances bear
mg on tiie existence of slavery is the almost
simultaneous movement in the slave mutes to
prevent the further inlorioction of slaves a
the exclusion of slavery from our new terri
tories becomes certain the slaveholders in
tle southern tier of slave stales apprehend
such a rush of the slave atock of the northern
biaveholding states aa will reduce the price
of slaves arid impoverish them they are
tailing time by the forelock and putting up the
bar the real intent and influence of the
movement are at once perceived by tboae
specially interested in keeping open the mar
ket and ibey cry out accordingly a late
number of the richmond va time in
noticing the movement in georgia for the pro
hibition of the slavetrade thus confirms the
deep interest that virginia takes m it
we have on several recent occasions
directed the attention of our readers to a move
ment now going on in some of the southern
states having lor its object the prohibition of
the further introduction of slaves into those
states i nun the slave states adjoining the free
stares esteeming this movement a matter
of far greater practical importance than the
question t restricting slavery in the distant
territories of california and newmexico we
shall continue to note the progress of public
opinion in its lavor
a like movement is called for we see in
the nashville republican tennessee being
alarmed in consequence of mr clays letter
and the proposition involved w it to send into
other states the slaves of kentucky the
southwest we hope will make the laws
they are talking of thus upon one point

my dear friend garrison
i ever since you were in this cjty laboring
for the poorest of the human family i have
had it times without number in ray heart to
write to you largely out of its fulness but
my days hours and minutes are so completely
demanded for domestic and english service
that  have not been able with other duties
to command time to write to you
 lament to inform you that from this coun
try a number of emigrants hare gone to texas
georgia tennessee and other slave slates of
america and to many their credulity folly
i and land mania have ended most disastrously
i now find a scheme set on foot by a highly
respected baptiet minister in birmingham to
purchase  acres of land in texas and
to form a number of colonies there of one
thousand emigrants each he vainly sup
poses and says we shall soon put down
texan slavery and graft old english sober
 sense on jonathans goaheadism these
colonies are to be founded chiefly of religious
people
i have published two letters in the british
banner to warn christians from going to the
slave states of america and yesterday i sent
a third on the same subject  have in other
papers as well as in the banner called the
public attention to the sufferings of emigrants
and the loss of life in the steerage of ships
during the middle passage second only to
that of the slave ships
now my dear friend if you would employ
your able pen in laying before emigrants the
fearful consequences they will incur by going
to settle in the sodom of america i will get
it published in as many papers in great brit
ain as possible
i have watched with deepest interest and
unspeakable delight the rapid advance of the
holy principles of abolition in the united
states and although the advocates of the
free soil party have not sufficient moral in
tegrity to unite with the vanguard they are
doing battle against the demon of slavery ac
cording to their small measure and are there
fore doing a good work that will tell upon
the common foe of god and man
present my kind love to henry c wright j
i doubt not he is honest and sinceie in all his i
views though i believe him to be mistaken in
some of his conclusions i prefer ins how
ever to those of a rev d d whom i
knew in western pennsylvania he also
reasoned from the immutability of the divine
being and stated that as god commanded
wars under the old testament they may also
be justifiable and pleasipr to dim under the
new i know nothing iliat deserves the
name of infidelity to christ more than lhat
the gold of california is  tear templing
many to their own ruin you will rny dear
friend greatly oblige ine by sending me by
mail a thin sheet map colored of the united
i states including their late additions from
mexico in a letter
i feel truly thankful lhat you have been res
tored from your second attack of illness in
both of which you had my very affectionate
sympathy my prayer is that he who has
prepared you for the fight will make you
strong ire your shield and lengthen your days
like those of the venerable clarkson umil you
shall hear the shout that babylon is fallen is
fallen and see your native country a free and
happy land in lhat land hoping again to see
your face i remain
your ever affectionate friend

two years before the american seamens

opened notwithstanding the narrowness of

so  aaaiitiid
a copy of this long looked for work has
reached our table it is a volume of five hun
dred and sixty four pages neatly bound well
printed and on excellent paper the superior
portraits referred to in the title page raise ex
pectations not to be gratified on looking j nto
the bookfor with but two exceptionsthey
are of the commonest sort the book would
hare been better without than with them the
one of mr pennington gitres but a poor idea
of the man and does him plain injustice that
of the brave cinque falls far short of express
ing the bold and majestic bearing of this heroic
son of the forest and is little better than a bur
lesque upon the fine picture of him owned by
our friend purvis that of frederick doug
lass we shall leave to others to criticise beg
ging only to remark that it has a much more
kindly and amiable expression than is gene
rally thought to characterize the face of a fu
gitive slave never having seen the other
persons whom the additional portraits are de
signed to represent we say nothing itf them
but hope they are truer liknesses than either
that of pennington cinque or douglass be
fore quitting the pictures we shall venture one
remark w inch we have never heard expressed
before and which will perhaps be set down
to the account of our negro vanity and it may
be not unjustly so but we have presented it
for what it may be worth it is this negroes
can never have impartial portraits at the hands
of white artists it seems to us next to im
possible for white men to take likenesses of
black men without most grossly exaggerating
their distinctive features and the reason is
obvious artists like all other w hite persons
have adopted a theory respecting the distinc
tive features of negro physionomy we have
heard many w hite persons say that negroes
look all alike and that they could not distin
guish between the old and the young the
associate with the negro face high cheel
bones distended nostril depressed nose thicl
i lips and retreating foreheads this theory im
pressed strongly upon the mind of an artisi
exercises a poweiful influence over his pencil
and very naturally leads him to distort and ex
aggerate those peculiarities even when the
scarcely exist in the original the templa
tion to make the likeness of ihe negro rathe
than of the roan is very strong and oftei
leads the artist as well as the player to over
step the modesty of nature there is th
greatest variety of form and feature among us
and there is seldom one face to be found
which has all the features usually attribntei
to the negro and there are those from vvhici
these marks of african descent while tliei
color remains unchanged have disappearet
entirely i am black but comely is ai
true now as it was in the days of solomon
perhaps we should not be more impartial thai
 our white brothers should we altempt to pic
ture them we should be as likely to gel tliei
lips too thin noses too sharp and pinched up
j their cheeks too lanternlike their hair toi
lank and lifeless and their faces altogethe
too cadaverous but we must let the picturi
go and console ourselves as thos whitsoi
opee did when he told us he should becorpi
handsome if public opinion was changed
for our part we like a large nose whether i
be flat or sharp no matter which so thi
i metal is there every one to his taste so h
does not trample on human rights
the book under consideration while it con
tains very little which lias not been presents
to the public before in one shape or another
is nevertheless a most valuable work in ar
rangemeni and literary ability it is by m
means remarkable it is plain simple trulhfu
i and is chiefly valuable as the repository of
luminous and brilliant array of testimony ii
favor of our claims to be regarded as equa
members of the great human family wit
the rest of mankind gathered with much in
dustry from the most valuable sources tin
author has evidently said less than he desired
i possessing a warm heart and a clear under
standing of the manifold wrongs growing
out of enormous views respecting the negr
character he could perhaps have covere
the whole ground with arguments as good a
i those he has adduced from more
j sources but he has wisely and generoush
i allowed others to speak so that out of tin
mouths of many witnesses the truth shall b
j established in this we see a disinterested de

to gratify an ambitions taste for display

in proof of the ancient greatness of th

testimony we have many extracts frofa th

distinguished colored persons the whole
work abounds in evidence of the natural kind
ness of heart gentleness hospitality and hon
esty of the negro race missionaries sea
captains and others testify that the negro is
peculiarly susceptible of religious impressions
facts are presented showing that in many
parts of africa quite a high point of civiliza

the skill and ingenuity of the african race
instances are referred to illustrating the readi
ness and ease with w hich the colored race
assimilate with the habits and customs of a
higher civilization the fact that negroes
are as eager to improve their condition and
obtain education as other men is alleged
color is accounted for by climate food and

and tytsnny which the latter have endured at
the hands of their opptessors and while he
weeps bitterly with the oppressed be strongly
rebukes the giuhy oppressor into the teeth
of the tyrant ho burls the truthful rebuke
if the negro is degraded you are the guilty
esose of his degradation and as ofonnel
once said to england try justice to ireland
before you resort to force there is in
these passages so much genuine sympathy for
the suffeting and indignation for the monsters
who gain their fortunes by the blood of souls
and withal such an intelligent view of the
duties of this nation to the plundered slave
that the heart of the most radical abolitionist
in this country would be wanned cheered and
strengthened by their perusal
after all however we have perused this
book with mingled emotionsdeeply gratified
that the work has beer so ably and generously
performed by mr armstead yet grieved and
morticed that such a work seemed needful to
be done here is a large volume made up
of extracts from the sayings of authors
travellers missionaries seacaptains doctors
lawyers and philosophersand all these to
prove what simply that the piesent re
viewer is a member of the human family and
ought to be so regarded if our dark cheek
could reveal our feelings words would be
unnecessary to the beholder whai a fact to
be handed down to coming generations that
the christian people of england and america
had become so hardened by crime and blinded
by prejudice that in the year  they
needed the light of a volume of nearly six
hundred pages to distinguish their brother
man from the beast of the field the anti
quarian of coming ages will search out this
work as one of the literary curiosities of the
nineteenth century and will produce it as
evidence of the daikness of this age what
a commentary upon our enlightenment that
we must have books to prove what is palpable

is a man

our minds grasping in the fulness of manly
strength the awfully sublime idea one su
preme god who is the common father and
creator of us all and vet with these facts
before the christian world it requires a book
to prove that the negro is a man and an equal
brother having equal capabilities with the
rest of mankind shame on the hardness ol
heart and blindness of mind
but iqt us not be discouraged or indignant
the world is making progress though the
movement be so slow at times as scarcely to
be perceptible we have now before us a
work nearly two centuries old advocating
and suing for the negros admission into the
church and called a persuasive to the
instructing and baptising negroes and in
dians by morgan godwyn on perusing
this volume we find that ground much lower
is occupied by the writer than that taken bv
the author of the tribute and that the
material of the former for making his work
seems to have been far less than that of the
latter let us hope that the time may come
when it will not be necessary for our friends
to write tributes or make persuasive appeals
to the church and the world on our behalf
but when we shall present such incontestable
evidence of our manhood as shall seal the
lips of calumny and persecution for ever
we recommend this work especially to the
nagrohaters of our own christian land we
recommend it to our negro pew churches
and our negrohating priesthood and ask
them to look at its facts statements reason
ings and lay its mighty truths to heart re
membering that the work is not that of a
wild enthusiast who bends facts no matter
how inconsistent and opposed to his theory
i to suit his purpose but that of a calm dis
interested christian and scholai with a heart
alive to human woe and whose only aim in
these pages appears to be to befriend the
helpless we would also commend the
work to our own beloved but heartbroken
j brethren the victims of prejudice and sla
very the book should be in all your
houses and those who can ought to purchase
one and possess it we need and ought to
possess it we need it as ameans of refut
ing with their own w capons and on their ow n
ground the cruel calumniators of our race
as well as to inspire us with higher aspira
tions and a nobler zeal and earnestness in the
cause of our own elevation and improvement
w e observe that one of our exchanges
the rams horn alleges the complaint that
the work takes too low ground with respect
to our abilities as a people the complaint
is not only unjust but in the person who
prefers it immodest a work admitting the
brilliant talents and genius of many of our
number and vindicating the capabilities of
the whole people is quite as much as we can
ask or justly demand as much or more in
jury is done by an over estimate of oui abili
ties as by an under estimation of them w
would be just though we should theieby
pluck wreaths of glory from the brow of our
own people and consign us to an inferior
sphere in the ranks of human brotherhood

since the abolition of the death penalty in
michigan fearful stones bare been afloat of
the prevalence of murder in that state were
proper measures taken to arrive at a correct
result it would probably be found that crime
haa not increased in a greater than usual pro
portion to the increase of population and if
it has still the difficult task remains of show
ing that it has increased in consequence of
the removal of the death penalty it is
satisfactory to learn however that there is lit

of the committee it is not adv isable to change
the existing laws requiring the crime of mur

the state prison the report was accepted
and the committee discharged from the far

so the lovers of the horrible in michigan
need not for the present anticipate any treat
of that description

that ciuel and revengeful laws have a tendency

he does not go far enough he sees only

own life it must be very evident that no life
can be taken away by course of law what
a man must not do for himself he cannot by
any process n reasoning be shown to be
capable of delegating to another the power
do for him still leaving this out of the
question as it is an argument not palpable to
many minds it can be shown that capital
punishments are both inexpedient and unnec
essary they do not answer the end desired
namely the prevention of crime not many
years since there were on the criminal code
of england about seventy crimes punishable
by death the majority of the laws inflict
ing death were and had been for a long time
previous to their abrogation dead letters for
ihe minor offences the extreme penalty never
was inflicted forgery was a capital crime
but there has been no instance of hangina for
forgery since towards the end of last cen
tury cases of forgery had not in conse
quence of the greater leniency of the punish
ment become more frequent no in this
respect there was a manifest improvement
not many years since it was no unusual
thing to have fitly executions during one
year in london now although the popula
tion of the metropolitan district has greatly
increased there are rarely during one may
oralty more than two or three cases of capital
punishment in  theretwas not one if
the gallows prevents crime the people of
london must be sinking into the lowest
depths of guilt but how stands the case
i here has been a gradual reduction in the
number of cases of murder and other heinous
crimes does not this show that it is not the
severity of the punishment that prevents the
crane v hen executions were tenfold more
frequent than they now are crimes were also
more frequent if the exhibition of an ex
ample is capable of checking crime examples
enough were exhibited at tyburn many year
ago when ten twenty thirty and upwards
were ordered to execution in one morning to
prevent forever every offence against the
laws of mau and of god
it is a divine command  he that shed
deib mans blood by man shall his blood be
hed this passage roust either be capable
ol a different interpretation from that usually
given to it or its divine authority must be
denied god is the perfection of goodness
everything that he does is and can be only
infallibly tight if it is wrong to destroy life
god never did or could command it to be des
troyed and that it is wrong is shown by
the simple fact that it is unnecessary no one
w ili affirm that the death of the murderer is un
avoidable if the desired end can be attained
by other and more humane means experi
ence hears witness to the faet that it can be so
answered therefore it is unnecessary and not
commanded by god
turn which way we will whether to ihe
law of christianity or expediency or to the
claims of humanity the same answer every
were meet os mi ibe quettioa whether capi
ta punishment ought to he tbolisbed tad
that answer is yes it is te he hoped that
the day is sot far distant when not only in

himself in a way well calculated to put to the

of our exchanges
gentlemen the copy of my history
which you were so good as to send has this
day reached me i can as yet only judge of
the genera effecl of the paper and typography
and that effect is hghly creditable to your
house
the spelling diffirs from mine but the
difference does not affect either the substance
or the style of my work and i therefore do
not consider mysoll as personally aggrieved
by the change if my sentiments were sup
pressed or my language altered i should
think that i had a right to complain but
as to the spelling  have no wish except
that it may be such as is generally accepta
ble to american readers

this book as our readers are of course
aware commands a very extensive sale in this
country  have heard of three different edi

new york one in boston one in philadel
phiaall three i suppose bringing con
siderable profit to the publishers the author
has nothing but the fame true the harpers
it is said paid for advance proofs of the work
as it came through the press but nothing was
in reality paid for the work itself is there
not a manifest injustice in this if a man
works at any piece of handicraftsay a chair
or a table everyone at once sees the propriety
of his receving payment for his work no j
one would think of refusing him payment
because he happened to belong to some dif
ferent country if he were to paint a picture j
the same would be said of the picture if
the picture is a good one the artist should be
well paid for it and so he ought but
let a man sit down anywhere out of these
states and labor it may be for yearsto bring
out of his brain the thoughts that spring up
therein let him publish them to the world
in the form of a bookforthwith an edition
may be issued in every state in the union
and the author can obtain no remuneration
for his labor he may be well rewarded in
his own land but what of that who is to
be the judge of what is a sufficient compenta
ion for his toil are the piratical publishers
in this country to decide the question as
well set the robber on the highway to de
termine how much the victim of his cupidity
should be allowed to reserve from plunder
but after all american authors are
greatest sufferers by the republication of
english books they are not paidor rather
they receive no encouragement publishers
dont want original works for which they must
pay the authors when they can get as many
new books from england to reprint as there
is any demand for without paying anything

the subject of indemnity to those who lost
property m the late rebellion has been publicly
tsised and appears to have kindled okf ani
mosities and even to have led to some free
speech about the propriety of joining the
l nited states the following extracted
paragraphs will show what is the difficulty
the bill to pay the rebellion losses has
passed the upper house of parlament by a
majority of four after encountenne a very
violent though ineffeetunl opposition a
protest was entered upon the records by the
minority
great anxiety is fob about the probable
course of the governor general a rumor is
current that he will reserve the bill for the as
sent ot the queen
addresses are pouring in from all parts of
the provinces and the tone of some of them is
very violent many plans are proposed for
redress if the bill should be sanctioned
the money if paid at all is to he paid bv
the united province most of the loss ar
crueii in the lower province nd the people of
the upper provtuce where the rebellion was
less are indignant that they should lie required
to bear part of the burden
a letter from montreal in the toronto pat
riot says
the rumor that his excellency will reserve
the bill is more rife than ever and if he does
this the mistry must resignand if he
should sanction it and it become the law of
the land what then l why to hazard a pro
phetic reply to so fearful a question i should
say a convention at kingston
at public meeting resolutions were passed
to the same effectand the monacal courier in
reporting them says
i he resolutions were received with tremen
dous cheers but on feeling animated the
meeting and is shared by the whole country
and that is never to submit to ihe payment of
the rebels let the parliament pass the bill
let the govenor sanction it if he pleases but
while there is axe and rifle on the frontier
and saxon hands to wield them these losses
will not be paid
the latest accounts state that a riotous dis
position had begun to manifest itself among
the people on the evening of the  ult a
mob gathered in the streets of toronto and
burnt three of the members of the legislature
in effigy
slave trade the southern ga re
corder of the th ult says the progress
of this illegal practice has met w ith a check
and has indeed we presume so far as this
vicinage is concerned been decisively arrested
in a case which has just occurred two slave
speculators reached this place some days ago
with a number of negroes for sale the
owners were promptly arrested at the instance
of the mayor and brought before the council
ihe parties were saved from going to jail by
giving bond and security for their appearance
next morning in the sum ot one thousand
dollars at the the time for their appearance
it seems the parties arrested had judged it
best to forfeit their bond and pay the penalty
which we presume they had secured to their
security rather than abide the issue of the
law they had violated we presume that the
proceedings in this case will in luture turn
the direction of those dealing in negroes in
violation of law to any other quarter rather
than this
slaveholding impudence the ken

the slaves will manage to get over it or
while their dear masters are watching the

letter from fierrit smith
frederick dorglaes my dear sir i
have at read the last north star i thank
von for the eoirection of last week that let
ter nn now o understood i thank you
ao for your comments on the add res which
 reined last tunc to the national conven
tion f the liberty party at buffalo fliese
commnts are rich in thought and feeling
valuable however as they are  must object
to them that for the mot part they are not
pertinent to the questidn in controversy between
u tuat question is rhihr th federal fhn
ttifufion proslavery or antislavery
you occupy much of votir space in oppos
ing the doctrines of the address that gov
ernment must whether with or against the
constitution alsdish slavery but this doc
trine if right or wrong does not touch the
question between us that question  ain pre
pared ti discuss with you as soon as you may
have retracted the admission made a fortnight
since in the north star that the constitu
tion of the inited states standing alone and j
construed onlv in the light of its letter is not a
proslavery instrument i ntil this and your
similar admissons arc retracted you will be
on mv side ol the question and therefore in
no attitude to discuss it with me if the
constitution is incapable of being construed
according to its letter there is of course lib j
ertv to go outside of it for help to construe it j
but you admit that it is capable of being in
terpreted in the light of its letter and i aj
peal to ail who are acquainted with the rules
which govern the interpretation of such papers
whether  am not right in saying that if the
constitution be capable of being interpreted
in the light of its letter it is utterly contrary
f
to such rules to attempt to interpret it ii any j
other light o bv any other helps
now if you will take the position and de
lend it bv argument that the constitution is
in its letter proslavery  will reply to you
or if you will take the position and defend
it by argument that the constitution is not
self interpreting ami is seen in the light of
history to c proslavery i will reply to you
moreover  will in either case endeavor to
show ist that the institution calls for no
surrender of slaves and for no aid whatever
t si ivery and nd that it gives power to the 
federal government or federal judiciary if 
not indeed to both to abolish every part of a
meriean slavery
permit me to say in closing that the part 
of the address which you suppose argues
disdain ol the cot stitulion and want
of deference lor it and distrust of its 
friendliness tu the slaves redemption has 
no such meaning in my eye and was not in 
tended to he susceptible of such meaning on 
the contrary i look upon the constitution to
he antislavery from its surface to itscore and
i insist that there would not be one just and 
intelligent mind  ft to give it a proslavery 
interpretation were it not that the african 
race ali dpless and despised race even j 
i t h rek douglass himself much as he loves c
his race would not he found joining in such 
interpretation did it hear against another than jl
his own race j e

mkssrs editors ln perusing your pa
p r of the jim insl  find over tin signafttre
of m u  one of the editors an
article headed domestic economy which
in rnv opinion will admit of come correction
and witli all due deference to the writer 
may be allowed to examine the validity of his
reasonings
and allow me first to remark that while 
gratefully appreciate the zeal and ardor which
have ever characteiized the efiorts of this aide
champion of liberty and while i hail his
labors as ominous of much good and the har
binger of better days i still in justice to that
divine command which he has seen fit to
choose as the basis of his argument must and
ever hail under my present convictions dif
fer materially with him
the divine command in question is this
seek ye first the kngdom of heaven and
its righteousness and all things shall be
added
the writer in descantino upon this pas
sage says or would infer that the christian
church had fallen into a great great error in
believing and promulgating the doctrine that
tie injunction had reference to the daily avo
cations ot men but would have us believe
that it was given merely as a command to
those whom be b id called to be his immediate
disciples in the days of his incarnationsuch
as andrew peter and james whom he de
scribes as iubcrmeii supplying the various
markets in that region of country hence we
are to believe that the only persons invited to
an interest in the kingdom of heaven are
those few favored fishermen
the presumption is just as strong m thus
light as m the light which our friend would
have you view the passage under considera
tion jjut he assert as a reason why this
command was exclusively to the fishermen
that they were engaged in their business
purmis earning forth nisei ves a livelihood
hence tins command was made as an in
ducement through the agency of which thev
inglit he brought into fields of more useful
employin m
aou that tins kin of reasoning was pe
cmiariv adapted to tin in may hetiue but
ih it u i not alike applicable to us we cannot
not tor w fud ll a luw clinging more

i tr of allowing tin ii minds to become so
mo engrossed witfi the cares of the
rid as to neglect to seek the salvation of
t tor tools and it is as reasonable for us to
mpposu that chmt wheu he commissioned j
his disciples to preset the gospel bad refer
ence to only those whom be vrts then sd
 dressing snd that when they were to die the
preaching of the gospel was to cease just
as much so as it is reasonable to suppose that
in addressing this language be had reference
only to the fishermen sod we must admit if
we believe iiine rete ist ion however much
it may be at variance with our feelings that
this injunction is alike applicable to all for
god is no respecter of persons and he desires
not to enjoin duties upoo one that ik will not
also require of another
but there are many points in the argument
j which i wonder at referring to our hav
ing embraced this faith he says that we
labor under a most eggregious and shame
i ful error and he accounts for it as being
the result of oppression evidently endeavor
ing to impress upon our minds that this doc
trine of seeking the kingdom of heaven is
nothing more than a wild imagination brought
into being through ignorance and fostered by
the hand of slavery our friend m r d
must certainly be in an error if i under
stand him in this matter if his argument is
tenable as he undoubtedly has the ability
i hope that he will define and simplify his
position and i stand ready to be corrected

prejudice against color
frederick douglass you may not be
aware that the freemen of this city have for
manny years been in the habit holding a tii
ennial procession in celebration of the organ
ization of their department once it was not
unusualto have the choice music of the col
ored bands indiscriminately mixed with the
white bands in their parades but of late
years prejudice has succeeded in excluding the
former from them altogether little less than
two years ago however the sons of temp
having a procession one of their divisions es
sayed to show their appreciation of good mu
sid and brave popular prejudice by the en
gagement of johnsons farfamed band their
courage i am sorry to say was not adequate
to the emergency for upon gaining the line
the threat of the entire white bands to with
draw if the latter were permitted to remain
caused their immediate discharge and thus
did prejudice complete its triumph but one
of the sections of the cadets of temperance
the morning star i believe determining to
have them offered them an engagement
but the band remembering their late treat
ment declined it unless the section would
agree to preserve the engagement however
averse their qpponents might be to their re
tention they did so and in a manner the
more honorable because they also shared the
exclusion w ith them this section followed
the procession in the rear at a snfficient dis
tance to make the cause obvious the gen
eral attention which thisjdrew caused many
in the ranks to feel ashamed of such proscrip
tion and overtures were made to the section
to take their proper place in the line hut be
ing once excluded they perepmptorily de
clined shortly after this occurrence one of
the fire companies in review of the triennial
parade of this month having the courage to
employ whom they would secured at once on
terms of perfect understanding the music of
the band whicli had been so obnoxious to the
other subsequently nut only was every one
of the colored bands engaged but several
were sought by companies who were disap
pointed in finding themselves too late mean
while the white musicians remembering the
triumph ufthe cadets and probably not know
ing the permanent character of the engage
ment which the colored bands had made
called a meeting among themselves and unani
mously passing a resolution not to play in the
procession unless the colored musicians were
excluded and had it published quite in season
to have the previous engagement broken
but not a single company bolted every one
determining not to cower to such a petty spir
it another card appeared afterwards pur
porting to be a refusal of the colored bands
to play unless the white bands were exclu
ded but this being untrue it was promptly
refuted the opponents rapidly diminishing
by several of the dissenting bands making en
gagements a final attempt was made by call
ing a meeting of the opposing delegates hut
whether they could not agree or were
ashamed of their proceedings they have never
yet met the public eye the day for the pro
cession has since come and gone and though
the weather was exceedingly unpropitious it
took place as in days gone by the colored
bands were indiscriminately mixed in the line
and so far as the writer knows not a single
deriding remark escaped either the spectators
or the musicians vho w ere thus humbled in
being obliged to play in the same procession
with those against whom they were so much
prejudiced dodsworths band of new
however made it an objection against
tbeir joining the procession and togethci
w ith the diligent hose company w hich em
ployed them went over the entire route in
advance of the line it is hoped that they
will yet he made ashamed of the distinction
which they thus gave themselves
with sentiments of high regard i am
yours for liberty and equality

portauprince feb bth 
friends douglas delasy after ai
unusually long silence which the overrul
ing force of circumstances imposed upon me
 eagerly embrace a few leisure moments
 io resume my correspondence though i
may have languished time has not been idle
and the year of our lord one thousand eigh
hundred and forty eight having made th
summation of its joys and its sorrows its gra
tifieations and its regrets ha gone to seek iu
predecessors in the past w hile that of eigh
teen hundred and forty nine with no treasure
but its hopes is impressing upon us the reali
ties of the present and giving us slight and
uncertain glimpses of the solemn and dreamy
future with us the old year passed ofl gai
ly and during the last day of its existence
the streets of portauprinee were enlivened
with passing parties of horsemen the oih
cfs of this and other governments going to
their felicitations to his excellency the pre
mdent of the haitian republic its gaiety
however was but the aurora with us promi
ses of meridian brightness and the following
day burst upon us in all the splendor that was
befitting the fortysixth anniversary of a ns
uoni independence early in the morning
of tbe first of january an immense concourse
consisting of tbe citizens and the military
were assembled is the place de pet ion in
front of the national palace the prescient
and other dipnitanea of tbe government were
in attendance as were also tbe consuls of
foreign powers resident here attired m their
respective uniforms the spectacle was a
magnificent one and as tbe morning sun was
reflected back from floating standards embroi
dered suits and glittering bayonets it seemed
as though i had been suddenly transported to
the fail regions of oriental tale upon tbe
mimic stage i may have seen typificattons of
this gorgeous mingling of steel and silk and
gold but certainly never have i had the com
monplaces of actual life broken in upon by so
imposing a pageant the splendor of the pre
sidents attiie surpassed any powers of descrip
tion that i may be possessed of let it there
fore suffce to say that it consisted of a scarlet
coat literally stiff with golden embroidery
long boots similarly decorated and the various
other portions of bis apparel in perfect keep
ing however much this galashow may
have conflicted with long imbibed notions of
republican simplicity the effect of its glitter
upon the senses was none the less imposing
after a short address by m dufresne the
secretarygenera the assemblage walked in
procession to the church where a solemn te
deum was chanted to the great dispenser of all
things under whose providence haiti is now
in the enjoyment of tranquility as well as in
dependence ever and anon throughout the
ceremonies of the day the deepmouthed can
non spoke out the heartfelt gratitude of aftee
people whilst every countenance evinced in a
manner that could not be mistaken the univer
sal joy
from the contemplation of this spectacle
my mind reverted to other scenes of which
this land has been the theatre the heroes
which vatying circumstances demanded pas
sed along in that rapid review which thought
ever orders first among them w as toussiant
louvreture who greater than the roman
that subdued his countrys foes re he sought
a redress for private wrongs paused in his
work of vengeance to perform an act of grate
tude it pictured him shaping the course of
that fearful exodus from oppression and at
length triumphant guiding his fellows with
a stern and steady hand in the way that an
untried liberty offered to their footsteps it
followed him in his successful rule until the
fell damps of an infernal dungeon cast their
blighting mildews over the genius that years
of bondage had not been able to extinguish
then came dessalines who called by his
countrymen to preside over those liberties
which lie had so gloriously etablished expi
ated by a bloody deatlt his grasping alter im
perial power nor was the recollection of
christnphe wantingthat selfemancipated
bondsman whose gigantic intellect after com
manding the admiration of the world could
not resist the glittering lures of regal dignity
but who rather than stoop from the lofty flight
that he had imagined sought in selfdestruc
tion a refuge from all abasement last came
alexandre petionhe whose military genius
had claimed the admiration of that greatest of
all modern chieftains napoleon bonaparte
he whose efforts to foster an infant republic
caused a grateful people to bestow upon him
the proud title of the father of his country
he whose untimely death was the sole event
in along administiation that caused a nations
tears to flow well might the mind ponder
on these instrumentuliiies for it was through j

tablished and that liberty so dearly earned
so watchfully guarded will henceforth and
forever remain the birthright of tier children

tinge which their maker has given them
when her tnurnes that raise their verdant
towards heaven shall crumble from their lof

break so iovingly upon her shores shall sweep
over the spots where nature bloums in her
most charming parure then if amid this gen

which haiti was once the stage be reenacted
 hough the actions of her liberators owing
to their having been reared in slavery may
not have always been characterised by that
disinterestedness which marks the perfect
patriotthough her sons maddened by the
prejudices which have been their heritage
may have caused fraternal blood to renew the
stain left by tbe band of her oppressors
though it is still problematical whether she
hath even yet reached the term of her calami

the dispassionate historian will be able
to make every little deduction from the
vast mass of infamy wuh which the
memory of the wicked judge has been
loaded
he was a man of quick and vigorous
parts but constitutionally prone to
insolence and to the angry passions
when just emerging from boyhood ne
had risen into practice at the old bai
ley bar a bar where advocates have
always used a license of tongue un
known in westminster hall here
during many years his chief business
was to examine and cross examine the
most hardened miscreants of a great
capital daily conflicts with prostitutes
and thieves called out his powers so
effectually that he became the most
consummate bully ever known in his
profession all tenderness for the
feelings of others all selfrespect all
sense of the becoming were oblitera
ted from his mind he acquired a
boundless command of the rhetoric in
which the vulgar express hatred and
contempt the profusion of maledic
tions and vituperative epithets which
composed his vocabulary could hardly
have been rivalled in the fish market or
the beargarden his countenance
and his voice must always have been
unamiable but these natural advan
tagesfor such he seems to have
thought themhe had improved to such
a degree that there were few who in
his paroxysms of rage could see or
hear him without emotion impudence
and ferocity sat upon his brow the
glare of his eyes had a fascination for
the unhappy victims on whom they were
fixed yet his brow and eye were said
to be less terrible than the savage lines
of his mouth
his yell of fury as was said by one
who had often heard it sounded like
the thunder ofthe judgment day these
qualification lie carried while still p
young man from the bar to the bench
he early became common sergeant
and then recorder df london as
judge at the city sessions he exhibited
the same propensities which afterwards
in a higher post gained for him an un
enviable immortality already might
be remarked of him the most odious
vice which is human nature
a delight in misery merely as misery
there was a fiendish exultation in the
way in which he pronounced sentence
on felons their weeping and implor
ing seemed to titillate him voluptuously
and he loved to scare them into fits by
dilating with luxurious on
all the details of what they were to sui
ter thus when he had an opportuni
ty of ordering an unlucky adventuress
to be whipped at the carts tail
hangman he would exclaim j
charge you to pay particular attention

scourge her till the blood runs down
it is christmas a cold time for madam

lyjess facetious when he passed judg

drunken tailor who fancied himself a
prophet impudent rogue roared
jeffreys thou shaft have an easy
easy easy punishment one part oi
this easy punishment was the pillory
in which the wretched fanatic was al
most killed with brickbats
by this time the nature of jeffreys
had been hardened to that temper which
tyrants require in their worst imple
ments he had hitherto looked for
professional advancement to the cor
poration of london he had there
fore professed himself a roundhead
and had always appeared to be in u
higher state of exhilaration when he
explained to popish priests that they
were to be cut down and were to see
their own bodies burned than when he
passed ordinary sentences of death
but as soon as he had got all that the
city would give he made haste to sell
his forehead of brass and his tongue ot
venom to thecourt
chipfinch who was accustomed to
act as broker in infamous contracts ol
more than one kind lent his aid he
had conducted many amorous and po
litical intrigues but he assuredly never
rendered a more scandalous service to
his masters than when he introduced
jeffreys to whitehall the renegade
soon found a patron in the obdurate and
revengeful james but was always re
garded with scorn and disgust by
charles whose faults great as they
were had no affinity with insolence and
cruelty that man said the king

ed to lead an important cause was
made chief justice ofthe kings bench
his enemies could not deny that he
i possessed some of the qualities of a
great judge his legal knowledge
indeed was merely such as he had
picked up in practice of uo very high
i kind but he had one of those happily
constituted intellects which across the
labyrinths of sophistry and through
j masses of immaterial facts goes sraighi
to the true point of his intellect how
ter he seldom had the lull use lven
in civil causes his malevolent and dss
jpotic temper perpetually disordered hu
judgment  o enter his court was tc
enter the den of a wld beast which
none could tame ao d which was at
likely to be roused to rage by caressei
as by attacks he frequently poured
forth on plaintiffs and defendants bar
risters and attorneys witnesses and
jurymen torrents of frantic abuse
intermixed with oaths and curses hie
looks and tones had inspired terroi
when he was merely a young advocate
struggling into practice now tbit he
was at the head of the most formidable
tribunal in the realm there were few
indeed who did not tremble before him
i even w hen he was sober his violence
was sufficiently frightful out in gen
eral his reason was overclouded and
his evil passions stimulated by the
iurnes of intoxication his evening
were ordinarily given to revelry
people who saw him ooly over his
bottle would have supposed him to be
a man gross indeed sottish and ad
dicted to u w company and low merri
ment but social and good humored
he was constantly surrounded on such
occasions by buffoons selected for the
most part from among the vilest petti
foggers who practised before him
these men bantered and abused each
other for his entertainment he joined
in their ribald talk sang catches with
them and when his head grew hot
hugged and kissed them in an ecstacy
of londirss but though wine at first
seem to soften his heart the effect a
few hours later was very different he
often came to the judgmentseat having
kept the court waiting long and yet
having but half slept off his debauch
his cheeks on fire his eyes glaring like
those of a maniac when he was in
this stae his boon companions of the
preceding night if they were wise
kept out of his way for the recollection
of the familiarity to which he had ad
mitted them inflamed his malignity
and he was sure to lake every oppor
tunity of overwhelming them with ex
ecration and invective nol the least
odious of his many odious peculiarities
was the pleasure which he took in pub
licly browbeating and mortifying those
whom in this fits of maudlin tenderness
he had encouraged to presume on his
favor
the services which the government
had expected from him were performed
hot merely without flinching but eager
ly and triumphantly his first exploit
was the judicial murder of algernon
sidney what followed was in perfect
harmony w ith this beginning respec
table lories lamented the disgrace which
the barbarity or indecency of so great
a functionary brought upon the admin
istration of justice but the excesses
which filled such men with horror
were titles to the esteem of james jeff
ryes therefore after the death of
charles obtained a seat in the cabinet
and a peerage this last honor was
a signal mark of royal approbation

they steamed  miles without find

look up into the interior por half a
j century english government have been
expending lives and treasures in a
partial exploration they have found
that this whole tract of country is one
of amazing fertility and beauty
abounding in gold and all sorts of tropi

woods invaluable for dying and archi

portions of the world through it for
thousands of miles runs a broad river

depth flowing on at a rate of two or
three miles an hour without rock

magnificent delta in the world consist

tjieseve sleepers
ihe story ol the seven sleepers is the
most romantic of the legends of the
church it is as followswhen the
emperor decius persecuted the chris
tians seven noble youths of ephesus
concealed themselves in a spacious cav
ern on the side ot an adjacent moun
tain where they were doomed to perish
by the tyrant who gave orders that the
entrance should be firmly secured by a
pile of stones they immediately fell
into a deep slumber which was most
miraculously prolonged without injuring
the powers of life during a period of
one hundred aud eightyseven years
at the end of that time the slaves of
a dolus to whom the inheritance of the
mountain had descended removed the
stooes to aupply materials for some
rustic edifice the light of the sun
darted into the cavern and the seven
sleepers were pennited to awake soon
after rising from their sleep which they
thought bad lasted only a few hours
they were pressed by the calls of hun
ger and resolved that jamblichus one
of their number should secretly return
to the city to purchase bread for the j
use of himself and his companions the
youth if we may still employ that ap
pellation could no longer recognise the
once familiar aspect of his native coun
try and his surprise was increased by
the appearance of a large cross
triumphantly erected over the principal
gate of ephesus kis singular dress j
and obsolete language confounded the
baker to whom he offerd an ancient
medal of decius as the current coin of
the empire and jamblichus on the
snspicion of a secret treasure was
dragged before the judgetheir mu
tual inquires produced the amazing dis
covery that two centuries were almost
elapsed since jamblichus and his friends
had escaped from the rage of a pagan
tyrant the bishop of ephesus the
clergy the magistrate the people and

broken the power of kings and had

it had grown mischievous it was time
