an address
delivered at oberlin ohio by miss
sally holley daughter of the late
myron holley of rochester jv f
ladies of the antislavery societt
i am happy in being permitted to ad
dress youglad to lift up my voice in
behalf of human freedom and tho this
phrase is often on our lips and in our
ears yet we cannot too fully drink in its
blessed spirit nor too vividly realize its
grand significance and glorious truth
and if the few words that i shall say
this afternoon will advance but one
hour the inevitable progress of human
freedom and the downfall of human sla
very i would not exchange that con
sciousness for ali the gold of califor
nia or the fame of a washington
if in the bosom of a single individual
they shall aid to extinguish one bitter
and cruel prejudice against the colored
race or kindle and quicken the slum
bering energies of one heart into gen
erous sympathy with the despised and
outraged african i shall be amply re
warded and it you will excuse this one
expression of a filial affection that
never slumbers nor sleeps i will
add that i shall feel from out his man
sion of rest in heaven the smile of a
sainted fathers love resting upon me
i propose to consider my subject un
der the following heads
ist the importance of the antisla
very movement
ski what it has actually accom
plished
d what can we do for its advance
ment
elihu burnt says the idea that a
man cannot own property in man or
make him a chattel has not fifty years
of age or expansion if we may say
it reverently the virgin mary of that
idea was an obscure english woman
who was startled from her slumbers
night after night by its vivid revela
tionsit wrought in her mind for
months absorbing all of her thoughts
all the glow of her sympathies all the
vigor of her convictions and its hour
came she proclaimed it to the world
with a heartpower that reached the
consciences of statesmen and stirred
the nation to emotion look at the idea
now see how tho principalities and
powers of the earth are bowing before
and a few years ago harriet mar
tineau wrote the most sublime spec
tacle now moving on the face of the
globe are the abolitionists in the united
states they include men of every
shade of color of every degree of edu
cation of every variety of religious
opinion ot every gradation of rank
bound together by no vow no pledge
no stipulation but each preserving his
individual liberty and yet they act as if
they were of one heart and of one soul
a well grounded faith towards a no
ble object is the only principle which
can account for such a spectacle
thus many of the leading minds of the
age early appreciated the importance
of the antislavery movement if
there was any doubt in their mind
about its ultimate triumph it lay in this
that like the doctrine of our immortali
ty it seemed almost too good to be
true well might they sing
oh could we make our doubt remove
those gloomy doubt that rie
and aee this canaan that we love
with unbeclouded eye
and m friends it is good for us
now that the antislavery struggle has
gained many victories to revert to the
pioneers of this great moral enterprise
it is refreshing to the very soul to think
of their courage and heroism most of
them from the beginning foresaw that
the conflict was likely to be long and
arduous and they girded themselves
accordingly for the conflict they pre
sent us a noble example of a brave fi
delity and a devotedness to as holy a
cause as ever blessed mankind for
antislavery is the child of christianity
it bears on its very front the image
sod superscriptionof god the an
tislavery movement is important be
cause it not only is to redeem three
and a half millions of colored people
from the vilest system of slavery the
tun ever shone upon and place them
on a level of a common humanity but
it is also to bring freedom to all races
we must never forget that it is as
much the cause of the white as of the
colored people vviib every black
lave a white will also be freed it
is prophetic of the doing away of all op
pression it is the foundation of uni
versal freedom it is the dawn of that
day when the rights of all shall be re
spected

the antislavery movement is im
portant in another most interesting
sense one of its most striking char
acteristics is its genuine and exalted
regard to the moral nature it may be
doubted whether since the days of the
apostles anything has ever occurred
to awaken so large a portion of the
world to the great fact that they hnd
spiritual rights and hopes as this same
antislavery movement it teaches
that the identity of a human being is
not in flesh and blood but in thought
affection conscience will and all the
riches of the spiritual nature when
told that the slaves have cookies and
dances and so ought to be contented it
indignantly replies is it not true that
the life is more than meat and the
body than raiment shall man live by
bread alone and not by every word
that proceedeth out of the mouth of
god
the antislavery movement is im
portant for it appeals to all the noblest
sentiments and aspirations of the hu
man soul it awakens a fervor of love
an earnestness of devotion and an en
larged hope that is twice blessed
it blesses hie that gives and him that takes
all over our land are those that
couldrise up and testify to the great
work it has wrought in their own souls
enriching and elevating their entire
being in consequence of the agita
tion of the antislavery question many
an otherwise wouldbe cipher in soci
ety both men and women are now
transformed into characters of perma
net interest and beauty it has im
parted vigor and freshness to their
once dull and withered lives and as
one after another of the colored race
escapqp from the south and undo the
heavy chain of ignorance they too as
tonish and delight us by exhibiting a
force of intellect and a fullness of ele
vated sympathy that before was not
so much as dreamed of in our philoso
phy witness thal most remarkable
man of the age frederick douglass
hear his rich and touching language
i sometimes forget the color of my
skin and remember that i am a man
i sometimes forget that i am hated of
men and loved of god has the white
man religious aspirations so have i
thoughts that wander thro eternity
and affections that ascend even to the
everlasting throne and cling around
my heavenly father here let me
ask you all to read gerrit smiths re
cent letter to mr douglass it is good
to have the heart stirred by the emotion
it excites it is good to let the dry
wastes within be freshened by the
tears of sympathy it occasions if the
cause of antislavery had made us ac
quainted with but one such spirit as
gerrit smiths we should greatly re
joice what then should we not feel
when we call to mind the glorious
company of the antislavery reform
ers think of a garrison a goodale
angelina weld and lucretia molt
that beautiful example of woman
hood to use the language of dr
channing and a host of others even
the most unfriendly to abby kelley
must see that she has brought holy and
beautiful gifts to the altar of god and
humanity with ali ihy faults i love
thee still
the antislavery movement is im
portant because it proposes to unite
the two races into one although i
have forgotten many other good things
that professor thome said in the rhe
torical class i shall not easily lose his
remarks made while criticising an an
tislavery discussion he saidit
is a great happiness for me i love to
look forward to the time when through
the divine influence of christian anti
slavery principle the two races shall
iqipgle into one the two races
united and in kindly activity can find
out everything and accomplish every
thing that is true they will subject
the elements then instead ot subjecting
one another the elements are made
for subjection their broad shoulders
are spread for service it does not de
grade them or weary them or impov
erish them to be made to work aye
they are willing to work all they
want of intelligent mankind is tint it
will stand out of the way and give them
elbow room and a chance
the antislavery movement is im
portant in view of its influence upon the
nominal church of our country it has
stripped off the stolen mask of goodness
and purity with which she has so long
tried to deceive if possible the very
elect aiffl shown up the cant hypocri
sy hollowheartedness and utter world
liness that lay concealed beneath let
none of my friends mistake me here i j
love and reverence the true church of
god as the very gate of heaven as
the shadow of a great rock in a weary
land but this is a very different thing
from the proslavery churches of this
world no one of us cau for a moment
look at the church and clergy of our
land without tne deepest humiliation
and mortificationwith a few noble ex
ceptions it must be owned they are all
on the side of oppression
we live in a crisis when a tremen
dous conflict of principles is taking
place on one side is the oppressor
struggling to keep his power for the
sake of his gold and with him the mer
cenary the faithlessly timid the am
bitous and the weak on the other
side are the friends of the slave and
with them those who without possibility
of recompense are sacrificing their
reputations their fortunes their quiet
and risking their lives for the principle
of freedom what are the church and
a great portion of the clergy doing
amidst this war which admits of neither
peace nor truce but which must end
right is of no sex truth is of no color god is the father of us all and all men are brethren
in the subjugation of the principles of
freedom or of oppression as a body
they must be ranked as the enemies of
the slave so while society is going
thro its greatest of moral revolutions
casting out its most hateful abomina
tions and bringing its christianity into
its politics and its social conduct the
church and the clergy are pitying and
ridiculing the apostles of the revolution
preaching speculative doctrinesmourn
ing over the wickedness of the ancient
jews and telling how stiffnecked and
rebellious people were a thousand
years ago advocating third and fourth
rate objects of human exertion and
leaving it to the laity to carry out the
first and pressing reforms of the age
they are blind to their mission of en
lightening and guiding the moral senti
ments of society in its greatest crisis
and yet professing abolitionists some
times tell us beware how you disre
spect the church and the ministers
antislavery must not lose its rever
ence for themcome of the slaves
what may abolish slavery ifyou can
but reverence the clergy the pulpit
aud the steeple whether or no our
judgment and our conscience answer
no we must prefer christianity to
the churchthe inward spirit to the
outward means and lastly i will
mention one of the considerations for
which i doom the antislavery move
ment important though in this i
may differ from some whose charac
ters i admire and whose opinions  re
spect and whom i should feel honored
to call my friends i allude to what
it has done for woman as woman it
has no small measure awakened her to
fact that she has political as
social rights and duties it has
made her intelligent as to the wicked
laws and usurpations of government in
this country honorable women not
a few are beginning to feel and act in
view of their immense responsibilities
in all philanthropic improvements
the antislavery movement has
helped them to see the difference be
tween a few mangranted peculiar
privileges and the essential godgiven
rights of their moral nature before
antislavery agitation who ever heard
of womens attending political meet
ings and listening with thrilling inter
est to political speeches when a
chase a seward pres mahan and
prof hudson speak in this chapel who
does not know that a large portion of
the audience are the women of oberlin
this is a loud comment upon the spirit
of the age
 what the antislavery movement
has actually accomplished it is gen
erally admitted that since the com
mencement of the antislavery strug
gle the condition of the free people of
color has greatly improved talent
enterprise and moral worth have been
developed that have ensured the es
teem and commanded the respect of
community prejudice in various quar
ters is giving way and caste will abate
as slavery becomes more odious until
they both descend to the region of
darkness from whence they sprang
the time will come we are encouraged
to believe when individuals will be ap
preciated according to their moral
worth irrespective of complexion sex
or condition in life when disabilities
will be removed and all enjoy the
privilege of rising according to their
talents enterprize and character the
antislavery movement has accom
plished what from the outsat it meant
to do it has brought the subject of
abolition into our national and state
legislatures antislavery is the all
absorbing subject of interest in the
hall of congress
the first men of the nation are now
engaged in its discussionand a few
days will bring us intelligence concern
ing it of the deepest interest the
antislavery movement has caused
ohio to repeal her black laws and
provide for the education of her color
ed children tbe proper officers are
authorized to admit colored children in
to the regular public schools and in
case they do not admit them they are
required to create schools for their spe
cial benefit colored persons are now
placed in regard to the distribution and
benefits of the school funds upon the
same footing with white persons the
antislavery movement has greatly
aided the free people of color in their
efforts for intellectual and social eleva
tion amorig many instances we no
tice the following the salem regis
ter says robert morris esq of
boston the young colored lawyer a
native of this city appeared as counsel
j in a case before the court of common
pleas now sitting in salem on tues
day last he managed his oase with
much ability and his presence excited
considerable sensation we hear his
effort spoken of as having given great
pleasure and satisfaction which were
not diminished by the consideration
that the first colored lawyer who has
j ever made his appearance in the courts
i here was one of our townsmen the
graduate at the last commencement at
middlebury vt college who deliv
ered the latin salutatory oration was
a colored man the new york cen
tral college at mcgrawville has a col
ored professor who is said to fill his of
fice with dignity and ability the
new york tribune in giving an ac
count of the examination of the public
school no  colored by the trus
tees in the presence of many visitors
and distinguished friends of education
says
the boys under mr peterson a
colored teacher numbered iso and
compared intellectually very well with
some of the other dpublie schools
their order end readiness were com
rochester n y thursday january  
mend able there ib a well selected li
brary connected with tbe school and
many other appliances for effective
teaching in the girls department
were  girls who were ladylike and
orderly with a fair thare of intelli
gence they read well wrote very
well and sang better some drawings
and paintings wfre decidedly good
the principal miss roe colored is
an intellectual and accomplished wo
man chas avery an opulent cit
izen ofpittsburgh pa has founded a
highschool for people of
intending to exclude other youthwhich
has been opened within a short time
it is called the alleghany insti
tute and is ty its charter a college
of the nine tmstees  are colored
nine successors to continue in the same
ratio forever the people of color
are making agricultural efforts that are
highly commendable the munificent
grants of land tsthe colored persons by
gcrrit smith in the state of new york
have induced a number of them to
commence subduing the forest and til
ling the soil their attention is
wisely drawn to ihe country and from
the employments and temptations inci
dent to their condition in cities the
convention of colored citizens held
last winter in colimbus was spoken of
by the newspapers with approbation of
the order of the proceedings the
ability of the speakersand the happy in
fluences exerted there are newspa
pers published and cwducted by col
ored persons which compare hand
somely with any in the countryand
my friends i might numerate many
more instances that shiw what the anti
slavery movement las actually ac
complishedl presune ii is unneces
sary
your own observafeon and reading
can supply them bu if i were asked
to tell in one singh phrase what is
the best thing the anislavery strug
gle has accomplished i would answer
lt has developed in he minds of the
community the idea f perfect human
freedom one of th greatest ideas
that ever dawned uptti created mind
personal freedom pditical freedom
religious freedom lol every individual
of the human race tor this inestima
ble service we are imnediately indebt
ed to the antislavery movement and
this brings me to tbe d head of my
addresswhich is
what can we do for the advancement
of the anti slavery cause
in the first place we can and must
discharge from every chamber of our
soul all prejudice against color this
is the first work for a true aboitionist
to do at home and abroad ir high
ways and byways in stagecoash and
steamboat in song and sermon always
and everywhere we must set oir face
against it yes the poor black slave
as he is a stalking animal wth his
mind all crushed in walking n this
green earth without a single pusation
belonging to a free man must u pre
cious and sacred in our estimation
my friends i ask you in all the serious
ness of my soul it is not enougl that
the colored people have to content with
their own ignorance stupidity and in
dolence in the way of their elevltion
without having to encounter this kick
ed prejudice against colorthat is press
ing down upon them with giant
weight on every side almost alike from
the sinner and the professing christian
think you the thought that you helped
to swell the tide of bitter prejudice
against color will add to the treasure
of your holy recollections in tbe great
future think you your heavenly
father will welcome you with more
love into his mansions of glory will
the smile of his countenance be more
radiant as you enter will it give mel
ody to your voice as you join the song
salvation to our god which sitteth up
on the throne and unto the lamb
my friends i beseech you by all your
hopes of heaven by all your sympathy
in a saviors dying love to cast off at
once and forever all prejudice against
color i know the influence of educa
tion association and custom of society
is great i know the power of sin and
selfishness is strong i know the
bondage of the flesh and the world is
not easily broken alas how few of
us ever escape alas how few of us
ever know what full salvation means
let us all remember that every time
we make a distinction merely on ac
count of color whether in the church
in the choir in the street in the recita
tion room in the social party every
time we refuse to associate with wor
thy colored people on terms of perfect
social civil and religious equality we
are helping to bind tighter the chains
of the poor slavewe are assisting to
put further off in the future the dy of
his deliverancewe are aiding to
trample uuder our feet and deeper in
the dust those for whom christ died
i say this as much for my own as for
any bodys else benefit we need to
look this matter full in the taco it
has been dodged long enough by pro
fessing abolitionists the only safe po
sition for the christian reformer is a
bold and uncompromising one it may
lead even to the cutting off of a right
band or the picking out of a right eye
no matter it must be done it is bet
ter to enter life maimed then having
two handa to be caat into hell fire
christianity is true candid aweet and
full of aimplicity yet strong amfcoura
geous what tho her way lie through
doubt darkness and difficulties yet
leaning on her fathers arm she feared
no evil a genflemsn who lor tbe first
time contributed to aid the anlislayery
cause said to a colored friend of mine
whe was lecturing i once bad great
prejudices against your people but
when i was converted they all left me
here was a genuine conversation
what a child of heaven despising any
color that god had seen fit to give hip
human family tho the hue for very
blackness
to thame might bring
the ptaamgo of the ravcna wing
a few years ago u gentleman wlo
professed to be a good abolitionist
was staying at mv mothersl sus
pected that he plumed himself rather
high upon his abolitionism so i ven
tured to test him i invited the only
colored neighbor we had to take tea
with us i said nothing to this gentle
man about it and when tea was an
nounced i was not surprised to ob
serve the quick flush of indignation that
broke over his countenance as he en
tered the room from which when he
saw who was there he precipitately
retreated afterwards i said to him
i thought you called yourself an abo
litionist he replied well soldo
but i dont intend to eat with black
folks and even in oberlin this
spirit sometimes manifests itself in
this place not many years ago a gen
tlemartinvited all his table mates to
accompany him on a ride to the lake
now it so happened one was colored
and did not go on the way out a
lady suddenly exclaimed o we are
not all here after all i do not see
naming the colored individual
a gentleman replied i think he
showed his good sense in not coming
he would not have enjoyed the ride
with us well said the lady
whose fault is it his for wearing a
skin not colored like ours or ours who
by our behavor aie constantly remind
ing him of the difference in our colors
there is truth in what an antislavery
editor has written our people have
got the colorphobia some of them
have it in blue collapse stage many
of them have got it so bad they cant
get well they will die of it it will
be a mercy if the nation does not what
a dignified philosophic malady dread
ofcomplexion they dont know they
have got it or think rather they took
it in the natural way but they were
innoculated it was breathed into their
veins and incided into their systems by
old dr slavery it is fouler than old
testament leprosy it seems to set
the dragon into people and make them
treat poor darkskinned folks like a
tiger it goes hardest with dark com
plexioned white people
yes my friends from our heart we
must discharge all prejudice against
color it is low base mean and utter
ly unworthy unless we do arise above
it we need not claim to be antislave
ry if there is any professing christian
here who is not willing to regard and
esteem people irrespective of their
color to him i say you may say that
garrison disbelieves the bible and
denounces the sabbathyou may call
abby kelly a hyenasay that em
erson and parker are of the worst
species of infidelthat douglass
scoffs and makes fun of religion
that gerrit smith is a fanaticthat
dr channing did not know what
christian salvation meant you may
say all these things and ten times hard
er things if you mil but do not call
yourself a christian dream not for
mercys sake that you in all your
sphere of influene and usefulness
are an appropriate representative of
the lord jesus do not ask
us to believe your spirit and life to be
christian tell us not to think you
are not far from the kingdom of hea
ven that you are helping to build
up the kingdom of truth and righteous
ness which jesus came to set up on
earthfor which the lamb was slain
before the foundation of the world
which caused the indefinite father
out of the fulness of his love to send
his only begotten son to die to re
deem us from sin and misery do not
expect that you have any part or lot
in this matter you are not laying a
solitary stone in the walls of zion
human redemption the angels and
archangels of god love to look over
the battlemenvof heaven to witness the
going forward of this grand provision
of the wonderful love of the everlast
ing father think i ask you what
the words mean that you so atfecting
ly sing
jews i my cross have taken
all to leave and follow thee
naked poor despised forsaken
thou front hence my all shall be
again we can aid the antislavery
cause by embracing every opportunity
to do all in our power to elevate the
colored people give them our respect
and confidence give them offices of
trust and honorwe must minister to
their selfrespect their highest pow
ers must be brought out into action
we must mingle freely with them
the idea of colored churches and
colored schools is all false there
should exist no such distinctions in so
ciety they must be made to feel at
home with us and we feel at home with
them it is brtter for us both their
presence amrassociation with us are
vitally needed for their and our mutual
welfarefor ttftir and our mutual
nourishment of their and our wronged
and sickly chardfeters gerrit smith
writesa few years ago i spent a
sabbath in one of the large towns of
western new york and as is wont
when i have the opportunity i wor
shipped with a company of colored per
sons the unregulated seal of not a
few of my fellowworshippers was loud
and freoxied indecent and disgusting
whence this gross violation of pro
priety
this was clearly traceable to their
exclusion from the society of the well
informed had they bean allowed to
terms s  per abbbm ißttritmy xb ajvabcc
associate with their white brethren
they would hare participated in the in
telligence of those brethren had they
instead of being shut out from the tem
ples of those brethren by arrange
ments and restrictions such as even
the most degraded can scarcely look
had they instead of this outrage upon
their equal rights and instead of being
compelled to herd together in their ig
norance and fanaticism been allowed
to worship with those brethrenthey
would have fallen not at all behind
them in the knowledge and observance
of a deportment proper to the sanctua
ry as moral reform women we can
not expect to do muh until slavery is
abolished the hideousness of slavery
is most awfully seen when it puts its
great claw into domestic life and
wrenches thence all that is most pre
cious and sacred this one monstrous
outrage ought fo array the whole civi
lized world in storm and deathless ener
gy of opposition against it o when
ive heard abolitionists accused of
using harsh and denunciatory lan
guage against slavery i have thought
if such accusers had ever experienced
a tithe of the horrors of slavery they
would deem all language too feeble
too impotent to show forth faintly the
unutterable character of this ill that
hath befalen inheriting flesh an
ill that flesh by nature wa not
heir towell has slavery been
called hell above ground there
are subjects on which not to appear
terazy and fanatical would be to be
come a moral iceburgh again as
antislavery women we can and it is
our serious duty to keep ourselves ac
quainted with the changes of aspect
this question is from time to time as
suming before the face of our country
we should bd armed with intelligence
as to antislavery affairs so as to be
able to converse freely and with effect
upon everything concerned in them
bring up the subject as often as you
can and discuss it earnestly and feel
ingly i confess i have great confi
dence and hope in talk i believe with
one of our professors that it is the
heavenly light it is one of the
mightiest agencies for good or ill that
has ever been placed in the reach of
human beings antislavery women
should read the doings of congress
when such men as henry clay and
daniel webster rise in the senate
chamber of the united states and give
their energies and influence on the side
of chains and oppression and their
speeches are reading all over the land
exerting a powerful bias upon the
moulding minds of the oung blinding
tbeir intellects and preventing their
moral sense and inducing them to close
tbeir hearts against the cry of the
downtrodden slave o is it not a
high duty for the antislavery woman
to be able to point out to those around
her the unprincipled baseness of such
speeches and to counteract their effect
never in the history of our country
since the days of arnold has there
been so traitorous a political act as
mr websters speech and it ought to
rouse the wholo country to burning in
dignation against it never has bos
ton exhibited such preposterous and
glaring inconsistency as in condeming
i w webster while approving and
congratulating daniel webster why
john w webster has killed only one
mao and then in a moment of passion
while danis has deliberately consign
ed throe and a half millions to a con
ation ten thousand times worse than
death it shows up the moral sense of
tiat city in anything but an enviable
light as antislavery women we
cannot take an enlightened interest in
we cannot render a good and efficient
service to the cause we love and honor
without knowing how it stands before
our country we must be able to
prove that the course of h clay de
serves the deepest abhorrence of all
christian hearts many of the young
people here are reading his speech and
think it fine and their minds are
taking a permanent stamp from it
now we ought as a matter of chris
tian antislavery principle cultivate
if we have it not already a decided
taste for such reading and with all the
intellect and energy we can summon
up battle valiantly for the true and the
right i do not believe that if in the
place of the endless talk about dress
society and the beaux we should intro
duce such topics our tabletalks our
home conversations our rural sides
and walks or social intercourse any
where would be any the less interest
ing then too we must appreciate
and honor such antislavery champions
as horace mann john p hale w
h seward and s p chase they
have done nobly in congress their
speeches are refreshing and inspiring
to every true antislavery soul if the
apeeches of clay and webster made
our hearts throb with pain those of
hale chase mann and seward
qaused them to leap with gladness 
have just been reading mr chases
speech how much more honorable
to humanity than daniel websters
no wonder whittier thought icba
bod o when i see so distinctly por
trayed the consequences of legislative
actionthe ship of state freighted
with liberty and blessings of many
the woes and agonies of others its very
sails beaten with their sighsits spars
creaking with their wailsits lading
drenched with bloody sweatthe
heartbreaking separation of famiiiea
the crippling destroying and wouldbe
kitlipg of the immortal mind distancing
popery and even mahoraedanism itself
while  feel hmmbly grateful for the
posseeaion of reason natural rights
and benevolence is it strange tint i
whole no 
should sire with all my tout to ex
ercise these in the way that shall be
meet potent most efficient for good
and here to my gentemett friends
present let me askdo you value the
ballotbox that executes your wiu as
freemanthat guards as a sacred trea
sure your deposits in the sues of the
good and the right do you prise this
inheritance beyond all price lias god
given to man tbe rights of selfgovern
ment and not to woman also is oar
sensibility to be wounded by the tele
of oppression consequent on bad lawa
and the power to be withheld from us
to counteract as far as we might by
good by just legislation it is useless
to plead that we are ignorant and there
fore incapacitated give us knowl
edgegive us lightgive us encour
agement as you would the serfs of
russsia or the peasants of hungary
it is insufficient to urge that home and
society afford just as good and all
necessary opportunities for manifesta
tions of patriotism of humanity let
the lawmade condition of three and a
half millions of staves answer with
refutation let the response of your
own hearts to tbe question would you
for any consideration give up yoer en
franchisement be the answer the
day will come when the right and ne
cesityof womans voting will be felt
and acknowledged god speed the
right and here if it were in order
i would say by way of doing that
it is indeed a very melancholy fact
that so few women realize the least re
sponsibility in this matter but does it
not all spring from the manspoken and
womanechoed precepts that women
should not meddle with politics it
would generate family feuds why
then is it not dangerous for men too
certainly it is very clear they ought
not to meddle with politics in what
ever effects the interests of humanity
men and women must have a common
cause the cynical sneers of the
press and from all other not wholly the
most philanthropic unquestionable
quarters in regard to the awakening in
terest of woman in politicsis by no
means an ill or even discouraging
omen and if the honesly good join in
the shake of the head they will not
point the finger of derision we need
only leave the temples of truth where
the light of religion of science of free
dom are now beaming with sunny
brightness and take our way down the
broad avenues gradually becoming
less and less broad the lights dimmer
and more dim till we are compelled to
thread a passage almost feeling our

as the cars were departing for the balti

some degree parallel to to longs case and
deserves to be made public a respectable
flee colored man in appearance had been
serving as waiter st one of the city hotels
he had recently come from baltimore there
was no question of his freedom none as to hts
character but he was informed upon as a
fellow who was seeking to earn his own
bread by he nest industry forty miles from hie
birthplace he was arrested and the offence
proved
he was ordered to give bonds in one thou
end dollars tor his good behavior or to leave
the place in twentyfour hours but like
many other respectable men lie could get no
body to bind himself in the penal sum of one
thousand dollats toinsure the corporation
the people of washington for the good health
food conduct and success of this black man
ie sotrowfully took up his bundle and went
to the baltimore cars to shake off the dust ot
hie feet against the place but he was there
met with the information that he could not
enter the cars to leave the district unlew he
gave bond for a thousand dollars with two
ufficient securities that he was not a slave
here was another illustration of the advanta

seventh a nnnal meeting oi tbo western
iv y antislavery society
the members and friends of this sooiet
met in irving hall on thursday jan th
at  oclock a m
benjamin fish the president of the so
ciety took the chair and the meeting wa
further organised by the appointment of julia
griffiths and sarah c burtis secretariss
frederick douglass abby kelly foster
abigail bush amy post and asa anthony
were appointed a business committee
while the committee were out preparing
business for the meeting hiram wilson o
canada made some interesting remarks abou
the fugitives in canada their present suffer
ing condition notwithstanding the kiodnes
of the people there manifested in their behalf
mr wilson expressed an earnest hope tbs
something could be done for them by th
friends of the slave in thia vieinity
frederick douglass from the businas
committee here reported a series of resolu
tions which were received
resolved thst american slavery is a sin
of the first rank a flagrant outrage agaiost
human nature a violation of the first princi
ples of justice a mockery of our professedly
free institutions a fool disgrace and scandal
and that it ought to be immediately and uncon
ditionally abolished
resolved that slavery ia not exclusively
an institution of the south but that it is
also an institution of tba north and of ibe
west and of the whole united states involv
ing in a common guilt and shame the tshou
american people
resolved thst slaveholding can never be
defended upon any principles but such as are
in accordance with theft robbery pitaey
and murder and that the faet that slavery
openly defended by professed ministers of the
gospel from the american pulpit implies a
blindness of moral vision a desdnosa of sen
sibility a perverseness of spirit and a prone
ness io evil which must shock and alarm
every man wbo teals an intelligent interest in
the moral and teligoo wellbeing of the
nation
resolved that we regatd with the fnlleet
measure ol detestation and scorn the recent
murderous threat of millard fillmore that he
is determined to exeeule the inhuman enact
ment of congress for the recapture of fugi
tive slaves even at the point of the bayonet
and that notwithstanding tbits throat we
shall never refuse to give bread or shelter to
the panting fugitive nor to use any means
consistent with christian prineiplea to hide
the outcast and to deliver the spoiled out
of the hands of the spoiler
resolved that each individual man ia
the rightful owner of eyes hands or pm w
dimensions menses affections and passions
with which be haa been endowed by hia
creator and that no law constitution nor
compact can aver invalidate or destroy
this natural and inherent self ownership
resolved that he who attempts under
the fugitive slave taw to enslave a fellow
man does in that act disregard the very
principles of justice by which as a man his
own life and liberty are secured to him and
if he should be struck down or shot down by
his victim in such an attempt the common
sense of mankird could pronounce hut one
judgment upon his fate via it served the
villain right
resolved that the constitution ot the
united states according to the popular inter
pretation of that instrument and the uniform
practice of the government under it is a
slaveholding compaot and that he who swears
to support that eompact agreeing with that
interpretation of it makes himself a partner in
the criminality of slaveholding and ought not
to be regarded consistent as the advocate of
emancipation
resolved that while we rejoice at the
manly stand taken last winter in congress
by william h seward john p hale s
p chase horace mann j r giddings
thaddeus stevens charles durkee and other
noble friends of freedom who eloquently op
posed the extension of slavery and the enact
ment of the horrid fugitive slave bill we are
nevertheless impelled to the oonclusion that
they are shorn of their moral strength and
are rendered comparatively powerless in the
presence of slaveholders while they solemnly
swear to respect the alleged proslavery com
promises of the constitution
whereas strenuous efforts are now being
made by proslavery priests and corrupt po
liticians in this state and elsewhere to pul
down antislavery agitation and to give peace
and quiet to this guilty country and where
as we believe that that agitation is founded
on the principles of eternal justice and iu the
noblest sentiments of the human soul and
whereas to cease from that agitation is to dis
regard those principles and sentiments to
prove traitors to god and to man and to havt
more than three millions of our countrymen
in chains upitied unwept and uucared for
and whereas peaceful emancipation can be
secured in this country only by changing the
moral sentiment of the people on the subject
of slavery and whereas this change can
alone be effected by the patient and persever
ing enforcement of the great principles ol
justice religion and morality upon the un
lerstanding and the hearts of the people
therefore
resolved that the members of this so
oiety do pledge themselves to renewed exer
ons in piomoting the apead of antislavery
principles in western new yorkthe as
sumed and natural field of labors and that
they so highly approvs of the proposition ol
the executive committee to employ one or
more agents to lecture in this region
resolved that as an earnest of onr sin
cerity and determination to encourage the
hearts and to strengthen the hands of the
executive committee of this society we
proceed at once to raise three hundred dol
lars and to place that sum kt their disposal
the meeting was then addressed by ste
phen s foster he expressed his deep
regret at the small degree of interest mani
fested in this community on the subject of
slavery he had not attended a meeting in
two years where eo few were present as on
this occasion among the many reaaons al
leged for the apparent coldneas and deadness
of the community on the subject of slavery
wore some which bore hard upon the aboli
tionists of this region he declared that they
bad not exerted themselves at they ought to
have done that the fault was in them and
experience showed that where there were no
agents in the field there would be little inter
est iu the cause where no teed is sown
said he no harvest can be expected it
ia impossible to keep up antislavery feeling
in the community without agents the tre
mendous influence of the olergy iu this local
ity ia constantly operating against the anti
slavery movement and unless there are
agents in the field it is utterly impossible to
keep up antislavery feeling mr foster
referred to the decline of antislavqry liberal
ity in supporting agents and in sustaining
the antialavery press and commended the
example of the american antislavery so
ciety fourteen yeara ago in sending out sev
enty agents it waa impossible to have pioa
perity where there waa no investment men
must give to the antislavery cause to become
interested in that cause it takes much
he said  to make a genuine abolitionist
he made reference to negative abolitiomsm
and pcinted out the difference between talking
and acting we need to commence with
eelfexaminaiion among ourselves as in the
church they commenqp revivals with confes
sions so we need to oonfess we need a
naw baptisma new consaoration every
abolitionist ought to feel as if his own dear
fnends were in slavery the plea that we
are few in number is no excuse there sre
enough present if but in earnest to shake
ha laaji think of that one voice which
sued forth from an obscure garret in the
ity of boston twenty years ago thai
oiee reechoed through every valley of the
south and filled the nation with alarm and
tauaed a price of five thousand dollars to be
offered for the head of w l garrison li
is not so much what is taid as the manner in
which we say it the people do not care fm
nere profession it is pottles our ac
tions not our words are the true test we
ire not aware what we can accomplish if we
determine the mere not voting not joining
a proslavery church does not entitle a man
o the name of an abolitionist the tnau who
sees his neighbors heuee on fire and refrains
from assisting to put it out on the plea that he
did not aet it on fire nor make it burn ia juai
aa culpable as the incendiary for one i am
determined to be heard and if the people
will not come to me i will go to them i
start with tho idea that thie community shall
be converted to antialavery said mr fos
ter some men will preach if men will
hear but i am a preacher who will preach
whether men will hear or whether they
will forbear mr fosters remarks were
listened to with deep interest by the audience
frederick douglass expressed his gratifica
tion at the remarks of mr foster he aaid
that the smallness of the number who had as
sembled was to be accounted iu by the almost
impassable slate of the roads leading to the
city and another reason tps the want of or
ganisation among abolitionist the feet ia
that the western n y aqjislavery soeiety
aa an organisation is littlo better than a name
and very few feel any degree of responsibility
in regard to its existence or usefnlooae mir
douglass base called for the reading of the
annual report as the best index to the real
state of the society the reading of the
report waa postponed until the afternoon
the mornings eoeetoo was timber ooeu
pied by remarks from hiram wilson tod
stephen s footer
mrs foster suggested that t plan far action
wsi desirable to be diacuscnd tl titit imtttag
rather than fundamental principles never
had theie been each a time for action as now
the fusion of politicul partiesthere being
no whigs no democrats no fiee soilers
all remaining uncommittedmake it com
paratively easy to mould the public mind
she declared that the abolitionists ibough
small in number were the roost important
body in ibe nation and alluded to the remarks
of messrs calhoun clay and webster in
which they say that the abolitionists must be
put down this little handful of fowstiss
had endangered the union thrown the politi
cal parties and churches into coofuaon and
that by laboring faithfully before the next
presidential campaign we shall hare the sat
isfaction to see in ibe field bat two organisa
tionone under the black flag of slavery
and one under the greyish white of liberty
our duty is to gain all we can for the highest
position no uoioif with slaveholder
she exhorted us to work while it is called
day the liberty party aha said had
vanishedas she expected it would do as all
small political organizations were in due time
swallowed up by the larger ones the pres
ent liberty paily ueder gerrit smith is not
strictly speaking an antislavery party but
has nineteen reforms to effect of which anti
slavery is one tha party has no agents
and only occasional meetings a large held
therefore is now open for the western n
y anti slavery society we may secure
aid from the members of all parties
mrs abigail bush arose tcmake snexcuse
for the ministers of rochester she said
that the ministers were engaged in other good
thingsbible missionary aid tract enter
prises and other benevolent sbjecta it was
true that the churches geneally were closed
against antislavery meetingi but that we are
no longer deprived of the ueana of reaching
the public ear corinthian ball a very com
modious one has been reportedly crowded on
sunday evenings to hew addresses from
frederick douglass
s s foster inquired wist were the anti
slavery resources of this eity l whether means
could be found to fur nidi agents for going
through this section of esuntry l he refered
to the bill now before the legislature pre
sented by mr coffin
the annual reptrt was then read by
mrs burtis and war accepted
tuibdai evening
resolutions were gain read by frederick
douglass
mr foster then iddiessed the meeting
he said the atmoeihere of rochester was
heavy exceedingly heavy difficult of res
piration s torpor seemed to have hung over
this meeting  lave had said he
since i came hereno ease no fluency no
flowing of spirit be did not know what
plan it would be netessary to devise he
however believed th there must be a storm
thunder and lightnag alone can purify this
atmosphere moßalthunder is required to
purify the public mild he was persuaded
that no oidinary applances could answer the
purpose it was pueible that even a moral
earthquake would be necessary to awaken the
people from their apathy had thare been a
crime committed in rochester the crime of
murder your city would have boiled with
excitement now all is calm and quiet
but ia there no crime l no cause of alarm
he would sooner take his place with piol
webster in judgment than with the ministers
of this ciiy he said the abolitionists were
on terms with murderers and to be ou such
terms offaiimacy was to be accessory to
mutder iis had always had the satisfaction
to be calkd an odd man a fanatic because he
had alwajs regarded the term of fellowship
with protlavery people impossible for a chris
tian hr had been called an infidel what
isaninsftel one who disobeys godno
faithful faithless the american church is
an infidd bedy mr foster here portrayed
the aboainations of the fugitive slave law
and thegwful condition of the women in sla
very lie regarded the people of rochester
to be ai guilty aa those of south caiolins
and getrgia and he would arraign them on
the charge of infidelity and immorality as
much deserving a plsce in the states prison
at auburn as the vilest prisoner ever sent
there he was a peace man and he believed
in the icriptute that exhorteth aa far aa in
you lieih if it be possible live peaceably
with all men but his doctrine was first
pure tken peaceable we have no right
said be to be at peace with the ungodly
to be at peace with wicked men is to be re
deem to christianity
wefhave not entered into the wrongs of
the slare as we ought to enter into them
revenge finds little lodgment in the bosons of
the colored people or they had long since
been free mr foster continued in a strain
of the most pointed denunciation of the hy
pocrisy wickedness and guilt of the american
church in respect to slavery and only desired
that men should place themselves in the con
dition of the slave to see the conduct of the
church in the seme light with himself
m d codding ststed some fsets relative
to the rev mr mcllvaines sermon on the
death of general taylor in which the rev
gentleman regards among other things the
death of general taylor as s judgment on the
nation for their unfaithfulness io their consti
tutional obligations thst rochester bad been
guilty in this particular in that she had not
return ed to bondage the three hundred fugi
tives who were here
meeting adjourned until halfput six
on reassembling the resolutions before
the meeting were again read by f douglau
s s foster submitted a resolution in de
nunciation of religious ud political editors
who were in favor of the fugitive slave bill
classing than with pickpockets pirates and
assassins mr foster made a long and
powerful speeoh in support of his resolution
he was followed by mr ptekard on the
same side rev mr may dissented from
the views of the previous speakers he saw
to advantage in calling a slaveholder a pick
pocket and the like names his philosophy
difiered entirely from that of mr foster and
mr piokard hie wont thing that a slave
holder could be called was a slaveholder mr
may illustrated his method of dealing with
such offenders by several very striking anec
dotes of his own experience in which he had
avoided the u of every hanh epithat and
yet had produced the desired impression on
the mird he relied more upon a faithful
dseoriptionfef the crime of the offender than
upon the epithet by which that crime wu char
denied mr may glaooed at the greet it
sponsibility of editors and dwelt with muck
powt upon ibe course pursued by tfee syra
cuse star in respect to the late convention
he said that that paper bad recommended tbs
prosecution and punishment of the officers o
that convention
frederick douglass was glad that this dis
cussion had taken this turn the manner o
advocating the cause of the sieve waa of gresi
importance the very best instrumentalitiei
ought to be need in aoch a cause there
was however no absolute and unvarying
rule by which tor determine the matter the
silvery mildness of mr may and tbs scath
ng denunciation of mr foster were alike
esseutial to the success of this cause wher
men will consent to have their conduct ex
amined and are disposed to reason epitheti
are unnecessary but when they are proud ol
their utter indifference to the enslavement ol
mankind and do actually glory in their own
shame then we need fire as well as light
epithets are necessary then in such cases
the very impression which they produce is in
dispensable to the salvation i therefot
ses woik for both my friends said he
the rough battleaxe of brother foster maj
bo used with effect in the same field with thi
smooths silver blade of brother may
mr foster again explained his views and
quoted largely from the d of mathew ic
support of his method of dealing with pro
slavery sinners he said that the men ol
rochester were walking corpses and thal
nothing short of thunder and lightning would
rouse them
friday morning
the meeting commenced by the rev s j
may proposing and leading a series of reso
lutions which were adopted
a resolution on the necessity of immsdi
ste action was read by f douglass who
added a few remarks on the subject he wai
followed by the rev s j may who exhorted
the meeting to remember the immense in
portance of the present crisis 
mr milo d codding next addressed the
audience beseeching them to use the present
time aright now ifeverbe said anti
slavery effort will pay political parties were
broken up it is an indisputable fact that the
slaveholders now beatow more loud and cloth
ing on their slaves than they used to do a few
years ago this was owing to the abolition
ists and should be one ground of encourage
ment to them to go on
mr codding was followed by frederick
douglass who spoke in support of the rao
lution and said this resolution involves ui
question to be or not to bef shall the
western new york amislavery society
really live once again or shall it con
tinue to have a name to live and be dead
you have usually appointed an executivt
committee the very name implies action
and doing the names ol the committee
have appeared in the paper and have been
heard of far and wide the friends in
england scotland and ireland have read
of the executive committee of the west
em new york antisiavery society
what have this committee effected 
they have no agent in the field they can
have no agents you have given them
no money to expend in the cause and
while you voted them into office you tied
their hands and rendered them powerless
and useless shall we renew this solemn
farce the time for action has now come
a resolution commending a good principle
it good as far as it goes a resolution
against the fugitive slave law is a good
thing as far as it goes bui some prac
tical effect is desirable and if our efforts
are chsrtcterixed by earnestness and sin
cerity we shall witness these practical
effects
mr douglass then made reference to the
anticorn law movement in england and its
eventual triumph after a seven years cam
paign he concluded with an earnest ex
hortation to the western n y antislavery
society to do their duty
mr foster then addressed the meeting on
the importance of immediately deciding upon
some plan of operations he suggested that
the first thing for a successful antislavery
oompaign was an earnest executive com
mittee he stated that four agents were
needed in wpatern new york and that men
could now be found for the work if funds
could be raised to sustain them in the field
he referred to the seal of the churches and
recommended the abolitionists to copy their
enterprise
after a few remarks from mrs bush
mrs foster made an earnest appeal to the
friends of the slave to act in some decisive
and businesslike mannernot to be discour
aged by the smallness of their numbers bat
to remember that it is usually the few who
take the responsibility

ures to counteract its baneful effects she

ful speech on the guilt of the america

at a meeting in relatioo to the fugitive
slave bill held at the union meeting house
collins centre erie co n y the th of
th mo  william henry ofgowanda
was called to the chair and joseph griffin
was appointed secretary
the meeting was feelingly addressed by
joseph parkins in a discourse of considerable
length showing the nature of the bill passed
as a law by congress but whioh hs did not
acknowledge as a law as it contravenes some
of our most important moral obligations
after s free discussion of the following pre
amble and resolutions thsy were unanimously
adopted
if in all criminal prosecutions the accused
shall enjoy the right to a speedy and pub
lic trial by an impartial jury see amend
ment to the constitution art  if in suita
at common law when the value in controversy
shall exceed twenty dollars the right of trial
by jury shall be preserved art  if the
writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended
unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion
the public safety shall require it con art
 sec  and if we consider the national
constitution the basis upon which all legisla
tive enactments that are repugnant thereto
are null and void and especially such as con
travene these provisions of the constitution
designed as guaranties of personal liberty
resolved that as the fugitive soe bill
denies the right of trial by jury in cases in
volving personal liberty when the person is nol
even claimed as s criminal and when the
value in controversy incalculably exceedt
twenty dollars and that it refuses the writ ol
habeas corpus that a commissioner appointed
for the purpose having supreme jurisdiction
in the cases is required to deliver up to the
lander mercies of slavery any person on the
affidavit of any other person in a distant slave
atate who may claim him aa a slave thereby
giving little or no opportunity for such a claim
being contested or evidenee being furnished
of his being legally entitled to freedom it i
a gross violation of the constitution of our
country in the spirit snd letter of it therefore
not legally binding upon us
resolved that aa instances have not been
wanting in times past of individuals of ob
scure parentage or of a dark akin but ol
partly european oiigin being claimed by
souther kidnappers and earned off or
attempted to be carried oft aa slaves this bill
by preventing evidence offers great facilities
for such miscreants to prey upon the liberties
of the whites we if we had nothing further
in view than the protection of our white
breihien object to it as an insult offered to
all classes of freemen in the northern states
resolved that in respect to personal lib
erty we know no distinction as regards color
we regret it as in its principles it contravenes
out highest obligations of duty one to
mother or that higher law than the constitu
tion that impels us to relieve suffering hu
manity without respect to color
resolved that the pay of a commissioner
according to the bill is in effect nothing less
than bribery fire dollars if he fails to make
out the claim sufficient snd ten dollars if hs
succeeds in it
resolved that in view of the unconstitu
tionally of the fugitive atave bill of the mis
chiefa snd miseries it is working to the colored
population in the northern states and can
ada in compelling us to become slave
catchers for the slave claimants of the south
and of its being utterly repugnant to the besi
feelings ol our nature that impel us to acts
of humanity toward those in bonds as bound
with them we will do all in our power mor
ally socially and politically to procore the
immediate snd unconditional repeal of ssic
bill

second time the next day and referred to the
judiciary committee its mover was mr
edwin s coffin of otsego the chief or
gan of the slaveholders in this city the jour
nal calls it an infamous nullification bill
which is good evidence so far as the opinion
of one man may go that it will answer its
purpose of protecting the rights of citizens
and ought to become a law a full expres
sion io its favor by that portion of the prees
opposed to slavehunting in our own
soil would doubtless secure its passage

aatifufiuv slave law meeting
at a large meeting of persoos from various
parts of the state of new yerk held ia the
city of syracuse january ih  aod of
which frederick douglass was president
the following resolutions and address were
unanimously adopted the address ia the
earn and with an inconsiderable exception
the resolutions are the same as those which
were reported by germ smith to the state
convention held in said city january th
aod bth 
anoluttohs
 resolved that we pour oot upon the
fugitive slavs law the fulleot measure
of our contempt snd hate sod execration and
pledge ourselves to resist it actively as well
as passively snd by all such means as shall
in our esteem promise the most effectual re
sistance
 resolved that they who consent to be
the agents of southern oppressors for exe
cuting this law whether as commissioners
or marshals or in any other capaeity are to
be regarded as kidnappers snd landpirates
 resolved that it is our duty to peril
life liberty snd property in behalf of the
fugitive slave to as great an extent u we
would peril them in behalf of ourselves
 resolved that obviously and grossly
unconstitutional as is this law nevertheless
this is not the chief reason why we condemn
snd defy itfor equally whether they are
constitutional or unconstitutional do we con
demn and defy all laws which insult him
who is above all constitutions snd whiah
aiming not to protect but to destroy rights
are therefore to be regarded as no laws
 resolved that horrible as ia this law
we must bear in mind that it is huts perfect
ly natural and not at mil to be wondered at
exsetion of slavery snd that hence oar first
and great work is to get rid not of the law
but of slaveryas it would be our first and
great work to pursue and kill the maddog
instead of pausing until we had effected the
cure of one of his biles
 resolved that between cotrupt politics
on the one hand and corrupt churches on the
otherbetween the politicians and parties who
enacted this law and the priests who are
pisaehing its enfsrceinentthere is no hope
for this nation unless it shall very speedily
be brought to prefer honesty to knavery both
in its religious teachers snd civil rulers
 resolved thai were the corrupt re
ligion of the country to be exchanged for
blank infidelity the abolition of slavery would
be comparatively easy
 resolved that when the immortal
writer of the declaration of independence
said if we do not liberate the enslaved by
the genetous energy of our own minds they
must they will be liberated by the awful
process of st domingo emancipation be
uttered woide which there is but too mueh
lesson to believe are rapidly approaching their
fulfilment
 resolved that inasmuch as aouod
principles snd sound teachers are as indie
pensible in our institutions of learning as in
our pulpits we iejoice to know that under
the progreaa ot the antislavery aentimeat
there are already several colleges in our
country which are open to colored students
snd that there are two of these in which
colored students find themselves emphatically
at home these are oberlin college in
ohio and central college in new yorkin
the latter of which there is a colored pro
fessor
 resolved that inasmuch as every
national party in this nation must beojose
it is a national party spars if not indeed
positively favor slavery it follows that
whoever belongs to the whig or democratic
party or to any ecclesiastical national party
does however unwillingly or unwittingly
give his influence and support to slavery
 resolved that the time has come and
had long ago come for gathering a northern
political party which shall be both determined
and able to carry out the principles of the
federal constitution and the principles of
h imanily and religion in overthrowing the
base and bloody system of american slavery
snd in establishing a righteous civil govern
ment
 resolved that we welcome the pres
ence in this convention of william l chap
lin and render thanks to almighty god for
having preserved him alive whilst under the
blows snd threats of murderous ruffians and
whilst in the dreary prisons to which villain
ous snd piratical governments had committed
him
 resolved that instead of rebuking
and scorning we honor and love this dear
brother for having dons thst for which jesus
christ will siy unto him before an assmbled
world inasmuch as ye hsvo done it unto
one of the least of these ye have done it
unto me
 resolved thst if william l chaplin
has done violence to the principles of repub
licanism and ehiistianity in suffering a couple
of his fellowmen to seek to promote their es
cape from slavery by getting into his carriage
then are republicanism snd christianity the
deadliest enemies of humanity and the crud
est lies thst have ever been propagated
 whereas notwithstanding the eoa
siderable amount of donations toward effecting
the liberation of our brother chaplin he waa
obliged by reason of the exorbitant bail
required of him to borrow large sums of
money from various individuals resolved
therefore thst we deeply sympathise with
him under his pecuniary embarrassments
snd warmly desire thst the benevolent may
toon relieve him of them
 resolved that the liberation of chap
lin is an occasion for remembering afresh tod
pitying raah drayton and sayre and lot
calling afresh on this hypoontica snd oraal
nation te set these outraged and afflicted
brethren at liberty
 whereas inasmuch as the imprison
ment of drayton and sayre for aiding their
fellowmen to escape from the horrors of
slavery is an imprisonment for what not only
humanity and religion pronounce a virtue
but for what the law of the declaration of in
dependence since it declares thst all men
are created equal pronounces s virtue and
for what the law of the federal constitution
since it declares its object to be to establish
justice snd secure the blessings of liberty
does also pronounce a virtue resolved
therefore that it would be not a lawless set
but a lawful as well aa humane aod religious
act to demolish the prison of these philan
thropists and let them go free
adshm i
to the people of tho state of nets york
a reeent law of congress called on you te
assist in reducing your fellowmen to alar
very were these followmen criminals
slavery would be a punishment bevead ud
infidelity beyond their deserts to subject
a man to the most capricious cruel and irre
sponsible despotisma despotism  which
absolutely annihilates all h rights sad
him from manhood to chattelhoodia mere
than is doe to even tho greatest crimes bui
these followmen ate not criminals they
are yoor peaceable guiltlee harmless
neighbors and they are not iosrasble la
the wrongs inflicted upon them they hem
interests and sensibilities like year owe
they love wife sad children even as you de
as susceptible as yourselves are they ot
joy aod sorrow as asset to them as lu
you is liberty and when bereaved of this
prioelete blasting theit desolation sad wiowfc
edness are u perfect u would be rout ewn
under be like bereavement
why tbeo if these tbtegs are eo should
yon do the great wrong of reducing iheee
innocent people to ala very the anawer to
thie inquiry ie that law commands it we
admit oar reverence and love for law and
our obligation to obey it we say with
the apostle that the law is holy and the
commandment holy and just and good
bat then all is not law which ia called law
that which laeka troth and justice and
all the elements of law it at the moat but
nominal law genuine and real law ia for
tho protection of rights it ia sham law
and no law which is for the destruction of
rights but slavery desolates the whole field
of human rights it leaves not one right to
its victims hence ever law in favor of
slavery ia moat emphatically sham lawia
most emphatically no law
bee it ia said that the law in question
must be obeyed because it ia a constitutional
law and because the constitution called for
the law we aee nothing however to justi
fy the enactment of this law in that provision
of ths constitution which the law was en
acted to enforce if that provision calls for
any legislation it is most certainly state
and not national legislation but were it
so that it calls for national legislation it
weuld of oourse be such as does not vio
leoce and attempts no violence to the pro
vision of the constitution respecting the
writ of habeas corpus or to that respecting
the tight of trial by jury or to any other of
its provisions againthis law was enacted
for the sole purpose of repluoging into ala
slavery those who had fled from its horrors
but by no fair construction of language can
thja provision be said to refer to fugitives
from riavery it is sad however that nol
withtending the constitution is upon its sur
face ad n obvious meaning a paper
against l t ery there is nevertheless in this
and in a ome other of its provisions a hidden
meaning m slavery to this we reply that
it is quite license enough to pass from an ob
viousness to an occult meaning of words
from the certain legal meaning of words to
some one of the ten thousand of their uncer
tain historical and tradititional meanings
even when this is done for the furtherance of
the cause of justice but that to do this for
ths purpose of gaining success for injustice
and villainy and injuatice and villainy of un
skilled enormay is to go vety far beyond
the limits of endurance
what however tfthu law were in harmo
ny with the constitution that would be no
authority for the law if the law is contrary
to truth constitutions and laws so far as
they are repugnant to truth are void if the
great apostle had to confess that he could
do nothing against the truth but for the
truth the like confession must be made for
constitutions and laws they are powerless
against the everlasting bulwatks of reason
and religion
because it ie the sacred work of our fa
thers is another of the ressoss assigned why
we must obey the constitution and every part
of it our brief only and sufficient answer
to this is that whatever respect we owe to
our dead fathera we owe more to the living
god
we are told too that if we respect the
constitution or any part of it we cannot con
sistently and cannot of right vote under it
and that hence we must cling to it and to
every part of it in order to save to ourselves
the precious and important right of
suffragethe precious and important right of
participating in the choice of our civil rulers
in answer to this we declare that it is a very
gross and a very pernicious fallacy that our
right to vote is crested by and held under
the constitution our right to select our
civil rulers comes from god inheres in our
sooial being and overides all constitutions
and enactments it is true that men are at
liberty to provide their conventional regula
tions for the exercise of this rightbut they
cannot create the right or take it sway or
at all encroach upon it hence the provision
f the federal constitution which makes the
taking of a certain oath the condition of the
choaen rulers entering upon the duties of his
offioe should be repealed because it is in de
rogation of the natural and absolute right of
the people to choose their rulers hence
too they are wrong who because of this
required oath relinquish or hold in abeyance
this natural and absolute right they should
persevere in the exercise of it as did the con
stituente of daniel oconnell snd if any
whom they wish to make rulers shall have
conscience against taking the oath of office
they should nevertheless elect them their
peiseveranee would he se eucceesful as was
the perseverance of oconnells constituents
the oath would be waived when refused
or better still it would be withdrawn from
the constitution
but in answer to all our reasons for not
obeying this law for making slaves of our
neighbors we are told that we must obey it
for the reason that civil government must
be obeyed it is true that civil government
must be obeyed but the command to obey
k comes to us with the limitation which ac
companies the command to obey oar parents
if we must obey our parents only in the
lordthat it only to the extent that their
commands harmonize with the divine com
mandsso we roust obey civil government
with the like qualification c vil government
is to the same extent that every person is
subjected to the supreme immutable laws of
god and wherever it violates those laws
it is entitled to no authority or obedience
the dootiine that wrong may be done if
commanded by civil government is utterly
fallacious it is a doctrine which found no
favor with him who had rather be cast into
the lions den thsn comply with a wicked re
quirement of the government the apostles
too refused to obey such a requirement snd
they based their refusal expieaaly on the
ground of the paramount authority of god
we ate admonished to obey this law as
we would escape the crime and the peril of
rebellion but when the civil government
tramples on the divine authority it is the
civil government which is the rebeland
not the citizen who refuses to follow it ths
government which has enacted this diaboli
cal law has involved itself in the deepest and
ei it tiesi rebel i ionrebellion against jehovah
imaelf but the citizen who refuse to
beer a part in enforcing it keeps himself
clear of the sin of rebellion
wc are summoned in the the name of
oatriotism to obey this law but this law
being treason to god snd roan we cannot
eerve our country by oheying it right
eeusoesa exalteth a nationand whenaoever
we shall be invoked by a true patriotism it
will be to a course of righteousness it will
invoke us to honor snd not to insult god
to stand by and not to oppraes his poor
wa are told that we are not at liberty to
deeide for ourselves what is constitutional
snd lawful snd the further falsehood is add
ed that the constitution appoints the judges
under it its sole expounders we are also
told to listen submissively to wbst eminent
clergymen pronounce to be the eithics in the
ease but whilst wescout the papal doctrine
which would urjnd out conscience by other
mens interpretation of religion we hold in
no higher asteem the equally lying doctrine
which denies our right to judge for ourselves
what is constitutional and lawful
we eee then that no pleaor respect for
law or civil government or for the civil
government or for the constitution or for
any of its expounders or for any of the ex
pounders of christianity and that no threats
or the stigma or punishment of rebellion and
no appeals in th name of patriotism should
he allowed to have the effect to bring na to
the side of ibis infernal and horrible law
come these pleaa and tbieats and appeals
from the meetiogs which commercial and
political men are fatting up all over the north
under the name of union meetiogs m
come they from the mercenaries snd knaves
who have got possession of so large a shart
of ths american pulpits we are to be deal
o them all
the way is new prepend fat us to aay
that we will resist this lawwill mist it
at all bssarde of property or liberty or life
tad by all each means as ahall promise to
him who uses them the most effectual re
sistance we cannot be christians we cannot
be men and do otherwise he is no christian
and he has sunk his manhood out of sight
who can join in the attempt to redaoe bis
innocent neighbor and brother to slavery or
who can witness such attempt without striv
ing to defeat it this is not extravagant
language in european ears and if it m such
in american ears it is only because slavery
has subsidised the american press and pulpit
and benighted infatuated and debauched the
american people it ia manifest that wher
ever slavery reigns there must be a very
imperfect perception of the claima of humanity
and religion
feuowcitnens we atop not with exhort
ing you to trample tbia law under foot thie
law ia one and but one of the demands of
amoriean slavery upon youand at long as
amorioan alaveiy lives it will ever and anon
be putting forth demands eponlyoudemands
all of which will be deeply revolttng to an
enlightened conscience sod a sound humanity
your war with this law ia therefore not to
be limited to thia law but it ia to be ex
tended to slavery itaelt for until alaveiy ia
overthtown you will be continually exposed
to its tyrannous and galling claims for your
own sake then you have need to strike at
slavery but if so how much more should
you atrike at it for the slaves sake if you
who are amid but the outer and feebler
reaches of the power of slavery are never
theless so impatient under that power what
must not be the agony of those who are in
the very eentee o its iron grasp  if you
who are in but the penumbra of mavery com
plain so much of iu chilling shadows how
horrid must be their condition who are in
the blackness of its dstkness oh to be a
slave to wake every morning with the
consciousness of being a slave to carry
tbe weary load of this consciousness all the
daylong surely earth has no other lot so
hard as that of the slave
does slavery then concern you for your
selves immeasurably more should it con
cern you for the millions of your enslaved
countrymen is it your duty to deliver your
selves from its toils infinitely higher is
your duty is to free theslsve what hinders
you from giving this help say you that
the constitution does we admit that in
most of the interpretations of the instrument
there is an abundance of proslavery but
we affirm that in the instrument itself there
a none we admit that proslavery is to be
found in some ot the clashing and uncertain
histories of tbe instrument but we affirm
that for the purpose of snterpreiing it we
have nothing to do with these histories and
hat we are to determine its character and
claims from its pages and not from its his
ories we admit that there ia some his
iorical evidence that certain persons had the
purpose to get slavery imo the constitution
but the question isdid they get it in the
rurpose is nothing if it was noi successful
what however if the constitution in
itead of requiring as it clearly does the im
mediate extinction of slavery requires it to
he upheldvain altogether vain is such
requirement aginst the obligations which
low from the natural and unchangeable re
ations of ifen to each other theso relations
wing befoie and above any relations created
y the constitution must be sustained and
lonored even though all artificial and con
tentions relations do thereby perish
is it said that we are not to interfere with
he institutions of our sister statesand
ihat slavery in virgini or georgia is beyond
cur legitimate reach we answer that
vherevei in our own nation or in any other
vation the rights of men are cloven down
here is a work for us to do in behalf of our
common humanity neither by stale nor
national lines are our sympathies to be bound
sdand wherever our sympathies are
sailed for thither should we go in person if
ihst be needful to make our sympathies most
sffeciive it is a fiction of men instead of
lhe truth cf god that we have not tbe right
to help such of the oppressed as dwell beyond
the limits of our state or nation the
ara right have we to fly to the succor of
the oppressed italian or hungarian as to re
dress the wrongs of our countrymen and
neighbors it is tyrants who are not willing
to be disturbed in their oppression of their
subjectsit is these who have instilled into
the well nigh universal mind the lesson that
a man has no right to carry his philanthropic
efforts beyond his own country but that
lesson is scorned wherever tbe doctrine of the
human brotherhoodsinieiiligently and lovingly
apprehended raw as many lines upon the
surface of toe earth and make as many
nations as you will this can in no wise
affect the rights which pertain to member
ship in the human family these were as
folly the righia of the samaritan when in
judeaaa when in samaria and hence
his liberty to minister to human want as well
tn the one nation as in the other these
rights are unimpaired in the beloved joseph
sturge and elihu burritt and hence their
liberty to go among the contending powers of
europe for the purpose of making peace
they are unimpaired in the the eloquent
and excellent george thompson also and
hence he may come to ihe shoies ot ameri
ca to plead the cause of the dowwntrodden
it is true that siurge and burritt ere not
danes and that thompson is not an ameri
can but sturge and burrit are brothers of
danes and thompson is the brother of ame
ricans and surely one brother has the right j
to help another meet they where they may
in the wide world
deny our right to deliver the millions of
our countrymen who sre crushed in the iron i
folds of slavery why if wherever a nomi i
nal christianity per vails and tbe prevailing j
christianity of no nation is more than nominal j
there were a real christianity then would it
be acknowledged over all christendom that
to break up the nest of pirates in our south
ern states and to break up every other neat
of pirates is tbe first work of christianity
and a work to which no state nor national
boundaries should be suffered to present any
impediments
we presume not fellowcititens to pre
scribe what you shall do for the overthrow of
american slavery it ia for your to determine
aa you sre able to do wisely by what means
you shall undertake to compass this object
but we cannot cloqe this ajdress without
reminding you that in vain will be all your
efforts to this end whilst you sre identified
with american religion or american politics
these are the great props of american sla
very america boasts of her republicanism
and also of her religion but there ia not in
the wide world another such compound of
hypocrisy meanness and cruelty as is to be
seen in her republicanism sud also in her
religion we mean by american religion
that religion which our national ecclesiastical
parties have t gotien up for tbe purpose of ac
commodating themenlhi vevesof tbe south and
their guiltier partners in the norththat re
ligion which only the other day shut out
men from an episcopal convention for no
other reason than the color of their skins
that religion whose cunning calculating
ministers from one end of your state to the
otherfrom the spencers of brooklyn to the
lords of buffaloare preaching obedience
to the law which calls on you to sink your
fejkiwmen into the hell of slavery we
ri by american polities that mixture
winch our national political parties have
skillfull adapted to the palates of the dealets
ia human flesh at the south and to the
palates of the dealers in southern cotton at
ihe north and to the palates of office seek
ers both north sod sooth we mean by
ametican politics the whig and democratic
politics which enacted that law under the
tenon ot which the poor of the earth hide
themselves together or fly affrighted to
the wilds end snows of canada and under
the powet of which patents children hus
bands wives are dragged dowa into the
match lees honors of slavery wa mean by
i american pgliuca the politics which crowd
the numberless union meetings of thi
north with whig end democrat traitor u
freedom end to god we mean by amen
can polities the politics which have so re
cently and so suddenly led the wwg and
democratic patties both in and out or con
gress to adopt the hush policy in regard t
slavery many of their newspapers have
ere now ottered brave words against slavery
bat even these have nearly all foend them
selves obliged to come into this hushpolicy
we scarcely need add that the base hag
gard murderous creatures which we have
declared american politics and american ra
hgion to be most necessarily so long as
slavery is the ruling interest of the nation
be the politics sad the religionthe one of
our national political parties and the other
of our national eooleaiaatical parties for it
is manifest that the south so long as she is
under the eway of slavery will oome into no
partywill abide in no party whether in
church or statethat does not eoofontf to
ihe demands of slavery whatever then
yon shall or shall not undertake to do for
the overthrow of american slavery it is ob
vious as we have virtually said before that
you can do nothing effectual to this end only
in so fsr as you are extricated from the
meshes of national parties both political and
eoelesiastical to be in any such parties is
to be whether you know it oi not and whe
ther you will or not on the side of slavery
we take pleasnieio admitting that there
are many persons in the whig and demo
cratic parties who cherish a sincere desire
for the abolition of slavery and who make
more or less effort to this end but it is
manifest that the antislavery influence cl
such desire and effort is as nothing compared
with the pro slavery influence which they
exert in sustaining a mighty proslavery party
surely if an individual would maintain his
power at any point he must not join and sus
tain a party which is exerting a counter
power at that point
so  do we take pleasure in admitting
that there are many persona in the whig and
democratic patties who cherish a sincere
desire for the repeal or nullification of the
fugitive slave law and who make more
or less effort to this end but preeminently
absurd is the idea that they are in effect as
well as in desire and effort against this law
for not only is it true that these parties are
desperately proslavery and from the fact
of their being national parties necessarily
proslavery but it is also true that this law
lias become the great bond of union in the
ase of each of these parties and that each ot
them is to be kept from dissolution only se
ong as this law is unrepealed and enforced
f he then who adheres to a party which it
ield together by the continuance and cement
if this satanic law may be honest id believ
ng that the weight of his influence can be
tgainst the law he nevertheless foolish
n entertaining such belief the whig and
democratic parties mad he law the whig
ind democratic parties uphold the law the
whig and democratic parties must on pen
ilty of being broken up continue to uphold
he law nothing then more plain than
hat the first work of him who is in one of
hese parties and who would contribute to
put an end to this law is to break out of his
isrty and to cease to vote for slaveholders
md for the makers snd defenders and keep
ers of slavecatching and slaveholding laws
do what else he will he is until he does
his for the law until be does this he is
o be held responsible for the murderous law
nstead of being fellowsbipped by its contin
ent and effective enemies his first woik is
iis own repentance instead of bringing others
o repentanceand for us to admit that he
an espouse oui cause and stand by our side
without having done this first work is for us
o cheapen and disgrace and condemn our
relves our poaition and our cause
this nation is perishing because of its
national parties and whoever would con
lribute to save it must stand aloof from them
the most reasonable hope that the free
soil party which waa organized in the state
two or three years ago would prove useful
was grounded in the tact that it waa not a
national party and it might possibly have
proved useful in some respects had it con
tinued to be a northern party but the
loaves and fishes are to be found in national
parties and as it was these more than the
success of the anti slavery cause that the
majority of its leaders were after it is no 
mystery that this party has with honorable
exceptions among its members identified it
self with a national party free soil parliea
were organized about that time in several
other states but little or no good will come
from them notwithstanding that many noble
men are in them these partis refuse to be
concerned for the three millions of slaves in
the states snd in respect to fugitive slaves
the highest ground which even their mr
giddings takes in his late free soil speech
is that whilst they will not hinder the fiend
work of replunging them into slavery they
will not help it it is nevertheless by means
of such parties that these good men expect
to accomplish good alas when will even
good men give up their atheistic contrivances
for doing good why should they hope for
success in a policy which is counter to the
divine policy gods ia the positive and
glorious policy of doing good theirs ia the
negative and miserable policy of doing no
harm he denounces not him only who
makes tbe poor cry but him also who
stoppeth his ears atthe cry of the poor
he denounces not him only who draws his
fellowmen unto death but him also who
forbears to deliver them that are drawn ua
to death the free soil parties flattei
themselves that god denounces but the slave
holder no less however does he denounce
them who suffer the slave to be held tbe
fiee soil parlies flatter themselves that god
denounces but the slavecatcher but no
less certain snd festful sre his denunciations
against them who auffet the slave to be
caught
the excuse of these free soil parties for
keeping themselves within this circle of ne
gations is that the federalconsti ration keeps
i hem there unhappy reading of the con
stitution is theirs but what if tbe consti
tution ia as they read it what in that
case have they to do but to break away from
it as they should from every covenant
with death and agreement with hell none
of ua are absolutely bound to be constitution
lists but all of us ate absolutely bound to
be men if we cannot be constitutionalists
and yet be men then we cannot be constitu
tionalists if we cannot follow the constitu
tion without forsaking our manhood then we
cannot follow the constitution if to claim
that god has made us keepers of all our bro
thersof our brother who ia pining in sla
very and of our brother who ia escaping
from itis to disobey the constitution then
we must disobey it
happy thrice happy would it be were
the good men of the land to oonstittute a po
litical party which should be inien on reali
zing tbe idea of a righteous civil government
a government which would sympathize
with the slave and the landless and protect
its subjects from the curse of war and the
cours ot the traffio in intoxicating drinks
how soon such s party would rid the country
o slavery and land monopoly and rumsel
ling and save the earnings of its laborers
from being wasted oq war and the prepara
tions for war but ae it ia that the good
men of the land do with few exoeptiona be
long to the national polities parliesand
what infatuation would it be to us to hope for
tha advancement of our country in the eauee
of truth and virtue and religion whilst tbe
great mats of her good men are found in such
wicked and pernioioos connexions make up
your minds felloweitizena that your country
must perish unless the good men in it hasten
to quit the national and because national
proslavery parties we beg you not to
tnisundmstand ua at this point we do not
bold that civil government however perfect
in its theory or in its administration ia the

the cneiaiatt fugitive slave case
we referred yesterday to the arrest of a
colored man by oar city watchman we
have since seen the individual who was ap
prebended aa a fugitive and locked in one
of the cells of the watchhouse the histo
ry of this affair is somewhat singular and
may be interesting to our readers we
yesterday saw the apprehended fugitive
and found it to be the barber hamilton jack
son of waloutet he lives at the corner
of new and broadway on sunday night
last a man who gave hie name aa charles
hooker found jackson near hit own house
and inquired of him after some circumlocuto
ry proceedings where the watchmen were
jackson showed hooker the ninth ward
when hooker ordered them to arrest
jackson sa a runaway slave from hit father
jackson waa accordingly taken into custo
dy and marched to the mayors office all the
time supposing it waa all a joke and that the
parlies knew him at the mayors office the
chief of police and the officers were acting
in good faith and even sent to mayor spen
cers bouse for his honor jackson was put 
into a cell and locked in he had been there
some time when he began to think the joke
had lasted long enough and asked to be let
out but was then informed that the proceed
ings were in earneet and that he was really
imprisoned at the instigation of hooker and
by affidavit by him held asa fugitive this
was rather a serious matter for jackson still
he knew that be could establish his freedom
ss hundreds had known him here for ten
years or more and there wete persons here
also who knew him when a child jn chilli
cothe
the fourth ward watchman came in dur
ing the night and seeing jackson confined
there and knowing bict well had him re
leased the officers are now after hooker
but he ia not to be found we presume
there are few men of color better known here
than hamilton jackson from what we
have heard we think that this hooker is a
northern man endeavoring to extort money
and as big a viliain as runs unhung and is
endeavoring to hook niggers in by false
swearing and effrontery but he may be
caught by a hook of the law without swal

the memphis eagle says that  fugitives

a colloquy between two
friends
as a christian what do you think
is our duty respecting this monstrous
evil slavery
why to persuade all free colored
people to emigrate to liberiaculti
vate its soilproduce cotton sugar
and coffee for the market of the world
by this method american slavery would
die out
you surely dont believe this
yes that is my settled conviction
you astonish me suppose for ar
gument sake it were possible to raise
sufficient cotton sugar and coffee in
liberia how would how could free
labor compete with slave labor it is
well known in new orleans that many
slaves are hired out at two dollars
a day their inhuman owners give
the slave one dime and pocket the dif
ference the poor unhappy beings
get a five cent loaf and five cents
worth of meat and sleep where they
can on the plantations the same
system of grinding oppression exists
the coarsest of fare and unrequited
toil is his unhappy lot how is it pos
sible for free labor to compete with this
scheme of unrighteous oppression
well i dont think you benefit the
slave by keeping up agitation his
condition is far worse now than years
ago he is held in bondage with a
firmer grasp his labor was never more
valuable than at ihis moment the full
energies of the slaveholder are em
ployed to perpetuate this peculiar in
stitution
my conclusions differ entirely from
yours it is quite true his labor was
never more valuable hence his mas
ters anxiety to keep him in bondage
by this craft he has hie wealth no
matter how vile and unjust the cause
so that wealth comes into his posses
sion it is quite true the slaveholders
are using their utmost endeavors to
perpetuate this system of wrongwhich
is a foul blot on our glorious republic
it is not true that his condition is worse
than in former years the slave
holder has too much sagacity to treat
him as cruelly as formerly such acts
he knows would be chronicled through
the length and breadth of the land
sad and forlorn indeed is the condition
of tbe unhappy slave yet not worse
than in former as to keeping
up agitation that is he only way in
my humble judgment to abolish slavery
in the united states by agitation
men are led to inquire into the truth
many who thought nothing of it before
give attention and come to right con
clusions when this is universally
done such men and only such will
fill our halls of congress and say of
slavery in decisive uumistakble lan
guage so far shalt thou go but no
farther here shall thy proud waves be
stayed besides what good was ever
accomplished without opposition read
the history of the world in the bible
read the acounts of modern times
all tend to show that any good achieved
for man must meet determined opposi
tion truth has nothing to fear though
tbe turace be made seven times hotter
it will corne forth with resplendent
glory error hates the light aed will
not come to the light lest its deeds
should be reproved
well i dont see any good results
from the agitation of slavery for the
last twenty years and as to the few
who escape from bondage and others
emancipated the system still retains a
firm footing for all that
my friend you are mistaken some
years ago there was scarcely a press
throughout the land which advocated
the cause of the slave and the rights
f the colored people now thank
god there are hundreds their number
still increasing when onoe the full
power of the pulpit platform and press
is employed in behalf of the oppressed
children of ham the day of their re
demption is at hand there were dark
days for israel in egypt but the com
tnaud of jehovah had gone forth let
my people go i will not let israel
go from serving me was the reply of
the haughty tyrant will our task
masters in the south take warning or
parish in fighting against god
but what good can you or i do in
this cause i would rejoice with you
in the abolition of slavery throughout
the country and this world
much my brother all our influ 
nee be it little or much should be
thrown into the scale of right all our
margies must ba employed to enlighten
our fellow men am imy brothers
keeper was the inquiry of the first
murderer let us not imitate him
we are verily guilty concerning our
brother let us redress the wrongs
 and grievance he has suffered and
endeavor to elevate enlighten and
christianize him love thy neighbor
as thyself is the command of him who
we call master and lord who is our
neighbor is it only him with a fair
skin or does the command embrace
all mankind let us show our love to
jesus by kindly treating the despised
negro it does not become us to be
dumb and inactive while the curse of
slavery remains in our borders the
tongue pen and press must all be con
secrated to the cause of justice
i begin to see with you that the time
has come for every christian to stand
manfully for the oppressed bondman
things do appear hastening to a crisis
the abominable fugitive slave bill has
aroused many who were indifferent to
look seriously into the matter and to
question the extravagant claims of the
slaveholder
depend upon it god will hold you
and  responsible to the full extent of
our influence let us not be partakers
of other mens sins by the fear of
god the love of christ the love of our
fellowmen the love of truth the ha
tred of injusticeby the sufferings of
those in bondsby the withering
effects of slavery on the slaveholders
posterity and by its wretched influence
on the free white nonslaveholders we
should labor and praypray and labor
that this upas tree may be plucked up
this thriceacoursed institution may be
destroyed jabez
antifugitive slave law mass
convention
first dat afternoon session
convention assembled and was called
to order by the president at two p m
gerrit smith and frederick douglass
made their first appearance in the con
vention
on motion of rev mr may the fol
lowing committee was appointed by
the chair to make out a list of those
present who wished to be considered
as members of the convention so
that it might be known who the mem
bers were and whence they came viz
l p noble of ondondaga a s
wing of oswego chas merrick of
syracuse and mrs mary springstead
of madison
during the taking of names a mr
johnson a colored man entertained
the convention with several appropri
ate songs
wm l chaplin being loudly called
tor took the stand he wanted those
who made abolition professions to act
up to them he thought that aboli
tionists were apt to make professions
not intending to fulfil them it is not
so with the slaveholders he proceeded
to illustrate by a familiar instance in
the course of his remarks he took oc
casion to vindicate the mental capacity
and moral tendency of the slaves and
related a number of anecdotes occurr
ing during his recent imprisonment in
maryland to support his positions
frederick douglass being called
forward said that it them ever was a
time of solemity for those who
well to the slave that time was now
the present is the time to test the
friends of those confined in tbe bonds
of slavery he understood the con
vention as being called to consider the
fugitive slave law and the duty of the
friends of the slave in this crisis the
fugitive law is the only law which has
been passed in many years causing the
executive opeulyto declare that it
should be enforced even were it neces
sary to employ the sword and the bay
onet it is however a law and a law
about to be pressed into execution a
few months ago the people at the norih
did not believe that such a law could be
passed by an american congress it
is true that mr mason had a similar
bill before the senate where it was ex
pected it would pass however we
did not think that it would get through
the house but it did not pass both
senate and house and the north ever
hopeful then fell back upon the relief
that millard fillmore would never sign
it and then the north still hopefulbe
lieved that it would be a dead letter
after the first case had been disposed
of and one fugitive sent back to sla
very the north thoughtthatthat would
of necessity be the last attempt to en
force the law there have been other
eases since yet the people at the north
have indulged in the hope that each
would be tbe last this matter of
slavecatching said mr d has just
begun the slaveholders have thus
far been but encouraged by the enrage
ment and subsequent cooling down of
the revolt of the north against the law
authorizing the recapture of fugitives
they see the ministers of the gospel
who ever before have upheld human
rights now preaching in favor oi sla
very and those presses which have
ever been strongly abolition in expres
sion now banishing it from their col
umns they see the north easily
brought to a tame submission to their
exactions inviting still further aggres
sions the more stringent their de
mands the more satisfactorily they are
answered the question is whether
we are to submit to the utter destruc
tion of oar ideas of the rights of man
and have those of slaveocracy insti
tuted the south are plainiybound to
press this matter to the bitter end
and have the law president army and
navy to aid them in doing it he ask
ed the convention to point out the best
course for the friends of the slave to
pursue mr d said he was a peace
man but he thought the convention
ought to say to the slaveholders that
they would risk bodily danger should
they come to capture fugitives in this
state he thought this a religious du
ty and nothing short of the blood of the
slaveholder should appease the indig
nation of the friends of humanity in this
state in the case of an attempted re
capture he wanted the convention
to point out the proper course to the
friends of freedom throughout our
state he bad great faith in moral
suasion but when the struggle comes
on between the slavecatcher and the
fugitive and he sees no other way to
rescue the latter he would strike him
down with as much composure and
thoughtlessness as he would a blood
hound he held that slaveholders had
no right to exist and if they came this
way after fugitives they would probably
be apprised of that fact the slave
holders are used to such talk they
keep the northern people from ag
fression upon the rights of the
outh by such talk and now let us
try its efficacy we mutt as did the
bostonians make the fugitive law a
dead letter and the only effectual way
of doing this to his mind wss by ma
king two or three dead slaveholders
we are invited to the work of slaying
slavecatchers a few examples made
of them will make all right mr d
recommended the course pursued by
the citizens o boston towards knight
and hughes who pursued william
and ellen crafts to that city as worthy
of imitation in all necessary cases
this fugitive law cannot be repealed
our only course is to make it unsafe
for the slavecatchers or government
officers to come after fugitives he
gave the instances of recapture and at
tempted recapture since the passage of
the law the slavecatchers have
been intimdated from their workand the
only way to preserve the fugitives is to
intimidate them more he held that a
man who would not fight and kill if
necessary for his liberty was not wor
thy of it
there was something in the heart of
the community here at the north
which said when a slavecatcher fell
by the hand of a fugitive served him
right mr d spoke we think over
an hour and delivered in the opinion of
those who have otten heard him one of
the best speeches he ever made he

the fierceness or rather blood and
murder which characterized his ad

the application of the chain the iron
collar the handcuff the knottedlaah
and brandingiron to the quivering
flesh of the unfortunate who have fallen
among thieve and all the rest of the
pharaphernalia of human torture which
the ingenuity of the most inhuman
tyrant can invent depend almost if not
exclusively upon the consumption of
the produce of the labor of the slave

slave produce are the primary support
ers of this most infamous scheme from
first to last

we learn from a gentleman
from the falls that the little steamer
the maid of the mist disappeared
from public observation yesterday
was moored for the wipter at the
wharf at bellevue and was deemed to
be beyond the reach of any casualty
the snow however gathered in such
masses on her decks that she was
weighed down deeply at one side the
water made its way over her decks
and filled her hull so completely that
she sunk in twenty feet water she is
still held by her cables but it is very
doubtful whether she can be raised
the current being very rapid and the
channel shelving off abruptly to a great
depth she was owned by the niagara
falls association and the loss is from
five to seven thousand dollarsno in
surance the little steamer so aptly
named has played a gallant pan in
showing up the fails to thousands of
visitors during her brief but eventful
life she was tbe first steam vessel to
tempt the storm and waye in the very
hell of waters in niagara river
and many of our readers have trod her
quivering deck as her elfin hull rose
and fell in the mad tide
many had doubt of her strength
and safety and deemed it a hazardous
exploit to muke one of her brief voy
ages but we imagine her place will
be soon supplied with a stauncher
craft and one more confided in by tbe
publicjßsunwwf
ky silence may be tbe aulltn mood
of an evil temper or the lefty endur
ance of a martyr
