law in south carolina
a man named john m barrett is
now in jail at spartanburg s c on
suspicion of being an abolitionist and
is quite likely to sutler smartly under
the code lynch if some provision in
the bloody statutebook ot carolina
cannot be stretched to roach his case
vet it is not pretended that he has
been engaged in inciting the slaves to
insurrection or flight nor even that
he has approached them in any manner
whatever but he is accused of hav
ing had an agency in w hat is far more
dangerousin enlightening the n me
nonslaveholders of southcarohnu
with regard to the glaring oppressions
to which they are subjected by reason
of the dominance of slaverythe in
equality of representation between the
strong slaveholding and comparatively
nonslaveholding portions of the state
the rigid monopoly ot office by the
great slaveholdersthe degraded con
dition and gloomy prospect of the white
kreernen of southc arolina who do
not own slaves fc the letters which
fully though briefly exhibit this subject
in its true light were written by a na
tive of southt arolina himself tormei
ly a slaveholder and thoroughly ac
quainted with his subject  here is
no such thing as answering himthe
only safety ot the aristocracy is to be
found in keeping all knowledge of his
letters form those he addresses ol
course the southcarolina journals are
guiltless of any such incendiarism as
would be involved in their publication
somebody out ol the state has
strongly desired to bring these letters
signed brutus to the knowledge ol
the class to which they are addressed
and knowing that mr barrett was
about to travel through the upper part
of southcarolina has requested him
to drop packages ot the letters printed
into some specified postoflices addres
sed to various citizens of the state
as yet no particle of evidence has ap
peared showing that mr barrett knew
what was in the letters or that they
were obnoxious to any party in caroli
na yet the spartan of a late date
says
the charge under which he was
arrested is punishable by twelve
months imprisonment and one thousand
dollars fine but he may be indicted
under the arrest for any crime of which
the state attorney may think himself
able by competent testimony to con
vict the prisoner  here is more than
a possibility that barrett may be in
dicted lor an offense the penalty ol
which is dratli without benefit of cler
gy and assuredly if convicted all the
abolitionists in the united states cannot
save him
but it is not so easy to convict a man
legally of crime as to threaten it even
in southcarolina and slavery has
tuken another step in its own direction
at spartanburg there is in the post
oflice at that place a letter directed to
john kdward thomson which the
accusers of mr barrett assert was in
tended for him or that he has author
ity to take it from the office he
respectfully declines to have anything
to do with it they then summon the
postmaster to appear in court us a
witness against barrett and bring this
letter to be broken open and used m
evidence against him tut spartan
says
mr legg was arrested and brought
betore the magistrate he said in his
defense that he was a sworn officer of
tie government and had given hia
uond md security for the faithful dis
charge of hi s duty that he was not au
the north star
thorized o deliver the letter to any one
but the patty or his agents that before
the next court of sessions he wai
bound to forward the letter to the de
partment in w ashington that he was
as w illing as any one to discharge his
duty to the state ns a good citizen
that w ith due deference to the dis
tinguished authority under which the
magistrate was acting he felt himsel
compelled to decline delivering up th
letter or to enter into recognizance ex
cept for his personal appearance this
defense though strictly correct was
not deemed satisfactory by the magis
trate who thought that the postoffice
was not intended to enable criminals to
perfect their scheme of crime with im
punity and that upon a reasonable
showing if the postoffice contained
the evidence of some crime perpetrat
ed or about to be perpetrated the
postmaster like any private individual
w as bound upon the requisition of the
state authorities to produce the evi
dence
mr legg was therefore committed
to jail until he shall have given bond
and security for his own appearance at
court and the production of the john
kdward thompson letter by the ad
vice of counsel and in order to re
lieve himself from his painful and disa
greeable position mr legg finally
complied with the order of the magis
trate and is now under bond to appear
and produce the letter mr leggs
conduct in this whole affair was wholly
irreproachable and becoming his gene
ral character it was firm temperate
and respectful showing a conscientious
determination to do his duty accord
ing to the best of his knowledge and
ability both to the state and the gene
ral government
thus has been made the first fea
sible issue at law with the general gov
ernment the state must succeed
while she rt tains her sovereignty and
before she will give up that she will
give up all that trammels or interferes
with it we commend the precedent
to the magistracy of southcarolina
and none of them will refuse to ac
upon it when called upon they could
hardly have a higher or more reliable
authority than the venerable judge
johnson selfdefense is the first law
of nature and that law is a part of the
code of each sovereign state in the
union no law or regulation of the
general government can deprive us of
this inalienable right nor will we suffer j
ourselves to be cheated tricked or bul
lied out of it by any human power or
form of law
the charleston mercury hereupon
mixes in to the fray in the following
fashion
the issue raised is this have the
criminal authorities of the state the
right to compel the attendance of the
agents of the postoffice department
in this state to bear testimony as to
any crimes perpetrated through the
postoffice against the state and to
bring and lay before the courts any
letters in their possession proving such
crimes the laws of congress make
no provision for the case which has
arisen because it never entered into
the minds of former administrations
that the action of the general govern
ment could become perilous to the
safety of a state that instead of be
ing a protector and supporter of order
and law it should in any of its branch
es be used as an instrument of incen
diaries to carry out their schemes of
insurrection and bloodshed now we
know not what postmaster collamer
may do in the premises mr kendall j
one of his predecessors inoifice issued a
circular to the postmaster in the south
er n states directing them not to cir
culate incendiary publications through
the postotlice in those states we
should suppose that if a postmaster can j
suppress a letter or document hei
might for the same reasons which justi
fy its suppression carry it into court
in furtherance of the criminal laws of
a state but w hether the postmaster
general shall pursue this course or
not we have no idea that this stale will
flinch from protecting itself against the
flagitious conduct of the postoffice
or its agents within its limits if her
laws are not clear or strong enough for
her protection they will be made so
if the federal government thinks pro
per to attempt to shield its officers with
privileges and immunities incompatible
with the peace of the state let it do so
one of two things will occur they
will have either to leave the service of
the general government or sutler the
penalties of our state laws though life
itself should be the forfeit
we would put a few questions to
our readers before closing this subject
how comes it that the very first fruits
of the existing administration which
the south lifted to power have been
the vigorous exercise of the only
branch of the government which direct
ly reaches usthe postoffice depart
ment to assail and overthrow our
slave institutions may not the fact
that we have abolitionists in the offices
of vicepresident of the united states
secretary of the interior and postmas
ter general by southern cooperation
lead to the conclusion that the south is
now ripe for all sorts of aholition ex
periments in the face of these re
sults can any true southerner who
from mistaken viewrs aided iu produc
ing them do otherwise than abandon
the administration and turning his
back on taylorism and abolitionism
stand by the south in maintaining her
rights and honorr
it is very fortunate that our steam
 communication by water between the
north and the less lunatic south is
already no neatly perfected that it will
uot be very luconvenieut to carry the
mails around in case southc arolina
txpeu them from her soil it is quit
right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren
clear that mails are very much out of
place thereon and it is scarcely proba
i ble that the disunionists will soon find
a better excuse for expelling them than
the present we should prefer to let
i things go on as they hare gone but
between a rifled spyhaunted dog
eared mail and none at all we could
not hesitateour choice is none we
greatly mistake the present postmaster
general if he will suffer the law to be
trampled upon to humor mr barretts
ravening persecutors if there is any
law to justify the opening of this let
ter of course let the law be obeyed
if there is not as the chivalry seem
to cy r let them open it at their
peril if slaverv wil make an issue
with the law the sooner it is done the
more welcome
mr barrett we learn from our
western papers is a highly respecta
 ble citizen of indianaa leading free
suiler but not an abolitionist he
is in a perilous position from which he
may never emerge with life but we
trust lie will at least preserve his honor
unsullied southcarolina has bullied
j northern freemen out of their rights
at least once too often already
from tlie hyperion
address to the colored peo
ple of the ejsited states
the hyperion comes before you in a
large and improved form
the publication of the first numbers
on a small sheet was an experiment
called forth by the belief that we as a
people have a part to act in human his
tory and that by no means can we so
readily find oot what that part is as by
having a common medium of communi
cation and intercourse between our
selves such as it is our purpose to
make the hyperion
we may be asked some questions
with regard to our specific objects
j and especially whether we might not
have promoted these better by suppor
ting existing journals than by estab
lishing a new one in as brief a man
ner as possible we shall endeavor to
satisfy all enquiries of this kiud
there are valuable papers in exis
tence devoted much to the interests of
fhe free colored peopleand many anti
slavery periodicals which plead fur
their humanity and their rights the
ground is perhaps well covered so far
as it regards our relative social position
in the northern states but it is not
so to our apprehension with respect to
our wants as a people among our
selves we need in take u broader
view of our connection in the human
worldto act upon a broader basis than
we have been accustomed to to take
the facts ofhistory and by their con
stant and repeated affirmation in many
forms substantiate them in the popular
mind let us state some of the chief
of these facts
we are a division of the human fam
ily by ourselves having nothing to
do at present with our ancient father
land we bok only to the western hem
isphere and we find our number to
fall a little if any short of twelve mil
ions of people according to the best
authorities they are distributed thus
in the united states and canada three
and a half millions in the west indies
two and a half millions in brazil four
and a half millions in other parts of
the south america one and a half
millions of this large population
about six millions lying mainly be
tween the th and th degrees of
north latitude in the west indies and
the united states may be regarded as
within the range of a common social
destiny
this is an imposing mass and with
the rapidity of its growth we must con
nect the fact of its gradual and inevita
ble concentration within narrower lim
its
when we want to speak of wants as
a people w e mean this mass of six mil
lions it constitutes one half of the af
ricoamerican family we are that
family we are the africoamerican
people
from the saxon conquest of eng
land came the anglo saxon race
from the american conquest of africa
comes the africoamencan people
it is not now with us a question of
the tree colored peoplethe amer
ican slavethe colored people of
new vork or philadelphiabut a
question concerning the africoameri
can people who are to be hereafter u
nited by a common bond of fraternity
and interest we wish to think to
to write and to act for the whole
mass and for the future as well
as for the present we wish to culti
vate the broadest identification of each
member of the race with the whole and
at the same time to guard against that
narrow spirit of the prejudice of race
which has wrought so much injury tc
ourselves the anglosaxon arogancc
of superiority over all other division
of the human family and the conse
quent assumption of despotic powei
wherever and whenever avarice or am
bition has required it is a chapter o
history which we desire may never bt
repeated
our fathers were denationalized
when they were torn from their native
shores but we their children are ac
quiring the powers and the rights of a
new nationality under circumstances
highly favorable to me growth of an
and knowledge by nationality w
mean not necessarily to point to an in
dependent political confederacy but t
equal civil and political rights in a gov
eminent it we be asked to what na
tiou do you belong we may answei
to that which protects us in all th
rights of citizenship and man
ofthis new territory we shall be
come heirs in the despite of slavery
and prejudice we are marching for
rochester n y friday august  
 ward towards it with the march of time
itself to prepare for itby discipline
education and labor is at the same
ij moment a privilege and a dutyto both
of w hich we may and must prove our
selves equal
oppression is a sore school but
i enough has been done by its jupils in
ages past and enough among our
selves to show that its cruelties cannot
destroy the love of liberty nor the ca
pacity for its right use and enjoyment j
it has lowered long over us with its
dark shadows and may yet coitinue to
turn day into night and life into bitter 
ness but even in the night see
the unchanging star of our redemption
nnd from thti bitterness of our lot we
may draw severe instruction
to every part of the africoamerican
race we owe and shall maintain equal
fraternity we acknowledge no right
in one man to denationalize and enslave
another neither shall we respect in
any way the authority by which such
outrage is perpetuated all men are
free by the endowment of god and na
ture chains and stripes and forced
labor and human laws can no more
make a slave than unjust punishment
can make guilt or an undeserved ac
quittal cleanse from crime in the af
ricoamerican we see a man and a
brother and as such we shall council
him aid him in extremity speak for
him write for him and act for him
is this ground too broad do some
i fear that we shall lose our hold of what
is practicable by aiming at too muchrdo
they say that the best wisdom is to se
cure all we can for the present within
locai reach
yve are not indifferent to this and
similar suggestions it is not our pur
pose to neglect the local whilst pursu
ing the general and the broadnor to
sutfer the advantages that may be made
out of the present to escape by an ex
clusive regard towards the future t e
well know it is by the right use of the
one that we are to secure the other
but our approach is rapid and near
to a new state of things twentyfive
yearsw ill well nigh double our number
the manhood of our children will find
itself in the midst of twelve millions of
people over whom we dare affirm an
glo saxon tyranny shall hold doubtful
sway if any it sleeps uneasily on its
pillow now in this country with but
one fourth of this number spectres
haunt its sleep and disturb its waking
hours
if then we are so near to a new state
of things is it not time that we should
be preparing for il wuiever it mey
be it should find us ready andhere is
no room for delay yve must educate
our children cultivate our energies
contrive to organize our social condi
tion get rid ot our vices and jealousies
in short fathom our resources and
know our capacities
the africoamericans are said to be
much given to sectional and party
jealousies it is the cry of their ene
mies that they cannot bear to see
each other excel in any thing so far
as this is a slander let it go hut let i
us profit by the impeachment is not
this spirit of jealousy the natural fruit j
of confineing our thoughts and feel
ings and hopesto too small a compass
y t e may trace it back from the popu
lar meeting through the debating cir
cle to the clique and finally to self
selfishness is its root now this comes
of taking narrow view s it comes ot
habituating ourselves to acting on a
small scale the gradations of which we
do not extend beyond the local and the
present
yy  e have no fire from heaven with
which to touch the hearts ot our people
to rouse them from lethargy and urge
upon them a preparation for the new
state upon which they are to enter
we can only place before them facts
and show inducements and stimulate
ambition that they be not found wan
ting when the day comes
a dark cloud lowered over the af
ricoamerican people when texas
was annexedas a slave territory to the
united states it seemed to envelope
our future in the deepest gloom of
midnight a vast extent of new soil
the life blood of slavery was added to
the old to take off its young and vig
orous victims for increase and to res
tore the sceptre of political sovereignty
to the southern states that was a
dark day which seemed almost to ex
tinguish hope but as the north star
beams through the storm clouds so
does the flame rekindle in our minds
the flame of liberty fanned into a
brighter blaze by the winds that sweep
over the ocean from the great fields of
europe
the annexation of i exas connot
arrest the march of the human family
towards freedom it cannot quell the
rising moral energy of combined na
tions it cannotcrush these sentiment of
justice in mens minds it cannot rob
us of that new nationality to which we
look with as sure confidence as we
do to the spread of light and knowledge
throughout the world
it is on this spread of light and
knowledge that wc depend for relief
and not on the employment of physical
force in allusion to recent events in
europe we do not wish to be under
stood as deriving hope and strength
from the resits of physical conflict there
or elsewhere these are but the
proofs of the spiritual hie that lies be
neath whilst we are creatures of pas
sion and resentment such results will
follow the awakening ol man to a con
sciousness of his suffering and his
rights but meantime the inward
growth goes on truth shed more
light and more love with every ad
vancing hour and it s to light and love
that our hearts may turn as the source
of hope amidst allj the claatunge of
outward thing
the moral sentiment of the people o
the united states as a whole is improv
ingthe evils of slavery its injustice
its cruelty and the necessity tor its
dissolution become every day more ap
parent it arrests the march of civiliz
ation it dwarfsboth morally and intel
lectually its victim and its minister
the conviction of this fact spread
w ider and w ider now is a favorable
moment for us to adopt such means o
i selfimprovement as shall aid to assure
the world that we are w orthy of regard
as a peoplethat we possess capabili
 ties for government within ourselves
and that we are not blind to the marck
of cts that carries iw swiftly o wa i
to that time when ethiopia shall
j spread abroad her w ings and rejoice
it is not necessary now to go into
special detail of the plans by which we
hope in the publication of this journal
to assist our people in the improvement
of their condition we prefer to be
broad and general in our prospectus
i leaving the ground open for the adop
tion and incorporation of the views ol
others whose experience and knowl
edge may be better than our own
industry economy education intel
ligence virtue and usefulnessthese
are the consecutive steps of the laddet
by which we shall go upward and as
i sume among the people of the earth
the equal station to which the laws ol
nature and of natures god entitle us
one of the first measures we shall
adopt in the pursuance of the genera
purpose of our labors is that of setting
jon foot a system of enquiry into the
present condition and w ants of our peo
ple we shall hold an open record for
statistical information as to the various
kinds of employment in which they are
engagedthe branches of art most cul
tivated among them their literary op
portunities their associations for mutu
al support their schools churches and
other institutions the number resi
dence and qualifications of their teach
ers and so forth thus we shall come
to a knowledge of our resources and
be enabled to make the best practical
use of them for the promotion of the
general good in this labor we shall
need the cooperation of others in all
j parts of the country and at the earliest
possible moment shall issue a circular
address to facilate and simpliitiy the
task
economy is one of the first and indis
pcnsible conditions ol prosperity we
have reason to fear it is but little observ
ed by our people the cruel prejudice
of color has excluded them from the
opportunities of saving which society
provides for all other classesloflaborers
an exclusion which operates injuri
ously on their morals as well as on
their industry
with this general sketch of our ob
jects and principles we are content to
take the chances that may befal of suc
cess or failhre no amount af exertion
or dilligence shall be spared to secure
the former and if we fail we shall have
the consolation ef having employed our
tallents in a good cause and of paving
the way for a more fortunante effort
which may prosper at a future day
extracts
from an article in the christian examiner of july
rntitleil narratives of fugitive stares by the rev
ephraim pkabodv d d of boston
there is nowhere a more settled acd
bitter detestation of slavery than is
sometimes met with at the south and
strange as it may seem so entangled
is the w hole subject so complicated are
the relations and powers of the several
states and of the union that though
the slave may find the most sympathy
personally at the north our main hope
of the abolition of slavery as an insti
tution depends on the efforts of the
enemies of slavery at the south
if the question by whom is the work
to be done is answered more particu
larly it becomes obvious that the bur
den and heat of the day is not to be
borne by gentlemen at ease who
make speeches in i aneuil hall or the
tabernacle nor by the members of
our antislavery societies nor by any
persons at the north they may con
tribute more or less of aid but the
work is to be done the sacrifices to be
made the battle to be fought by those
whose homes are in the slave states
if slavery is to be removed it must be
at the final stage through legislative
action in those states and over this
the inhabitants of other states can
have only a slight and indirect infiuence
the great mass of whites
and blacks are alike unprepared for
freedom have both grown up under
the influences of slave institutions and
there is not any method of making such
fundamental changes in the very con
stitution of society which does not
involve perils and immediate evils from
which a thinking man may not reason
ably recoil how then are
we to regard the friends of freedom
at the south for ourselves we look
on them with the profoundest interest
and sympathy they compose the
only class of antislavery men whose
existence is absolutely vital and es
sential to freedom freedom can dis
pense with the efffiit cf others but nol
with theirs on the other
hand those in the slave states who are
desirous of the abolition of slavery are
not helped by northern abuse aji
loose uodiscrunmattng denunciations
all that rbetoncal reviling which en
deavors to make a bad and restless
temper pass for righteous indignation
all those careless judgments which
show either ignorance or disregard of
facts interfere with their efforts they
have to defend themselves alike against
the ignorance and mijudgtnent of the
north and south and such is the
natural weakness of man that many
draw from these misjudgmenu an ex
cum for doing nothing whoa they
find that they are classed among man
stealers and murderers and that the
least sympathy and the bittrrest denun
ciations come from those wh profess to
be the friends of the slave but on
whom none of the sacrifices of freedom
are to fall they recoil from any seem
ing companionship with them and
easily acquire a distaste for a cause
which subjects thera to such unde
served abuse it becomes
the north at all times ami at all
hazards to be faithful to freedom but
in doing this it should remember the
real position of the south i here is
needed in this great work not only
zeal and firmness hut information
justice kindness truth and so far as
the north is concerned what is most
to be dreaded will come from haste in
tolerance selfconceit political am
bition and a philanthropy which goes
far enough to be indignant but which
will not take the trouble to be just
one of the questionable rhingswhe
ther it lias or ha  not compensating ad
vantages we do not pretend to say
about the free soil party as a party
is we fear its tendency to cripple the
friends of freedom in the slave states
we have no doubt that southern em
ancipationists are aided and strength
ened by all discussions at the north
which show r the evil ot extending slave
ry over soil now free there are mul
titudes at the south who are ready to
respond to all arguments for keeping
those territories free which as yet
are not cursed by the presence ol
slavery but an organized northern
party which as such bands itself
against the southand especially if it
become a mere political party managed
by and for the benefit of political lead
ers who have given in their past lives
no special pledges of regard for free
dom must have a very different re
sult it arrays section against section
the north against the south and the
southern man who is opposed to slave
ry feels compelled by all those social
instincts which are more powerful than
our reasonings to unite with his neigh
bors against what seems to them all
the organized aggressions of strangers
of the narratives at the head of
this article the first four possess no
especial interest beyond what must be
long to the life of almost every fugitive
slave they are records of degrada
tion on the part of both blacks and
whites of suffering and wrong and
noral corruption they give doubt
ess a just idea of what slavery is to
he slave but on the other hand
white we have no reason to qußtio
the truth of particular facts respecting
individuals we have no doubt that i hey
convey an altogether erroneous idea of
the general character of the masters
the best qualities of the masters are
likely to appear anywhere rather than
in this connection with the slave and
except it be an easy kindness the
slave is in up position to estimate aright
he virtues of one who towards him
self appears simply as a power whom
rie cannot resist they stand in such
jtterly false relations to each other
hat their whole intercourse must ne
lessarily he vitiated and the worst
qualities of each and these almost ex
clusively must be perpetually forced
n the attention of the other but hu
nan society could not long exist were
he great body of slaveholders like
hose whom these narratives describe
the narrative of louglss contains
he life of a superior man but
vhileour sympathies go strongly with
urn and because they go with him we
ire disposed to make a criticism on a
node of address in which he sometimes
ndulges himself which we believe is
ikely to diminish notjonly his useful
iess but his real influence we would j
lot detract from his merits and we can 
easily excuse in him a severity ofjudg
nent and a onesidedness of view
ivhich might be inexcusable in another
iv e can hardly condemn one who has
jeen a slave for seeing only the evils
sf slavery and for thinking lightly of
he difficulty of remedying them but
e have wished when we have heard
aim speak or read what he has writ
ten that he might wholly avoid a fault
from which a natural magnanimity does
lornething towards saving him but to
which he is nevertheless exposed his
associates at the north nave been
among those who are apt to mistake
violence and extravagance of expres
sion and denunciation for eloquence
men who whatever their virtues
otherwise are not in the habit of using
discrimination in their judgment ol
men or of measures which they do not
approva to him they have doubt
leas been true and faithful friends and
he naturally adopts their style of
speech butitia a mistaken one it
the speaker wishes to sway the judg
ment of his hearers and to accomplish
any practical end no matter what
the vehemence of tone or expression
whenever a speaker indulges himself
in violent and unqualified statements
and in sweeping denunciations he not
only makes it apparent that lie is de
ficient in a sound and fair judgment
but what is worse he creates in his
hearers a secret distrust of hts real
earnestness a vague feeling that
iltr all he is thinking more of his
speech than of the end for which he
professes to make it when men are
profoundly in earnest they are not apt
to be extravagant the more earnest
the more ngidly true a merchant
in discussing the politics of the day
about which he knows or cares little
freely indulges in loose extravagant
and violent declarations but follow
him to his countingroom let him be
making inquiries or giving direction
about some enterprise which be realty
has deeply it heart and the extra
agance is gone nothing will an r

whole no 
his earnestness makes him calm it
is seen in the moderated accuracy as
well as in the decision and strength of
his statements ktravagnce and pas
sion and rhetorical flourishes might do
when nothing which he greatly valued
was at stake but here is something
too serious for trilling just so it is in
other cases a flippant extravagant
speaker especially if he he gifted with
the power of sarcasm will probably
be listened to and applauded bat noth
ing comes ot it they who applaud
the most understand very well that
this is not kind ot personfwhose
judgment is to be relied on as a guide
in action his words are listened to
with much the same sort of interest
that is given to the personated passion
of the theatre a few sober words
from a calm wise discriminating mind
are after all the ones which are fol
lowed nothing is less effective for
any practical end than the withering
and scorching eloquence with which
american speeches seem so to abound
it conciliates no opponent and though
it may light up the momentary pas
sions it gives no new strength of con
viction to the friends of the cause it
is the last kind of eloquence to be
cultivated by those who are heartily in
earnest in their desire to promote any
great reform while upon
this topic we will take advantage of
the opportunity to express our regret
that there are so many who consider
mr clay a fitting subject of abuse
we have no doubt that their denuncia
tions of this eminent statesman ars
very sincere but it is a mournful fait
that they can be sincere in most
cases it is hardly possible to retain
confidence in the good faith of those
who profess to desire the abolition of
slavery and who yet attack mr clay
with unmeasured virulence because of
his recent letter on emancipation
while we should be utterly opposed to
his particular scheme of emancipation
we cannot fail to see that mr clay has
nobly identified himself with the great
interests of humanity at this moment
he is doing incomparably more for free
dom than any living manand we be
lieve more than all the antislavery
men of the north united the appetite
for calumny and denunciation must be
ravenous and insatiate which can lead
those who profess to wish well to the
cause of freedom to attack mr clay
in time of peace prepare
for war
the injunction in time of peace
prepare for war is of heathen ori
gin as a rule of international con
duct it is unworthy of an age of
christian light it can be vindicated
only on two grounds first by assum
ing that the arbitrament of war is the
proper agency for deciding controver
sies between nations and that tho
v ar system is therefore to be main
tained and strengthenedas the ea
sentiul means of international justice
or second by assuming the rejected
dogma of an atheist philosopher hob
bes that war is the natural state of
man whatever may be the infirm
ities of our passions all must perceive
that that natural state of individuals
in which they have the highest hap
piness andjto which they tendjby an ir
resistible heavenly attraction is peace
and this is true of communities and of
nations as well as of individuals the
proper rule should be in time of
peace cultivate the arts of peace so
doing you will render the country
truly strong and truly greatnot by
arousing the passions of war not by
nursing men to the business of blood
not by converting the land into a flame
arsenal a magazine of gunpowder or
an infernal machine all ready to
explodebut by dedicating its whole
energies to useful and beneficent
works
the incongruity of this system of
armed peace may be illustrated by an
example look into the life of that
illustrious philosopher john locke and
you w ill find that in the journala of hi
tour through france describing the
arches of the amphitheatre at nisrnts
he says there is a stone laid about
twenty inches or two feet square and
about six times the length of my sword
which was about a philosophic yard
long who is not struck by the un
seemliness of the image of the author
of tho kssay on tho human under
standing travelling with a sword by
his side but in this he only followed
the barbarous custom of his time in
dividuals then lived in the same rela
tions towards each other which now
characterize nations the waf sya
tern had not yet entirely retreated from
municipal law and custom to find its
last citadel and temple in the jawa and
customs of nations do not forget
that at the present moment our
own country the great author among
the nations of a new kssay on the
human understanding not only
travels with a sword by its tide but
lives encased in complete armor bur

 j istick in suithcarolina it appears
that on friday the th day of july some
disturbance occurred among lire negro prison
ers at the work house in charleston s c
the number of colored peisous confined in
this establishment was about eighty they
seem to have been permited to herd together
and run at large in the yard no distinction be
ing made between those who had been con
victed of heriub crime and tin mimpr

vagabondism and trivial offences of course
under these circumstancesdiscipline and quie
subordination could hardly beexpected amon
the prisoners on the day abovenamed an
offiejr attempted to remove a negro womai
from the workhouse but was resisted by r
slave named nicholas who said she should
not go because she was of his family and
should not be separated from him
other negroes joined nicholas and inter
posed to prevent the removal of the woman
a scuffle and light ensuedduring which some
of the party employed by tne authorities both
white and coloied persons were wounded
but not dangerously from the little evidence
drawn out on the subsequent investigation of
the affnr it seems that the number of the
prisoners prevailed over those attempting to
maintain order and that they escaped from
ihe jail and scattered themselves through the
towu ihe next day a court of magistrates
and ireeholders was organized for the trial of
nicholas and others of the slaves who had
been recaptured three of them nicholas

narratives oi fugitive slave by the
rev ephraim peabody
since the publication of the last north
star we have received a copy of the chris
tian examiner and religious miscellany
containing the article from the pen of mi
i peabody upon extracts from which we
commented last week we have read the
article and find nothing in it to alter the
opinion we then expressed except that we
must give its authoi credit for a deeper sym
pathy with the slave and a clearer perception
of the evils of slavery than w r aa evinced in
the extracts to which we made reference
we have no doubt that much of the mist and
darkness by which he is now enveloped as to
the means ot getting rid of slavery will dis
appear in proportion as he contemplates the
monster evils of the system we thank him
i sincerely for his eloquent and powerful por
traiture of the horrors of the internal slave
trade and foi his exposure of the miseries
which it inflicts not only upon the individual
slave but upon the whole slave population
lt will certainly be of service to the anlisla

proposition
j to abolish the colored schools and to repeat
the ordinance for excluding colored childrer
from the district schools in rochester
the following report of the regular meet
ing of the board of education is taken frorr
the daily magnet of august th
the regular meeting of the board ofedu
cation was held last evening at the citj
halland having a leisure moment on oui
hands we dropt in after the transaction o
some unimpoitant business hitam c smith
esq from the committee on colored schools
made an able report on the subject which
we trust will be extensively published and
read the committee say we may as well
make the religious sentiments of the parents
or the physical organization of the children
a test for admission as the color of the skin
they concluded the report by a resolution
declaring it inexpedient to establish anothei
colored school to be located on the east side
of the river recommended that the school
on north washingtonstreet be discontinued
and that the ordinance forbidding the admis
sion of colored children into our dist irci
school be repealed the report canvasses
the whole ground in an able manner but as
it is to be published we refrain from attempt
ing a synopsis
after the reading of the report mr ams
den made a few remarks stating that it did
not exactly suit his views but hoped that
some compromise ground might be taken and
suggested a modification of the recommeuda
non by which the colored children should be
admitted by consent of the trustees
mr smith defended the positions of the re
port in an able manner and was followed by
mr hatch in support of it
mr quinn said it was an able report but
thought it did not originate in the board a
proposition was now being urged to classify
the public schools put the girls and boys ol
the same studies and capacity together and
no citizen would want a colored boy sitting
in school beside his daughter for one he
could not vote for abolishing the present sys
tem now
the wl oe subject was finally deferred un
til the next regular meeting on motion of mr
parsons
mr porter from the committee on clasifi
cation make a report recommending the adop
tion of a system of classification founded up
on capacity and advancement alone without
regard to sex the recommendation was ad
opted
l hi ts certainly an important movement
and should meat with the warmest encour
agement ot the rochester prcea ictr smith
has done himself high honor in taking the
lead in a measure so just and wise and yet so
unpopular w e have not seen hia report
but aa it is to be published we hope to be
able to lay it before our readers in our next
week s papei r u high time that this un
christian and soudemocratic distinction in our
district school was abolished the pride and
prejudice which it fosters are fraught with
untold injuries upon the most helpless and
least protected portion of the community

l
we have placed this rootto at the head of
oat editorial column not as a rhetotical flour
ish nor as something to catch the eye for a
moment and then lobe withdrawn bat at ao
important and solid end to be attained much
has been said about uniting the free colored
people m a general organization for opposing
alarery and improving their own condition
but as yet all efforts hate been unsuccessful
we hare been and still are a divided and
entered people and in consequencewe have
not distinguished ourselves by doing much for
our elevation and improvement it has ever
i been the policy of our enemies to divide us
and to create jealousies among ua and thus
to render union as difficult as possible tbey
well understand that we are more easily man
aged and viotimized while disunited than
we could be if protected by a bond of union
we are now without this protection we
have no general understanding among our
selves and the question foi every colored man
to answer is shall we have it f different
answers w ill undoubtedly be returned to this
questiou some will say with our oppress
ors tnat any general union among us is out of
the question that as a class we are too ig
norant and too suspicious of each other to
organize ourselves iu a comprehensive man
ner for prosecuting any important measure or
for achieving any great purpose whatsoever
it will be contended that we are too indifferent
to our condition and too well satisfied with
our degradation to rally in behalf of our own
rights such will be the gloomy apprehen
sions of the faithless many among out selves
incapable of doing anything towards bettering
their own condition they are ever readywith
their doubts and fears to discourage others
against all piecedentsagainst all luke
waimness against all doubts and fears we
believe that the oppressed colored population
of this country can and will be largely and
effectively united and single handed we
mean to bend our energies to this end until
i we are convinced of its hopelessness or grati
i fied by its success
as a means of having something definite
before our people we take the liberty to sub
mit the rough outlines of a constitution or a
basis of union which may serve the betterto
j illustrate our subject and facilitate our object
preamble
whereas the voice of reason and the ad
moniions of experience in all ages alike im
press us with the w idom and the necessity of
i combination and that union and concert of
action aie highly essential to the speedy sue
cess of any good cause that as in division
there is weakness so in union there is strength
 and whereas we have long deplored the dis
tracted and divided state of the oppressed
and the manifold evils resulting therefrom
and desiring as we do to see an union formed
which shall enable us the better to grapple
with the various systems of injustice and
wrong by which we are environed and to re
i gain our plundered rights we solemnly agree
to unite in accordance with the following
constitution

are that slavery is a heinous sin against goc
a monstrous outrage upon mana fruitfu

that it ought to be immediately and forevei
abolished that resistance to slavery is the
right and duly of every member of the humar
family that of all other men it is especiallj
the right and duty of the oppressed to vindi
cate their own rights that if they are indif
ferent to their condition it is idle to hope tha
others will be interested for them that to be
worthy of human freedom we should seel
to attain it that the best evidence of  mans
fitness for social equality is to make the besi
use of his civil rights that no people evei
obtained their freedom worthily that did noi
manifest a willingness to make sacrifices ir

we msy remark that this constitution is
merely thsown out as a means of directing at
tention to the subject of union it makes no
attempt at perfection nor do we propose to
insist upon its adoplion in its present form
but we present it to the consideration of our
people as a means of leading them to adopt
something better
we shall be happy to receive any commu
nications on the subject and as we anticipate
that roany may wish to make their sentiments
known we would recommend ttatvity to all
who may write for the north star the
subject is one of vital concern to us all and i
should receive our most serious and earnest
attentionf d
the lynn pioneer and herald of
freedom
our old friend bradburn in his accustomed
spirit his come to the rescue of mr garnet
and defends him from ihe animadversions
upon his conduct made in the north star
two weeks ago we are not disposed to en
ter the irena with one so skilled in the use of
certain weapons as ihe editor ot the pioneer
we cannot meet him on his own grounds
should we do so we are sure that how vic
torious soever we might be the clothes worn
in battle would be rendered useless forever af
terwards but we must venture a few words j
even at this hazard on his defence of mr
garnet
in answer to the charge we prefeired against
mr garnet as having no faith in moral
means for the overthrow of slavery and as
believing that the sword is the only successful
instrument for its abolition mr bradburn
comments as follows
if mr garnet has so declared himself
then we are happy to know that mr gar
nets practice is better than his faith in that
tegard for to our certain knowledge he
has been during these many years past busily
plying moral means for the abolishment of
slavery and we do not understand him to
differ at all in respect of the matter in ques
tion from charles lenox remond who in
the same number of the star in which the
former is bo flagellated is very justly lauded
as a talented and eloquent advocate of equal
rights we have heard mr remond
again and again advocate the right of the
slaves to serve their masters just as our revo
lutionary fathers served their english op
pressors ellis gray loring we remember
in one instance felt it to be his duty to pub
lish a disclaimer of all sympathy as a mem
ber of the american a s s with that sen
timent of our friend remonila
it is surprising that one so straightforward
as mr bradburn should attempt to disguise
j an inconsistency so glaring as the one in ques
tion we maintain now as we didin the
article to which he takes exception that mr
garnet has repeatedly held up moral suasion
not only as abortive but as contemptible and
that for such a man to assume at any time
to be a champion for the abolition of slavery
by moral means is proof of hollowness and
hypocrisy he believes in the sword but
carefully abstains from the use of it he con
demns moral force and appeals to it for suc
cess when it suits him when in zion
chuich new york he makes capital among
the colored people by avowing his faith in
the sword when among more enlightened
reformers he makes his appeal to public opin
ion such a course of doubledealing proves
him to be an unprincipled man
mr bradburn attempts to confound the po
sition of mr garnet with that of mr re
mond and in this shows that he knows little
about either it is one thing to assert the
right of a slave to gain his freedom by force
jand another thing to advocate force as the
only means of abolishing slavery we un 
derstand mr remond to assert the former i
but to deny the latter as iirmly as we do
all that mr biadburn says in justification of
a slave insurrection on the ground that it is
consistent with the conduct of the revolution
ary patriots we have said and do now say
this however is no authority with re
formers we contend that the only well
grounded hope of the slave for emancipation
is in the operation of moia force
mr bradburn having disposed of our ob
jections to mr garnet with a marked love of
good english tries to mend our grammar but
with as little success as his attempt to wipe
out the inconsistencies of mr garnet the
sentence in our article ending either by
precept or example be amends so as to
read either by precept or by example
we have consulted no authority as to the
necessity of mr bradburns amendment but
shall accept it as a correction until we are
corrected by higher authority if there be any
such m he country or out of it a second
amendment is in that sentence saying the
pariy who has invited him to england mr
bradburn corrects by inserting the word
which after parly instead of who
he seems not to know with ail hia acquaint
ance wuh good english that the term jnrty
may be as correctly applied to one individual
as to a body of persons and in this instance
it was so applied therefore while we ac
cept of one of mr bradburns amendments
we insist that he should thank us for exposing

yvlien freedom here her claims obtained
no cannon with tremendous sound
the noble patriots cause maintained
no furious battle charger neighed
no brother fell by brothers blade
none of those desperate scenes of strile
which mark the warriors proud career
the awful waste of human idle
have ever been enacted here
but truth and justice spoke from heaven
and slaverys galling chain was riven
tvvas moral force which broke the chain
that bound eight hundred thousand men
and when we see it snapped in twain
shall we not join in praises then
and prayers unto almighty god
who smote to earth the tyrant rod 
and from those islands of the sea
l iie scenes of blood and crime and wrong
the glorious anthem of the free
now swells in mighty chorus strong
telling th oppressed where ei they roam

southern moot ot argumentln reply

which slavery engenders and dispose h
thoroughly of a current objection that it if

has never been properly argued between the

citizens were to set out from ihe north to moi

even for fitly per cent while ten to one would

peculiarly the duty of christian men to testi

question teally raised was whether the
character of a mans religious belief should

he had visited in the united state ship ohio

he states that mr ithamar whiting former

he left at the stanislaus dry diggings with
a party of  sick of their peclauon and
regretting tht they had given up their com
fortable situations the situations they had
left were at a factory in tepic mexico
whitings income from his factorat the same
place last year was  and yet lie left
all to dig gold the writer left him at

says that california is the worst hole of a
place he ever was in and that thousands ol
disappointed people were arriving everv day
tne w riter states that he w t nt up to the mines
in company with a gentleman who had ex
pended considerable monev in bringing along
fifteen indians to assist him but they did not
j succeed in getting more than an ounce apiece
per day and that the man was disgusted with
the mines as every decent porson is who
goes there these statements in regard to
california are without doubt too true the

in the day at king solomon the
son of david who by the virtue of his
cabalistic seal reigned supreme over
genii as well as tnen and who could
peak the language of animals of all
kinds all created beings were subservi
ent to his will now when the king
wanted to travel he made use for his
conveyance of a carpet of a square
form this carpet had the property
of extended itself to a sufficient size to
carry a whole army with the tents and
baggage but at other times it could be
reduced so as to be only large enough
for the support of the royal throne and
of those ministers w hose duty it was to
attend upon the person of the sover
eign four genii of the air then took
the four corners of the carpet and car
ried it with its contents wherever
king solomon desired once the king
w as on a journey in the air and carried
upon his throne of ivory over the va
rious nations of the earth the rays
of the sun poured down upon his head
and he had nothing to protect him from
its heat the fiery beams were begin
ning to scorch his neck and shoulders
when he saw a flock of vultures flying
past o vultures cried king solo
mon come and fly between me and
the sun and make a shadow with your
wings to protect me for its rays are
scorching my neck and face but the
vultures answered and said we are
flying to the north and your face is
turned towards the south v e desire
to continue on our way and be it
known unto thee oking that we will
not turn back on our flight neither will
we fly above vour throne to protect you
from the sun although its rays may be
scorching your neck and face then
king solomonlifted up his voice and
said cursed be ye o vulturesand
because ye will not obey the commands
of your lord who rules over the whole
world the feathers of your necks shall
fall off and the heat of the sun and
the cold of the winter and the keen
ness of the wind and the beating of the
rain shall fall upon your rebellious
necks which shall not be protected
like the feathers of other birds and
whereas you have hitherto fared deli
cately henceforth ye shall eat carrion
and feed upon offal and your race
shall be impure till the end of the
world and it was done unto the
vultures as king solomon had said
now it fell out that there was a
flock of hoopoes flying past and the
king cried out unto them and said o
hoopoes come and fly between me and
the sun that i may be protected from
its rays by the shadow of your wings
whereupon the king of the hoopoes
answered and said o king we are
but little fowls and we are not able to
afford much shade but we will gather
our nation together and by our num
bers make up for our small size so
the hoopoes gathered together and
flying in a cloud over the throne of the
king they sheltered him from the rays
of the sun
when the journey was over anc
king solomon sat upon his golder
throne in his palace of ivory whereo
the doors were emerald and the wind
ows of diamonds larger even than the
diamond of jemshid he commandee
that the king of the hoopoes shoule
stand before his feet now saic
king solomon for the service tha
thou and thy race have rendered an
the obedience thou hast shown unto thi
king thy lord and master what shal
be done unto thee o hoopoe am
what shall be given the hoopoes of thi
race fora memorial and a reward
now the king of the hoopoes was con
fused with the great honor of standing
before the feet of the king and ma
king his obeisance and laying his righ
claw upon his heart he said o king
live forever let a day be given t
thy servant to consider with his queei
and his councillors what it shall be tha
the king shall give us for a reward
and king solomon said beit so am
it was
but the king of the hoopoes flew a
way and he went to his queen wh
was a dainty hen and he told her wha
happened and he desired her advice a
to what they should ask of the kin
for a reward and he called togethe
his council and they sat upon a tree
and they each of them desired a differ
ent thing some wished for a lon
tail some wished for blue and greei
feathers some wished to be as large a
ostriches some wished for one thing
and some for another and they debar
ed till the going down of the sun bu
they could not agree together thei
the queen took the king of the hoopoei
part and said to him my dear lor
and husband listen to my words am
as we have preserved the head of kinj
solomon let us ask for crowns of gol
on our heads that we may be superioi
to all other birds and the words o
the queen and the princesses hei
daughters prevailed and the king o
the hoopoes presented himself befon
the throne of solomon and desired o
him that all hoopoes should wear gold
en crowns upon their heads ther
solomon said hast thou considered
well what it is that thou desirest anc
the hoopoe said j have considered
well and we desire to have golden
crowns upon our heads so solomon
replied crcwns of gold shall ye have
but behold tnou art a foolish bird and
when the evil days shall come upon
thee and thou seest the folly of thy
heart return here to me and i will
give thee help so the king of the
hoopoes lelt the presence of king solo
mon with a golden crown upon his
bead and all the hoopoes had golden
crowns and they were exceeding
proud and haughty moreover they
went down by the lakes and the pools
and walked by the margin of the water
that they might admire themselves
w re a i lam and the queen
of the hoopoes gave herself airs and
sat upon a twig and she refused to
peak to the morops her cousins and
the other birds who had been her
friends because they were but vulgar
birds and she wore crown of gold
upon her head
now there was a certain fowler
who set trap for birds and he put a
piece of a broken mirror into his trap
and a hoopoe that went in to admire it
self was caught and the fowler look
ed at it and saw the shining crown
upon its head so he wrung off its
head and took the crown to issachar the
son of jacob the worker in metal and
he asked him what it was so lssachar
the son of jacob said lt is a crown
of brass and he gave the fowler a
quarter of a shekel for it aud desired
him if be found any more to bring
them to him and to tell no man there
of so the fowler caught some more
hoopoes and sold their crowns to is
sachar the son of jacob until one day
he met another man who was a jewel
ler aud he showed him several of the
hoopoes crowns whereupon the
jeweller told him that they were of pure
gold and he gave the fowler a talent
of gold for four of them
now when the value of these
crowns was known the fame of them
got abroad and in all the land of israel
was heard the twang of bows and the
whirling of slings birdlime was made
in every town and the price of traps
rose in the market so that the fortunes
of the trapmakers increased not a
hoopoe could show its head but it was
slain or taken captive and the days of
the hoopoes were numbered then
their minds were filled w ith sorrow and
dismay and before long few were left
to bewail their cruel destiny at last
flying by stealth through the most un
frequented places the unhappy king of
the hoopoes went to the court of king
solomon and stood again before the
steps of the golden throne and with
tears and groans related the misfor
tunes which had happened to his race
so king solomon looked kindly up
on the king of the hoopoes and said
unto him behold did  not warn thee
of thy folly in desiring to have crowns
of gold vanity and pride have been
thy ruin but now that a memorial
may remain of the serv ice which thou
didst render unto me your crowns of
gold shall be changed into crowns of
feathers that ye may walk unharmed
upon the earth now when the fowl
ers saw that the hoopoes no longer wore
crowns of gold upon their heads they
ceased from the persecution of their
race and from that time forth the fam
ily of the hoopoes have flourished and
increased and have continued in peace
even to the present day
