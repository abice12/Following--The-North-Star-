the usurpations and aggressions of the slave power look at the extent to which this malign influence has predominaied the slave states are far interior to the free states in population in wealth ineducation in libraries in resources ot all kinds and yet they have taken to themselves the lions share of the offices of honor and profit under the constitution they have held the presidency for fiftyseven years while the free states have held it for twelve years only but without pursuing the exposition of this uame of political sweepstakes winch the slave power has perpetually played let us present what is more important as indicative of its spirit the aggressions and usurpations by which it lias turned the federal government from its original character of freedom and proslituted it to slavery here is a brief catalogue early in this century when the district of columbia was finally occupied as the national capital the slue power succeeded in defiance ot the spirit of the constitution and even of the express letter of one of its amendments in securing for slavery within the district the countenance of the federal government until then it had existed no where within the exclusive jurisdiction of this government it next secured for slavery another recognition under the federal government in the broad territory ot louisiana purchased from i ranee it next placed slavery again under the sanction of the federal government in the territory of florida purchased from spain waxing powerful it was able after a severe struggle to dictate terms to the federal government in the missouri compromise compelling it to receive the slate into the union with a slaveholding constitution it instigated and carried on a most expensive war in b lorida mainly to recover certain fugitive slaves thus employing the unny of the united states as slave catchers it wrested from mexico the province ef texas m order to xetend slavery and triumphing over all opposition finally secured its admission into the union with a constitution making slavery perpetual it next plunged the country in war with mexico in order to gain new lauds for slavery with the meanness as well as the insolence of tyranny it has compelled the federal government to abstain from acknowledging the ueighbor republic of haiti where slaves have become freemen and established an independent nation it has compelled the federal government to sloop ignobly and in vain to secure compensation for certain slaves who in the exercise of the natural rights ot man had asserted and achieved then freedom on the atlantic ocean and afterwards sought shelter m bermuda it has compelled the federal government to seek to negotiate treaties for the surrender of fugitive slaves thus making it assert property in human flesh it has joined in declaring the foreign slavetrade piracy hut insists upon the coastwise slavettade and the sanctions of the federal government for several years it rejected the petitions to congress adverse to slavery thus in order to shield slavery practically deny mg the l ight vf petition the north star it denies to the free colored citizens of massachusetts the privileges secured to them under the constitution of the united stttes by imprisoning them end sometimes selling them into slavery it insulted and exiled from charleston and new orleans the honored representatives of massachusetts who were sent to those places to throw the shield of the constitution over hei colored citizens it has by the pen of mr calhoun as secretary of state in formal despatches made the republic stand before the nations of the earth as the vindicator of slavery oll it has put forth the hideous effrontery that slavery can go to all newly acquired territories and nave the protection of the national flag such are some ofthe usurpations and aggressions of the slave power by such steps the federal government has been perverted from the original purposes its character changed and its powers subjected to slavery it is pitiful to see freedom suffer at anytime from any hands it is doubly pitiful when she suffers from a government whose earliest energies were i inspired by her breath and who learned by her teachings to be strong so the struck eagle stretclied upon the plant no more through rolling clouds to soar again viewed his own feather ou the fatal dart and winged the shaft trial quivered in his heart keen were his pangs but keener lar to feel he nursed the pinion which impelled the steel while the same plumage that had warmed his nest drank the hut lifedrop of his deeding breast that we may fully estimate the enormity of this system of conduct we must call to mind the evils of slavery where it is allowed to exist and here language is inadequate to portray the infinite sum of wretchedness of degradation of injustice which are legalized by this unholy relation there is no offence against religion against morals against humanity which may not stalk in the license of this institution unwhipt of justice for the husband and wife there is no marriage for the mother there is no assurance that her infant child will not be torn from her breast for all who bear the name of slave there is nothing which i they can call their own but the bondman is not the only sufferer he does not sit alone in his degradation by his side is his master who is compelled in the debasing influences on his own soul to share the degradation to which he dooms his fellow man he must be a prodigy says jefferson who can retain his manners and morals undepraved by suh circumstances and this is not all the whole social iabric is disorganized labor loses its dignity industry sickens education finds no schools religion finds no churches and the whole land of slavery is impoverished from the raleigh n c register espionage ofthe mails jgj the doctrines set forth by the wash ton union and reiterated by the southern locofoco press in reference to the powers and duties of the post master general would disgrace a russian or turkish despotism for the sake of turning the excitable sensibilities of the southern people to political account it is boldly maintained to be the duty of the head of the post oflica department to authorize his subordinates to open letters and packages supposed to contain objectionable matter this principle being once established the liberty of the press becomes a nullityand the dominant party is invested with full powers to suppress the promulgation through the mails of any opinions which they disapprove if the post master general can prohibit j the delivery of abolition newspapers and letters and authorize them to be opened there is nothing to prevent him from exercising the same censorial power over his political opponents if a democrat he may strip the n hig party entirely of the use of the mails and at the same time make them a vehicle for propagating the views of his own party we are not prepared to charge that this despotic principle was acted on during the last or preceding presidential campains but certain it is that it is openly maintained by the organ ofthe late administration if the principle of espionage is allowed to be correct it is a mere question of prejudice and passion in the dominant party as to who are to be its victims in the exercise of it the whigs if we can suppose the bigs capable ot maintaining such principles would suppress the circulation of democratic doctrines and the democrats thoseof the whigs and the abolitionists in their turn would close the mails to both the other parties there is no drawing a distinction between doctrines which are criminal aud hurtful to the comu nily and such as are salutary what is regarded as sound doctrine in new etigland passes in south carolina for ranting fanaticism on the other band the new englanders look upon the maxims and principles which are prevalent in south carolina as the offspring of barbarism there are a thousand shades of opinion in reference to the question of slavery any one of which stopping short of unqualified approval of the institution would be condemned in south carolina as heretical acd the promulgator of them subjected to insult if to nothing worse it would be dangerous in south carolina for a manto utter the prayer of general cass for the abolition of slavery throughout the world ah uch opinions therefore would be voted incendiary ny a south carolina vigilance committee and the postmasters would feel bound to destroy the documents containing them th viw dailjr priulmd cuy jt m ill ii f i t eight is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren palmetto state as no better than tree sod and are believed to have the ef i feet of exciting insurrection yet in the state of missouri and kentucky they are daily uttered from the press and the stump and command the respect ot thousands in massachusetts the gen timents which pass for orthodox in south carolina would excite disgust or ridicule there is no standing of ri truth and orthodoxy in politicsat least none to which all parties refer and such beiug the case the question j can never be settled for what object j aud to suppress what opinions shonld the censorship of mails be exercised dgttkain it is however that tht south tshostd not uphold the right ot r espionage she has nothing to gain by it now and will have less in future years when the north will be so much aggrandized by the increase of popu  lation native and foreign and by the i addition of new states the immediate cause of the excitement in south carolina as we isarn  from the newspapers is an attempt of j some crazy fanatic to circulate an address intended to operate on the class of nonslaveholders and to accomplish this object a ridiculou s air of mystery was thrown around the subject by the use of cyphers and other secret signs llt seems that no evidence exists however of a purpose to excite insurrection but merely to raise up a freesoil or emancipation party and but i i for the stupid attempt at mystery and concealment the whole affair would have passed off without so much as exciting a remark if this is the extent of the offence of the abolitionists there would be no justification of the illegal proceedings that have taken place in spartanburg indeed we see no necessity for legal proceedings under any circumstance the law is ample for i the punishment of the diabolical attempts of abolitionists or others to excite insurrection and public opinion everywhere will justify its vigorous exercise every arm is nerved for the punishment of such villains and even the summary justice of lynch i law maybe excused though unnecessj j ary but for the promulgation of opinions not tending te excite insurrection i and not addressed to slaves hut toi freeman we apprehend that neither law nor justice will justify their forcible suppression we cease to be a free people when we cease to cherish the most sacred charters of our liberties the bill of rights and the constitution both of which guarantee the freedom of he press and of speech these were the rights for diitcw our english forefathers fought against the tyranny of charles ii and for denying them he forfeited his head and it was in the same sacred cause that war was waged against james who uninstructed by the misfortunes ofhis father commenced the same career of tyranny which cost him his throne the legality of arresting barrett in spartanburg holding him to bail and in sending him to prison may be justified if he had given grounds for suspicion of tampering with slaves in order to induce them to run away or resist their masters but the circulation of such documents as have been published would not warrant his punishment the pamphlets or letters are addressed to white men and as far as we have seen propose no resistance open or clandestine to the laws of south corolina but the proceedings against the post master legg are wholly illegal and amount to a nullification of the laws and constitution of the united states the circumstances are thesej m barrett an emissary of tho abolitionists of ohio or indiana i had been arrested in spartanburg and it was known that he was authorized to take from the post office in that place a letter addressed to one john i edward thompson and the committee afvigilance supposing that this letter contained evidence of his guilt determined to have possession of it for this purpose they induced a magistrate ito issue a warrant against the postmaster g w h legg compelling him to give bond for his appearance before the court of sessionswith the letter as a witness against barrett the postmaster refused to comply j very properly with this mob requisition and was sent to prisou for his temerity it seems that mr admitted even by the mob to be a man j of honor and bis scruples of conscience are respected but nevertheless the be bests of king mob must be obeyed mr legg alleged that being a sworn officer of the united states government he could not deliver the letter to j any one except the person to whom it was addressed or his agent withont a violation of his oath but his excuse would not suffice and he was sent to jail he subsequently however thought better of the matter and entered into the required security for his appearance in court with the letter we j presume he will plead before the court the illegality of the bond as a releasei from its condi ions and certainly an american court of justice will not insist upon their fulfilment the law has already been violated by the mob it remains to be seen whether the constituted authorities of south caroli i n a sanction what has been done the poet master did in the first in i stance what every men of honor and sense would fool to be his doty if placed in like circumstances the law is so plain that a fool may run and read and yet the washington union and other unscrupulous locofoco sheets are arraigning mr collamer and the adi ministnations because they have not to exercim a dispensing power over the i laws and constitution of the united tmm the baaanees of this dema ifofaiml aftwi ute t a wii u so e rochester n y friday october ibr tion cannot failto be appreciated by southern men there is no power in tha president or his cabinet to withhold a letter from i the humblest citizen without coramit f ting the crime of perjury as to letters addressed to slaves they are noti citizens and the owner can forbid any sort of intercousse with them in fact f they have no surname by which one may be distinguished from anotherand a postmaster is not bound to know one slave from another they being in the eye of law not persons but property such is the estimation in which they are held by the state laws after all there is less danger from tha sissalsliiis rf such documents through the mails than is geaerally imagined in the first place the slaves are unable to read and if white men are base enough to read such documents to them they would operate more effectually by talkiug with them as a proof of the correctness of this view it may be remarked that in maryland j and kentucky where the opportunities of the abolitionists for disseminating their views are of daily occurence the idea of insurrection is never dreamed of while iu south carolina and some of the south western states where no such opportunities exist for intercourse with the slaves the public mind is in a constant state of apprehension and excitement the slate trade in brazil corre pendent of the tribune bahia june h greeley esq i write this to give you some information of the slave trade which is carried on here extensively from the coast of africa the first thing done is to send a vessel with a cargo of goods suited to the trade apparently entirely unconnected with anything elseand really so as far as bringing slaves away in her is concerned this is done to prevent the loss of vessel and cargo if boarded by a manofwar and made a prize of if anything be found on board to identify f the vessel as a slaver the capital being thus placed where it is wanted the vessel returns in ballast or with what little cargo can be procured the slavedealers in africa with the goods thus placed in their hands buy up tbe black diamonds as they term them and keep them imprisoned until they get a chance to ship them in the swiftsailing small schooners and brigs which leave here in ballast for that purpose on arriving here they land them on an island opposite to this place about four or five mifmsiflcnt dt the cther side of the bay of all saints on which this city is situated the price paid for bringing slaves varies from o to o for every one taken on board and to lo additional for every one safely landed we heard of two arrivals of slavers last week with slavesone little felucca of less than tuns brought and landed them and asmall brig not half full they say brought and landed them also we hear that the balti moreanbuilt pilot boat henry clay is now gone on her eleventh vayage to the coast of africa for slaves in the four years she has been owned here and that she has made in that time oyer for her owners while such profits are realized doubtless men will be found base enough to run the hazard of being taken as no punishment followsthe loss of the vessel and cargo being the only penalty it is said that some or vessels are engaged in the business from this place alone and probably four times as many more from different ports of this very extensive empire though at present the market is overstocked with slaves and the price less than usual and consequently the trade is not as active as common the goods sent out jwith which the slaves are bought are all of english manufacture and consist principally of of guns pistols swords powder and ball rum c fit instruments to perpetuate such a trade formerly by treaty with great biitain france and the united states brazilian vessels engaged in the trade were lawful prizes but that treaty expired some two years since and now it the english take them it is not in consequence of any right except the right of strength and humanity the government of brazil do not exactly legalize the trade though they take no measures to prevent it there are now lying in this harbor ia frigate sloopofwar and several small government vessels and yet vessels are daily arriving and departing known and publicly talked of as engaged in the business it is said that the english with all their professions of philanthropy do not by their actions j give credit to their great pretensions to humanity that it is a fact that in onj or more instances slaves taken on thisi coast have been taken into rio dei janeiro and the slaves mpprtnhted ovi i fo r a term of years at so many pounds j per bead and that tbe apprentices are sure to be only blacks that are reported as dying while one is left this is naturally one of the finest countries in the world producing with the least possible labor all the productions of tropical countries in tbe hands of an industrious and energetic moplc irlobe the climate is said to be and lpeir bmhby ul m i coun tnes labor ia here disreputable and any ither way of procuring a living supposed to be more respectable for freemen thank heaven such ions are not prevalent in our part of the world and sincerely hope they may not long influence any part of our ii union with stneera ragarda yours fre w m john p hale on slaveev this emioent champion of the cense of free soil says the providence transcript who has persevered and triumphed over the combined forces of and democrats in new hampshire the ligament of whose union was a blind subserviency to southern dictation has witten a let tter declining to attend a mass convention in norwich vt a portion of which we extract be j low it reiterates a truth that we have stated to our readers that slaves are being carried into the territory which we acquired from mexico and this truth should unite the free soil in a still closer union and give new impulse to their efforts in the cause of freedom j the extract reads thus the present is a dangerous crisis there is danger great and imminent danger that slavery will be introduced i and ultimately established by law in california and new mexico to avert the calamity so serious to every friend of humanity requires the united and energetic effort of all those who would avert from our country the reproach which would most assuredly follow such an event it will not avail to shut our eyes to the existence of this dauger and attempt to deceive ourselves with the idea that it does not exist it does exist it is even now close upon us and while the interested and the venal are lulling us with the syren song that there is no danger slaves are being carried into those territories the clanking of whose chains and the cries of whose agony shall fill the ear of the most high calling for vengeance upon us if through timidity party spirit or any other cause we hold our peace and do not do what we may to prevent so great a wrong from the foundation of the government up to the passage of the oregon bill in slavery has j with hardly an exception triumphed in every issue which she has raised she has made war and peace passed and repealed tariffs moulded our legislation controlled our diplomacy and made the operation of the whole machinery of the government subsidiary to her interests the whig and democratic parties as they have been heretofore organized have been as bondservants to slavery the ferocity of the attack which the organs of the old hunker proslavery democracy are making upon the present administration seems to originate in the fear that j the whigs by their course in the last presidential campaign have done better service to slavery than they with j all their servility in years past have j been able to render ssewryliai nevt eryet with the exception of the oregon bill met with a defeat in any measure which she has seriously urged that partial defeat seems only to enrage the slave power and excite it to greater efforts in the great struggle which she is now making these efforts must be met by corresponding efforts on the part of the friends of freedom the crisis is near the day and the hour are at hand may god grant that the men for the day and the hour may not be wanting  farther encroachments of i slavery when placing together a few weeks ago several incidents illustrative of the tendency of slavery to encroach upon the rights of northern freemen we had no idea that the most flagrant illustration was yet to be given but such is the case the charleston mercury of august th contains the official proceedings of two meetings of the citizens of st peters parish south carolina held at lawtonville the first on the bih of february wand the second on the th of august the object of the first meeting is stated to have been to take into consideration the fact that rev wm h brisbane m d is in this section of country and to devise some plan by which to rid ourselves of so unprincipled a personage at this meeting which was presided over by hon j d johnson a committee of five including hon h smart was appointed to draft resolutions among which was one declaring that forbearance on account of dr brisbanes numerous and highly respectable connections must have a limit the farther proceedings are thus recorded by the mercury about four years sioce he visited this section of country and after his return north gave a garbled and false statement of his sojourn here endea voting to make capital for himself by recounting the great personal risks he encountered in appearing among us when unfortunately for ourselves he was permitted to remain and depart unmolested sfter having settled his personal aad private business having made no public demonstration of himself or his abolition principles but i during his present sojourn be has had the audacity to show himself in one of oar palpits there alluding to his estrangement from his native place not being the result of choice but of necessity a necessity brought about by the force of conscience then insulting us with the prayer that universal liberty might soon prevail in consideration of these facts and regarding him as we do to be an enemy to bis country n traitor to the south and particularly dangerous to this section where be has the sympathy of the slaves having liberated a part of bini own bam we think he should not be i permitted to rest among ns therefore be it resolved that a committee of three wait on rev wra r h brisbane m d instanter and warn him to leave the state u forty sight hours or abide the cotmoquencet from a hitherto patient but mm iadig resolved that if the coaunittei find mr brisbane unwilling to depart that they wait upon the chairman anti secretary who are charged with disseminating the information so as to call the people together at an early day of course dr brisbane hearing of the above proceedings fled from his native state to save his life one of his relatives dr t d mathews ventured at the time to say a few words in behalf of mr brisbane and subsequently wrote to him giving some account of the meeting hence a second meeting was called on the th ult which dr mathews attended and at which he was accused of having prepared an account of the former meeting and sent it for publication to the north the doctor defended himself by asserting that more had been printed at the north than he bad written that he was of revolutionary blood and was never an abolitionist but scorned and detested them through this means he escaped lynching with i out flight the facts in this case give one an idea of the character of slave ry and of that liberty which northern freemen enjoy in the slavehoiding states sabbath recorder a conscientious manit is refreshing now and then to hear of the reforming effects of conscience on mens conduct we never hear of a case of money anonymously returned or property restored but that wc feel better for it and entertain a higher opinion of mankind it is not often however that we can record a case of conscience so natural and we suspect frequent as the following the nr tie subjects of such scruples mod stt referring to keep their good ictos to themselves by the constitution of mississippi in days past it was forbidden to bring slaves into the state tor sale but like most other constitutional provisions this was construed as our supreme court has declared that all constitutions should be according to the wants interests and convenience of the people for whom they are formed that is it was generally disregarded a slave trader named jones from virginia brought into mississippi for ale some forty likely slaves and cotton being fifteen cents a pound he found for them a ready market in fact they were all purchased by one gentleman who delighted in the name ot brown by the terms of the sale brown paid onefourth cash and was to pay the balance in instalments of one fourth yearly sortty after the purchase mr brown was elected a justice ofthe peace and discharged the duties of the station with commendable intelligence and uprightnessthe year passed off and jones drew a draft on j his vendee for the installment due which was protested he immediately pflid a visit to his debtor whereupon the following dialogue took place joneswell mr brown you didnot meet my draft brownno jonesbut i suppose you can pay me the money due on the slaves now brownlndeed i cannot jonepwhy have you met with any losses or misfortunes that you are unable to pay brownno my affairs were nevermore flourishing i made an excellent crop last year aud have every prospect of a good one this and the price of cotton is still going up but i dont think ought to pay you jonesfor what reason are not the negroes good have you any fault to find with them brownoh no they are as likely a lot as ever was sold and worth much more than i agreed to give for them but the fact is things are different now from what they were then when i bought them i was pretty much the same as my neighbors and didnt care much for the constitution and the law but since i have been elected a justice of the peace and have taken a solemn oath to support the constitution which forbids slaves being bought and sold in the state the transaction between you and me was contrary to this plain article and i cant without violating my oath carry the matter any further cant conscientiously be s party to an unlawful act which i would be by paying you for the negroes you had no right to sell regard for mj oath and duty to my country alike for j bid it joneswell damn me if you are not the greatest fool or the datndesi scoundrel in existence if your cursed conscience wontt let you pay me give j me back my negroes brownmr jones there is no use of harsh words and though grieved at the violence of your expressions i forgive you as to returning the negroes cant think of it you would go and and sell them to some one else in violation of the constitution which i am sworn to support and i would by put j ung it m your power to do so be equal tly guilty with yourself i cannot bejan accomplice in such a transaction mr jones what honest man could no never this was too much for jooes bist fury overcome him and we are sorry to say that he snocked squire brown down but the squire was an athletic i man and in the fight that followed i jones was conquered with much dam i age to hti right eye and the loan of apart of his nose finding no saiiefoc  non from taking the law into bis own hands he applied to the courts for be recovery of his

on wednesday evening last an important important meeting wu held at the leeturehall croydon for the purpooe of publicly receiving and hearing the atatemeot of that intrepid loof ameitc freedom mr william well brown the numerous advocate of antislavery principle in croydon having heard of mrbrown arrival in england from america where it i well known he haa labored with the mot itgnal success for the delivery of hie brethren in honda determined them somewhat appropriately to invite him to make hia brat public appearance in thia country in a town so celebrated for it antislavery zeal they moreover resolved to solicit the attendance upon the occasion of that eminent champion of emancipation george thompson keq m p mr brown having concluded hr mission as delegate from his colored brethren in the united states to the late peace congress at paris where he most powerfully exposed the desolating influence of the war principle practised by the professed followers of the prince of peafe upon the condition temporal and spiritual of three million of his brethren in the republic of america determined to comply with the a hove request and to commence at croydon an extended antislavery tour which at the entreaty of the friends of freedom thronghoui the kingdom he purposes to undertake in the principal towns of england ireland and scot land long before the time of meeting the lec turehail was well fi led with a lughlymflu ential and attentive auditory including i morland esq of heathlodge who was called upon to preside g thompson esq m p mr w w brown the rev w campbell d j r sterry esq peter bedford esq till esq crafter eq squier esq the chairman in opening the proceedings stated that the principal object of the meeting was to hail the arrival in england and to introduce to the notice of the british abolitionists mr william wells brown who had escaped from slavery in the state of missouri and had come to mis country with high testimonials from those vaiious bodies in the united states who were seeking the emancipation of the american slaves mr browns desire was to lay befote the british public some account of the present position and future prospects of the oaue of abolition on the other sole of the atlantic hear mr g thompson also stated that mr brow n had been deputed at a meeting of the colored inhabitants of the city of boston to attend the late peace congress in pans that gentlemen enjoyed the foil confidence and approbation of all the parlies in ameiica who were earnestly seeking the extinction of slavery throughout ihe great american republic he had for somewhat more than five years labored unceasingly in the cause of his enslaved brethrena cause most dear to him inasmuch not only as himself an escaped slave hut from the fart of his having at that tone a mother throe brothersand one sister still in slavery in america although he knew not where they were ocated mr brown had come to england fully accredited bearing testimonials of his unimpeachable moral character his most selfdenying attachment to the cause of the brethren he had left beh nd him in bondage and with lie character of aman who had bv his amiable qualities commended himseifi not only to the canfidence but to ihe warn friendship of the friends ol freedom in the united states thus sanctioned by those w hom he had left behind and with one of the best and holiest objects to promote he would no doubt meet from that meeting and the public at large ihe mosl cordial reception and kind attention which in such a cause a stranger was entitled to receive at the hands of a british audience hear mr brown in coining forward was greeted with warm applause which having subsided he said that in coming before a british public as the advocate of the ameriear slave he had nothing to commend himself ir the way of educational attainments having been brought up under the institution of slavery without schooling or the opportunity of obtaining that which every good citizen should possess and be desirous of atiaining education when speaking in america ol the friends of the slave in england every heart that was capable of beating tor freedom leapt for joy there was in the united staten a higher appreciation of the advocacy of the friends of freedom in this country than the themselves probably supposed the people of great britain had already done a great dea for the cause of emancipation in america iet even a small meeting of the friends of ihe slave be held in england and it was immediately published in america and men whi cared nothing about the cause of abolitioi there would talk about such a meeting as a matter of consequence but the people ol this country had not only already accomplished much for the american slave hut tliev had it in their power to effect a great deai morehear let an american slaveholdei he warmly received in any part of europe and ihe whole body immediately rejoice that one of their number had met w ith sueli an honorable reception but let him be received here as every man should be who robbed alarge portion of his countrymen of their liberties and the americans immediately take that reception to heart and it exercises great influence upon them no meeting could beheld in this country no matter for what purpose but especially of a moral and religious characier to which the slaveholders ol america were not anxious to send representatives hear if a worlds evangelical alliance was projected or a worlds temperance convention was held in england slaveiy was sure to lie represented hear if a peace congress was called together in paris slavery was present and why was that because the slaveholders w ished to make slavery appear before the world as good and tolerable a thing as possible among the first persons whom he mr brown saw upon the floor of the pans peace congress were two slaveholders front america who had come over to england in the same steamvessel as himself whether they w ere or w ere not delegates he could not say but they sat among and had the same badge or card of admission as the delegates uid yet it was known to a number of the members of congress that those men were slaveholders hear hear now had those individuals been received in paris as they should have been received consistently with their true charactersas men stealers il would have created a great stir in the united elates had hey been regarded m the same manmr as people would unhesitatingly look upon a horsethief orone who committed highhanded act ol injustice against hi fellow men they would not have dared m remain in that congress but as it was they continued there as any other member until the close of the bitting he mr brown however thanked god that the antislavery cause had made such progress wnhin the last twenty years that if slaveholders were sent over to represent the united states m a worlds evangelical alliance borne gamson would make lit appearance on the outside when the meeting was adjourned and let the friends of freedom throughout europe know that slaveholders had been there and thus they would be prevented accomplishing that w hich they had designed bear hear and cheers if at a great tenijerance convention slaveholders were sent here to represent america some douglass would there make his appearance and create such a stir as would defeat their purposes and if they got up a worldpeace congress some fugitive slave hke himself would break loose from his chains make his appearance upon the platform and let the people know that slavery was sllhu existence in the united stales and that u was not ibai respectable thing m reality which some aiuencan delegates would fain have it appear cheers although an amwto humcit be mr brown recurved mm prgwnioo in england than be abould ttf the untied suita tbt people of england had bill a very faint idaa of what slavery waa they had no doubt many of them heard aad read a g mat deal aboat slavery ia amenea hot bea the friends of freedom came before a british audience they had to pick and eoll from the mam of evidence the least disgusting details which the auditory would be willing to listen to he dare not bring before them the horrors of the slavetrade ia aamti ca or what he himself had witnessed of slavery heir own mural feeling would not allow of the detail or if it would be for one would not be willing to go into those revolting statements but it waa common in europe to aak were not the slaves in america bettei off in their aopply of food and clothing than the poorer classes in europe f he mr brown would not atop to eoquue f whether they were or were not better off as far as food and clothing were concerned he protested against american slavery because it enslaved man and brought the human being down from the high position which god intended him to occupy and placed him upon a lower level than the beast of the field sop pose the slaves in america did in fact get enough to eat and weargrant tt all what conqiensaiion was that for being robbed of every right as men look at the three j millions of slaves in america witness the slavetrade as carried on in the capital of the united sutea in virginia kentucky maryland and those places where slaves w ere raised for the supply of the south i ern market look at the internal slavetrade and then ask whether food and clothing was j any compensation whatever for the deprivation which the slaves underwent he mr drown had not seen a poor man woman or child since he landed upon the british soil who was worse off than the slaves in the united states what was food and clothing to a man as long as he knew that he was a chattel slavethe property of another person what was the utmost amouut of food and clothing to a man when be knew that he might be placed upon an auciionstand sold to flie highest bidder and torn from his wife j and children and everything that was dear to him then look at the mental degradation jof the slave if a man handed a copy of the bible to a slave or taught him to lead the truths it contained he was severely punishable by law why only a few weeks before he mr brown left america a clergyman thought he was doing service by establishing sabbath schools m one of the northern slave states by merely getting a dozen slaves together and teaching them what he conceived to be the principles of christianity and yet that very minister of religion was taken up and received for that christian act thirty lashes upon his bare back under the sanction of the laws of the country hear no no he mr brown would rather bea beggar in england than the best conditioned slave in america cheers jf he were to die of hunger however let him perish at least free without manacles upon his limbs said mr brown have felt the chains upon iny own limbs and have never seen a single moment since escaped from slavery in missouri that i would exchange for the best portions of slavery which i have left behind and yet since made my escape from slavery have had to struggle for existence as i hard as the poorest man in england having come out from under the institution of slavery destitute of education or friends in the coldest winter season without a penny in my pocket j orjany to and yet i had rather grope my way along and try toget my living under the most disadvantageous circumstances i than serve a single moment under the institution that have left behind me cheers it was a principle in the slaveholding states that the negroes must be kept in degradation jin order to be retained in slavery in a clergyman from the north proposed to send a shipload of bibles and missionaries to teach the slaves to read them but he was told that i if be did so he must send with them another i vessel freighted with soldiers muskets and bayonets for the purpose of protecting the planters for if the slaves had education they would not longer be retained in subjection ihear as it wanted nothing but the power of knowledge to liberate them when the i people in this country read of some slave hav i ing been whipped to death or hung with only a sham trial before or three slaveholders they were horrified p and yet these were nothing more than the circumstances naturally incident to slavery instead of vainly seeking to better the condition of the slave let them then seek to knock off the chains from his limbs and not be content with anything short of that the government of the united states was on the side of slavery instead of being the friend of freedom in its very capi tal men could obtain the privilege of buying and selling human beings and of trading inhuman flesh for the sum of dols per annum and in sigh of the capital might be seen negropens and warehouses where men were kept for sale andyefthe men who practised that traffic were the professed followers of the meek and lowly jesus christians in good and regular standing in some of the churches of america hear w ithin the last twenty years the american government had used its influence for the spread of american slavery and even where i it was abolished in mexico it had been reinstated by the united states if a negro made his escape from a slave to a free state and a christian man gave him a crust of bread and a cup o cold water that good man was for that very act subject to a fine of dollars when he mr brown was making his escape he had nothing whatever to eat except a few ears of corn which he plucked by the i way and yet sick and weary as he was ati bst and almost ready to die he dared not ask relief until he saw a quaker come by cheers some of the most heroic attempts had recent ty been made by slaves to obtain their freedom one man to gain his liberty had travelled in a railway carriage upwards of miles packed in a little box breathing oods air only through small gimblet holes j w ere he mr brown about to depict the rue character of american slavery if he could he would pluck a feather from the wing of some fallen angel dip it in the wailings of despair and write upon the blackened walls of perdition in characters which would frighten the hyena out of his ferocity what justice was there in america for the slave a woman was recently tried for causing the neaili of a negro girl she was acquitted on tiie ground that it was her slavewoman who actually committed the deed the slavewo tnsn was afterwards tried and acquitted on he ground tnat she committed the murder on the authority of her mistress hear if a colored man went to washington without free paper he would be thtown into gaol there to remain until he had paid the goal fees if unable to do so he waa sold to raise the amount of such fees and the balance of the produce of sale actually went to swell the treasury of the united states government he mr biown thanked god however that there was an asylum still left for the slave and that the canadas at the present moment wre the land of refuge for more than escaped bondmen cheers nor could he convey to that meeting the feeiiugs which came over him when he landed at liverpool and felt that he was really free then he could indeed adopt the language of the poet and say frl en mud old en bld bwsd and

be spoke the highest among the peers and prelates of england a majority in both houses of parliament and all the great commercial interests in the country were opposed to abditioe yet when the nation or nations became coligh tened aroused and in earnest the great moan ure was carried and the year of jubilee was proclaimed throughout the islands of the west the trreeiatahle mandate was promulgated

behold the glories of a brighter age unfold friend of the outcast view the accomnlised plan the negro towering to the height of man for justice leagued with mercy from above shall reign in all tli liberty of love and the sweet shores beneath the balmy west again shall be the islands of the blest he mr thompson would call upon all the fnends of humanity to rejoice over the great victory let them not heed the sordid croakings of those worse than egyptian taskmasters who had no standard by which to measure the prosperity of a west india island but the number of cotton bales or sugar hogsheads or rum barrels exported on their own exclusive profit perish if it must be sothe sweets of the cane and the prosperity of the tyrant plantergive us in their place woman rescuedfrom the lashthe curse removedjfrom unborn millionsour nation delivered from guiltand god acknowledged as the only rightful proprietor of the mysterious and immortal being whom he had stamped with his own image and created for his own glory loud cheers but there was no cause forfear it was not necessary that man should be degradedthat he should be yoked with the brute and fettered to the soil that we should have sugar cotton or rumthere were higher motives than the scourge to induce men to labor and when tyrants and slaves no more the earth should see the cotton field and the cane brake would bloom and wave as beautifully and as abundantly as the rich harvest which god in bis goodness had granted to this country or the indian cornfields of new england tilled by the free and thriving sons of those who stepped ftom the deck of the mayflower upon plymouth rock great applause he mr thompsonwas delighted to be present because it afforded him the opportunity of joining those around him in extending a iraterr al an english anda christian welcome on his first appearance to the friend and brother before them william wells brown it was on his account and for his sake solely he mr thompson had visited croydon the person who had addressed the meeting was a stranger but he came with good credentials and was therefor welootno he need feel himself a stranger no longet he would every where find i those who would esteem it a privilege to cherish him and speed him on his way he was an american and therefere doubly welcome he mr thompson would have every american not a supporter of the horrible system of slavery treated with the utmost hospitality and kindness that so the bonds of love and friendship might be drawn closer and closer still between those whose altar whose language whose literature whose interests whose mission and destinies were one cheers mr brown was an american abolitionist of the right stamp snd as such would i not only be hailed as a friend and a guest but united with as a fellow laborer in the cause of universal freedom and he would i find many who would be rejoiced to strengthen bis hands and those of that most worthy and courageous band who were waging a sublime moral war with oppression under the flag which twenty years ago had been unfurled by the undaunted garrison and ever i since w ithout a stain and without a reverse had nobly braved the battle and the breeze but the chief reason why the man before us should be welcomed with cordiality and enthusiasm was that he was a colored man anda fugitive from slavery cheers he was in complexion in origin in suffering in sympathy and in proscription the bona fide representative of three millions of men in chains and of tens of thousands more held downby the manacles of a hated and inhuman prejudice against color his recognition that night therefore was not a mere welcome extended by that assembly to an individual but a recogntiion by those who represented fairly and truly the sentiments and feelings of great britain of one who was the representative ol the enslaved and the downtrod en in all america lei william brown accept it as such and believe that in taking his hand as that of a brother and an equal we take the hand of every colored man including the meanest and the most despised found within or without the realms of slavery in the united states cheers in this welcome there was no condescension on the part ol those who gave it the injunction was to honor all men the slaves were men the most z effaced and larciated amongst them was a man measured by his capacity for suffering for enjoyment ay and for depte datumtested either by his virtues or hia vicesanalyzed by the faculties of hia soul by the dread responsibilities from which he could not escape by the pries paid for hii redemption by the heaven for which he waa eligible and by the eternity of suffering at enjoyment that awaited himhe was a mao the equal of the president of the united stales the equal of the monarch of england and the equal in his essential elements of the most gifted being who ever dazzled the worl d by the effulgence of his genius cheers mr thompson alter enlarging on the character of american slavery and making an earnest appeal to the audience to coounoe their efforts in the antislavery cause by refertng to the career of mr brown in the united states and to the many which had

resolved that by all our love of truth and mercy of god and man we be aeech our fellow citizens of every part of this nation to aubecribe the following petition and to keep on subscribing it until the aggregate of the petitioners be hundreds of thous ands to the congrese of the united state we call your attention to some of the atrocious wrongs and stupendous frauds done in the district of columbia and by all that is eracious and sacred in the rights of man andy all that is commanding and fearful in the authority of god we ask you to put an end to these wrongs and frauds ist daniel drayton and sayte are in prison in the district of columbia and they are to be kept there until they shall have done the impossible thing of paying the amount of the fines so cruelly and wickedly imposed upon them this is their doom because in the first place there were found in the vessel which they navigated seventy four of their wretched fellowbeings who weie seeking to escape fiom slaverythis a their doom because in the second place their judges adopting the shameful and monstrous falsehood that slavery has a legal existence in the district of columbia a legal existence under our antislavery national constitution transmuted the merit of these two men into a crimetheir rare merit into ahigh crime with these judges who are guilty of being the servants of pirates and ol installing in the place of righteous and holy law the assumptions of lawless piracy what leas should be done than to impeach them what less indeed should be done with any united slates judge who is guilty of admitting in his official capacity the legs existence of slavery d the present secretary of state is guilty of prostituting his high office to the service of the siavehnlding interest his refusal to grant a passport or protection to heory hambleton a colored person was based distinctly and solely on the ground of mr ham bletons complexionls not congress bouurj to provide effectually against the repetition of this scandalous offence d the present marshal of the districl of columbia is another instance of the abuse of official power which calls loudly for the action of congress he too makes righu turn upon complexion and he goes so fai in this direction as to imprison and otherwise outrage colored persons who if they were but white persons would be entirely unmolested by him this charge is fully justified by his recent crime against edward brooks th there are persons even thousands ol them in the district of columbia who are actually held as slaves and they are claimed to be so held under the laws of congres we surely need not say that there are nr laws of congress authoiizing slavery ii slavery can be legalized by any authority it nevertheless cannot be by a legislature whose powers are bounded by the antislavery constitution of the united stateshow absurd the supposition that congress can establish slavery at westpoint or wherever it has a fort or arsenal and yet if congress have power to establish slavery in the district of columbia it has power to establish it wherever congie has exclusive jurisdiction we respectfully submit whether congress inasmuch as there is a wide spread deiusiun that it has power to create and legalize slave ty should not hasten to declare that it has noi such power but whatever may be expedient on this point there can be no reasonable doubt that congress is bound to put an immediate end to slavery in the district of columbia and to guard against its recurrence jy the terrors of the highest densities the north star rochester october oar late an lislaverr tour while on the wing travelling from place to place by day and speaking by night i could give my readers only a dry statement of facts connected with my meetings accompanied with an occasional remark respecting the late antislavery fairs i now fee that a word is de as to the state of the lecturing field from the experience of the last four weeks and the general aspect of the public mind in this region am satisfied there never was a tune that afforded a better opportunity of doing good by antislavery lectures than now the field may be properly said to bewhite for the harvest a general disposition to hear the subject discussed is manifested in all quartos and i am persuaded that if one or two devoted and earnest laborers coaid be secured to lecture in the field they would not only greatly advance the common cause bat secure the prompt aid aod warm sympathy of great numbers of the abolitionists the bitter opposition with which the gatrisou abolitionists were once mat in this quarter has mostly subsided since those from whom it formally came have for the morn part so eompletaly fallen from antislavery grace and have accommodated

preparations had been nude i was therefore compelled either to leave tbe place witbeat abearing or to seek a boose aod proclaim the notice myself tbe time was short tbe sun waa nearly down and i loand i must do what was to be dose quickly i therefore immediately called on mr ogden a member and trustee of the methodist episcopal church in the hope of obtaining the use of the methodist house for the meeting i soon found that he had but little sympathy with the slave instead of replying at once to my application be engined axe you one of those that speak dyritnt tw church i answered i am one of those that speak against a proslavery chnrch said be you evade my question do you condemn the churches of the north i answered yes if they hold fellowship with slaveholders well said he i am not in favor of letting anyone into the church who will abuse it he added however that if all the rest were willing he would have no objections i next enquired who the rest were but from this pious defender of the church no answer was returned i reminded him that il his church were built upon the rock and ij he believed it to be so built he could have no ground to fear that anything i might be able to say could have the power to injure it and cited that scripture which states that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it but this was to no purpose since the man wat probably conscious that his church could not pretend to be the one described in this passage i here turned my back upon the man and hit church finding no sympathy with either and i applied at beagles hotel for the use oj his ball room which was readily granted to me thus it is and thus it has ever been the cause of lod is received more gladly by the world than by a corrupt and hoilow church shut out from the house of prayer it takec shelter in a ball room and may it not yet be said as of old which is nearer to thekingdonc of heaven the pharisee or the publican after securing the room i borrowed a large dinner bell from the tavern and proceeding through the village proclaimed my owe meeting this is the third or fourth time that i have been compelled either to adopi this measure or to be defeated in my purpose to speak to the people and lam resolved it pursue this course whenever am persuader that the occasion requires it for gonhin would please proslavery priests and politicians more than to silence the antislavery advocate by excluding him from their meetinghouses and by refusing to give publicity tc his meetings they shall not have thii pleasure although i confess it costs roe something to be under the necessity of resorting to this novel mode of procedure the meeting in the evening although noi large was attentive and i had an opportunity of making known to the people of the place t few of the reasons why the methodist churcl and other churches so closely guarded theii doors against the approach of antislavery ad vocate the ministers and officers of these churches know full well that tbe action of the church i has been on the side of slavery and they further understand that a faithful exposure ol that action would materially lower those organizations in tbe estimation of a candid public it is from no motive of shielding any principle nor of protecting any righteous organization from assault that they oppose the admissioa of antislavery men iute their meetinghouses but they do this with a view to cloak the wickedness of their siaveholding position for such christians we have but the same respect that we entertain for the ancient scribes and pharisees which they so much

decidedly prefer philadelphia as the place of our first meeting it is there that the idea of the league meets the warmest approbation it is there that the largest colored population reside it is there that the north star receives the most cordial support it was there tbe great american antislavery society was organized which has shaken the land from end to end and it is there we would have the

that opinion unreserved and unrestrained having traversed the length and breadth oi your state during five months of the last year i acquired a tolerable knowledge of the condition and resources of our brethren ol ohio and their probability of auceese in the event of such an issue the colored population of the state is now using twenty thousand a body of people in all conscience much too great to he without an organ or special advocate making the allowance of one sixth of this number only it gives three thousand three hundred and thirtythree families who should be sufficiently adequate to the sustenance of any single newspaper theae families it must be admitted are generally well to dobeing industrious they are mostly property holders many of whom are farmers and mechanics and oonaequently men and women of means and money but there is another consideration in norms community in the state is there a tbous nd of a population of colored people save cincinnati and columbus the former of which is rising five thousand and the latter me again to ensure the success of a newspaper two things arc necessarya reading and a business community the first to ensure subscriptions and the other support by advertisements these are what give life to and ensure the existence of the various public journals of the country except the reformatory which are always a drag and burden to their conductors drooping through a period of beggarly existence coming at last to a pitiable end such a result should be henceforth studiously avoided by us in every enterprise having ever occupied a beggarly position and god knows only regarded ashe objects of pity in any given number of colored families where the heads consist of elderly persons here is always a ratio of two thirds who tannot read leaving but one third but a kirtion of whom are in circumstances that will justify them in supporting a paper but a faction of which portion again may be wiling allowing all reasonable excuses and ob ections so common among our people this slimate will hold good particularly among he three thousand families in ohio cincinnati being an exception as the greater part are immigrants from different parts of the south three thousand families remotely scattered jver the state with no one community suffi sient to sustain such a project with all their various misconceptions and prejudicespre dilections and biases imbibed and instilled in the south and the difficulty in obtaining suitable agents to secure subscribers and collect money sufficient to sustain the enterprise renders the undertaking at once so difficult that it looks in the distance to be insurmountable and having had seven years experience in editing and conducting newspapers and an ixtensive acquaintance among our people with their situation condition and otherwise in other places as well as ohio i unhesitatingly expreas my doubt of the ultimate success of the project believing that it would end with great losses to the undertakers and in its failure produce consequences that would give much cause for future regret there are at present two or more newsi papers in existence published by colored men devoted to the cause of our people all of which are merely dogging at the threshold of loubta and fearsasking aid at the gateway et impatient benevolence their conductors depending upon personal friends to whom they are almost compelled from necessity to rater and pander for their scanty means of lubsistence if one or two papers cannot be fustained surely an additional number must make the prospects slid the less and in my tumble opinion i should much prefer that we would suppoit one good paper ably and pro ery conducted adapted to our demands wants and condition than to have several iu sxistence barely floating with exhausted wings upon theebbingtide and worn out patience of philanthropygouging to tbe vitals rad abstracting the very lifeblood of the rharity of the public and community in which hey exist have sir other and personal objections to entenng into such an enterprise i have never been sufficiently successful in the cause jf our brethren to have s value set upon my fforts i have labored for nought and revived nothing if i except the use of fifty lollais borrowed from a donation of one hundred dollars presented by the ladies fair to tbe north star which sum i have still to pay the present of a sum of ten dollars and various articles of clothing for myself and wife and little children during my stay in philadelphia last winter by several excellent colored ladies is mors than i ever before re alised during seven years labor as editor of jifierent papers the last eighteen months of uruicfa time were devoted entirely to the cause i am fully persuaded that

earnestly desire to solicit your aid and cooperation in the good antislavery cause and we would plead with you more especially for assistance on behalf of the western new york antislavery society one of the objects of this society is to help to susiain the north star newspaper which is we believe one of the best antislavery instrumentalities now in operation the annual antislavery fair will he held at rochester towards the close of the year and a series of antislavery fairs are now being held in the towns and villages of western new york consequently there is an unusual demand for useful and fancy articles we earnestly entreat our british friends to send us renewed help in the way of contributions to our london friends and to those living n birmingham coventry leicester leeds sunderland and bristol we would sugge that they forward their contributions by the third week in october to miss carpenter of bristol who has this year kindly consented to forward the london box to the frieods in carlisle and manchester who sent boxes to rochester last year we renew our appeal hoping and believing that they will continue to give us their aid and we trust that the frieods in

in a utuie notice an appeal ta behalf of the western new york antislavery fair earnestly desiring the abolition of slavery in this land and being deeply convinced that this result can only be accomplished by renewed efforts to change our present corrupt moral sentiment the undersigned members and friends of the western new york antislavery society again make their appeal to the friends of the slave in behalf of their annual bazaar which will be held in rochester in december next while we have been cheered and gladdened by the progress already made and the good alteady done and while we rejoice to observe that friends have been raised up to plead the cause of the bondman among persons and in quarters where we had least expected theta we still see the harvest to be great and the laborers to be few and instead of relaxing out efforts we are impressed with a sense of the duty of doubling our diligence and applying more closely our energy to the means of advancing this holy causewe appeal the more boldly to our friends because those for whom we plead cannot plead for themselves while we are surrounded by our domestic circle with none to molest or make us afraid there are three millions of men and women in our own land doomed to abject slavery and chains robbed of every rightcivilsocial personal and political remembering those in bonds as bound with them we desire to plead their cause as though they were on our own limbs and the knotted lash were applied to our own backs while to obtain means for enlightening the public mind is the strong motive for holding our arnual fair it is not the only one agreat amount of good may be traced directly j to such occasions many who are now active workers in behalf of this holy movement became first interested in it through the instrumentality of those annua exhibitions of antislavery industry tact and bkill j the present object of the richeater antislavery bazaar is for the general enlightenment of the public mind on the subject of slavery recognizing the north star published in this city as an efficient antislavery ill strumentality we propose that the funds raised j by the sale of articles at the bazaar on behalf of whieh we here appeal shall be maiuly appropriated to the support of that important paper we gatefuily acknowledge the prompt assistance rendered to oar last fair by our friends and coadjutors in various parte of our own state wisconsin and michigan and we earnestly solicit their continued cooperation with us in the good woik that no tune maybe loot we especially recommend to them tbe immediate formation of sewing circles in their various towns with a view to making strides for the rochester bazaar we would also in this connection render our heartfelt thanks to our british friends for the valnabte aid extended by them to our last years fair and we would again warmly olicu their generooa i assistance it is due to our transatlantic friends to sav that for much of tbe interest felt in our last bazaar we were indebted to them and we are persuaded that their continued cooperation will essentially promote tbe aoe eess of our approaching december bazaar and the advancement of the cause of the slave in our land we hope that the foregoing appeal will commend itself to out philanthropic friends on both aides of the atlantic and that they will cordially unite

bissette of martinique twentyfive yew ago there lived at st pierre in the island of martinique a young man of color named bissette he was noted for bis intelligence and worth and exercised no small degree of influence among the free blacks ot i the island about this time a pampb i let on tbe condition of the people of color in tbe french colonies was printed in paris and copies of it were sent to martinique and guadaloupe on the th of tbe th month one mer ando an agent of tbe procureur du roi for martinique looking through tbe jalousie window of bissette saw copies of this pamphlet on his table he hastened to the procureur and on his report that functionary repaired to tbe house of bissette whom he arrested on the charge of conspiracy to overthrow the colonial government the discovery of two copies of the obnoxious pamphlet in bissette a house and ol several others in the bands ol free colored men was deemed ample ground for charging the principal and leading men of color with the design of rising against the whiles some two hundred were arrested and banished from the island some were sent to the burning deserts ot senegal while others were allowed to go to i ranee bissette was sentenced to the punishment of branding and hard labor for life the sentence was commuted to banishment for life by the tribunal of port royal the procureur entered an appeal from this judgment as did also bissette and his lellow prisoners the king had in the mean time appointed a new procureur who was already on his passage out when the acting procureur contrary to rule and justice insisted upon pressing the appeal the trial was a burlesque on judicial proceedure the accused were neither allowed to produce evidence in their defence nor to avail themselves of the aid oflegal counsellors and defenders the court sat with closed doors bissette was declared guilty ot distributing seditious pamphlets and the original sentence was reaffirmed the governor made strenuous efforts j for a delay in the execution of the sentence but they proved unavailing against the prejudices and fears of the white planters the horrible punishment of branding with a hot iron was inflicted upon bissette and his friends volay and fabien they were then sent to guadaloupe without being peri milted to see their wives and children lrom whom they had been separated ji tor three years the energetic spirit i of bissette devised the means of bring jing their case before the court of cas i sation at paris here the colonial decision was reversed and they were set jat liberty bissette who like oge of st domingo had commenced his public life as the advocate only of the rights of free men of color had learned during j three years of suffering that his own class could not be safe from the suspicions prejudices and insults of the whiles so long as the latter continued to hold his brethren by birth and comi plexion as slaves he felt that the men of color bond and free were united in a common destiny acting upon this conviction he began the work of agitation in the french capital in be i half of emancipation in the colonies he established a periodical devoted toi the subject wherein he exposed the

the late election in tenaesaea a specimen of which has appeared in our columns crrixxns after an absence of twentyfire years it ia impossible to be more happy than am on finding myself in the ntidnt of compatriots whom i love and who are for so many reasons dear to mei am not tha leas moved by j our fraternal welcome accept the tei mony of my warmest thanks and grati tude certainly i had thought i could anticipate the eagerness which would have brought before me those friends with whom i have been for many long year in communion of ideas and sentiments but this slmosl unanimous concurrence of the inhabitants of your city surpasses my utmost expectation and if i am oveijoyed at this and feel honored i do not deceive myself neither do i labor under an illusion as to the value of this manifestation of your sympathies too well know what am worth not to understand that it is not my personal merit which you recompense at this moment by this kind of ovation you come to give your adhesion here to those words of peace union concord and conciliation which proceeded from my mouth and which preceded me to this colony aa the expression of a common sentiment you come to bear testimony that i was but the organ the faithful interpreter of your wishes and that we ardently desire the union of the generous spirits of all parties as the sole pledge of the prosperity of our dear martinique it is thus citizens and countrymen that i account to myself for the flattering reception of which i am the object let us therefore consent to a mutual oblivion of the past and cast away unhappy divisions old prejudices of a bygone day and recriminations which can never promote the welfare of parties still less the happiness of the country which should reign over and tranquilize all passions as to those sufferings to which you have made allusions they were never very painful to me for even at the depth of my dungeon they long since formed for me an habituated chain of which i never felt the weight they were the inevitable consequence of our social regeneration vive la republique no doubt whatever is expressed of his triumphant reelection to the national assembly of his ability and integrity in the discharge of the duty thereby imposed on him his constituents have ample guaranty in his past life and character a night under an avalanche there was in the interior native of aosta who meant to leave us at mar tigny for the purpose of traversing the great st bernard at the exaggerated dangers of which pass he laughed very heartily accidents he admitted did sometimes overtake travellers in that part of the alps but generally he said the pass of the st bernard was open and safe throughout the year except during the continuance of snowstorms he had himself a few years previously in another pass the name of which i forget been overtaken by one of these in company with an english family returning froiq italy and been witness of the way in which the element sometimes perforins th office of sexton they set out early tin the morning and arrived a little before nightfall at a part of the pass which owing to the driving of the winds is easily choked up the snow hhd begun to fall about an hour and a half previously and was now pouring down the ravine before the blast blinding both horses and postilions and bringing along with it premature night they had hoped to reach the summit before darkness set in but the horses furnished them were weak and the snow for the last hour at least had greatly retarded their progress how he came to be in the englishmans carriage he did not explain i fancy our countryman had invited him out of sheer politeness the party consisted of five in all the husband and wife the italian the nurse and the little baby how it comes to pass i know not but it generally happens that the english when overtaken by danger display qualities which astonish fereigners on the occasion in question all the solicitude of the husband seemed to be concentrated in the wife while all hers was in the baby self seemed equally absent in the mindbofboth the nurse for her part displayed the utmost stoicism except that as the cold increased and the snow drifts beat more and more furiously against i he carriage windows she pressed the child more closely to the breast and protected it from the influence of the air with a greater allowance of shawls our friend from aosta who understood thoroughly the perils of the position went on talking with the husband who while his eyes were fixed upon his wife and child appeared calm and collected though from certain thundering noises above it appeared probable that the avalanches were in motion at every ten yards the carriage was stopped by the accumulated snow jane said the husband at length to his wife tie up your throat carefully we may have to walk presently and you nurse make the baby comfortable and give him to me the nurse obeyed and the mother looking anxiously at her child inquired with suppressed earnestness william is there any danger yes a little love just enough to impart an air of romance to our adventure hark f f exclaimed the wife whats that my god cried the nurse the mountain has fallen on us just at that instant a loud shout was heard from the men outside followed by a suppressed struggle and a groan and hen the most complete silence all notion was at tha same time arrested o the carriage and on applying the amp to the carriage window it wae per eived that they were embedded in thick mow what is u ha dona ax laimed the englishman addraamag tun self to our friend from aortt can ur experience suggest any means of ixtricatiiig ourselves from this position f force oar wmy oat da jroa uuk it wwblt cwu nwk nm i shell no aheweredbetbelu i impoeeible all we can do is to rfa i where we ere they will dig u out in the morning and the drivers ob kited the englishman a sudden f thought fleshing across his mind whel i is tobecocse of them they will die ol cold they ere deed already anawered the aostan the first stroke i of the avalanche extinguished life in them whet you heard was their death groan impossible cried our countryman i must force my way out and endeavour to drag them hither the confined space into which the bad to breathe would have rendered il necessary to let down the windows at the risk of admitting a quantity oil snow but all egress was impracticable they were entombed as it were in the avalanche which fortunate for them was soft and spongy permitting air to pass through its pores yet the heat soon became almost insufferable and once during the night the lad fainted travelling carriages in the alps are always well supplied with provisions and restoratives wine brandy i c and as our countryman never once lost his presence of mind everything i practicable was done for wife anc nurse and child what their laaguagt and feelings were may possibly be imi agined ail our friend from aostc i could say was that it was very terrible which be uttered in a tone more signifi i cant thao his words well morning t came at last as they knew by consult f inr their watches but it brought nc light with it and for some time nc f sound at length a confused rumbling i was heard through the snow whicl died away and came again by fits til at length it became evident that it jvai the voices of men after a protractec interval a gleam of daylight entyrec the carriage the snow was cleared partially away and the welcome face of i rustic was beheld peering down upor them their deiiverauce was no speedy and they were conveyed ha dead to a chalet together with the bodies of the driver and postilions surf accidents said our friend are rare i it is to be hoped so exclaimed mad amecarli and what became of the i english lady oh the whole party escaped without injury and next year if saw them pass again into italy so littler had they been daunted by the peril they had escaped tails mag the foot prints of war f it was in the cool of the following morningas full of satisfaction at the approaching end of our journey i was walking in advance ot the camels talk t ing with komeh when i was strurf with the appearance ot an objec by th side of the path which gave me an undefinable sensation of heart sickness and yet at the moment i could not de p cide on what it was it appeared ai first rather like the impress of a humar body in the sand than an actual corpse but on a narrower scrutiny from which r though shudderingl could not withholc i myself it proved to be the remains some one who had there perished the unhappy wretch had either sunk exhausted as he lay or perhaps was deposited in his position by another the former at the time struck us as more probable only the upper part of the k figure remained the flesh was long since consumed and some of the bones were missing but the clothing of the i chest and arms still adhered to the skeleton part bearing marks of being j torn by birds or beasts of prey in the process of getiug at the flesh it shrouded the sand had filled every cavity where once the heart beat out its last j pangs and had matted between and half concealed the bones so that in ap short time these hideous vestiges would be entirely obliterated komeh took r the pipe from his mouth and we endeavored to make out from the remains ing scraps of dress the condition of the unfortunate man so vague were they that i was quite at loss but komeh suddenly stooping to the chest discovered some traces of the embroidered costume of the egyptian soldiery and pronounced and i believe correctly the unfortunate victim to be one ofthat wreck of ibraham pashas armywhich i after the storming of the acre by the englishfled towards egypt in different routes through the desert the recol leciion ofthat terrible retreat when t thousands perished from thirst famine and fatigue as yet fresh in the minds of the bedouins the fall of acre re r sounded through their deserts and impressed an awe and dread ofthe power of the english which will be long ere it pass away here then lay the mouldering remains of some poor fellah from the bank of the nile torn from his native fields and sent in chains to the army cf the egyptian ty tyrant to fight battles in which they had no concern and close a life of slavery in a death of horror and that to fulfil the shifting policy of another and a distant nation the spectacle of this poor wretch was little flattering to ones national vanity to see one of thousands we had been instrumental in thus cutting of counts of our successes in the jornals bartletts forty days in negro suffrageforoursrff we always have believed since we have taken any part or interest in politics that suffrage should be univeral without distinction of color there is no reason why the negro should be denied the privilege ot expressing his approval or disapproval through the ballot box of public men and measureshe has just as good a right to represent l his person or property through the ballot box as mr webb or any other man however white his skin the man of color has just as good a right to be a lawyer if qualified as mr webb he has jiut as good a right to sit on juries or on the bench as mr webb provided always he be qualified the position of free softer we true is well understood and we think mr webb or ny other men will make but little in thes daring free softer a we believe ke people too just too intelligent and patriotic to have their prejudices aroused against us because a simple act ot dlyd proposed right end wrongs no one the mq of color is born with the same right ns the white man god knows no difference neither should constitutions or governments
