gentlemen and citizens of massachusetts if my humble name has ever reached vour ears it is not in consequence of my learning my talents or any distinguished characteristic of my own any further than a humble endeavor to discharge my humble duties although the hearty reception with which i have met since first entered your state has been well calculated to inspire me with confidence in myself it will never lead me to claim any character fame or reputation further than those most humble efforts in that character j appear before you this evening and when i look upon the audience around me and think of the intelligence and learning which is here this evening i can promise you blit one thing and that is that you will go away disappointed i will however attempt to meet your expectations as far as in me lies in my plainand humble manner and in doing so now bespeak your liberal indulgence all of us have our own peculiar characteristics which attach to us on every occasion we have our habits mine have been formed among ihe people of the west we have characteristics of our own some of us are accustomed to address public assemblies and in so doing we have certain customs one ot which is that we speak our thoughts without much reserve and sometimes without much care as to the language we use provided we can be understood another custom is that in the audience every man stands on the same level with the speaker and if anything is left unexplained it is the privilege of anyone in the audience to ask the speaker anything he pleases now if shall say anything tonight which you do not believe if you will call for the testimony on which i base my assertion you will cooler upon me this obligation tiial you ivc me a chance to satisfy you you understand me as intended to he un lerst you represent me tomorrow i wish to be represented and justice is done both to you and ine before i commence any particular train of argument i desire to knowhow my audience are affected towards the great and fundamental principles upon which shall base my whole discourse and in order to do this snail address you as should my friends in the backwoods of the buckeye state exactly come not here to address the democrats the whigs or the liberty men but to see whether you all agree upon our constitutional rights nd if l g a y anything with which you do not agree want you to ay so now be careful for if you find yourn a l ght place by and by shall hold you where you put yourselves i will now lay down my positions and ii there u a man no j jj u i u y e jf q boston where there are some who say wc have a right to abolish slavery in all the states but from them if there is a man who dissents from me let him say so at once at the formation of tl e federal compact when massachusetts sent up her delegate to the convention that framed our constitution and when other delegates from the free states went to that convention it was with the hearty determination to abolish slavery the south refused to fulfil the pledge o and giro p alavery and here w was the question above all others that created difficulty in tb formation o must compact the arrangement wai the north star final made that slavery should be left precisely as il had been under tbe confederation and that the federal government should have no power over tbe institution of slavery that they should iiave no more power to abolish slavery in virginia than to establish it in massachusetts that the rights and privileges of virginia south carolina and massachusetts should be perfectly reciprocal it is now as much opposed to your rights to be involved in the support of slavery as it would be opposed to the rights of south carolina to be involved in its abolition lay this down is a principle and now i come right borne to you you democrats whigs ai d libti mew unite upon his proposition if there is a man srho denies this proposition will he have he kindness to say no no answer j but remember if you go uway and find yourself cramped tomorrow iti this position dont lay it to menow dem ocrats if you agree to this proposition and vote for cass you jo it inconristently and want tell my whig friends if you agree to this proposition and vote for taylor i will say farewell to you as whigs i iguin put the question do you believe hat you have the clear and indisput  ible right under the constitution to he entirely exempt from all participation in he guilt the crime the expense and he disgrace of sustaining the institute n j slavery vcs yes from the audi nce then i take it for granted that all parties excepting those few gentle men referred to agree to this i wish now to lay down one more proposition and that is that if you sufl ier the federal government to involve you in the support of slavery you yourselves surrender and basely surrender your constitutional rights and upon you your children and your childrens children will the responsibility rest i know that the slaveholders interest and feeling and every fibre of his heart and soul are bound up in that institution and if he had the power he would bring you into slavery and scourge you as quick as the black man i do not blame him for this for it is his principle hut if men in massachusetts under the shadow of bunker hill sulfer themselves to be enslaved it is their fault if then you knowing these rights permit yourselves to be led blindfold to the polls to be wheedfcd into the support of any man diametrically opposed to these rights i repeat that the fault and the guilt arc yours i want to know if the commcicjal men of boston ar here for if these commercial men voluntarily go and deposit ther ballots tor a man who is for the extension of slavery so as to give the holder of one hundred slaves in new mexico the same control over the commercial interests of boston with sixty one educated intelligent citizens of massachusettsl was going to say it was moral suicideit is degradation oft ic most damning de i cannot conceive of a baser ii e degradingmore selfsacrificing proposition that could have entered into the heart of man than to place the slaveholder in power over the interests of boston it seems tome as if the people of the united states had not entered into the consideration of the subject i have been a farmer can handle the spade the hoe and the scythe and shall i allow a southern farmer with five slaves to have four times the power with myself when i verily believe before god that i am better than the whole of them i say fellowcitizens that a man who will do that who will thus degrade himself deserves juft what he receives he becomes a himself time would fail ine if i were to recur to what has transpired in years past when your rights have been disregarded your interests sacrificed your honor trampled under foot and the constitution vi dated to render you supporters of slavery allow me to make the single remark that the first treaty ratifnd under the present existing government was a treaty that made you the upholders of slavery and from that day to this the citizens of boston have contributed their dollars and cents their moral purity character and ieputation to uphold that institution the whole histor of the past is the surrender of northern rights and southern encroachments you and i fellowcitizens have submitted to it you will all of you recollect that the florida war in which forty millions of dollars were expendedbloodhounds general taylor and alll do not mean any disrespect to general taylor i do not mean to say any more about him than i can helpthat sutu was paid for the purpose of recapturing and returning to their owners five hundred and fortytwo negroes they went into the swamps and in some instances shot them down because they loved freedom because they gave loose to the feelings which the god of nature had implanted in their breasts and we anation having a written constitution professing to be the only lovers of liberty upon earth this nation waged a war sending our armies there to seize them men women and children and deliver them over to their owners the power and influence of the nation was lent to put down that love of freedom to smother the flame which god had given them and yet you and i sat quietly i dont suppose you knew anything about it didnt look at the coastwise slave trade upon our coast in the tkh congress a report was made in favor of waging a war it was not directly recommended but intimated at a war with great britain unless she would piy to tb slavedralers and slavetraders upon oui coast the value in dollars and cents oi those slaves whichwhen wrecked upon eight is of no sextruth is of no colorgod the father of us all ani all we are brethren british islands became free by british laws when god ia his providence had sent them upon that soil and when by setting their leet upon free soil they i were restored to their natural rights j this committee on foreign affairs madea report favoring the idea that this nation must wage a war to shed their blood and expend their wealth to compel great britain to pay for the bodies j of these slaves on that committee was a representative from massachusetts it would not be parliamentary to call names but it was the gentleman i if i mistake not who on the fourth of july last in the mexican camp nominated gen traylor for the presidency jit was the gallant officer whose only wounds were received when walking one evening with a beautiful signorina a gentleman who i believe was once a democratic candidate for governor of massachusetts my friend intimates to me that he was once a whig representative i was there at that time and he belonged to what was then called the corporals guard of john tyler j that same representative when i in j troduced certain resolutions denying the right of the federal government to involve the federal government in the support of slavery pronounced my resolutions treasonable because dared to assert what there is not now a man in congress nor a jurist in the united states but says it was correct he called if treasonable i say it not at all disrespectfully to him but to induce you to look well to your own rights and to say to the slave power thus far shaft thou go but no farther to maintain the constitution and to stand forth in the dignity of good old massachusetts god bless her when this was advocated in the senate of the united states and john c calhoun that southern intellectual giant introduced a resolution declaring it to be your duty to uphold sustain and perpetuate that coastwise slavetrade where w ere your senators from the free states that voted against it echo answers where there wasshall tell itbut one whig senator from the free states who voted upon that question and that senator voted for the resolution that will do our democratic friends some good but i will tell them another story every democratic senator in congress voted for it the slave power constrained those men thus to degrade themselves and the north ohio senators voted for it ohio citizens were disgraced not a voice in that senate chamber was raised in defence of our rights and our honor i couul starll here till tomorrows sun should risfc citing to you instances in which your constitutional rights have been violated in ways without number and times innumerable but i forbear let us come down a little nearer home who is it that now sustains that traffic in flesb and blood in the district of columbia of the horrors of which you have read so much the last winter do the people of boston the people of massachusetts sustain it is there aman here who is in favor of it if there is let him stand forth and avow it i will tell you one thing everyman there votes against inquiry there are hundreds of thousands who have sent their respectful petitions to congress praying to be exempt from this crime and you cannot make the committee say that the petitions ought to be granted or ought to be refused they are a great deal more dumb than balaams ass you cannot provoke them into speaking upon the subject because a report would affect the election so today your hands are dripping with the blood of those slavesaud at the bar of final account you must answer the unutterable suffering agony and grief which the laws of congress indict wish i could transport you to the car when that man slalter brought back those slaves who had attempted to escape a man who attempted to bid an affectionate farewell to ihe partner of his bosom was knocked down in the car unutterable grief and agony preying upon their very heartstrings were marked upon the faces of the friends around and that was by your law the guilt lies upon you iny friends of massachusetts and ohio and all the free states you are as responsible as the people of the slave states and at the bar of final account the guilt will rest upon you and me unless we atone for our fault by attempting to retrieve the injury we have thus committed now to go back there were certain great issues to be tried in the election of abel p upshur had put forth the new startling important doctrine that the people of the free states were bound to extend slavery into texas to render it firm and to perpetuate it in the slave states of this union now says a whig friend that is democauic doctrine aud i suppose he democrats think so too but that is a doctrine pul forth by a president elected as a whig who called himself a whig as much as gen taylor he was no whig there is no doubt about that to receive the idea that you will extend slavery ia tc overthrow the very elementa of the constitution itself we proclaimed ii such then the whig party declarec that it was unconstitutional inasmuch as it led to a war for the purpose opac quiring foreign territory now let me talk to my democratic friends for i you are red democrats if yours is the democracy of jefferson here is m heart and my band am with you you may think am a strange whig but here is martin van bureano not fought harder against him in that i didand when the proposition wai made to him lie rejected it with discus and contemptand never even lubmittri lit to the senate or called a cabine rochester n y f friday july council upon it it it mr duty as aj public mn wherever i stand to award to that gentleman what ia his just due t to apeak the truth let it fail where it i may i applaud martin van bureo for his deference to the contitution to your rights and to mine he did right and you have no cause to find fault with me for sustaining him when he was ini the right for god knows it was seldom enough that he was ever caught there laughter but he vas right upon this great transcendent issue now brought home upon the people of the nation when in the question was put to bimby a slaveholdiog inem her of congress from mississippi whether he was in favor of the annexation of texas w hen martin van buren wrote that letter declaring himself opposed to the extension of slavery aud the annexation of texas he spoke the sentiments of my heart i then did him justice i then pronounced it to be j correct and now pronounce it to be correct it was in strict keeping with his course in in his letter to mr butler when he called it an infraction upon the constitution to legislate for the extension of slavery he spoke the sentiments of my heart and you have no reason to find fault w ith me for extending to him the right hand of fellowship upon that subject and whoever you are if you sustain the position assumed by martin van buren in in and again in then sir i am with you upon that point and such were the doctrines of henry clay in the lexington observer he declares first that congress has no power over the institution of slavery and secondly that the existence of that institution depends exclusively upon the states in which it is situated which is the very doctrine laid down at the formation of the constitution now to iny liberty friends at boston i wonder if some of those editors are here tonight that opposed me so and berated me so then i sustained henry clay because he sustained my sentiments because he sustained the whig doctrine as i understood it a slaveholder as he was it was my duty to do him justice and as long as he sustained my doctrine i was ready to support him my liberty friends believed that he would violate the constitution they did not believe he would sustain the doctrine he laid down i believed that he would there was no difference between us in principle the difference was in evi deuce they were as honest as i was and allow me to say that was just as honest as they were allow me to can your attention to the fact that the letter of martin van bu ren in aud the declaration of henry clay in were the death warrants of those gentlemen they signed their own deathwarrants when they dared to come out and declare their sentiments w hen those sentiments were in opposition to the wishes of the slave power there is a power which raises up parties and puts them down it is the slave power of the nation it was that pow er which pronounced martin van burens political death and execution when they saw his letter of refusing to extend slavery they used the same power and pronounced the doom of henry clay i hat power has driven both of those men to retirement and private life am i not right ask your consciences examine the record search the history and then as you shall answer god say whether these are not enduring truths will you say we have nothing to do with slavery would to god we had not tel you it has depressed the free labor the north from the first your inu it sis have been raised and depress ci exactly as the freaks of the slave power have dictated and they will continue to do so so long as you continue to yield to the slave power your lights w ill he trampled under foot do you tell me about your tariff in john c calhoun was the great advocate of the tariff for he thought he could in that way extort from the pockets of the freemen of the north the whole amount necessary to pay otl our indebtedness he was for fixing that tax upon free labor and you andi and our friends around us submitted to it but when they saw we were benefited by it that same inexorable power struck dow n the tariff duties and repealed it it han error which has been impressed upon us from our in infancvas it were that the slavelubor of the south and the freelahorof the north are rccoucilable it is a contradiction in terms what can you reconcile liberty and slavery iey are direct opposite antagonisms you might as well talk of uuitiug light and darkness vice and virtue heaven and hellas to speak of uniting slavery and freedom it cannot be done the law that builds up the free labor of the north oppresses the slave labor of the south and the law that sustains that puts down the free labor of the north i it is a contradiction in terms to say that the same law can benefit both but we were defeated in texas was annexed who was it that annexed texas i know we charged it upon the liberty men i said that if liberty men had united with us we should have elected henry clay but thev did not but who was it that introduced the resolution in congress you know that we had fought early and late but henry clay waa set aside the slave power had bid him retire and he had retired and miltoo brown who had always stood by our side in opposition to texas now introduced the resolution lor the annexation of texas thus dei i daring himself in the face of the nation an apostate to the doctrines he had professed milton brown and seven other t whigs deserted us john tyler bad to got these eight whigs to rote for it or it woeld not hare passed and yet those men sre bugged to tbs party as whigs today though they bad in the hour of need deserted their ranks and gone over to tbs enemy now i tell you if that man be e w hig if that bewhig doctrine to dcatrt our principles then lam not a whig it ought certainly to be an article in the creed that their memories should last three weeks but bis did not cannot change my opinions in so short a time as that those eight men they went over to the democrats they voted with them sympathized with them fraternized with them andjet they are called whigs i allude lo these facts to show that that issue was affected by our own par tizans the next subject to which i allude was the recognizing of mr polks war now fellowcitizens i may come nearer home than i have been but you will excuse me w t hen that question fiaught with such transcendent consequences to this nation the waging war for the extension of slavery was brought before us and the executive declared that war already existed by the act of mexico and that abominable lie was placed before us to say whether war did exist by the act of mexico i ask you fellowcitizens what was our response look at our professions during the entire campaign when we foretold this war on every stump in the nation i had foretold it in ohio and asked my fellowcitizens there if they desired to see the bones of our soldiers bleaching upon the plains of mexico or their blood fattening mexican soil i had pointed out the horrors of the war i had spoken of women and children murdered by our troops we had foretold all that and yet in that hall who went for it i will tell you everyman w ho gave his vote for the war now stands ready to give his vote for gen taylor for president i cast no personal imputations i impugn no mans motives but it has been my lot to have my public acts scanned and scrutinized and public acts are public property what is done in otheial capacity is spread before the nation and you are hound to know it and act accordingly and nollr i turn to the record look at those who called this an ungodly piratical and murderous war and see if every man of them does not sustain gen taylor or lewis cass for the presidency is that whig doctrine i dont care whether you are cotton whigs or woollen whigs i want to address myself to every man old hubkers democrat barnburner anda was this whig doctrine i stand tonight where i then stood i have labored and i call god to witness that i havelubqred honestly with a sincere desire to avoid the war and yet all but fourteen in the house of representatives and two in the senate turned round and went over to the enemy adopted their policy and voted for the war they say it was under peculiar circumstances and it must have been peculiar circumstances to compel a manto vote against the whole course of his life but i saw nothing very peculiar about the circumstances men thus willing to yield up their consistency and propriety ought to have their public acts spread before the people and it is your duty to scrutinize them and stand forth in the defence of your own rights from that day to this the whig party has been dissolved cheers it was not at the philadelphia convention it was from that moment that our moral power was gone w e could not maintain our consistency we had no moral power before the people of the nation could i stand forth before you and exhort you to sustain the whig party because we had sustained our principles the countenance of an honest man would be made to blush by such an attempt from that moment from the th of may the whig party have ceased to have the characteristics of a party they have mingled with the opposite party in all the great interests of the nation now i call upon vou gentlemen of the press to speak true condemn me and consign me to infamy if truth will do it but do not distort facts do not betray the country do not sell the liberties efyour country to the slave power cheers tell the truth to the people for it is their right and your duty and when truth is laid before them if they fail to maintain their rights and the constitution on their heads on their children and childrens children be the responsibility you and i will discharge our duty posterity will give us the honor and it will be said then that the people have their just deserts but the people will not be blindfolded i dont believe it wdf take wine days to get the eyes of the people open have told you of the manner in which this war was brought upon ns and i never felt so weighed down aud oppressed in my life as upon that day with tears and entreaties and exhortations i rnet the members of the house on tliwt occasion but to no purpose every one lof those men had had all necessary time for reflection to ponder upon it upon their pillows but sti they voted to send your frllowckiaens of massachusetts and every free state to ifeat infernal war to leave their bodies hi mexican graves and to leave then blood upon themselves and upon you and me they bad time for reflection ud they did reflect they pondered upon f they argued upon it publicly and privately and yet they voted and continued to vote ia favor of that war i tell yotjr that when they mad for years r proclaimed their unutterable detestatrurt of that war aud then voted to support and sustain it it waa not whig doctrine if it was whig doctrine then ii was nnwhig wbeartfce whigs came into power did they not carry out the j precise doctrine and policy of the loco locos to continue the warj lid they i not assume the very positions the ver doctrines the very policy with the democrats it was with these views that said that the whig putty ceased to have its distinctive marks on the uthofmay i denounced that war denounced every man who sustained it every man who would wage war in mexico to acquire territory jupon which to establish the infamous institution of slavery the blood of the women and children murdered m mexico at our bidding instigation and expense rests upon you and me yourj hands and mine are stained with it and yet we talked of the w hig party i still cherished the hope that w e might bring them back to bt conclmltd next uea i the wilmot proviso debate in congress july lsftlr new mexico mr halel will only detain the senate a few moments am pleased tobe called to order by a gentleman who sticks always so closely to the question himself ha ha mr hale desired a vote directly upon these amendments before the senate whether slavery should or should not go into oregon he was opposed to any compromise on this question and referred to the compromise in the texas annexation as not touching an inch of texas hut as running across new mexico which did not come into the occupation of the united states till conquered by gen kearney mr rusk would answer all that at the proper time mr hale referred to the maps and to the conquest and government established in new mexico by gen kearney as proof that that territory did not belong to texas and even by running the missouri compromise through thnr territory to santo fe and all the territory worth anything will be south of the j line mr rusk did not rely on the maps texas had sounder claims according to the maps all texas down to the treaty belonging to mexico up to the sabine mr halewell then i refer the senator to the presidents messages mr ruskour claims do not depend either upon the mgps or upon the presidents message mr hale resumed in opposition to the committee and to the coiupguflufc mi buffer sppkeearnestly w rarer of the eommitfee and of the nccessityp from the dangers to the union of settling this question at the present session of congress mr hale one compromise to which he would assent he would agree to compromise the matter by giving back to mexico every inch of territory we have acquired of her let us tell mexico to take it all back forthwith as it is but a bone of contention he was unwilling to a compromise which contemplated the assent of this government to the extension of human slavery mr foote replied denouncing the idea of giving back the territory as ah surd in the extreme denouncing mf hale as affiliated with such men as henry c wright whose avowed object was to break down this constitution and this union surrender this valuable territory no sir never he was decidedly in favor of the motion for a committee and argued in itssup port mr clayton defined his position to he on the borders ofmason anddixous linehis great object to he an amicable adjustment of this difficultyhence the motion he had made he would he glad if this question could be settled now hut thought it could be judiciously postponed till after the presidential election mt hale rose again mr westcot l raise a point of order no senator shall speak more than twice on the same day on the same question and the senator from new hampshire has spoken three times mr haleonly twice sir question put mr hale allowed togo on mr hale rose to answer the charge that he affialited with that class of abolitionists who seek to destroy the constitution and the union mr foote rose to explain mr westcott aside fheretncre we shall have it again mr hotter amdccant you stop them mr westcottno i want to barea speech myself by and by mr halel am sorry if my remarks give pain to the senator from i lorida mr westcottvery much very much i assure you a voicel would like to have a chance at him mr hadethe aetmfiveners of the senator satisfies me that be is originally from the north going at length in reply to mr foote mr foote asked if the gentleman was nut the champion of the abolitionists in he north and does he not expect to be nominated by the buffalo convention if he is we ahall have a hate storm wiflf a vengeance haha he mr hale that depend altogether upon how it is footed ffp he then proceeded to ihow ktft he did not be long to he henry c wright faction hut t dm conservative abolitionist wished to preserve be union b lalho back upon ffe old pidlform of dm con stitution with sme further conversation between mr foote and mr mr wescot took dm floor he had wo fears of tbo union he had no fears john dick psausaaa whole nobl of th wiltnoproviaofor if passed we have a president who ilf give it the veto tht etcitemeftt upon the question would waste itself to the presidential clecyofr he we in fnvor of thb committe end if nothing more could be done the president would be empowered at in the cnee ol florida to establish n temporary government over the he territories till cong ret should meet again mr niles was glsd to hear the union waa safe he wsa opposed to any compromise on this question he did not beheve it wohld be settled this tension it cld not be done by ibis congress it must be nettled by the people in the eiectioo of a new congress let the people be heard on it if you pass this proposed compromise the members voting for it may be burnt in effigy when they go home and the act will not be binding as in the case of admitting missouri as a state these are but territories and they w ill still be open to legislation he wonld submit to be voted down but he would never assent to an act by which one inch of free territory shall ever be stained with human slavery alt that should be done this session would be to give to the president the temporary government for the new territories in the interval to the next congress as was done in iao u mr berrien advocated in a lively strain the committee as the safest medium for a satisfactory settlement of this question mr downs congratulated the senator from delaware on bis motion ihe opposition from a certain quarter

months ago called at lent too to i proposed outrage upon the rights of colored children in bath steuben co j y wi now call attention to its consummation when in bath this spring we were informed that a union schoolhouse was in procesi of erectinti to which all the children in town were in go instead of going as they were to schools in different parts of the town thai f this union schoolboose was built by a ux i upon all lakable property in the town and as r colored men owned a considerable property in the town their proportion of taxes amounted to a large sum one colored man paid fifteen dollarsanother aeven and some less the schoolhouse is now completed and is an excellent building quite commodious and occupies a central position easily reached by all persons in the tow n when it was opened colored mothers though they had had intima lion that their children would probably be excluded took their children to the schoolre solved to know themselves bow they were tobe disposed of they found the doors of that building closed against them the house built in part by their hard earnings was shut against their children and they were hooted through the streets with theory of nigger nigger nigger and other low blackguardism of which miserabla white trash are so prolific now we invite attention to bath and submit that this treatment is a most mean and cowardly outrage by the many upon the few that highway robbery is not more unjust than that of taking the colored mans money to build a schoolhouse exclusively for white children but the worst part of this infamous treatment remains to be told the taxes imposed to build the union school i house was to be collected at three different times the first and second had been collected which the colored people very readily paid but before the collector camo around the third time they became aware that their children were to be excluded from this schoolhouse for the erection of which they were about to be again called upon to pay a friend of ours being called upon refused to pay the remainder of his assessment on the ground that his children were to be excluded while the children of white men who had not paid as much as he had already done were tobe admitted the collector persisted in demanding his pay but my friend nobly resisted the demand as unjust and unreasonable whereupon this collector by virtue of his authority levied upon a portion of the goods in tiis store and sold them at public outcry and this barefaced piece of atrocious villanv received the sanction of a good methodist irother who while others hesitated about aking part in the robbery came forward making a meiit of his brazen audacity and j said i am not afraid to bid we should like to know the name of this religious rogue and to ascertain his precise standing in thej community and especially if he has never been an occupant of the large building ax au burnwhether he was not once caught stealing sheep or which is worse stealing colored children and running them off south we should really like to know his history i will any of our readers in bath give us the facts that we may in future deal with this i mean creature intelligently meanwhile we say shame on bathshamel on the community which can perpetrate such mean and dastardly acts on any portion of their fellow citizens because they have not the means to redress their wrongs wej should have thought that the fact of the ored people being in the minority would have suggested to the w hites the utmost scrupulosity in dealing with them in regard to this matter there was an opportunity afforded them to seem a little magnanimous and we had fondly hoped that they would embrace it well knowing that some of the most respectable and intelligent persons in the town were adverse to the present mean and proscriptive j measure but they have let it pass we therefore now call upon the press to hand the gross injustice around we would say to our colored friends in l bath be of good cheer they may iob you of your money and shut you out of schools exclude you from social and political rights j but they cannot rob you of the right to be saber honest and industrious nor can they exclude you from the throne of the most high your prayers are as precious in the sight of a god of justice as those who boast their white superiority over youmoreover that god whose allseeing

consideration of its character and objects the editor says in bis salu tatory may we at the outset explain a little what we shall attempt under the name and motto we have chosen there is a god not a mere rhetorical flourisha figure of speech a sublime conception not that there is a god this world is his world he made it and preserves it and has sever yet lifted the w eight of a finger of his

its parts from the sand jrrain up to the tallest hero that ever undertook the task of honoring human respon sibilitiesevery thing aruund above beneath within us is shut up to the operation of his laws these lawsexpressions of the omnipotent willare all pervading universal unchangeable silently or in the crash ofj empires by day and by night through the earth the air the water in things of time and sense and among the sublimer realities we call spiritual the inevitable laws are there and there as laws heaven and earth may pass away but they remain unchanged the grass withers the flower fades but these the words of a god endure forever now all this is very sublime but very indefinite and can scarcely be called an explanation of what is to be attempted by this model worker if we did not know the editor of the model worker we should be disposed to think this mere cantintended to ingratiate his paper among a class of persons who never weary in talking about a supreme being but possessing no disposition whatever to consider the welfare of his creatures the model worker goes on to say that all will admitw hat it expresses of the supreme being but that the masses of mankind hold the throne ofgod a humbug ja fter dwelling at length upon this idea he proceeds as follows butif these laws are inevitable in their operationif gods very existence is pledged jo their maintenanceif the universe is insubjection to them what can they accomplish vho set themselves in opposition in a strict sense the activity of wicked men cannot result n anything deserving the name ofdeeds kor the word deed

which he is intent w ithout conforming himself to the creators laws every such one w ill find sooner or later perhaps to confusion and everlasting ruin that it is hard to kick against the pricks this too sounds very well theological philosophical and politicalbut not very direct or explanatory we wade on through nearly a whole column of such beauty and sublimity before meeting with any thing like the objects of the paper in these days of juick travelling quick printing and quick read jing men w f ill not generally puzzle tbeir brains iy such an effort to find out what a man is driving at as that required by this salutatory if the model worker we do not know how it is with learned men but we who have been iccustomed to the unvarnished hardships and stern realities of life have a strong attachment to simplicity and directness of speech whether written or spoken the model worker shall tell in its own language all that looks like an explanation of what he is about to attempt and our readers will have the same means of knowing of what that object isthat we possess in theenterprise before us then we would make these laws the model of our activity j we would put ourselves in harmony

noted as was the clerk by that extremely polite and humble demeanor whichever chaiacterizes the mean and unprincipled yet so contemptuously indignant did we fee toward the w hole concern that we even did not inquire of the captain into the rules of the boat there is no doubt but this is the established rule of ihe pacifica nams which i desire the frienda of freedom to remember and neither captain

acknowledge it we did not get passage until monday morning on the gen scott a sandusky and detroit packet sandusky has greatly improved not more than four years since the port consisted of but one street and a few scattered houses with scarcely a dock sufficient for the landing of steamers the place has now some six or eight thousand inhabitants and so rapidly increasing that the demand for houses is by far greater than the supply at this time there are in progress of building not less than houses and doubtless there are as many more under contract the people of this place are in the main quite civil and polite being principally yankees there are several colored families in and j about sandusky city and these are of the most praiseworthy character those who reside in the country are generally farmers and well doing having land and stock of their own in a fine state of prosperity themselves being intelligent and industrious those of the town are equally praiseworthy the greater part owning good houses and lots in the best parts of the city one young man having agood grocery another and his wife keep a confectionary and saloon all of them are doing well there are two others making preparations for entering largely into the boat store and grocery business on passing new buildings i was much gratified to see in them busily engaged colored carpenters plasterers painters and others all industriously and sociably working on the same benches and scaffolds with other workmen though bearing a different hue but not probably a more skillful hand with the exception of a few who belonged to the steamers which lie in the bay i did not see an indifferent looking colored person in sandusky i conceive it to be ominous of good the dawning among ocr people of a better j day when tin can be fou d among the ar tisars tradesmen merchants and property j holders who first contribute to the establishment of new places in directing a letter to sandusky i would remark if

court assistant this was a suit brought at the instance of troutman who is also a practicing lawyer in kentucky agent of francis giltner of carroll county ky for damages for payment by the law of for loss of the crosswait family of fugitives who effected their escape on the th day of august and located near marshall calhoun county michigan against chas t gorham dr oliver c comstock mr hurd and three colored mencharles bergen planter moss and nelson ilackett the investigation continued about four weeks and upwards of sixty witnesses were examined on the th day of january early is the morning about daylight troutmas david giltner and fiancis lee went to the house of the crosswait family consisting of the old man his w ife and four children forced their way in presented arms asserting their intention of taking them back to kentucky whereupon the old man or one of bis sons cried out kidnappers kidnappers this had the desired effect of arousing the j neighborhood a colored man one of the defendants was thq firtt who came to their aid upon whom troutman instantly drew a revolving pistol commanding him for the life to stand back when the news got folly spread an old gentleman mounted his horse rode through the streets rnging a bell crying kidnappers the cnwawait family and so forth until the whole town was gathered together about the house of the fugitives whom up to this tune it was not proven inevidence that the people of the peaceful village of marshall knew to be fugitive the family was very respectable and well thought of by all the people of marshall messrs gorham hurd and dr comstock severally came upon the of whom at different times endeavored to remonstrate with troutman and his fellows during which time they were swaggering and boasting of what they intended doing not only w tth the gentlemen who attempted expostulation fast with all on the giound not satisfied with this over bearing southern insolence troutman mounted a large stone and commenced a harangue of arrogance which had the same been attempted by a northern man in kentucky would have cost him at leant his neek apor the highest stake m the neighborhood af the conclusion of which he offered i rtso lotion w hjch received a unanimous negative elcept the four kentuckians who voted in fator of their own resolution mr gorham offered a resolution to thii effect resolved that these kentoekiana bt prevented from taking away the crosswail family by moral legal or physical force and that they leave the state in two bouis or be subject to a prosecution for breach of the peace this received a unanimous aye i dr comstock addressing troutman remarked my good sir you must see that y u cannot take these people by moral legal or physical force troutman insolently inquired what do you say i shall not take them to which replied dr comstock no sit i do not say so but i say according to the appearance of things an excited crowd aruund you that you must see the impossibility of taking them by moral legal or physical force messrs gorham and hurd made similar remarks with a degree of impudence which could emanate alone from those accustomed to domineer over slaves troutman demanded the names instantly of gorham comstick and hurd demanding of the crowd to know whether or not they were responsible men answered in the affirmative he proceeded to write down mr gorham in giving his name observed my name is charles t gorham write it in capitals and bear it back with yoo to kentucky i dr comstock also remarked rw giving his i my name is oliver comstock jr be sure to write junior as i bear the name of my father and do not wish bim to be responsible for me there is no doubt but both of these gentlemen as well they might be were somewhat irritated at the overbearing and i insolent demands of these kentucky ruffians the kentuckians had a wagon in which to bear off their victims but failing of success as a last resort endeavored to get them before esquire sherman a justice of the peace to tins there was little objection but before its accomplishment the evervigilant colored men true to their trust themselves humanity and their god spirited away the whole family on the underground this is a fair statement of the case messrs pratt and now ell appeared for the plaintiffs messrs remain emmons wells and clarke for defendants mr emmons did justico to his cause and credit to himself he assumed as his foundation an elevated position manfully and fearlessly in a strain of seven hours one and a half the first day and five and a half the second ably vindicated the right the cause of humanity and the liberties of the north in his eloquent plea he severely castigated the serflike servility of dixon the acting deputy sheriff of calhoun county who for the sum of five dollars dared in the absence of all legal injunction undertake at the bidding of troutman to arrest the crosswait family it was admitted in his own testimony that he knew he had no authority for so doing but observed he in justification of the act mr troutman insisted on my doing so saying that he would be responsible for it it will be gratifying to the friends of humanity to learn that the high sheriff of calhoun county promptly discharged the wretch dixon from the services of his office mr wells w ho is quite a young man acquitted himself well and manfullymr romain making the closing plea which was summed up without j fear favor ot affection with this exception that lie did not take quite so high ground on the subject of human rights as his colleague the fearless and independent mr emmons mr norvell u s attorney who opened for the prosecution made a blustering noise about southern chivalry and gallantry liberality and patriotism and all that to this mr eininons dealt out the severest and most blistering sarcasm the counsel said he talks of chivalry gallantry patriotism and iiberahly yes the southerner is always chivalrie whom standing before the crouching slave who is taught that submission is of the divine will he is always gallant when his only antagonist is the trembling bondmanhe might well be patriotic in lifting that artn in defence of his country which has never been nerved by toilwell may his heart he liberal as the prodigal sons is liberal when lavishly j casting away the meins and property of a father gained by years of care and labor his being wrung from the hopeless slave mr pratt who readies at marshall closed for the prosecution and in support of his position hieughj tin w ard a written argument an old lame proslavery colonisation argument long snce exploded to prove that lavery was a divine institution sanctioned by the bible he uiked about jewish servi lude joseph in egypt paul and ouesunus rad the lke declaring that these things were true slavery wn an institution sanctioned by goff or the bible was not true and should immediately be abandoned as the guide j sf our faith adverting to bis antagonist mr emmons tie observed that the counsel had brought in books to prove certain positions in lawwhich id not a student after six months studying know deserved to be discharged from the pro fession to this base but to reply that if any boy of seres veers old knew no better than to believe such silly stuff as that brought forward by counsellor pratt which evidently gained the approbation and sanction of many proslavery votaries present opposed as i am to the corporeal punishment i do think be should he severely castigated for his ignorance the position of counsellor pratt was both mean and dastardly and sever did a slave more earnestly labor for bis master than mi pratt for these slave catchers by whom be was employed id several respects the servility manifested during the litigation was in the extreme bu miiiatisg it is true that there are few in detroit to he found quite ao debased but there were several and my attention was called by a gentleman at my aide while sitting in the court room to the fact that as the insolent upstart young slaveholder troutman would swagger through the court chamber with hit curved staff banging on hu arm some persons present would smile sod bow very obedience to him although bis attention waa turned in another direction they appeared te receive it aa a compliment merely to eaieh a glanee sf bis eye se aceswtemed w the north to southern mle that it has become wccwd nature how exceedingly mortifying k northern men thus beeely bbwmg their necks to the dark spirit of alavery rharge of judge mclean to the jotjt i look upon as decidedly partial weighing heavily hi the scale on the side of slavery the course of the old gentleman throughout the prosecution i viewed in the same light it is true that he asserted th wrongs of sin eery in the abstract declaring that it bad no existence either in tb national law or law lof nations it was hmited mhe eaist j cr nd ocal character deriving its whole strength from municipal authority he did not venture after the bible argument of mr pratt who to alt appearance dared him to the task once make the declaration that slavery had no existence in the law of god was much disappointed in judge mclean and did not find him that mdepend exit and liberalminded jurist that from all i had heard of him i had a reason to expect during the charge he did not once express his abhorrence of slavery but modestly evaded commitment on that point by simply saying whatever may be our feelings and so forth the law is thus and so mr pratt a proslavery man and attorney for the plaintiff frequently during his pleading declared that he was as much opposed to slavery as anybody while at the same time he used his might to prove its scripture authority the antislaver references also of judge mclean prove nothing so far as his sentiments arc concerned it may be contended thai the law is directly against the feelings of the judge and of bun wit be can do nothing this i readily concede and wqile so doing alone hold him responsible fee hts own opinions independent of constitutional or state provisions suelk opinions when emanating from the bench become the actual law of the land and are so received and considered in oar courts of judicature this extraordinary opinion of judge mfc lean to which i call your particular attention announced from the bench as an essential point in civil jurisprudence is to my mind w ithout precedence in the history of modernat least enlightened judicial pro cedure indeed in me it may be the result of ignorance of the law of the land for to thinking and expressing myself for w hich i may even be rebuked but if this is the law of the country in which we live then ts liberty but a by wordlitigation for protection a sham andl all judicial proceedings a farce that should immediately be abolished unexpectedly to every one either plaintiffs defendants or their friends in his charge to the jury giving a definition of a etiminah in this and all similar casesthe charge being brought for haiboring concealing hindering and obstructing in the language of the act of congress knowing them to be slaves e shall forfeit and pay for each slave the sum of five hundred dollars c unequivocally asserted repeatedly that it was not necessary to the offence that the person interfering with the rights of the the slave catcher should know that the person or persons so claimed wereslaves if thp slave catcher did but assert his intention declaring that the persons so claimed were ins property w hich declaration might be made m the absence of any slave save the persons claimed it was sufficient the merest interference a ter this declaration will suffice to criminate to make this plain in reply to an interrogatory by one off the counsel for defence the judge remarked i wish the jury to understand me it i nut necessary that the persons interfering should know that the persons claimed art slaves if the claimant has made the declaration that they are such though he should only assert it to the fugitives themselvesin deed it could nu be exacted that the claimant w ould he required the trouble of repeating ihi to persons who might be disposed to in torfereshould any one interfere at all after the decl araiion of the claimant he is liable and responsible to the provisions of the law in such cases here then is the decision of the highest judiciary rathe land upon the subject of our liberties and that by one whom hi friends call s friend to humanity to my judgment such a decision is neither in accordance with philosophy nor common sense moral philosophy teaches as common sense dictates that no act can be considered criminal where there is not a criminal intention hence the distinction between killing and murder a person through mistake under the impression that he is aiming at a beast may shoot and kill a man in the bush though he actually kills the man he does not titers fore commit murder because there was no intention of murderingthe object shot at being a beast and not a max bui in the position assumed by judge mcleatv common sen so is set at naught and philosophy at defiance though says the judge a person aims at the rescue of a freeman from the hands of a kidnapper he rotist be responsible for an unlawful interference between master and slate nor did be make any allowance for the presumption in favor o freedom until the contrary is proven it in enough for one to know flat the slavecatcher attempted to arrest his victim and the presumption must be in favor of the master l truly this is the law of the land law by which

the approaching first of august i shall write once more before my return yours for god and humanity m r d the rights of women one of the most interesting events of the past week was the holding of what is technically styled a womans rights convention et seneca falls the speaking addresses and resolutions of this extraordinary meeting were almost wholly conducted by women and although they evidently felt themselves ina novel position it is but simple justice to mv that their whole proceedings were characterized by marked ability and dignity no one present we think however much he might be dispose to differ from the views advanced by the leading speakers on that occasion will fail to give them credit for brilliant talents and excellent dispositions in this meeting as in other deliberative assemblies tharc were frequently differences of opinion and animated discussion but iii no case was there the slightest absence of good feeling and decorum several interesting documents cutting forth the rights as well as the grievances of woman were read among these was a declaration of sentiments to be regarded ts the basis of a grand movement for attaining all the civil social political and religious rights of woman as these documents are soon to be published in pamphlet form under iheauibority of a committee of women appointed by that meeting wc will not mar them by atttempting any synopsis of their contents we should not however do justice to our own convictions or to the excellent persons connected with this infant movement if we did not in this connection offer a few remarks on the general subject which the convention met to consider and the objects they seek to attain in doing so we are not insensible that the bare mention of tins truly important subject in any other than terms of contemptuous ridicule and scornful disfavor is likely to excite against us the fury of bigotry and the fully ol prejudice a discussion of the rights of animals would be regarded with far more complacency by many of whit are called the arise and tli j good of our land than would bea discussion of the rightsof woman it isin their estimation to be guilty of evil thoughts to think that woman is entitled to rights equal with man many who have at last made the discovery that negroes have same rights as well as other members of the human family have yet to he convinced that woman is entitled to any eight years ago a number of persons of this description actually abandoned the antislavery cause lest bv giving their influence in that direction they might possibly be giving countenance to the dangerous heresy liiat woman in respect to rights stands on an equal footing with man in the judgment of such jiersons the american slave system with all its concomitant horrors is less to be deplored than this i ricked idea it is perhaps needless to say that we cherish little sympathy for such sentiments or epect for such prejudices standing as we do upon the watchtower of human freedom we etnsot be deterred from an expression of ippiobalioti of any movement however umble u unlove and elevate the character and condition of any members of the human aim y vhile it is impossible for us to go lato ibis subject at length and dispose of the vtrreus objection which are often urged against such a ducuu as that of female equality we are free to say that resp ect to political nghts we hold woman u be justly entitled to all we claim for min we go farther od expru our conv lc tion that all political rights which it ta expert for manto exercise jt is equally so for woman all that distinguishes man as an intelligent and accountable being is equally true of woman snd if that government is only just which governs by the free consent of the governed there can bo no reason in the world fur detiy g to woman the exercise of the elective franchise or a hand in making and sdminis trug the law of the land our doctrine is hat right is of no ex wo therefor m the women engaged in this movement out bumble god speed jobs jfclea tvro has been some talk of judge mclean in certain quarters as a fit nominee for the i buffalo convention the people convention at columbus panned the following resolution revived that we repose full confidence in the punty wisdom patriotism and firm nem of john mclean his opinions that slavery can only exist by virtue of a special law that the common law national law tand the law of nature are opposed to it that the relation of m itter and slave is an uni natural ad artifu relation created by the muncipal law i nnequently cannot exist beyond the binding influence of such law and congress has no power to constitute flavcry anywhere meet our warmest appro rj and heartiest concurcnce how do the sentiments that are here attributed to judge mcljean agree with his recent manifestation of dougbfaceism in tbecross i wait slave case in his charge to the jury in that case he said should any one interfere after a claimant has stated a person to be his slave whether in healing of the person whoso interferes or not he is liable and responsible to the provisions of the law in such cases that is he shall forfeit five hundred dollars for each slave the act of congress says i knowing them to be slaves according to judge mclean one may be ignorant that the person in w hose behalf he interferes is a slave and yet he will be liable the law is bad enoughdisgraceful enough bat the interpretation of the judge is worsemuch  more disgraceful the buffalo convention it isto be hoped will not forget this j d cominunkations from our own correspondent london july th dear douglasssince i last wrote to you blood has been running like water in the kennels of paris a disturbed feeling had been known to pervade the city and apprehensions were entertained that the outward j semblance of tranquility then existing could not remain for long when a tremendous storm arose which as regards extent and intensity may be said to be utterly unforeseen paris was quiet on the night of thursday june the promenades were as crowded and the cafes a much frequented as at any time since the lecent revolution on friday a few men dressed en blouses and armed with muskets began to traverse the streets vociferating for a red republic their numbers j rapidly increased barricades began to rise i on all sides and before night

of which would have done honor to ihe old guard the insurgents height with the awful courage of despair a thousand troops fell before one barricade the defenders of w iiicli lost but two killed and five wounded the rebels will everlastingly be remembered as the perpetrators of savage cruelties which would have disgraced the herukee indians they mutilated with every circumstance of revolting barbarity such ot their opponents as fell into their power omen came and assuaged the thirst of the fevered troops with poisoned w ine there were even women who w hen the rebellion had been crushed

containing a programme for the cx elusion from the rights of citizenship for ten years of every one paying two hundred francs ayear and upwards in taxes so much for libertyequalityfraternity s p q r letter from a slaveholder dear s have been as much prejudiced against negro slavery as yourself or almost i any other person but since the subject has been so much agitated i have read much andi examined it with great attention w ith a view to ascertain what was really best for the negro and i concur with our men of information generally that in all the hue and cry about friendship for the negro his only real friend is his master and that they ate so well convinced of it that were it left to their vote it would be so decided you can never make a white man of the negro lie differs as much in mind as body his rank smell uncomely appearance and stupid intellect make him disgusting to be associated with whites on equal terms and he feels this himself and prefers his own society and color and besides the negro aswell as the red man generally is so constituted that his nature must be entirely changed before he can enjoy the same elevation of society with the white race with the latter love in its proper sense is the purification and elevation of the good affectionswhich are perfected by marriage and continue to be advanced and matured through lifethe marriage of cana of gallilee in which the last wine is better than the first this is more particularly the cae in this country which is considered the peculiar country for the elevation of the woman and where she is acknowl i edged the world over to be the most virtuous intelligent and beautiful and therefore to require no restraint for she is above temptation and besides her sons are sovereigns and their servants our rulers rank above the and princes of the earth her desire is only to her husband and she delights that he should rule over her and on this account his heel is so bruised that he cannot leave her and there is no serpent in their eden now dear friend will such angels of affliction and kindness ever yoke themselves with the unsavory and repulsive nigger with whom love is nothing but an animal passion without affection or constancy and on whom god almighty has placed a mark of damning distinctionand declared he shall ba the servant of servants i he black and red women are alike destitute of that affection necessary to insure their j virtue i hey are creatures of mere impulse and passion and the experience of the world has decided that the only way to keep them honest is to lock them up as is done throughout the east at present and besides the races will not amalgamateit only embodies the vices and diseases of both and destroys them it is the very reverse of humanity to free the negro unless you can better his situation john randolph was once attacked by a respectable quaker about freeing his negroes randolph offered him one hundred slaves and only required of him to place them in a better situation and gave the quaker time to reflect upon it and upon reflection he refused andi believe in the height of abolition times a number of years ago in boston and rhode island the mobs were killing the free negroes by wholesale they were such nuisances the project of sending them to africa has faded and the free negro among us is lazy improvident dissipated profligate dishonest and every way a nuisance nd not one i believe in a thousand can show a means by which he gets an honest living on this account he is rambling from place to place liv j ing where and how he can and so depraved they raise but few children in virginia at present the governor has twice recommended to make them slaves and there is considerable probability that it will be done i you form no proper estimate of slavery i take persons in your country and make them slaves it would be a hardship and if they consented to live in slavery they would deserve killing but the negro here is born and raised in that situation and sensible of i his inferiority he looks to his master to take care of him and protect him indeed it is the negro who owns the master his masters friends and relatives are all his and he rates his own consequence according to their wealth and respectability he is the apprentice who never serves out his timethe minor who never becomes of age he marries and is set up in housekeeping and he and his family are all provided for years of scarcity make no difference with him he lives in plenty without any care on his part and if sick he has the best medical attendance the country affords and the most careful nursing and for all this he only does a moderate days work every daynot more than half or two thirds as much as is done by a while laborer among you if he is honest and moral he is reiqectj and indulged and every way rewarded and if his conduct is not so he is corrected an i every possible means used for his reformation instead of exercising over them the tyranny you suppose the master regards them with compassion and kindness and treats them with liberality and kindness to such a degree as often to be impoverished by it and then they are sold to another and it is nut rare that you find negroes that have ruined three and four masters this may appear incredible to you but a negro of good character is rarely sold unless for the debts of his master and these debts with out planters generally are occasioned by then indulgence to their slaves and you may perhaps ibtnk h fctrange that a man often fays o or loo toa doctor for attending a negro in one spdl sickliest when he would not hire for it in two or three years or perhaps is an old negro whose services are not worth a support the many thousands of negroes earned to the south of us every year may be generally considered as sold because their labor produced no profit or at least not sufficient to enable their master to live m a plain and decent manner clear of debt at the south their labor is more profitable but can assure vou that were it not lor slave labor cotton and other staples would be at lean five times the price they are for the white man can never do much labor in those ctanates and it can never he done by the negro m a state of freedom they are a thoughtless and improvident race and even as slaves the master is a meritorious person who keeps theiri rabrzt and honest and makea them wotk enough to produce en income besides their support yet thtseen be done with prudence and care and in ums way both are greatly benefited yet the mister who httr slaves never thinks himself above labor onless fas has enough to employ his at tent rob in overseeing them or fellows some other pursuit the negro if turbulent headstrong sod with bad propensities sad constantly exorcises the vigilance end patience of the master leave negroes who are good mechanics and i get lor them oooixaiit employ and good price yet win i to net them free they weald be etnsanor to fee pobhe i have others who attend to my puauuna affairs and have done ao for years yet they cannot get along without ray direction other manage ray household affair clothing the whole fam uv giving me httle or no trouble yet werf i ikh in piece ttwy would soon be i confusion some who commit offences run away and he out in the woods for weeks or even months but it is to keep clear of the punishment they deserve and which for their good is actually necessary and besides the negro knows it himself and actually despises a master who will not correct him when he deserves it and thinks him of no account because he can fool and cheat him fee but with all this run i ntng away and lytag o fee woods and the like it is nut to get free but to get clear of i punishment yet tnev do sometimes get off to the free states and are taught to lecture about horrid sufferings and the like to suit l political purposes yet their situation is always made worse and i often hear of bsggmg letters they send to their masters to enable them to get home fred douglass ran away from this state i have not seen his book nor do i suppose i that he wrote it we have had educated negroes here graduates at college bat in intellect they could scarcely attain to mediocrity with all advantages and in obtnseness of mind they were negroes still the time has been when the abolition subject gave us some annoyance made some insurrections and cost many lives but upon the whole i think it ha been an advantage to the south it has convinced them that it is perfectly justifiable by the scriptures which they were inclined ti doubt and that it is humane and not criminal and shown to the world that the slave of the south eats about twice much and is much better clothed lodged and accommodated and does less work than the agricultural laborer ir europe and one was never known to die ol hunger i believe that about arc expended yearly by the societies in englanc to agitate this subject among us it had better be given to their poor at home at pre ent abolition excites no interest of couse quence among us we look upon it as a political measure altogether at the north got uj for party or sectional purposes but you musi forgive me if assure you that we sometimes grieve and sometimes laugh that so many oi the intelligent and refined ladies at the non should be so zealously engaged in a subjeci which has a tendency to give them black husbands and mulatto children and i believe the time has passed by when the northern lady will choose to be seen waited on in public by a negro for we are a white nation and the only one on earth and as such peculiat people no black person has authority among us a kind providence has drove out the redman and given us their possessions if we amalgamate with the red or black we may expect the fate of mexico which is a mixed raee aud therefore become incapable of self government we may have bean made all of one blood that is all mortal i admit bui the red man is certainly more highly favoret than the black and the white vastly superior to the red christ was the incarnation the carnation or white race a new creation and we have no historical account of the white race previousto this period unless in japheth vho now has the ascendancy and among the white race the americans are certainly of the highest rank foi we are the only nation capable of selfgovernment yours c political items new y ork the following resolution was passed at a free soil meeting held iu new york resolved tht we view with scorn the miserable contrivanc is of a few northern doughfaces and their southern taskmasters designed to cheat the people of this union out of the decision ol the great is sue of the present time that we uttirly reject and repudiate any pretended compromise which surrenders e single mile of the virgin soil of the mighty pacific region as yet untrodden by the footol a slave all of which is required for the vasl multitudes of landless laborers in our own country and the refugees from european oppression to the degrading contact of human bondage and insatiable avarice of monopolizing slave owners and that if any such fraudulent scheme is enacted by the present congress we pledge ourselves to raise immediately the banner of repeal and to agitate unceasingly until every provision abolishing freedom is expunged from the

impression of the duty we owe to god and our fellow beings the antislavery women of rochester feel constrained to continue to persevere in their efforts for the oppressed and suffering bondmen who still remain toiling unrequited in the southern prison house we are frequently brought painfully to remember that not only their labor wrested from them unremunerated not only do they suffer from intense hunger and cold not only are the females our sisters subjected to the cruel and passionate outrages of their tyrannical masters and overseers but there are daily instances of sun during the dearest ties in nature thus separating them forever and can we expect anything beltercan we look for benevolence or fine feelings from a system so foul and fiendish as slavery it would be unreasanable because a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit therefore knowing that without associative action we cannot render efficient aid to this holy cause we affectionately invite the cooperation of the citizens of rochester and the public generally we ask them to bear in mind the injunctions of jesus all things whatsoever ye would men should do to you do ye even so to them remember also the beautiful parable in which he calls our attention to the sick and to those who are in prison and concludes by tbe forcible assertion inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me we feel assured all that have hearts to feel and are careful to attend to the monitions of conscienceall who are determined to live for the good of our race instead of devoting all their time to their own personal easeall who feel bound to improve the precious time allotted to them here by pio moting as much as possible the cause of truth and righteousness in the earth will come forward in the work of laboring to banish forever the demon of slavery from our land and in so doing instead of an example of corruption and wickedness wc should be a light to the world we hope no one will feel too poor nor any too rich to enlist in this holy cause the christians influence in whatever situation is always salutary and will certainly produce its good effects we ask for the aid of men and of women we call on the old and the young the farmer the mechanic and the merchant we ask all and every one to give us their help to devote what they cn spare either of money or of the fruits of their labor to the work of restoring men and women to themselves to their manhood to the rights and blessings with which they were endowed by our creator for this object we propose holding a fair in december next we ask the females in the adjoining towns and country around us to get up sewing circles and prepare such articles as will be most saleable and to come furnish tables give us their company and help us not only in selling those things thus prepared but in convincing the public mind of the necessity of our perseverance and fidelity and thus be helpers in hastening the day of emancipation the shadow of slavery hitman slavery is life ant labor ir the state of total eclipse slavery ha brt n denominated the sum of all villanies but there it a density and opaque nets about the huge iniquity that distinguishes it from all other corporate depravities when its great black solid cunc gets between human life and the sun of freedom which gui designed should light every man thal came into the world truly may it be said that the beings thus eclipsed tit ir the region and shadow of death tc their earthly hopes to everything thal is dear to this existence to every righl which inheres to man to the whole firmament of his expectations this side of eternity slavery is a total cold perpetual eclipsethat is an awful fad that in the midst of a country boasting of being the very home and throne of freedoms sun millions come to th dark inheritance of slavelife and lay it down in the grave without ever catching one ray of that sun from behind the black tinabating disk of that monstrous luiquity w hich this nation seeks to qualify with the name of peculiar institution the totality and darkness of this eclipse to the slave are pretty well recognized by those who live in the midday light of freedom but there ii one quality of this overshadow ing curse which has not been taken into due estimation a quality analagous to e prominent feature of a solaa eclipse we mean its penumbra or that cole subtile shade which it casts over life anc labor beyond the territory proper o slavery we invite all the workingmen and women of christendom tc consider seriously this phase of that great outrage upon humanity which many of them have perhaps thought tc be perpetrated upon the african race alonewho can tell how free laboi j through the world has been depressed j degraded robbed of its just rank and reward despised rejected thrown into i the gutter shut up in fever breeding j garrets in consequence of that sum ol all villanies concentrated upon the afri  can slave if there be any man or woman in this world whose cheek red j dens w ith virtuous indignation above all others at the sin of slavery it should be i the great democracy of free laborers to what may be ascribed the ascendency wealth power and perpetuity of the aristocracy of europe but the unanimous determination in all ages of everyone of its titled constituents to standby his order to uphold its dignity amid the wreck of revolution of all other human interests the democracy of labor is older than all tiie orders that have been created upon earth since man was made the earth and all tire treasures deeply hid in its heart its mines of gold silver and iron the precious things that glitter upon the bed of the deep blue seas all all were given to enhance the rank and reward of this ancient order to shine in the diadem of human industrythen how can those who wear about them the badge of this godordained order whose moistened foreheads glitter beneath the sun with the tiara of their profession whose red hard hands are marked with the signet which adam wore in hishow can they so desert their order as to brook the existence of slavery which degrades the reputation of labor through the world suppose onesixth of all the dukes earls and lords in england were tomorrow to be reduced to hodcarriers and compelled t mount buildings with brick and mortar upon their shoulders in sight of the world with the badges of their nobility upon their coarse blouses think you that the english aristocracy would not feel that their order was degraded by such a spectacle but what would this humiliation be in comparison w ith the disgrace which our ancient and honorable order incurs from the existence of slavery one sixth of our order in the united states are reduced to the deepest degradation of condition to w hich human beings can be forced they wear into the prison house of their bondage the common badge of our nobility every drop of perspiration that comes to their foreheads every ridge raised by hopeless toil in their sable hands is one of labors pearls one of the signets of her nobility trampled under the feet of profane conspirators against the honor rights and rank of the great industrial democracy of the world what the english aristocracy would feel in view of one sixth of their number reduced to hodcarriers and compelled to wear at their work the badges of their former rank we should feel and more abundantly and virtously in view of onesixth of our order reduced to slaves if we could come to this great sentiment of virtuous indignation at the outrage perpetrated by slavery upon our brotherhood the products of the slaves labor would crimson before our eyes with the reddest guilt of sin and oppression e b christian citizen injudicious patronage it is very well to encourage young artists and young poets provided that i the encouragement be judiciously and temperately rendered but knowingly to raise hopes which can never be realized ia at the beat wanton mockery to extol beyond reason is often in j effect to weaken the motives for improvement how frequently are men i spoiled by a false estimation of their own abilities we could point out instances in the present day of personal refusing to work because they have been dubbed poets we have known men who would never handle the hoe nor wield the hammer nor throw the shuttle because they

censure i shtjfxdd and rotherham independent the outside passenger j some years ago a young lady whr was going into a county took a seat in the stagecoach for mauy miles site rode alone but there was enough to amuse her in the scenery through which she passed and in the pleasing anticipations that occupied her mind she had bceu engaged as governess for the grandchildren of an earl and was now travelling to his seat at midday the coach stopped at an inn at which dinner was provided and she alighted and sat down at the table an elderly man followed and sat down also the young lady arose rang the bell and addressing the waiter said here is an outside passenger i cannot dine with an outside passenger i the stranger bowed saying i beg your pardon madam can go into another room and immediately retired the coach soon afterwards resumed its course and the passengers their places at length the coach stopped at the gate leading to the castle to which she was going but there was not such prompt attention as she expected all eyes seemed directed to the outside pas sengerwho was preparing to dismount she beckoned and was answered as soon as we have attended to his lordship we will come to you a few words of explanation ensued and toher dismay she found that the outside passenger with whom she had thought it beneath her to dine was not only a nobleman but that very nobleman in whose family she hoped to be an inmate what could she do how could she bear the interview she felt really ill and the apology she sent for her nonappearance that evening was more than pretence the venerable peer was a considerate man and one who knew the way in which the scripture often speaks of the going down of the sun we must not allow the night to pass thus said he to the countess you must send for her and we must talk to her before bedtime he reasoned with the foolish girl respecting her conduct insisted on the impropriety of the state of mind that it evinced assured her that nothing could induce him to allow his children to be taught such notions refused to accept any apology that did not go the length of acknowledging that the thought was wrong and when the right impression appeared to be produced l gave her his hand the model husband he walks out with his w r ife on a weekday and is not afraid of a milliners shop he even has change when asked for it and never alludes toit afterwards he is not above carrying a large brown paper parcel or a cotton umbrella or the clogs or even holding the baby in his lap in the omnil bus he runs on first to knock at the door when it is raining he goes outside if the cab is full he goes to bed first in cold weather he will get up in the middle of the night to rock the cradle or answer the doorbell he allows the motherinlaw to stop in the house he takes wine with her andj lets her breakfast in her own room he eats cold meat without a murmur and pickles and is indifferent about pies and pudding the cheese is never too strong or the beer too small orthe tea too weak for him he believes in hysterics and is melted instantly witha tear he patches up a quarrel witha velvet gown and drives away the sulks with a trip to epsom or a gig in the park on sunday he goes to church regularly and takes his wife to the opera once a year he pays for her losses at cards and gives her all his winnings he never flies out about his buttons or brings home friends to supper his clothes never smell of tobacco he respects the curtainsand never smokes in the house he carves but never secretes for himself the brown he respects the fiction of his wifes age and would as soon burn his fingers as touch the bright poker he never invades the kitchen and would no more think of blowing up any of the servants than of ordering the dinner or having the tray brought up after eleven he is innocent of a latchkey he lets the family go out of town i once every year whilst he remains at home with one knife and fork sits on a brown holland chair sleeps on a curtainless bed and has a chairwoman to wait on him he goes down on the saturday and comes up on the monday taking with him the clean linen and bringing back the dirty clothes he checks the washing bills he pays the housekeeping money without a suspicion and shuts his eye to the sundries he is very easy and affectionate keeping the wedding anniversary punctually never complaining if the dinner

platform where on by one they were success  ively to pass under the hammer the men sat in stoical silence the wo i men especially such as were mother gazed in anxious grief upon their little ones as they playfully grouped them j selves ujon the floor at their feet the children that but a short time since had been pressed to the mothers bosom with all the earnest yearniogs that none but a mothers heart can ieelj were to be sold and separated away to cauel servitude never more to know the endearment of maternal love all the tire of conang amity mod friend ibio were bore to be severed for tile e wri the miierawe objects to hi sent e from the place there all their happy associations had clustered away to the ferer and ague swamps of miss or to the barbatoas cotton fields of upper texas and such an outrage upon humanity was to be perpetrated in open daylight in a christian city and wit nessedyes sanctioned by hundreds of witnesses one could hardly realize the atrocioua fact here in the freest coaotry on earth and in the nineteenth century was a scene transpiring that would bare disgraced the times of nero or caligula it is no dream of fiction it is too real and yet no arenging band is put forth to stay the outrage the work goes on the two next victims are a noble middle aged man sod his wife who called herselt twentytwo they were not to be sold together for they would not bring so much money as if sold separate and moreover it seems the design of every one who has anything to do with slaves to discourage and deaden all the domestic lores to w hich human nature is addicted the young wie was first questioned in this manner that she might perchance recommend herself how old are you twentytwo how long have you been married three years how many children have you none and as she made the last reply in a saddened tone the tears started from her eyes and she turned beseechingly to her husband for protection upon this the questioner too turns ferociously towards him you villain ou have you lived three years with this wench without having any children now the true man was seen although bound in fetters and trampled in the dust with form erect and folded arms and with a dignity that might have lent lustre to othello himself he calmly replies we have had one but god took him the fact that the woman had been the mother of but one child and that dead was the reason for the low price of two hundred dollars for which she was knocked down she was purchased by a red river planter to be turned out into the fields to hoe and pick cotton the husband was afterward som for seven hundred and fifty dollars to be sent into the swamps of tennessee as a wood chopper the two were separated never more to meet in this world it is expected that husbands and wives thus separated will form new connections rear up new families and perhaps be again sold and divided asunder thus are the holiest of the institutions of heaven rendered void by the management of men andj thus are poor ignorant slaves made to commit the sins that are denounced by all moral and civil law and by the direct commands of god the last spectacle was as much as we could bear we thought of our own deep domestic lovesthen three thousand miles away the love and the sympathy of the wife so entwined into our own soul that no fate in time or eternity could separate the two whose separate existences had become onej life the clinging fondness of the little ones who will not be content witha separate existence but insist upon being a part of the parent still we left the scene but the anguish of that separuteed pair followed usit has not ceased to follow us since there was the memory of their little log house in the skirt of cotton wood upon the riverside there was the place of their early love as they had pcen reared up together on their wealthy owners plantation from thence had they entered the precincts of the church and before god and in the holy forms of the episcopacy had they promised to take each other for better for worse lor richer for poorer in sickness in health to love and to cherish till death should part them according to gods holy ordinance there was born to them their little boy who had gladdened their heartsand then died and there hard by was his little grave over which they bad wept together and would only be comforted in believing that god had taken him in that last long lingering look was crowded the gathering reminiscences of all the happiness they had known in life in closing this sketch allow me to say that we have seen slavery in every form we have conversed with slaves slave owners slave speculators and those who would have nothing to do with slaves we have looked at it politically morally and religiously and may hereafter give our views from each point of observation we can only say now that it is difficult to comprehend the enormity of the eviland that in the work of emancipation is required much care and consideration if possible the philanthropists of both north and southof the whole country and the whole civilized world should work harmoniously together that the time may be hastened when slavery shall be no more
