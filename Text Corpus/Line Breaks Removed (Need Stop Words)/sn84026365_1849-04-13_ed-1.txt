purpose of receiving from the free church in scotland important information bearing on the sufferings of large bodies of christian people in scotland arising out of the refusal bv several large landed proprietors to grant sites for the builjing of places of worship the attendance was but thin at first but the body of the large hall afterwards became filled on the platform with the deputation were the rev m essrs roper crisp g h davis and ham the rev mr crisp having engaged in prayer the rev h roper took the chair in the course of the pro ceedings mr r norris came forward to address the meeting the chairman inquired if he intended speaking to the resolution mr norris said he did and commenced by expressing his sympathy with the general objects of the meeting he should have been glad if less had been said about toloration because he did not hold that any government could tolerate in him that which was his inalienable right cheqrs he also thought that if there must be a bill it should provide not only for evangelical christians but should recognise the equal rights of conscience for all denominations whether jews mohammedans or pagans he should too have liked to have heard a little more determination expressed to go to the root of the evil by opposing the infamous laws of primogeniture and entail alter some further observations mr n went on to remark that it it should be found that the free church had in an evil hour sanctioned one of the most gigantic systems of wickedness ever known if it should he found that it had sent out a deputation from scotland to the slave states of america and there in despite of the warnings from the abolitionists given the righthand of its fellowship to avowed slaveholders and made collections in churches in which slavery was upheld if it should turn out that there eould beno doubt that this was a fact and that the free chur h had been guilty of this grievous error then it would become that meetingthough it mightfully and deeply sympathise with it on account of the suffering it had undergone and though it might give to the free church the full meed of praise for the noble sacrifices it had made of wealth and of influenceit would he repealed become them remembering the lessons taught them by frederick douglass cheers remembering too the horrible character of slavery itself j and the known fact that but for the countenance given to it hy professing christians slavery could not endure to show themselves honest in their i principles hy declaring that while they sympathised with the free church in her trouble they also sympathised with i the millions of their fellowcreatures in slavery cheers he called upon them honestly to express their convictions j that in that respect the free church had failed in her duty to warn her to withdraw herself from that iniquity and to send back the money cheers the ooo which was the price of i human blood an l human wrong md cheers mr norris proposed that the following words he added to the resolu lion that while we thus express our i sympathy with the free church we foci it to be our duty earnestly to protest against the conduct of that body in regard to american slavery and cs j pecially in soliciting and receiving coni tributions of slaveholders for its support and that we respectfully advise the free church to send back the money thus procured and no longer to give any sanction to a system so abhorrent to the spirit of the christian religion this need not at all decrease their expression of sympathy for the sufferings of the free church while it would express their feelings in regard to the wrongs of their fellowbeings who were suffering in slavery he hoped he had said nothing unnecessarily offensive he had discharged his conscience and the meeting must deal with the question i according to its sense of truth aud justice cheers mr h c howells having seconded the amendment toe rev g h davis said he felt himself placed in an extraordinary posi tionsympathising mot deeply wih his black brethren across the water feeling that in season he would like to say and d all he could for th in feel ling too that he should be grieved ati any tiling which might seem in any way to countenance that most iniquitous system yet he felt called upon to op pwe a course which he feared would lead away their sympathies from the object of the meeting let them look at the christian people of scotland and see them standing upon the cold wet sands afraid to couie above highwater inark and exposing themselves to the stonns ot the atautic and let them ask themselves should such things be and then if they imd any lear tnat through a division of their sympathies such things would coutmue to be let them be cautious how they did any thing to create such divisio i he questioned the wisdom although he recognised the nobility of the amendment of his excellent friend mr norris h did not know afiy one that would so rejoice at any division as the duke of buccleugh and his followers and he did hope that it might be avoided he felt as hearty a detestaion ol slavery as any man and he agreed that tha free church rochester n y friday april had not acted quite well in that matter a voice let them send back the money but he thought it would be unwise to depart from the special object of the meeting whicn was to bring public opinion to bear on those in high places cheers aud hisses mr davis went on to argue iu this strain occa p sfonally interrupted bv some slight j hissing and he concluded by reminding ihe disaffected that every serpent that crawled could hiss and advising them to express their sentiments in a less serpentine manner dr begg before the resolution was put begged to say a few words they were come there for the purpose of considering a particular point upon which as far as he could understand they were all agreed but a new point had been introduced upon which as he un j derstood it they could not agree hei must in honesty tel them that he did not agree and unless he got new light he could not agree lii respect to the iniquity of slavery he went all the way with them hear he held it to be an abomination wholly irreconcilable with every principle of reason and scripture cheers but then the mode of dealing i with slavery and the slave trade was altogether another matter let them look back to the time when they hadj slavery in their own colonies did they j excommunicate men because they were connected with it did they pledge i themselves to reject all produce which had had connection with slavery or did they do so now except as far as it concerned the free church was there a man who wore a cotton shirt or who took a pinch of snuff or a whifi of tobacco who did not know it was connected with slavery and was there a man who refused the use of those arlicles because of that connection hear he had travelled through the united states and the system of slavery existed in vari ius parts and was ramified through all parts and yet ji would it he denied that in that couutry there were many noble christian people if th y were to proceed upon the system now promulgated if they were to ask aud examine every man to see if lie had any til ng to do with that system if they were to trace the genealogy of every dollar and reject all w hich had been in any way connected with slavery he w uld defy any man to go through america applause and hisses ifthey were to put a man to every chapel door to scrutinize every sliil ling how could the thing work the point introduced was one upon which i they must allow the free church to differ till they had better light for noman could say that the question was so simple so free from difficulty and doubt as at first might appear he hoped there would be no want of unity be i cause they could not quite agree upon the question of which was the best way to overthrow slavery hut however j much he valued the good opinion of others lie had made too many sacrifices for the sake of the truth to be driven ji into a course he could not approve the church in scotland had testified to the churches in america that they were guilty of a great dereliction of duty in not using their most strennous  efforts to put down the abominable sys  tem and they hoped that it would soon have an end the reverend doctor concluded by reminding the meeting that the nonconformists of the three kingdoms stood in a most perilous posii tion and that there never was a period when there was greater need of a complete union mr crighton admitted that the position of the southern states ot america was a most equivocal one and that after the remonstrances of the free church they stood in a different position from that which they held when the deputation was sent out he had i in his heart as great an abomination ot slavery as anyone but he differed as to the best mode of abolishing it and believed that the extreme abolitionists had takn an injudicious course and that they kept lack the good work he gave mr norris all credit for good intention hut he questioned the policy ot i his proceeding which he considered l powerfully calculated to strengthen the course taken by the duke of buccleugh ii and their persecutors iu scotland hear aud no mr norris came forward to reply i but was interrupted by the chairman j land by mingled applause and cries ofj j sit down i the chairman said when he asked mr norris if hi speech referred to the motion which had been read he replied that it did he the chan man did juot consider the introduction of a totally rew topic into the buiness of the evening a fair carrying out of the statement which mr norris then made applause i and disapprobation had he been aware that a new topic was to have i been introduced lie should have rei signed the chair and for this reason that he did not consider it right generous or just where a meeting had been called for a specific object to introduce some other object cheers and oh he begged to enter his protest against a practice which not right in itself had of late made public meetings a byword and an object of reproach they would give up oue of the strongholds j of their liberty and would be allowing the platform of public meetings to slide from under their feet if they allowed topics to be introduced for discussion different from those for which the meet as were held and be must repeat that bad he been aware that mr norms was not going to speak to the resolution he should lave the chair i the course taken had altogether weakened the influence of the meeting and what must be iu effect upon the deputation they were men like themselves with feelings and passions ir capable of being raised or depressed and would they be likely after wha had taken place to go forth encou t raged or discouraged bear and lei them send back the money the i mischief would not merely lie in wbai j would appear in the public papers bui it would be more deeply seated it would t weigh down the hearts of those who r were required to go forth as the champions of religious freedom he coni sidered that mr nrris had done wrong and whether he should be heard again must be determined by the meeting m the chairman then put it to the j meeting whether mr norris should bel again heard add the show of hands numbered about three to one against hearing him ij mr norris amidst some interruption called upon the press to record his protest against the chairmanship of that i night the amendment was than put and having been rejected by about the same majority as on the previous division i the original motion was adopted i a collection was then made but wei i are informed that only s was raised i j extracts from a pamphlet entitled libtnathe condition and prospect oj that republic made from actual observation by elderss ball the climate of ihc country at the time of my arrival it was early in the rainy season or african winter which commences about the latter part of the month of april and lasts about six months i did not find the weather so hot there as i have felt it in the states at the same season the thermometor stood generally at deg and there were constantly fine sea aud land breezes blowing but notwithstanding it did not seem so hot there as we often feel it here the sun seemed to have a different effect upon a person thereto what it has in this country it is regarded dangerous for any one to walkout without an umbrella over him from nine oclock in the morning until four oclock in the afternoon this i suppose is owing to the situation of liberia as it lies in g deg min north latitude i was told by some of its citizens that the thermometor never stands higher than deg in the driest or summer season but averages about sg deg the summer through the rams there during the winter season i are not so incessant as wholly to prevent its inhabitants from attending to business it is seldom lam told that a person cannot work half a day during the rainy season as to tne diseases of the country i do not think them so complicated and various as in our own country with regard to the african fever it is a disease that is not considered very dangerous where the patient can have proper medical attend i ance comfortable lodgings nursing and nourishment but where this cannot be had it is regarded as a most maiig i riant disease as to other diseases i believe that colds are the most that the people suffer with soil l take the tends in mes surado county rs a fair sp c men of the lands throughout the republic except in grand rassa county which i think is better for coffee the following description i think essentially correct though some of it seems tome rather highly drawn it is in the languaage of a distinguished residentthe rev hilary teage the soil where monrovia is situated is sterile comprised principally of detritus and the remains of decayed vegetable matter this soil is very shallow and rests on a sub i stratum of solid rock the cape therefore is not at ail adapted to agricultural pursuits leaving this and proceeding up st pauls river you come to soil on either side of the river to the distance i have traveled about fifteen miles as fertile and as fat and productive as any to be found on the face of the earth ido not mean to say that there are no barren spots or marshes these are to be found in all other countries but i take a general view of the whole face of the country reflection upon one fact will attest the truth of what i say the w hole face of the country is covered with a dense forest nature here robes herselt in her mantle of green twice every year of ourse the earth must twice each year groan under the burden of leaves and other vegetable substances which these semiannual falls impose upon it i these under the actiou of heavy dews by night and heat hy day are soon decomposed and return a large contribution to feed the soil agricultural improvementas to the improvement in agriculture it is as far as could reasonably be expected under the same circumstances it must be recollected however that there are no horses asses mules or oxen at work there all the farming operations art carried on with the hoe and such like implements i saw but one horse in all the republic and he was a mere skel i eton the experiment has been tried of importing horses from the interior and the windward and the united states and they have all died in going through the acclimation but i was informed by gen lewis that they wert about getting a horse from the leeward that would stand their climate as to cows sheep goats and hogs they could have them in abundance if more attention was paid to that branch of husbandry production these farms as a general thing were producing in abundance all the vegetable and fruits indi fenuous to that country such as rice ndian corn cassada sweet potatoes cabbage beans pumpkins tomatoes cucumbers melons of different kinds arrow root penper sugar cane and cotton all of these require cultivation of fruits there are the orange sou sops paw paw mango plumb pun i apples and cocoa nut these also require cultivation the coffee grow tine there and fields abundantly and o a very fine quality the palm trr grows spontaneously out of which i produced the palm oil pahn wine th palm cabbage and the palm butter buildings the h uses are constructed generally of stone brick m frame in monrovia the state house and methodist baptist and prcsbyte rian churches besides two oilier edifices for school jmrposcs are all o stone the presidents house and hke wise judge benedicts are of brick the wealthy people about monrovia and throughout the republic as a general thing live in good houses but among the poorer inhabitants you may find riohv houses const meted after the african style of bamboo and thatch style of tiring the style of living among the wealthy colonists is very fine this of course is attended with considerable expense which the poor cannot support and in addition to this they have just as many servants as they wish and there seems to be as much distinction made between the rich and poor there as there is in this country among he whites this causes many i who go to that country to be greatly disappointed as they are led to believe before leaving here that they would be recieved with open arms and placed upon an equality with the very best families in liberia and they would be i in a few years be promoted to office c irrespective of any quaiilienti ns to move in this style or till those lli ces but this is not the case in every such instance let the truth be told say to the poor and ignorant such as the great majority of those wh go there are you will there be allowed to exercise the elective franchise but after this ail will depend upon your qualifications and in this respect liberia is generally considered aristocratic religion ln point of rcligio in monrovia there are three churchesmeth odist baptist and presbyterian communicants in the baptist church to elder boston drayton pastor in the methodist church rev james s payne pastor in the presbyterian church ii rev harrison w kilts pastor these churches are all supplied with pastors from the different missionary soci ties in this c untry except that ofthc methodists of which i know nothing with respect morals of the people they seerneu i be good i never heard less profane lan i guage or saw less intemperance in the same length of time in all my life as to sabbath school they are generally good in monrovia there is a school in each church in the baptist church in the morning they hold one for the american children of about j thirty scholars ten of them native children there is also one one in the methodist church in the morning for american children of about forty scholars and in the afternoon for natives lof about eighty scholars there is also l one in the presbyterian church for american children under the superin tcndance of b v r

natives in and adjacent ito all the towns and settlements that j visited thr ughout the republic they j roaui about in their country dress and look contented and happy some are engaged in loading and

it to the house this amendment it is thought was penned by calhoun it extended the revenue laws ot the tinted states over tiie territories of california and new mexico and in so many words recognized the coast wise slave trade under this provision the slaveholders would introduce their slaves into the territory and would claim its authority to hold them and judges in the territory would sustain the claim holding as they would be compelled to that the right to introduce them would give them the right and authority to hold them after they got there that southern men were intending to make a

to sustain and carry it through on saturday the measure was disscussed in the committee of the whole and in tlie afternoon a recess was had on the coming in of ttie house at half past in the evening the southern men boldly asserted that they could carry it and that they had got enough of northern men pledged to cany it through they went so far as to name the men the free soil men went and

should lad to get their salaries at this stage of the matter they w ere almost compelled to give up iff hope mr g said he might as well tell the whole truth which was that the free soil men had pledged themselves to each other to prevent its passage at ail hazards that they were prepared to make motions call ayes and noes c until the session should expire by its own limitation that they were preurared to go with gen wilson of new hampshire and see the wheel of government slop and stand still to ee the union dissolved yea to see the universe itself dissolved rather than see slavery wrong

correspondence syracuse april th my dear friendsl have just time to let you know of my whereabouts and to say a word of my meetings thus far my first was held at seneca falls in the wesleyan chapel i found mr phillips the minister as usual on hand warmly interested and ardently laboring to promote the cause at tire time appointed the house was crowded with a very respectable audience all apparently anxious to hear and to be instructed with such an audience and such a subject it was impossible to be cold and lifeless the meeting continued for more than two hours at the close obtained eight subscribers to the north star thursday i went to auburn through the kind agency of my friend e capron a meeting had been appointed for me in the old fniversalist church for that evening the house is small and was well filled i have no doubt that good was done by the meeting auburn has long been accounted bard soil for antislavery truth but to my mind there are few places where a more generous hearing will be extended to an antislavery laborer on friday my kind friend j w quincy hired a carriage and took me to my next appointment atskanealeles here too a large audience greeted me and gave me a respectful hearing skaneateles has greatly improved in its tone on the subject of slavery since i visited that town four years ago it had the appearance of a real slaveholding townin which the black man could not enter without being assailed by j thoughtless boys and brutal young men whol seemed to take delight in manifesting disrci sped and contempt for what in sheer rudeness they called a nigger we passed through the village this time without meeting any of the usual marks of semibarbarism that formerly distinguished that town much of this change was wrought by that fast faithful and noble friend of the slave now gone to his rest james canning fuller who iu early antislavery times was several limes mobbed on account of bis abolition principles and practice hut he is new gone to his rest it was sad to j be there without his presence to cheer and encourage me in the good work to which he was devoted yet it was grateful to fierceive that what he achieved lived after him was met at skaneateles by david spalding from borodino whokindlv came to convey me from the burner to the latter ot my appointments and alter meeting he took mein bis wagon and loot in me on to lus house eight miles toward barodino the meeting was held iu the methodist church and was well attended jnat on sunday was held in the baptist church and was equally well attended my visit iu borodino was a very pleasant one mr spalding and family know well how to make the weary stranger at home and i left fe ling grateful forth sr kind attentions and the aid they mutually rendered rue the antislavery lecturer need never fear to l go to the home of david spalding for though unpretending and in humble ctrcumsuuces he lakes sincere pleasure m lending a helping hand to all devoted laborers in ibis cause there is a meeting appointed fx me tin evening in i be googrefationil chunk ofthis i place u will pwteire that all my meeting ho far hare taken place ia churches thi ij uke to be a hopeful atga of the times a few months ago it was difficult to get the doers of the church on this subject and it may be so still in most places but thus far on my tour meetings have bees held ia ehurehes without a single exception t ant now at the house of my esteemed friend samuel j may vours sincerely f d respecting he meeting at syracuse mr may says dear sirl am happy to say that we had a very large audience on last evening and j mr douglass addressed them an more thanan hour in a very able manner i hare sometimes heard from him passages of greater eloquence but never a discourse that was sowell sustained throughout aa this he has just left my house for new york s j m domestic economy under the head of domestic economy wei intend to continue such articles as pertain to the business enterprise of our people sod i although this properly belongs to another classification we prefer uf treat it under the above head as it connectedly belongs to the subject of domestic economy as adduced by us in adducing the following subject we do not intend to treat it elaborately aa this we shall do in another place but design barely to correct a long established error and te move what is to our people an insurmountable difficulty thereby clearing away the barrier and dispelling the gloom in which we have been so long enshrouded as the greatest j obstacles to our elevation prayer we are taught is allsufficient for all things this we also assure our readers is not the case never was there a grosser or more palpable absurdity and the writer of this is perfectly willing to hazard his reputation for the good of his brethren and run the risk of being branded by bigots and hypocrites as a sceptic and infidel in giving this a positive contradiction it may be orthodox so to believe but it is not in accordance with commonsense it may be enjoined as revelation bat it is at variance with truth and contrary to reason and fact there are three distinct laws by which god rules the destinies of man these are the spiritual law the moral law and the physical law these laws are as immutable as invariable as god himself and without a strict conformity to one or the other nothing can be effected all that is or can be must be done in accordance with and can only be of the same nature of thelaw to which it conforms hence a physical or temporal end cannot be attained by a spiritual means nor can a spiritual end be attained by a physical means there is no effect without a cause and every cause must be adequate to the effect produced therefore there can be no end without a means and every means used must be adequate to the end to be attained thus a barrel of flour requires a man or person of certain strength to lift it without which force or power it could not be raised the force or power applied is the means and the barrel of flour the end to be attained in this case hence the means were equal to the end the barrel of flour had to be lifteda certain force was necessary a child or weak ly person could not have done itnothing could have accomplished it but which was equal to the task in like manner are all things effected or accomplishedmeans and ends equal to each other prayer is a spiritual means used in conformity to the spiritual law and can only be instrumental in attaining a spiritual end this we wish to be distinctly understood and nothing ever was ever can or evfer will be effected by it but that whichw spiritual the physical wants nor temporal demands of man ever can be supplied by it infidel you cry but stay good brother say we truth is mighty and will prevail yes truth crushed to earth shall rise again the eternal years of god are hers while error wounded writhes fn pain and dies amid her worshippers all miracles were wrought for spiritual purposesto show and establish the power of god to those who doubted and disbelieved and not in any case to supply the temporal or physical wants of man miracles being of i that order of gods ordinances beyond the comprehension of man and altogether spiritual in their tendency we shall not spend time in treating of them in this place we are told that christ taught us to pray give us this day our daily bread cand and that this or some other prayer is necessary to the attainment of our bread or whatever else we desire tiiis is also a mistake an awkward blunder in our scriptural exponents and theological demonstrators albeit as christians we hold that mau should at all times that is daily return or give thanks to god the author of his being for the abundance of his goodness in all things but this injunction like many of ins precepts was given expres ly to his disciples they were taught to daily ask to be fed w ith the bread of heaven upon which to feast their souls to fit and prepare them for their love and mercy and this appeared to be necessarywas it not reasonable that men such as they were fresh from the unrestrained multitude of trafickers who swarmed the region of judea and called to a vocation so high and holy should receive an admonition to daily look to heaven for aid and sustenance in the propagation of those great truths it is reasonable and christ had reference to heavenly bread and no other that it meant no other than spiritual bread it requires but little argument to show i player be the means by which a temporal oi physical end be attained if it be at all a means by which such cods are attained why iu the name of justice is there not more accomplished by the prayerful and faithful why have not piaying people the manifold abundance of this worlds possessions l nay verily because prayer u not the meant by which such ends are attainable prayer beif purely spiritual only pertains to those things that are spiritual and can efiect nothing but that which ia spiritual it can neither fell a tree nor lift a barrel of door it w ill be readily admitted by the colored people at least that slaveholders are general ery wicked men many of them confirmed ufcdla and the greater part of them gamb lets rs bbihbr taker fornicator and adulterer all added to the doable m and a tji damnation that await them for nunsieahg and bartering away humanity and trafficking in tlie blood of soula also that ti c slaves gcreraljy are a pioua and religious people no one will deoy how thru can you and we pot the question to you as colored people those whohave suffered tenfold w rung bow can vou reconcile yourselves to these facta facta which challenge and defy contradiction that the slave who prays has not only got nothing but dare not lay claim to bis own personto the affectumis of las own wife and children while the wicked master the infidel wretch who neither prays uor believes in the existence of a god possesses power almost unlimited mean of ll kinds lands money and wealth in abundance besides owning the very bodies and souls as it were of the people who depend upon prayer as a means we address ourselves to your common sense and reason and ask you brethren colored people in gods namein the name of a degenerate racein the name of outraged humanityin the name of our future prospectsin the name of the destinies of our oppressed peoplein the name of a debased intellect in the much abused name of insulted intelli geace howcan you reconcile yourselves to such a glaring contradiction a contradiction as clear as the sun at high meridian the slave may in the agony ofhis wounded soul and goodness of a believing heart fall upon his knees and clasping his handscry out pray master forgive me this offence then raising his eyes to heaven how longo lord most mightyhow long shall i thus continue to suffer o when shall the day of my deliverance come and while heis thus pathetically supplicating rending both heaven and earth with his appeals of misery the infernal monster with the blasphemy of hell upon his polluted lips and the punishing rod of a fiend in his hand deaf to ali entreaties and cries of mercy will continue to lacerate scourge and lay open the naked flesh until the bleeding mangled victim falls exhausted at his feet all this is actually done yea daily takes place somewhere in ihe the south while the simplehearted ignorant slave is calling upon high heaven for aid and assistance and why we ask in the name of god and all the just made perfect why are not these prayers and supplications answered simply because prayer and faith are not the means to be made use of in such a case prayer is a spiritual means intended only to answer spiritual ends when the slave called upon god from the depths of his soul to forgive and pardon his sinsto comfort and refresh his spirits god heard and answered him but in this prayer and supplication for deliverance from the iron grasp of a hardhearted task master and ruthless tyrant god answered not his prayer because it was improperly applied it was wrong means to be used in such a case the inhuman despotism of the demon master toward the slave was a temporal and physical act and required temporal and physical means to prevent it the master and slaves are both human beings endowed with the same facultiesa corporeal or physical system with limbs having bones muscles and tendons which give strength to the system as the punishment of the slave was physical inflicted by strength so should it have been met by physical force and prevented by strength had the slave instead of falling upon his knees looking up to heaven for assistance have seized his master held him fast tiirust him aside or taken to his heels in all or either of these cases he may have been successful in arresting the punishment the proper means to be made use of in such a case physical ends we honestly and sincerely assure you brethren can only be successfully attained by physical means and itis the height of follyit is blind madness to believe any thing else further argument is useless we have now transcended the bounds to which we had limited ourselves our sole and only object is to disabuse the minds of our brethren of the miserable heresies which they have been taught by the enemies of our race to unplug their ears and tear away the veil from their eyes to ihe scenes the sufferings the groans and wailings of outraged and downtrodde humanity the slaveholding and proslavery high priests of infamy may for sinister motives so teach as true doctiine and sound orthodoxy the while theologian may if he can induce colored people to depend upon faith and prayer to accomplish their earthly desires for them believing them to be tit means and our brethren may if they will so stubbornly persist in believing but we can assure them that the whites v ho so teach do not believe it themselves but if they did it is not the truth being at variance with every known fact and all human experience it i high time brethren we had begun to think for ourselves we have had others long enough to think for us while the proslavery whites can keep us satisfied in depending upon prayer and looking to heaven for all we desire in this world there are no fears that we will ever be in their way other thanas a nuisance w hen it is the easiest thing in the world to get rid of us by sending us away to distant parts things should be dealt with just as persons please and if we will be things why let us be accordingly dealt with brethren our object ia

they are for the most part in advance of the public hence they cannot be otherwise than unpopular and that which is unpopular cannot be expected to meet with very paitieular favor especially in such a cause as that espoused by the noth stas to render such a paper useful it should aa extensively as possible be circulated among the colored people of the lnited states without which it could not be more effective than any other antislavery paper upon them then ia such s paper mainly dependant for support were there white subscribers sufficient who were willing to sustain this or any other papdpfon ducted by colored men devoted to the elevation of their race that would not reach the object aimed at because the colored people themselves would still le deprived of its benefits and occupying the same nonentical indifferent position having others to think act read and do for them but this is not even the case the few friends who are willing to aid us in our arduous undertaking are so burdened with papers of their own papers necessary to the sustenance of th great antislavery cause at large that the mot that might be expected of them would bo to assist us at the commencement and reasonably enough expect us to sustain ourselves thereafter what we now design to do is to sot this matter in a clear light before the public and our readers everywhere of all classes anti show them that it is morally impossible in the present state of society or condition of the colored people of this country for them to sustain an ably conducted and efficient newspaper among them to this end and purpose we shall present a statistical account in which there can be no mistake there are now in the united states about free colored people five sixths of whom being women and children we have and a fraction who are men or heads of families and as one third of this number at least belong to the southern states we h ive but g and a fraction who dare take a newspaper such as ours of this number at least two thirds male adults and we make quite a libsral allowance cannot read so that there are only and a fraction qualified to understand anything in it ofthe twentythousand and odd there are and we consider this the smallest figure at least three fourths who from various causes perhaps religious and others combined are totally indifferent to the existence of a paper among us so that we have really but or thereabout who may be considered interested ir such enterprizes of these one half may b accounted as too limited in means to justify them in subscribing for and sustaining a pub lie journal though it may be devoted to thei welfare hence all told and this is a libera figure there cannot possibly be at best mor than colored persons throughout th united states who under any circumstance at present can be reasonably expected to take a newspaper a want of knowledge of these facts is the reason why all papers among us die for want of support those who know anything about our people in this country at all very well know tha the preponderance of the aged by far came from the south the children and in many tn stances the younger people having only learned to read since they came to the north our young women too who are for the mos part readers are generally at service and it could not be expected that young women at service and children could sustain z newspaper were the whole twentyfive hundred t concentrate their patronage upon a good paper it would be insufficient as it requires ai least paying subscribers to sustain tlx north star to give an idea of the average number of our people who subscribe to s newspaper devoted to their interest we wil state for information that new york citv philadelphia where the concentrated intelligence and wealth of oar people in their palmiest days never affoided more thar sever hundred subscribers in either place to thosf papers which then existed in their midst and will not now give an advance of five per cent and no paper at a distance may expect to obtain over two hundred subscribers in eithei place and other towns will rate proportionn hly below these but of the few there are tc support a newspaper these are now called orby the existence of three papers at present among us besides other antislavery papers and how can they exist they cannot nndei existing circumstances we have travelled holding meetings among our people almost incessantly during the pasl year and understand their state and condition in many of the states quite familiarly ami are satisfied what can and what cannot hedone in this enterprize now that we cunnot do without and must have an efficient newspaper among us is beyond a question bm how shall it be sustained is the mst important inquiry to us as an individual and we risk nothing by asserting the same for our colleague it does not matter who the persons are who stand at the helm so that they are fully competent and adequate to the task colored men we think they should lie in this instance because it is peculiarly the colored peoples cause but let them be good and true true to their brethren and then god true to god and humanity we have no personal ambition in the matter and we repeat w hat we say for one we venture to say for both all that we desire is to see the cause pressed onward in sturdy inarch te success and victory a newspaper to be well sustained and kept up among the colored people should be conducted by men of easy circumstances as sir years experience in connexion with the pres has convinced us they should have a support solely independent of the proceeds of the subscription to their paper to us it was always a losing concern as we then supported ourselves by other business giving our services gratuitously as editor besides contributing to

of mr clay that the emancipated slaves who shall colonise liberia will probably spread the christian religion through the whole continent of africa it seems probable that such is the glorius mission

to enjoy our hare of the elegancies and luxuries of this life we found ourselves surrounded bv a good many who before were not over liberal in their attentions mrs sunderland believed their friendship sincere but l reserved to myself the nght to doubt the genuineness of some of the professions that were made i didnt like the my dear mrs sunderland or the particular solicitude expressed by not a few in anything that concerned my wifes welfare and when he talked about mrs jones being such a kind good soul and miss peters being so diseoterested in everything i shrugged my shoulders and reserved the privilege of a dubt in regard to all being gold that glittered no having been raised in fashionable life wc had no taste for display and although we had our share of company whether we cared about it or noi we had never ventured so to sea as tc give a party although we had accepted several invitations to assemblages ol this kind but some of mrs sunder lands good friends and acquaintances insisted upon it last winter that she give an entertainment and they used such cogent arguments that she good soul was won over i remained for a longtime incorrigible but as nothing could put it out ot mvf sunderland ahead that it was due to her position and relations to give a party i with much reluctance withdrew my oppsi tion and forthwith the note of preparation was sounded who shall we invite was the first question our circle of acquaintances had considerably increased within two or three years and when we went over the list it was found to be rather large you will have to cut it down considerably said ito do so without giving offence will be difficult replied my wife better cut all off then was on my tongue but i repressed the words feelin that it would be unkind to throw cold water upon the affair at this stage of its progress you havent got fanny and ellen on your list i remarked after a good number of erasures had been made they were two of my nieces good girls but poor both were dress makers apprentices they were learning a trade in order to relieve their father an industrious but not very thrifty man from the burden of their support i liked them very much for their good sense agreeable manners and strong affection for their parents shall i invite them inquired my wife certainly replied why not will they be able to make a good appearance you know uiui a nuinbei of fashionable people w ill be here it you doubt it we will send then each a handsome dress pattern wit the invitation perhaps wc had better do so was mrs sunderlands approving remark and the thing was done as i suggested the pruning down of the invitatior list was no easy matter ahd it was no without many fears of giving offence that my wife at last fixed upon the precise number of persons who were t honor us with their company the exact character of the entertainment was next to be considered and ar estimate cost was made several ladies an fait in such matters were consulted and their opinions compared digested and adopted or rejected as they agreed with or differed from what we thought right it will cost at least a hundred dollars said mrs sunderland after we had come to some understanding as to what we would have the sum seemed large in her mind if we get off with two hundred we may be thankful i replied oh no it cant go above a hun dred dollars we shall see if i thought it would cost so much i would there is no retreat now mrs sunderland we have taken the step initiative and have nothing to do but go through with the matter as best we can my word for it we shall not be very eagre to give another party this threw a damper upon my wifes feelings that i was sorry to perceive for now that the party must be given wanted to see it done in as good spirit as possible from that time therefore i was careful not to say any thing likely to awaken a doubt as to the satisfactory result of the coming entertain ment the evening came in due time and we bad all tilings ready i must own that i felt a little excited for the giving of a fashionable party was something new in the history of my life and i did not feel altogether at home in the matter unaccustomed to the entertainment of company especially where ceremony and the observance of a certain etiquette were involved i was conscious of au awkward feeling and would have given double the cost of the party for the privilege of an escape from the trials and the mortifications it promised to involve in order to give additional beauty and attractiveness to our parlors we had purchased sundry articles ot ornamental furniture which cost over a hundred dollars and which were of no manner of use except to look ati it w as so late before the elite of our company began to arrive that we were in some doubt whether they were going to come at all but towards nine oclock the came along and by ten w e were in the full tide of successful experiment my neices fanny and ellen were among the first to appear und they looked pretty and in teresting as soon us the first embarrassment consequent ou the appearance of the extra fashionables had worn off andi felt at home once more in my own house began to look around with an observant eeabout the first thing that attracted my attention was the ober aspect of a certain lady arbose husband by a few fortunate adventures had acquired some money and lifted her into good society as it in called she was talking to another lady and i saw that their eyes were directed toward my nieces of whom i felt a little proud they looked and behaved so well whats all this aboutsaid i to rm sell and i kept my eyes as intently upon the ladies as they did upoo ellen and fanny presently i saw one of them toss her head with an air of dignified contempt and rising up made her way across the room to where her husband stood she spoke to him in evident excitement and directed his attention to my nieces the sight of them did not seem to produce any unpleasant effect upon him for he merely shrugged his shoulders smiled and answered in a few words that i could see were indifferent but his wife was in earnest and placing her arm within his drew him away towards the door he remonstrated but she was not in a humor to listen to any thing and with surprise i saw them retire from the parlors my first impulse was to follow them but the truth flashing across my mind i felt indignant at such conduct and resolved to let them do as they pleased in a little while the offended lady bonnetted cloaked and boaed came sweeping past the parlor doors with her husband in the train attracting the attention of a third part of the company a moment after and she had passed into the street who isthat whats the matter went whispering about the room it is mrs l mrs l is she sick why has she gone but no one seemed at first to know soon however the lady to whom she had communicated the act that we had insulted our company by inviting rnantuamaking girls whispered to another the secret and away it went buzzing through the room finding its way as well to the ears of fanny and ellen as to those of the rest of the company about one hall ot the ladies present did not exactly seem to know whether they ought to follow the example of mrs l or not and there i was a portentous movement when almost the waving of a finger would have caused our party to break up in dis order the moment my nieces understood the feeling that had prompted the lady to withdraw indignantly they arose and were retiring from the room when i intercepted and detained them with as little ceremony as possible they begged hard to be permitted to retire but i said no for my blood was upas the saying is ellen and fanny are worth as many mrs l s said i to myself as you can find from here to jeri cho the disaffected ones noticed i suppose my decision in the matter aud thought it prudent not to break wit mr and mrs sunderland who coulc afford to be independent money is t great thing humph there was t time in our historybut no matter we are people of character and standing now wc had rather a dull time after thi withdrawal of mrs l foralitth while the spirits of the company rallied under the effects of wine and a gooc supper but they soon flagged again and a sober cast of thought settlec upon almost every countenance mj poor wife lound it almost impossible tc retain a cheerful exterior and mj nieces looked as if almost any othei place in the world would have been i paradise to it at least an hour earlier than we hac anticipated our rooms were deserted and we left alone with our thoughts which upon the whole were anything but agreeable mrs sunderland the moment the last guest retired wem back into the brilliantly lighted parlors and sitting down upon a sofa bursi into tears she had promised hersel much pleasure but alas how bitterly had she been disappointed i was ex i cited and indignant enough to say almost anything and a dozen times as paced the rooms backward and f rward did i check myself when about uttering words that would only have made poor mrs sunderland feel ten times worse than she did the next time we give a party we wont said i taking the words out of my wifes inouth she was recovering from her state of mortr fication and beginning to feel indig nant youve said it exactly respondee mrs sunderland i call this throwing awav a couple of hundred dollars in i very bad cause so it strikes me when fifty i sixty people eat an elegant sup perj and drink costly wine at iny ex pense again they will behave thein i selves better than some high bredi ladies did to nightas for mrs l fanny and een are worth a hundred of her its my opinion that if she knew anything she would curtail her dignity a little if im not very much mistaken her husband will go to the wall before a twelve month passes on the next day we settled all accounts with our confectioner wine merchant china dealers and waiters the bills were over a hundred and fifty dollars exclusive of a hundred dollars paid as before intimated for parlor ornaments to grace the occasion so much paid tor worl liy wisdom said i after all was over i dont think we need to give another party mrs sunderland sighed and shook her headpoor soul her kind and generous nature was hurt she looked upon a new phase of character and the discovery had wounded her deeply a few months after this uofortuaate party from which so little pleasure and so much pain had sprung said to iny wile on coming home one day lt is as expected pride must have a fall why do you say that what has happened inquired mrs sunderland l has failed as i predicted and his lady wife who turned up her aristocratic nose at our excellent nieces is likely to see the day when abe will stand far below them in aociety i spoke in an exultant voice bui my wife instantly reproved my levity she cherished no animosities end had long since forgiven the offence so much for my wifes petty the little hatchgirl by the part averse it was so terribly coldit snowed and the eveniug began to be dark it was also the last evening in the year new years eve on this cold dark evening a poor little girl went into the street with bare head and raked feet it is true she had shoes on when she went from home but of what use were they they were very large shoes her mother had worn them last they were too large and the little one lost them in harrying over the street as two carriages passed quickly by one shoe was not to be found and the other a boy ran away with saying he could use it for a cradle when he had children himself the little girl now went on her small naked feet which were red and blue with the cold she carried a number of matches in an old apron and held one buudle in her hand no one had bought of her the whole day no one had given her a tarthing poor thing she was hungry and benumbed with cold and looked so downcast the snowflakes fell on heryellow hair which curled so prettily around her neck but she did not heed that the light shone out from all the windows and there was such a delicious smell of roast beef m the street it was a new years eve and she thought of that she sat down in a corner between two houses the one stood a little more forward in the street than the other and drew up her legs under her to warm herself but she was still colder and she durst not go home she had not sold any matches nor got a single farthingher father would beat her and it w as also cold at home they had only the roof directly over them and there the wind whistled in although straw and rags were stuffed in the largest crevices her little hands wrere almost benumbed with cold ah a little match might do som good durst she only draw one out ol the bundle strike it on the wall and warm her fingers she drew one out richhow it burnt it was a warm clear flame like that ofa little candle when she held her hand around it it teas a strange light the little girl thought she sat by a large iron stove with brass balls on the top the fire burned so nicely and warmed sowell nay what was that the little girl stretched out her feet to warm them to when tee flarne went out the stove vanished and she sat with a stump of the burnt match in her hand another was struck it burnt it shone and where the light fell on the wall it became as transparent as crape she looked directly into the room where the roasted goose stuffed with apples and prunes steamed so charming on the table which was laid out and covered with a shining white cloth and fine porcelain service what was stillmore splendid the goose sprung off the dish and waddled along the floor wth knife and fork in its back it came directly up to the poor girl here the match went out and there was only the thick cold wall to be seen she struck another match then she sat under the most c iarming christ mastree it was still larger and more ornamental than that she had seen thro the glass door at the rich merchants the last christmas a thousand candles burnt on the green branches and motley pictures like those which ornament the shopwindows looked down at her the little girl lifted up both her hands then the match was extinguished the many christmas candles rose higher and higher she saw that they were bright starsone of them fell and made a fiery stripe in the sky now one dies said the poor girl for old grandmother who alone had been kind to her but who was now dead had told her that when a star falls a soul goes up to god she again struck a match against the wall it shone all around and her old grandmother stood in the lustre so i shining so mild and blissful grand mother exclaimed the little girloh take me with you i know you will begone away when the matches go out like the warm stove the delicious roast goose and the delightful christmas tree and she struck in haste the i whole remainder of matches that was in the buudleshe would not lose sight ofgrandrnother and the matches shone with such brilliancy that it was clearer than in broad day light grandmother had never before looked so pretty so great she lifted the poor little girl up in her arms and they flew so high in splendor and joy where was no cold no hunger no anxiety they icere i riih god but the little girl sat in the corner by the house in the cold morning hour with red cheeks and with a smile rouud her mouthdeadfrozen to death the last evening of the old year new years morning rose over the little corpse as it sat with the matches of which a bundle was burnt she had been trying to warm herself saidi they but no one knew what beautiful things she had seenin what splendor and gladness she had entered with herold grandmother into new years joy prison discipline chas pearson esq m p has created a deep sensation in london by a course of
