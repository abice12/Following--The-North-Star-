slavery and the slave trade h the district of columbia the following letter from our distinguished fellowcitizen lr howe was as we understand addressed toon of his english friends and companions in the liberation of greece it j lias found its way into print in england we copy it from an english pamphlet j entitled slavery at washington narrative ot the heroic adventures of drayton an american trader in the pearl coasting vessel which was captured by american citizens near the mouth ofthe potomac having on boare seventyseven nen women and children endeavoring to escape irom slavery in the capital of the american republic in a letter from dr s g howe u together with the proceedings upon capt draytons trial and conviction ir all who are familiar with dr howe s philanthropic character particularly as shown in his participation for seven years in the var of greek independence and in his more recent efforts for the blind will readily unders and that his feelings must be strongly moved in behall of the slave boston jun th my dear i am pleased to hear by your last letter that the views i expressed concerning the mexican war meet your approbation i know sowell your liberal views of this country and its institutions and your friendly regard for me that i am sure you will not misunderstand me whem i seem to peak disparagingly of what by almost common consent men uphold through evil report and through good report sometimes when i read the praise bestowed on us by foreigners i feel as an american that sort of guilty shame which one feels upon receiving praise which he knows he is utterly unworthy of i love my country i cannot if i would break the tender ties which naturally bind one to the land ot ones birth and the home of ones childhood hut i hope have outgrown that selfish and blind love which arrogates to itself the name of patrotism which is born of egotism and nurtured by ignorance and which in its turn begets abrood of evil passions out of which come hatred strife and war lore my country but i love the world more i love my countrymen but love humanity better i would tain promote the prosperity of americans but not at the expense of th interests and happiness of europeans asiatics and africanscertainly not at the expense ot right as for that vulgar love of notoriety that enlargement and extension of individual vanity which makes one covet for ones country at whatever price the admiration and envy ot other countriesglory honor and the likeot course have put oft uch childish things only let my countrymen do right act nobly and carry into public alfatrs the sublime mordtity which makes the man do uuto others as lie would be done by and i will gladly leave the the houui mid glory to nations who still delight in the sounding brass and tinkling cymbals if there was anything which justified americans in their feelings of national ft ride it was that their country was ooked to as a place of retuge fer those fine spirits of europe who could not brook the religious bigotry or political intolerance which forbade all hope of j progress at home but surely we can j make no such boast now for at this moment the spirit of reform and progress is abroad all over the the nations of europe and in some respects they the north star are teaching uato admire them and t be ashamed ot ours lavas for instance have lately returned from washington and cannot help blushing at um thought that tt is the only capital wee of constantinople where tyranoy ant oppression dare manifest themselvei openly and where despotism in broac day rivets the chains upon millions oi slaves and forges new ones for unborn generations yes washington hat not only its slave market where men and women are bought and sold like cattle but its halls for legislation in which laws are deliberately framed to perpetuate and extend slavery j through coutles ages and over vast regions of now unpeopled territory how can one boast of his americanism when he is obliged either to re j nounce his allegiance or to become in his capacity of citizen a jailer and punish men by impriaonment among felons for attempting to do deeds more truly noble and generous than those for which parisians and remans receive the thanks of their country and the praise of the world yes the jail at washington a prisonnot of astate but of the united statesa prison which every citizen of the united states helps to support is used as a place of confinement and punishment of men who struck a blow not for their own freedom but for the freedom of othersfor the rescue of men women and children from a state of slavery the like of which parisian and roman nay russian nor turk never en dured i want to washington mainly to see what could be done for the legal de fence of the three white men who wero imprisoned for attempting to rescue alarge number of slaves aad set them free and i cannot perhaps make my letter more interesting to you than by relating what i have learned about the affair it will be at least in striking contrast with those scenes receutly witnessed by you in rome some time ago a rough hardy generous man named drayton part sailor part trader went to washington in a small coasting vessel under his command while there he became acquainted with a black man who with his wife and five children were held as slaves by a free citizen of this republic drayton became interested in their salvation and yielding to their prayers resolved to attempt their rescue he directed them to come down to the wharf at noonday when he was shout to sail and to mingle among the crowd of idlers who frequent such places they came accordingly aud he contrived to get them one by one down to the companionway unperceived by the bystanders he then closed the hatches cast off from the wharf made sail and bore away his prizes to the state of massachusetts where they now live a free and happy family if this is the true version of the storyand i think it iswe need not wonder that drayton longed to repeat upon a larger scale his practical experiment at emancipation who that has ever done a bold and generous deed but sighed to do another still bolder and more generous last winter he formed the bold and perilous plan of sailing in a small coasting vessel from philadelphia up the potomac river to washington and bringing off by night as many slaves as he could crowd on board they were to be carried down the potomac through that great inland seathe chesapeake bay then up the delaware bay to a point of landing in the state of pennsylvania where carriages were to be in readiness to carry them beyond the reach of pursuit this plan required the aid and assistance of persons of wealth and intelligence and it was found for as you must know many in this country who believe they have no right to interfere with slavery in the independent states of the united states hold that slavery has not even the shadow of legality in the district of columbia because that belongs as much to the free states as to the slave states they say it is our soil and we will do all we can to purge it of the guilt of slavery be this as it may drayton fuid friends who hired a vessel for him called the pearl and supplied the necessary funds the plan was rendered the more perilous because it had to be entrusted to a great number of ignorant negro slaves any one of whom might betray it drayton however undertook to arrange everything and to risk everything asking only that his wife aud children should be provided for in case of the dreadful event of his failure and of his falling into the hands of his enraged enemies he made known his plan to about fifty slaves as many as he thought his frail craft could carry safely in the open sea and though they guarded the secret carefully from every white man they communicated itto so mnay blacks that when drayton came up in the pearl they crowded down to the wharf at midnight in such numbers that he was forced to cast oft suddenly and soon fuund himself with seventyseven men women and children on board besides the two white men who had come with him not a moment was to be lost and away they swept down the broad potomac ffymg for liberty and life from the capital of the freest and most enlightened nation upon the earth and steering dear of every vessel that boro the stars and stripes of the boasted republic the daylight broke upon them and oh god if it is given to the spirits of the just made perfect to linger ibout the scenes of their early lore what must bars been the sight revealed to the spirit of washington on that peace right is of no sextruth of no rgou is the father of us all and all we are brethren ful sabbath morning there skulking under the shadow of hie loved mount vernon fled feet ewey towards the i oceen e freii berk leden with fourscore men women end ctnidrtn i striving to escape from the cruel tyranny which reigned in the city honored by his name their hearts

their hope rising to gladness as they looked forward to the wide ocean as to tb bw zw dering from the egypt they left behind and that city of his founding what an aspect did it present to his benighted but saddened vision what noise and confusion what wrath and cursing what fear and trembling masters and mistresses in rage and despair crying out that they had been robbed and ruined robbed of their hewers of wood and drawers of water robbed of the bones and muscles of their human beasts of burden by tho sweat of whose brows and the toil of whose limbs they had lived in laziness the magistrates hurrying to take counsel the officers beating about upon the scent of the fugitives the slaveholding senators and representatives increasing the turmoil cursing the interference with their right and threatening their compeers from the north who hastened to purge themselves by solemn assurances of want of all knowledge of the plot and all sympathy with the liberators meantime the mob gathers together it swells to thousands arms itself and soes about threatening to emeute the rae presses and drive out the freemen just as the mobs of paris and berlin break in pieces thrones and drive out tyrants five la liberie a baa lea tyrana cry the frenchmen hurrah for slavery down with universal liberty damnation to those who meddle with our slaves cry the americans during all this time no tidings were heard of the runaways and no knowledge was obtained of the direction they had taken but the whole neighborhood had become aroused the slaves who had been out in the night were examined some of them were whipped and amid the din and turmoil ofthe whites were heard the agonizing shrieks of poor wretches who had failed to get on board the pearl until one of thema mere boywas so cut iuto the quick by the cruel cat that be confessed all he knew instantly is steamer was manned by free and fierce j republicans the steam was urged up and away they w ent in hot pursuit j meantime the little pearl had glided down the river many leagues until she approached its broad mouth where it empties itself into the great chesapeake bayan inland seawhich begins to swell with a risirg tempest the night was coming on they had seen no sign of pursuit they thought their course was unknown they gave themselves up to a joyful feeling of security they ran their vessel into a small cove dropped anchor and were soon asleep but the slavehunters were upon their track furious as tigers in the pursuit twice did they pass in their steamboat the little cove and very near the pearl when at last just as their stock of coal was about exhausted they discovered their prey and dashing suddenly onboard took them completely by surprise indeed the most of the negroes worn out with the excitement the hope the pains and the labor ofthe past day and night were asleep under the hatches which were suddenly fastened down upon them then went up the shouts of savage joy and exultation from the captors mingled with the cries and groans of their poor victims as the steamboat took the pearl in tow and sailed proudly in triumph towards the capital of the republic then did the potomac present a scene from the dark drama of the slave trade which if enacted on the thames the seine the neva or even the dardanelles would have roused a storm of indignation in the whole surrounding country yes had these slavehunters approached with their prey so taken in the toils any capital in christendom excepting washingtan they would have been received with hisses and scorn and their victims have been torn from their grasp oy a justly indignant populace but their return to the capital of the republic was hailed as a triumph they were received with shouts of gralula tion a wild joy thrilled through the city the crowd ran eagerly together and hardly could the poor negroes be carried in safety to their prison so eager were the multitude to get hold of drayton and his two white companions and wreak their vengeance upon them i will not dwell upon the sad fate of these poor slaves who catching here and there a word about tho glorious revolutions of europe foolishly thought they too were men and might be free hurried off to the rice and cotton fields of the far south they may have to pine away under the lash wielded by freemen but long as is my letter i must add a word about drayton and bis companions i found great difficulty inbeing admitted to a sight of them for they were subjected to an imprisonment far more clone and cruel than have ever known in this countryeven in the case of murderers by dint however of the influence of two noble members of congress who have dared to standup and stem the torrent of public fury was allowed to enter and aee the men in pretence of the jailer they had

fulness in the light of which neither slave prison nor slavery can be countenanced in the capital of this country the fulness of that day may be nearer than we thnk lor there are so many good men and so many more good women in he souththe pressure of public opinion is becoming so strong the moral feeling is becoming so active the sense of religious duty is becoming so keen tie prickings of conscience are becomiig so sharp and above all the progress of humanity is becoming so rapidthat slavery must soon yield there is one circumstance in the life of lafayette which strikes me as furnishing a remarkable proof of tie inconsistency and guilt of the proceedings against drayton the southern men and even the northern men sty that it is not only wrong and illegal but cowardly to go by night into other states and steal away slaves though they admit the right of the slaves torun away when lafayette was imprisoned at oimutzlegally imprisoned if the austrian government was a legal one an american gentleman made a very gallant and almost suc cesslul attempt to rescue him that attempt was looked upon here as a noble generous and heroic deeds and the author of it would have been carried in triumph from maine to georgia had he been here such was the indignation which was felt at the imprisonment of one man for a political offence aud ch th sympathy with his wpuidrbe rescuer but wnea fourscore men women and children are made slaves for life without any offence and one american drayton attempts their rescue he is hooted at from maine to georgia as a wretch and nothing but the granite walls ol a prison save hint from the fury of a mob to be reserved for the slow vengeance of the law such however is poor humanity such is the result of ignorance error and wrong may god hasten the day when they shall give place to knowledge and truth yours cs g howe from the portland transcript progress of reforms true reform is not volcanic in its operations it does not startle a sleeping world by the sudden belching forth of tiery torrents of innovation or the upheaving of old foundations it is rather like the little rivulet which steals forth from its source amid the hidden recesses of faraway mountains and glides along noiselessly at tirst but as its course becomes obstructed it works in its bed gathers strength from all its tributaries and rushes fearlessly on until it forms a part of the great sea of life and as the sources of many streams are often forgotten or unknown so the origin and originators of most reforms are slighted and traduced by the world illustrations of the truth of this proposition are numerous in the worlds history but there is one now existing in our own land which to our mind is very striking just now the world is all agog at the enormity of slavery the murmur of i ndignant voices rises all over thei land and strong arms and stout hearts are valiantly at work to destroy the monster or at least to stay his further progress a great reform is iu operation the dead sea of slavery rumbles and roars and dashes its dark wavaa heavily under the strong gale of popular indignation the purifying process has fully begun to one who wishes to investigate the secret springs of human actionit is an interesting question whence cometh this commotion where and when did the work begin who first aroused the sleeping sense of justice of the nation an l directed the sympathies of the popular heart to the sufferings of the blacks doubtless since the earliest times and in nearly all heartsthere has lurked a sense of the wrong inflicted but ii took not bodily form and cried not boldly out for justice until some eighteen or twenty years since then was heard the voice of one crying in the wilderness and yg rpent ye repent then garrison girdled up his loins and went forth to battle with the nation a nation proud ofita institutions and righteous in its own esteem that he was opposed denounced imprisoned mobbed and nearly mtirder ed the world knows and the world knows too bow impotent were those acts truth has been spoken gods truthand as the truth ever wu it found its way to the hearts of the people in vein did gentlemen of property end standing swear and fight in vain did dignitariee threaten infant did poluictmnt spent ehom patriotism and tremble for the safety of tbo dear people and in rain did religionist and prests life up their hand in holy horror and call down curses on the beads oi those who would mature me eao lished order of society slowly but surely the divine leaven worked in the hearts of the people and now behold the change slavery is a dangerous evil cry the united voices of millions and in that cry how many once discordant voices blend he who once assisted in placing a halter around the neck of an innocent man is now shocked at the barbarities of the slave system they who but yesterday said that all abolitionists should be imprisoned are now thrusting into jail the agents of slaveholders loud mouthed politicians now shout themselves hoarse to prove their devotion to human freedom as once they shouted in defence of slavery and pious priests drawl dolefully over the iniquities of our southern brethren and pray for the liberation of the bondman as erst they prayed for the destruction of his best friend and do not all join in doing justice to the man who opened their eyes to this wickedness alas for the perversity of human nature no the divine truth which he and his followers promulgated has forced itself upon their acceptance but the promulgators they reject and why because as the spanish proverb has it the rnan who has done you an injury will never forgive you shall they acknowledge themselves in error to those they once reviled as totally in the wrong pride and prejudice forbid it and now comes the most ludicrous part of their performance not only do they reject the early abolitionists but they become suddenly alarmed on account of the injury they are doing to the good cause pious bc benevolent souls how it grieves them to think of the good which might be done for the slave were it not for these hotheaded fanatics they good honest consistent conscientious men are extending all their sympathy for the slave in words while those disturbers of the peace will persist in calling for action how provoking that the true friends of the slave should he thwarted in their good intentions by the rash measures of those deluded men now if all this is not the utmost height of the ridiculous it is assuredly the lowest depth of the contemptible why is it not as plain as the light of the heaven that all these mournful philanthropists are bankruptutterly bankrupt and are trading on borrowed capital who arousesa b th public mtfla sense of the enormity of slavery the early abolitionists who gathered together the facts and statistics which now form the stock in trade of the politician the early abolitionists who created that public opinion which the demagogue labors to propitiateand before which the priest bows the earj ly abolitionists and what power now holds the mas of the people up to a certain point in the antislavery faith the influence of early abolitionists and yet gentlemen of leisure make speeches occasionally and call themselves the only true friends of the slavewhile the hard working persecuted pioueers of the cause are his greatest enemies true the pioneers have gone a long way in advance of the multitude and have struck into a strange path but we must remember it was their task to drag behind thema people with a very swinish propensity to hold back and hence they had to i advance a long way in order to get the mass to move at all they havej gone far into the future and the future will do them justice cheap patriotism in this goodly city of ours tnere is an abundance of cheap patriotism let it but be known that some miles off a people are becoming restless under long continued wrong and oppression and forthwith our popularity seeking politicians are brimfull of the most disinterested philanthropy they will at a moments warning congregate together and pass patriotic resolutions by the hat full a few months since the domestic institutions of old ireland were not conducted to the satisfaction of our humming bird patriots a courthouse sympathy meeting was therefore convened and tbe government of england duly lectured in a series of resolutions freely spiced with patriotic anathstnas against tyrannyop pression kingcraft and all that sort of thing within the past year we have had in this city of louisville public rneetj ings of sympathy with the greeks the french the poles the irish and the dorr government of rhode island all of which were doubtless very proper j and against which we have not a word to say we have attended many of these meetings and we do not recollect of hearing a word said against inter j fering with tbe domestic institutions of an oppressing or on oppressed peo pie vested rights were generally forgotten the rights of property bad no peculiar sacredness or precedence over the rights of persons hoary beaded precedent if founded in wrong was bitterly denouncedtbe right and the true eloquently advocated men could then stand up and give utterance to those immortal sentiments of the declaration of independencein which it declared that all men are created i equal and that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liber t j and the pursuit of happiness without any equivocating and contemptible commentscomments which are a disgrace to the living and a slander upon the dead speakers and listener spoke and acted generally american freemen might be expected to speak and act md one would not suppose that a stave could tread the glorious soil of patriotic kentucky the secret ot ail tms spowtaueoot patriotism lies on the surface il costs nothing and is popular wo can alford an abundance of eloquent denunciations against all oppression and wrong provided it exists in another continent and in another form than that which prevails in our land our skindeep patriots can tread on the toes of the pope knock gen oudioot over the knuckles curse the sivaaatneot of england anathematise e emperor of russia for all this can be done without suffering either in their purses or their popularitybut i ask them to look at home and too door say something that shall tend to destroy a system of slavery that regards i men simply as property and which i cannot be sustained a moment without a violation of the most sacred rights of humanity and all at once they are as dumb as oysters they will tell you that liberty is a very good thing home i times and under certain circnmstances but circumstances especially color alter cases that the sentiments about personal equality premulgated in the declaration of independence are a lying abstraction long since exploded by the inventive genius of john c calhoun that political and social wrongs are best remedied by the slow process of moral causes that jesus christ does not in terms condemn slavery therefore slavery can i not be very wrong and that after all slaves are in a better condition the than free negroes with our views of right as founded in the laws of mans being and as clearly proclaimed in our national charter we have no confidence whatever in this timeserving and superficial patriotism and we have no doubt that a large proportion of the fairweather patriots who thus openly proclaim themselves the slaves of prejudice and who are always ready to bow down to that everchanging but omnipotent idol public opinionwould if they were residents of europe be the most obsequious slaves of monarchy or the most radical levellers just as the popular breeze or fie instincts of selfinterest would seem to dictate we have been led to make these remarks by reading the proceedings ot the meeting held at the courthouse on monday evening last for the purpose of passing resolutions of sympathy cor those hungarians who are now making a moat heroic straggle to obtain that freedom which is the birthright of the human race the resolutions passed meet with our unqualified approval louisville exam iner from lhe natio ml era number of slaveholders in the united states no census has ever given us the number of slave holders we hear and see and feel so much of their power that we arc apt to confound them with the white population of the south it is one of our popular delusions that every southerner is the owner of slaves whereas in fact the people who are forever threatening to dissolve the union unless permitted to govern it are a very small landed aris tocracy in an address to the nonslave holders of the south published a few years since there was a long array of arguments and statistics to prove that each master could not on an average hold less than ten slaves of course on this average the slave population divided by ten would give the number of owners viz this number deducted from the white males over years old in the slave states and territories vtz would give us adult white nonslave holders a fact has recently come to light that most conclusively proves that this supposed average of the ten slaves to the masters is very far below the true number it seems there was a census taken in kentucky of voters slaves and slaveholders mr underwood of that state in a recent speech published in the new york express gives the number of voters as of slaves and of slaveholders being an average of more than slaves to each master now let it be recollected that the slaves are necessarily less concentrated upon kentucky farms than they are upon the large cotton and sugar plantations of the more southern states it is well known that the great planters hold from to slaves a let j ter lately published in tha newspapers from the parish of ascension louisiana giving an account of the ravages of the cholera in the neighborhoodj ays mr fish has lost negroes kenner ueile minor colonel bibb has lost bishop polk but applying even the kentucky ratio j which is obviously too small to the whole slave region the result is astounding the whole number of slaves j men women and childrenwere by the last census this number divided by give as the sum total of the slaveholders iu the united states beyond all question this in an exaggerated estimate we are now qualified to judge of the accuracy of the reports made by the slaveholders themselves of their number mr horace mann in a speech june in the house of

wives and children cannot in the aggregate exceed nor the slaveholding voter this small but powerful aristocracy wield the political adlhority of the states in which they reside and this they do not only through their wealth and superior education but by making the masses bclievo that by protecting and perpetuating slavery they are promoting the common good according to mr lnderwaod there ia in kentucky a majority of nonslava nolding voters yet at the recent election most ol these men were persuaded by the lords of the lash to go for everlasting slavery it is obvious that the power of the masters rests wholly upon the ignorance and subserviency of the non laveholders hence the wrath and trepidation manifested by the masters whenever an attempt is made to enlighten the masses as to the influence of slavery on their interests some years ago the new orleans papers announced that copies of an address to the nonslaveholders had been received at the lost office in that city but instead of being delivered to the persons to whom they were addressed they were burnt mr barrett has recently been arrested in south carolina and is now in prison his solo offence and the only one of which he

the letter which you have wrtten to me to offer me the presidency of the congress of the fiiends of universal peace this gentlemen is an honor the full value of winch feel and for which i should never be able adequately toexpress mygratitude i think with you gentlemen that war is a remnant of ancient barbarism that it is accordant with the spirit of christianity to desire the disappearance of this formidable ecourge from the face of the earth and to make strenuous efforts to attain this noble and generous end perhaps alas the time has not yet come when it will be completely possible for the rations to enter upon the path of peace perhaps war will continue for many years longer bo cruet necessity but it is allowable itis paaiseworthy it is noble to labor to make the people understand that they as well as individuals should endeavor with ihe least possible delay to terminate their differences by pacific means and that humanity and civilization will have made immense progress on their way when an end shall have been put to these fratricioal contests i beg you therefore gentlemen to iuaenbe my name among those ot the friends of the ptace congress but it causes me deep regret that cannot on account of my health accept the honor which you have so kindly offered tne of presiding over you if my phy sictan who strongly urges nte to take a tnp into the country to prevent my health

armaments is that tbey tend to excite dangerous animosities between the two nations and to perpetuate fear batrqfi and suspicion passions which find their gratification instinctively in warthe correspondent of the a s standard writeathe thing that most interested us as it will your readers was the success of our fnend william w brown in addressing the audience so many are desirous to speak on such an occasion that an unknown man can hardly hope or fan opportunityjbut our friends color and cause the two very reasons that would have prevented his obtaining a hearing in the united states removed all obstacles here our friends r  wchb and cochran and many others intet ested themselves warmly on the occasion and when he rose on the platform die general feeling of the assembly sustained him notwithstanding the efforts of the hiisser in the performance of his functions to keep him down his name not being on the listof speak era he spoke about five minutes imid the most cordial applause having been intiodu ccd by m coquerel as a fugitive slavej whose good character and abilities had cna bled him to attain his liberty and to appear i before them iu the character of a delegate of the american peace society his idea was as follows cut the slip from the galig nani mr william w brown said that at so advanced a stage of theproceedingshe should j not have thought of taking up the time of the meeting were it not that he desired at the peace congtess of paris to protest against the existence of the war elementwhich condemned thtee million of men in the united states to slavery cheers he had been a slave for years and he could speak from experience on the point he could utter his sentiments with perfect freedom in paris but he could not do that in the capii tal of the uuited states were he to do sobis life would be in danger slavery had now been abolished in almost every country in europe whilst shameful to say it still existed in america france in her revolutioons of had rendered not only her inhabitants at homo free but had set her slaves in martinique and guadalupe at liberty he wanted to have the same effect produced in the united slates that could ouly be done by the destruction of the element of which he had spoken the dissemination of principles of peace he firmly believed would bethe best means of leading to the emancipation of the slave population in the united states hear bear this was instantly translated by m co querel and received moat enthusiastically j w c pennington says the nonconformist another escaped slave came forward he fully agreed with mr brown that slavery was a great element of war and that every man of real chr stian feelings should put shoulder to shoulder to get tid of such a curse he was sure that with the assistance of that society the advocates of the abolition of slavery must triumph when universal peace would reign on the earth and when no other sentiment would be heard or expressed than that of peace and good will to all men loud applause the rev gentlemen on leaving the tribune was shaken heartily by the hand by the abbe duguerry and the rev m coquerel and by the chairman and received the congratulations of a number of other parties on the plat form after votes of thanks had been passed to the french government the president the vice presidents and the secretaries m victor

to the journal of commerce received on monday night slates the piesident has directed that the french miniater poussin be informed that his passpoits are ready for him an important note from poussin is the cause there is a great deal of speculation as to the matter ef the note and it is generally supposed to have had reference to the appointment of mr rives as minister to france which it is aid displeased the french government a difficulty has occurred evidently between the two governments the following version of this affair which has created not a little excitement may bere garded as the truth some weeks since m poussin made up i on the government at washington a demand fondemnity fora french ship damaged or captured at vera cruz in the mexican war several letters were exchanged between the envoy and mr clayton on the subject in the course of which the former indulged in remarks which were deemed positively msul ring to our government in consequence ot this the correspondence was suspended and a copy of the offensive letter was transmitted directly to paris with the expressed wish that he should be recalled without delay weare informed that m de tocqueville the french minister of foreign affairs replied maintaining ihe same ground as that taken by m pousatn and declining to recall him itis however reported on the other hand that no answer whatever has been received from paris bat that after having waited a sufficient time in vain the of the envoy has taken place but we have reasons fr supposing the version we have given above to be more authentic it wa no doubt

last from oswego i hare since then visited fulton pultneyville mt morris and scotsvillc my meetings in fulton were very successful and will doubtless prove of advantage to the cause there is in that place a number of churches only one of which is opened for antislavery purposes and that one is the w esleyan methodist this house was fieely gtaoted to me for a meeting on saturday evening anu tw ice during sunday i found the minister of this church to be a most devoted abolitionist and highly intelligent concerning the who e antislavery movement although a preacher toa wesleyan congregation he is thoroughly a free man and wholly unshackled by sectarianism he sees clearly through the hollowness and impotency of political parties as reformatory instrumentalities and looks beyond them in humble faith relying upon the power of truth and the persuasion of love to redeem the world from the curse of slavery and all kindred ills i shall long remember my short interview with the rev lyndon king and shall rejoice in the opportunity of again meeting him on the antislavery platform i had the pleasure while there of listening to a powerful discourse on the subject of reform as connected with christianity from mr mitchell of ogdensburgh in which he nobly stood by the cause of the slave and exposed the weakness and worthlessness of the current religion of our land my intercourse with these gentlemen afforded me a pleasure which i seldom experience in meeting with ministers of any denomination there was in their manneis an absence of all ptieatly assumption and domination and they conversed with me in a manly way on common ground and on equal termsa thing rather unusual for ministersto do from fulton i went to red creek a flourishing little town about twelve miles fiom oswego whither i had been invited by a number of gentlemen who called upon me at the hotel and solicited me to lecture in that village on ray return from the east the i meeting was held in the methodist episcopal church and was densely crowded by s class of intelligent looking people in the course of my remarks i requested the audience ts vote on three or four propositions supported by mv speech all seemed to progress well until i came to the question which involves the christianity of slaveholders when a bap list minister of red creek arose end wished to be excused from voting on the ground that he believed that a slaveholder might be a christian that education and habit might sofar warp his judgment and blunt his moral sense as to prevent his seeing the relation of master and slave to be sinful there wete in sums esses s aves held because they were too old to be emancipated in the latter case the reverend gentleman contended that slaveholders sustained the relation of master from benevolent motives and he said that be could never uooseat to unchristian ae such perrons i asked him to mention a single cane where a slaveholder found it necessary to continue a slaveholder in order to perform offices of benevolence to his slave he named one ease in baltimore the plea was good for nothing there is not a slaveholder in that eity bat has the power of emancipating his slaves and ot performing towards them all the offices of kindness which can be suggested by the principle of benevoleooe and he who does nor exercise his power to emancipate does nor give the world a sufficient evidence of christian charterer to warrant hit admission and fellowship into a christian church in respect j to the alleged ignorance of cbnsuan nkro bolden as to the sin of slavery it any be i

the notice xgrho extensively gien and as a consequent a large meeting was obtained a number of our frtenda from vi i ilia arson were present and did good service by interesting ihe villagers in the objects of the meeting the antislavery meeting and fair at mt morris may be set down as htilc better oran a failure i had tbe misfortune on ray journey thither to be met by a man who either carelessly or maliciously or perhaps both ran his ugly wagon into my carriage and broke f my axletree this accident caused me six hours detention in repairing damages and it was with difficulty that i induced the careless man to pay the expense incurred of course j the delay prevented my reaching mt morris jin time for theproposed meeting which was j therefore postponed until saturday evening owing to this circumstance the notice of the fair was too limited to secure any success the ladies however with rare industry and perseverance succeeded by calls in awakening some degree of interest and securing from a few families contributions for the re j fresh me nt table our antisiavery ladies of rochester feel deeply indebted to mrs sleeper for assisting them in their efforts and t would also gratefully mention the names of bacon johnson bond and green mt morris is scarcely a place for any antislavery enterprise of this kind although there are many benevolent persons who would be willing to assist by donations there are very few who would give to it their personal attention and presence i have seldom been in a village where color madness is more rampant and where a colored gentleman will meet with more rudeness in this respect that community is behind the age the churches of the place are all closed against the antislavery lecturer the people with such an example before them treat the whole antislavery movement as unworthy of their attention and respect tho trustees and ministers of the methodist church deserve especial mention since they deported themselves towards me in a most discreditable and shameful manner on my arrival in mt morris on thursday evening i was too late for the meeting advertised and they then proffered me the use of their house and allowed mo to give notice for a lecture there on sat uiday evening but when that time arrived instead of finding the church open learned from the bystanders that the trustees had ordered the doors to be closed against me on conduct so inhuman unjust and false com i ment is unnecessary in ordinary business j life among nonprofessing christians such a disgraceful breach of faith would be branded aa it deserves to be but unhappily such baseness finds securer shelter under the droppings of the sanctuary than it meets on change i held no meeting m caledonia as no notice of my visit there had been given the meeting in scotsville last evening was held in the presbyterian church and was very fully attended ample notice was given of the fair j and we are at work today in fine spirits since the foregoing was written the obove mentioned fair is concluded the gross receipts of it amount to fifty dollars thirtyone dollars of which were taken at one table i ought perhaps to apologize to my east bloomfield friends for delaying until now to notice the fair held in that place two weeks since the omission was certainly not froma want of gratitude to the many kind friends in that place who contributed so generously and bountifully for the refreshment table and who otherwise assisted on the occasioii we feel all the more gratified with the success attending that fair in view of the limited notice given of it tbe ladies of east bloomfield were not informed of the intention to hold a fair until the evening previous yet in the i short space of time intervening they brought together a most liberal supply of delicious cakes tarts jellies and pies of all deacrip j tiona one gentleman donated a roast pig j which to all appearance was gratefully re j received by tbe numerous guests who were i privileged with a taste of his quality i a large number of friends from canandaigua attended the fair and added much toi the interest of the occasion it was altogether one of ths most pleasing antislavery demonstrations of the series hope that the secretary of the fair committee will give to the readers of the north star a minute ae i count of the fair in her general report the friends in east

box brown was born a slave iu louisa couuty v a fortyfive miles from the city of richmond his mother was a religious woman and used to instruct him in the principles of morality she taught him not to steal and not to lio from some other quaner his youthful mind got hold of the idea that his master was almighty god and his young master jesus christ while a young lad his chief employment was waiting upon his master and mistress with at intervals lessons in the cultivation of the plantation with the fearful apprehension hanging upon his mind that the time was not far distant when he should be driven to daily toil beneath the rays of the scorching sun he was anxious to learn the condition of the slaves on other plantations and did not lose any opportunity of gratifying his curiosity he and his brother were in the practice of j carrying grain to a mill twenty miles distant j on one occasion while waiting for their grain j they saw a number of forlornlooking beings pass who as they passed looked wiih astonishment at the two colored persons with shoes vests and hats on the brothers followed these poor creatures to their quarters and entered into conversation with them which was soon cut short by the approach of the overseer they had not gone far when they heard their screams while suffering under the i lash for the erime of talking to strangers henry and his brother felt tbankfui that they were exempted from such terrible treatment but were filled with apprehension by and ibye their master died as he was about i to expire he bent for the two brothers ithey ran to his bedside

this day which will in all j probability be regarded hereafter one of iha most eventful that have evot dawned upon haiti uoubiksn the new that am about to communicate will appear incredible and must confess tb it matters wear almost a dreamlike aspect to myself who base been a spectator of the various scenes that have transpired wuhin the last twelve hours but to be brief as mv tunc is limited i this morning about ten oclock palms ot triumph were to he seen waving before all the doors and suspended to all the galleries of this goodly city of portauprince the drums beat rhe trumpets sounded the cannons roared the people shoutedand haiti became an empire yes a veritable empire with its tmpeiia family in esse audits dukes counts marshals and other titled dignitaries n futuro the change certainly is a bud dsn ono and wc who upon rising this mor rung snuffed the airs ot a republic and now inhale the atmosphere of a monarchy might well regard it as nothing but a fantastic vision were it not for the vast amount of ocular and auricular demonstration to the contrary and ycl no violent outburst no effusion of blood marked this transition from one form of poliyical existence to another lu ally when a people grown tired of the governmental fabric which hitherto has sheltered them resolve to tear it down and construct another it chances that some tenacious lover of the timehonored edifice or some ardent laborer in the work of demolition finds a willing or unwilling grave beneath the fall mg stones and flying rafters but no such event has taken place here ihe republican scaffolding which for fortysix years fits served its purpose but indifferently well and which many personsregarded as a permanency has been quietly taken down and he who yesterday was the president soulouque is now by the grace of god and the sovereignty of the people faustin the lirst emperor of haiti with regard to the new structure it remains for the future to judge of the correctness and purity of its style the justness of its proportions and the strength of its columns this change also has been almost as unexpected as it wassudden i rue any observer of events might have foreseen it for some tine back but even then only as a contingency which might take place in the course of years however the first intimation that the period was at hand was the appearance of a circular on thursday iat to the effect that in consideration of the eminent services renl dered to the country by his excellency the president he sheuld he named emperor this document was signed by a large number of persons action was taken upon it last evening in the senate and chamber of hep j resentatives and in accordance with this action haiti ceased this morning to be a republic a very quiet and respectable revolution certainly and in all respects totally j different from those of which europe recently has boen and still is the theatre but to return to the affairs of the day hearing the repeated discharges of artillery this morning i hastened out into the streets and learned that the senate had just made proclamation of the establishment of the empire and that body accompanied by life representatives had already proceeded to the palace to offer the imperial diadem to his newly created majesty on my may i encountered the troops crowned with garlands onjtheir march lo the church with beating drums and flying colors shortly afterwards the imperial cortege came into view it consisted of the emperor the empress and two of their nieces on foot and attended by the general officers of the army and various other military ami high civil authorities of the government his majesty was attired in the most simple uniform and indeed a bearing in all respects the most becoming marked the first appearance of the new dynasty in public arrived at the c hurcb a solemn le deum was chantedwild bursts of martial music ever and anon mingling with the deeptoned harmony of the choir at the close of this service the bells pealed the cannons again fired repeated salutes and amidst liudand reiterated cries of ive vem pereur the most important ceremonies of the day were terminated the empress and her niece returned in a carriage to the palace while the emperor mounting his horse proceeded with ins usual attendance to make a turn through the city manv true friends of haiti will perhaps see in this revolution much cause of regret and it certainly is asa l thing to see a republic sink into an empire but although an ardent admirer of the political institutions of my native land and a iirui believer m hei political creed still cannot but tliiuk thai there are many persons outside of the wall of lunatic asylums and yet within the precincts of civilisation who are utterly unfit

that considerable search has recently been made on or about the indianßeservation in this vicinity for a slave said to have bean a few months since the house servant of a distinguished individual at

liberty and independence viz that all men are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among which are lite liberty and the pursuit of happiness it ia therefore hereby  resolved that any person who will suffer himself to be hired or m any other way influenced to seek and return the poor panting fugitive ia not only unworthy the name of an american citizen but should he regarded as

the reader that the island of mauritius appertaining at this day to the english was originally colonized by the french and that the population yet consists ina great measure of persons of that na lion to whom by a formal treaty between the owera concerned their ancient laws and uauages were preserved without any material alterations about ten or twelve months ago the sieur clodomir frenois a rich merchant of the island was found dead and frightfully disfigured in his own habits tion his body was discovered lying on the floor with the head and face mutilated by a pistol and all doubt as to the cause of the catastrophe was dispelled by the discovery of the fatal weapon by the aide of the corpse as also of a paper in the handwriting of the deceased this paper contained the following words am ruined a villain has robbed me of twentyfive thousand livres sterling dishonor must be my portion and cannot survive it i leave to my wife the task of distributing among my creditors the means whichremain to us and i pray that god my friends and my enemies may pardon my self destruction vet another minute andi shall be in eternity signed clodomir frenois great was the consternation caused by this tragic event which was the more unexpected as the loss alluded to in the note had never been made public the deceased had been held ingreat esteem over the colony as a man of strict honor and probity and was universally lamented his attached widow after endeavoring faithfully to fulfil his last wishes found her grief too overpowering to permit her to mingle longer with the world and took the resolution to consecrate her remaining days to the services of religion two months after the sad end of her husband she entered a convent leaving toa nephew of the late merchant a physician the charge of completing the j dstribution of the effects of freuois among his creditors a minute examination of the papers of the defunct led to the discovery of the period at which the unfortunate merchant had been robbed and this period was found to correspond with the date of the disappearance ofn man named john moon long in the employment of frenois of this man on whom suspicion not unnaturally fell nothing could be learned on inquiry but shortly after the division of the late merchants property moon reappeared in the colony when taken up and examined respecting the cause of his flight he stated that he had been sent by his master to france to recover certain sums due to the merchant therein which mission he had been unsuccessful and he further averred that i if clodomir frenois ia his eviuting correspondence had thrown any injurious suspicions upon him moon the whole was but a pretext to account for deficiencies of which the merchant himself was the sole cause and author this declaration made by a man who seemed to fear no inquiry and whose worldly circumstances remained to ap pearance the same as they had ever been had the effect of silencing if it did not satisfy the examinators and the affair soon fell in a great measure out of the public recollection things remained for a short time in this condition when one morning mr j william burnett principal creditor of the late clodomir frenois heard ai knocking at his gate at a very early hour he called up one of his servants who went down and opened the door and immediately returned with the intelligence that a stranger who seemed desirous of keeping his person concealed wished to speak with mr burnett in private mr burnett rose threw on his dressing gown and descended to the parlor he saw there a stranger of tall person seated in an easy and familiar attitude upon a sofa with a number of the morning post in his hand the back of the visitor was turned to mr burnett as he entered rather surprised to see a stranger coni duct himselfso like an old friend of the house mr burnett said aloud sir may beg to know your business with me the stranger turned round and advanced to salute his host warmly and courteously mr burnett started back and uttered a loud exclamation of surprise and alarm well he might for before his eyes stood his friend and debtor clodomir frenois whom he had beheld nearly a year before a mutilated corpse and whom he himsell had followed to the grave what passed at that interview between mr burnett and his strange visitor remained a secret mr burnett was observed to issue several times pale and agitated from his dwelling and to visit the magittrate charged with the conduct of the criminal processes of the colony in the course of that day while john moon was regaling himself with tea under the palm trees in his garden along with a circassian female whom he hsd bought sometime previously he was arrested and taken to prison by the officers of justice on the following day he was brought before the criminal court accused of robbing the late coldomir f renois the crime being conjoined with breach of trust and violence moon smiled at the charge with all the confidence ol a roan who had nothing to f car the judge having demanded of him it he confessed the crime the accused replied that the charge was altogether absurd that clear testimony was necessary to fit such a derelict upon him and that so far from there being ny such evidence producable neither e widow of the deceased nor any one i person m his service had ever heard the pretended robbery even once mentioned by frenois during his life ou hen affirm your inno ceace repwud ih jbdg after hearing all that the other bid to say i will avouch my innocence replied mood oven before the body of my late muter if that ha accessary such a thing often took place under the old colonial law john moon said the judge invoice broken by some peculiar emotion it is before your late master that you trill bare to assert your innocence and may god make the troth appear from the judge accompanied the words and immediately a door opened and clodomir frenois the supposed suicide entered the court he advanced to the bar with a slow and deliberate step haring his eye calmly but sternly fixed on the prisoner his servant a great sensation was caused in the court by his appearance uttering shrieks of alarm and horror the females present fled from the spot the accused fell on his knees in abject terror and shuddering confessed his guilt for a time no voice was heard but his however as it became apparent that a living man stood before the court the advocate for the prisoner gained courage to speak he demanded that the identity of the merchant be established and the mystery of bis existence be explained he said that the court should not be biased by what might prove to be a mere accidental likeness betweeu a person living and one deceased and that such an avowal as that of the prisoner extracted in a moment of extraordinary terror was not to be held of much weight before being admitted here as an accuser or witness continued the advocate addressing the resuscitated merchant prove who and what you are and disclose by what chance the tomb which so lately received your body mangled with bullets has given up its tenant and restored you to the world in life and health this firm appeal of the advocate who continued steadfast to his duty under circumstances that would have closed the lips of most men called forth the following narrative from clodomir frenois my story may soon be told and will suffice to establish my identity when i discovered the robbery committed by the accused he had then fled from the island and i speedily saw that all attempts to retake him would prove fruitless i saw ruin and disgrace before me and came to the resolution of terminating my life before the evil day caine on the night in which this determination was formed i was seated alone in my private chamber i had written the letter which was found on my table and had loaded my pistol this done i prayed for forgiveness from my maker for the act that i was about to commit the end of the pistol was at my head and my finger on the lock when a knock at the outei door of the house startled me i concealed my weapon and went to the door a man entered whom i recognized to be the sextou of the parish in which i lived he bore a sack on his shoulder and in it the body of a man newly buried which was destined foi my nephew the physician then living with me the scarcity of bodies foi dissection as the court is aware compels those who are anxious to acquire skill in the medical profession to pro j cure them by any possible means the sexton was at first alarmed at having met me did my nephew request you to bring this body said i n replied the man but i know his anxiety to obtain one for dissection and took it upon me to offer him this body for mercys sake continued the sexton do not betray me sir or i shall lose my situation and my familys bread while the man was thus speaking a strange idea entered my mind and brought to my despairing bosom hopes of continued life aud honor i stood for a few moments absorbed in thought and tsen recollecting myself i gave two pieces of gold to the resurrectionist the sum which he had expected telling him to keep his own counsel and that all would be well i sent him away and carried the body to my cabi j net the whole of the household had been sent out of the way on purpose and i had time to carry into execution the plan which had struck me the i body was fortunately of the same stature as myself and like me in complex kin i knew the man he had oeen a poor offender abandoned by his fami y poor relic of mortality said i with tears in my eyes nothing which man may do can now injure thee yet pardon me if i rudely disfigure thy lifeless substance it is to prevent the ruin of not one but twenty families and should success attend my attempt i swear that thy children shall be my children and when my hour comes we shall rest together in the tomb to which thou sbalt be borne before me at this portion of the merchants narrative the most lively interest was excited in the court aud testified even by tears from many of the audience frenois thus proceeded i then stripped off my clothes and dressed the body in them this accomplished i then took up the pistol and with a hand more reluctant than when i applied it to my own person i fired it close to the head ofthedeceas ed and at once caused such a disfigurement as rendered it impossible fur the keenest eye to detect the substitution which had been made choosing the plainest habit i could get i then dressed myself anew shaved off the whiskers which i was accustomed to wear and took other means to alter and disguise my appearance in case of being subjected by any accident to the risk of betrayal next morning saw me on b oard a french vessel on my way to a distant land the native country of my ancestors the expectations which had jed me to the execution of this scheme were not disappointed knew john moon was the man who had robbed me and who now mauds at the bar of this court and that he had formed connections in this island which would in all probability bring him back to it as soon as the nteliigence of my death gave him the promise o security in this i have not been disappointed i have been equally fortunate in other respects while my unworthy servant remained here in imaginary safety i have been successful in discovering the quarter in which not daring at first to betray tbs appearance of wealth be bad lodged the whole of the itoleo money i here brought it with me y and alio sufficient proofs supposing his confession of this day to be set aside altogether tq convict him of the crime with which he stands charged by the same means continued ciodomir frenoia with a degree of honorable pride in which all who heard him sympathized will i be i enabled to restore my family to their place in society and to redeem tbe credit of a name on which no blot was left by those who bore it before me and which please god i shall transmitj unstained to my children and my childrens children john moon whose guilt was thus suddenly and strangely laid bare to the world did not retract the confession which he had made in the extremity of his terror and without separating the court sentenced him to confinement for life in the prison of the colony the news of ciodomir frenoiss reappearance spread rapidly and the high esteem in which his character was held led to an universal rejoicing on the occasion he was accompanied from the court to his home by a dense multitude who welcomed him with prolong d shouts it would be in vain to attempt any description of tbe feelings of the wife who thus saw restored toher tbe beloved for whose sake she had quitted the world she was released from her ecclesiastical vows and rejoined her husband no more to part till the grave really claimed one or the other of them as its due waterloobefore and after we were forcibly struck lately says the knickerbocker in reading dutnas shores of the rhine by his contrasted picture of napoleon going to and returning from waterloo the two scenes are worthy the pencil of delaroche we saw two coaches approaching galloping each with six horses they disappeared for an instant in a valley then rose again at a quarter of a leagues distance from us then we set off running towards the tow n crying il lmptreur lempereur we arrived breathless and only preceded the emperor by some five hundred paces thought he would not stop whatever might be the crowd awaiting him and so made for the posthouse when sunk down half dead with running but at any rate i was there ina moment appeared turning the corner of a street the foaming horses then the postilions all covered with ribbons then the carriages themselves then the people following the carriages the carriages stopped at the post i saw napoleon he was dressed in a greencoat with little epaulettes and wore the officers cross of the legion of honor i only saw his bust framed in the square of the carriage window his head fell upon his chestthat famous medallic head of the old roman emper orshis forehead fell forward his features immoveable were of the yellowish color of wax only his eyes appeared to be alive next him on his left was prince jerome a king without a kingdom but a faithful brother he was at that lime a fine looking young man of sixandtwenty or thirty years of age his features regular and well formed his beard black his hair elegantly arranged he saluted in place of his brother whose vague glance seemed lost in the futureper haps in the past opposite the emperor was letort his aiddecamp an ardent soldier who seemed already to snuff the air of battle he was smiling too the poor fellow as if he had long days to live all this lasted for about a minute then the whip cracked the horses neighed and it all disappeared like a vision three days afterwards toward evening some people arrived from st quentin they said that as they came up they heard a cannon the morning of the lth a courier arrived who scattered all along the road the news of the victory the eighteenth nothing the nineteenth nothing only vague rumors were abroad coming no one knew whence it was said that the emperor was at brussels the twentieth three men in rags two wounded and riding jaded horses covered with foam entered the town and were instantly surrounded by the whole population and pushed into the courtyard of the townhouse these men hardly spoke french they were believe westphalians belonging some how to the army toall our questions they shook their heads sadly and ended by confessing that they had quitted the held of battle of waterloo at eight oclock and that the battle was lost when they came away it was the advance guard of the fugitives we would not believe them we said these men were prussian spies napoleon could not be beaten that fine army which wg had seen pass could not be destroyed we wanted to put the poor fellows into prison so quickly had we forgotten lb and l to remember the years which had one before my mother ran to the ort where she passed the whole day knowing it was there the news mtlst arrive whatever it were during this time i looked out in the maps for waterloo the name of which even i could not find and began to think the place imaginary as were the mens account of the battle at oclock more fugitives arrived who confirmed the news of the first comers these were french and could give all the details we asked for they repeated what the others bad said only adding that napoleon and his brother were killed this we would not believeinvulnerable he certainly was fresh news more terrible and disastrous continued to come in uutil ten oclock at night at tea oclock at night we heard tha noise of a carriage it stopped and the postmaster went oat with alight we followed him as he ran to the door to ask for news then he tepped one step back and cried its the emperor got on a stone bench end looked over my mothers shoulder it waa indeed napoleon seated in the ame corner in the same uniform his head oa his breast as before a black bishop a black episcopal bishop it soon to be ordained in england and sent to africa
