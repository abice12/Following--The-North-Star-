all the developments of society in this country are rapidly tending to workout and manifest this great principle that the only safe and sure method of elevating the african race and conferring upon them those civil social and political privileges which are the common birthright of tie human fain  v is to separate them from the anguv saxon race some of the slave states are beginning to feel that their presence is a burden which is almost intolerable and are casting about for some method to rid themselves of this incubus upon their prosperity which so greatly impedes their progress in the inarch of improvement whilst the free states in their vicinity arc becoming every year more fixed and settled in their policy of prohibiting their introduction amongst them whether this desire to get rid of them on the one h ind and not to receive them on the other be right or wrong we undertake not to settle at the present time it is however a fixed fact which cannot be changed until society is completely revolutionized in us present inodes of thought and feeling and as a fact it has to be met and dealt with by the philanthropist lie must irame his plans to meet the condition of society as it actually exists and not as he would have it be that the tendency of public opinion in the free states is such as we have described is becoming every year more manifest especially in those which border on the territory of slavery and are exposed to the immigration of this class of population a few of the states in the extreme part of the union that feel secure against any considerable influx of this population may for the sake ofa show of consistency place upon their statutebook laws that recognize the civil and social equality of the colored man hut just let any large number ofi iliat class make their appearance among them and assert their rights and exercise them and those statutes will soon disappear those which are much exposed to the evil are already beginning to take more decided action l ake the following resolution which has just passed the illinois state convent ion by a vote of p to as an example the legislature shall at its first session under the amended

for consistency and left the public mind and ear iu just that excited state that it is prepared the better for the reception of truth the subject will be must be discussed increased acquaintance with

make use of the following language and while it i is somewhat flattering at the same time you speak as one having authority i i supposed you would enlighten your readers and many admirers what ii phases of the american colonization i scheme had presented themselves to j you in such attractive forms as to chapgc your mind greatly qf lateand to engage your complacency ralso did and shall still expect to hear the reasons for the change neither of these appear in your former communication unless in the last clause quoted and that it seems to me is not so full and explicit as one would naturally expect from henry highland garnet i will freely give you iny reasons i am not aware that i entertain any opinion in relation to public matters which i desire to conceal but first allow me to say by way of preface that my opinion of the hon henry j clay and other colonizationists of the same stamp has undergone no change i have no reason to believe that he is now different from what he has been during his whole public lifethat is a hardened sinnera cruel and murderous persecutor of my people and of late a baptized and confirmed hypo crite i have experienced no change of mind as to the possibility of our enfranchisement in this the land of our birth all this cun he done by patientj labor frugality education and pure re j ligion but on the following points my mind has changed new developments have been made in relation to the descendants of once glorious but now fallen africa and these have changed my mind in the words of the great peterboro philanthropist i say with humility there is only one who can truly say i change not and that is god i i believe that the republic oi liberia will be highly beneficial to africa in a commercial and a political point  believe thattthe new republic will succeedand that its success will curtail the slavetrade on the coast by the diffusion of light and knowledge j and by turning the attention of the black traders to soroejier and honorable business and by sweeping off the white ones as with the hands of an avenging god no colored man going from this blood red republic can possibly have any love for the slave trade unless he be a devil i believe that every political and commercial relation which president roberts negotiates with european powj ers goes far to create respect for our race throughout the civilized world the walls of that infant republic may now indeed be insignificant so much bo that you may leap over them as live i founder of rome did over the first bulwarks of that city yet it is my firm and sober belief that liberia will become the empire state of africa believe that every colored man who sincerely believes that be can never grow to the stature of a man in this country ought to go there imrne diately if he deaires for he may do some good there whereas if be remains here be will contaminate and curae every one of his brethren over whom he has anv influenewr jf i belived i declarebefore high

he laws of louisiana has occurred at new orleans monsieur l a coppens a french gentlemen from martinique after the emancipation by the french republic of the slaves at that place embarked in the british brig recovery captain burke for new orleans accompanied by three servants formerly slaves who had passports from the french government on the arrival of the recovery at new orleans it became the duty of the collector under an act of congress of the th feb to proceed against the captain of the brig and passenger m coppens for the recovery of a penalty of looo for the introduction of persons of color into a state where the local law forbids such persons to be intoduced special bail in such cases is required and the ship is liable to forfeiture the delta says captain burke of the recovery m coppens and his colored companions were all arrested and held to bail y esterday however the counsel for these parties took a rule to discharge the arrest on the ground that the united states laws having abolished imprisonment for debt in all states where it was not abolished by state laws which is the case in this state the parties could not be held to bail the point thus raised involves some very important questions of law which if determined in favor of the position of the defendautswill seriously embarrass the enforcement of our whole system of revenue laws the judge took the matter under consideration it is under this law that colored sailors citizens of free states are imprisoned whenever their business calls them to any of the southern ports although it is a direct violation of the constitution which guaranties to the citizens of one slate all the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the citizens of any other state it is nevertheless persisted in and yet those who persist in denying tho constitutionality of this law threaten to dissolve the union because some of the free states refuse to lend their jails for the imprisonment of persons claimed as fugitive slaves if our southern brethren would pick the beam out of their own eyes they j would be better able to pluck the motej from ours albany jour another slaveholding out rage a few days since a humane gentleman residing in this city received a letter from an acquaintance a lawyer in baltimore informing him of the imprisonment of three young colored men from wilmington del in the jail of harford co and that unless stso was raised to pay their dues and jail fees they would he sold as slaves out of the state and entreating him to raise and forward the money for their release these men were in the pursuit of an honest business they were charged with no crime and suspected of no evl design but they were guilty of possessing a dark complexion and had therefore violated the maryland law which forbids free colored men from other states coming into that state or remaining in its waters for more than ten days this case is mentioned and additional circumstances are given by our friend edward webb iri another column it seems that the vessel and crew belonged to wilmingtonand that having gone up a creek or bay of the chesapeake on a trading voyage they were frozen in by the sudden cold weather and were unable to leave the captain being an old man and unsaleable was robbed of hts money and left the three remaining persons of the crew were seized thrown into jail and fined soo each with o for jail fees and were to he sold on friday last to satisfy these demands our blood tingles wilh indignant shame that such outrages are tolerated in our country this is one of the fruits of our glorious union another illustration of southern respect for the guarantees of the constitution and stale rights and yet weare coolly told of the monstrous aggressions of the north upon the south the shameless impudence of the charge is in keeping with the cruelty which indicts such outrages as this which we have recorded if the northern people will stand idly and silently and witness such wrongs wrongs which would almost give the stones and cold eartbelods indignant speech they deserve all the injuries and insults they receive from the soul hern oppressor i penn frumau slave trading is massac lit setts few persons ere aware of the rami ficatiotis of slavery through our systen of trade at the north here are direc influences against freedom existing among us which make themselves lei whenever the question of slavery u discussed for this reason if no other it is time that all trafficking in slaves should be discountenanced by law tc the extent of our state jurisdiction th subject will be brought up in our legislature and it is well to fix public attention upon the facts a southern trader wishes to purchase goods in boston or lawrence on credit and offers his note with a mortgage on his slaves as security this is not unfrequently taken a lumber dealer not long since in this city represented himself as having sold pine to a southerner and secured himself in negroes again a massachusetts manufacturer wishes to secure he cotton crop of a mississippi planter he advances cash three months in anticipation and takes security on plantation and slaves here only one party to the transaction is in the commonwealth must he therefore escape the penalty as a consequence of taking slaves as security they must sometimes inevitably fall into the hands of the massachusetts citizen who may send them to the auctionblock and receive the product of their sale england has passed laws against her citizens trafficking in slaves how far has massachusetts the right to do the same what wonder while our merchants and manufacturer are thus stained with slnveholding that the moral tone of our large cities on the subject of slavery should be so depressed to our legislature then belongs the duty of finding a remedy for so great a dishonor and crime resting upon the com munitybunion repub the british west indies the politicians of jamaica talk of separating front the mother country and annexing themselves to the united states hands off gentlemen we want not your company as ye have brewed so you must bake the only motives of the jamaica planters to this annexation would be the reestablishment of slavery to this they have been encouraged by mr calhouns proposition to reestablish slavery hayti mr yulees proposition to annex cuba for the purpose of preventing the abolition of slavery and the attempt of our statesmen northern and southern to fesfnßlish slavery ffi new mexico and california and to establish it originally in oregon but even if jamaica w r ere annexed a proposition to reestablish slavery there would fail the colored population ninetenths of the whole would fight for liberty and they would make a desperate fight too for they are much stronger now than they were fifty years ago when a few of them retiring to the mountains held all british power in defiance and were finally subdued with great difficultyadmitting that southern chivalry would sacrifice a hundred millions of dollars to reduce the colored jamaicans to slavery we feel assured that northern middle and western plebianisin would not iand without the consent of the latter the former could not pass the necessary bills we will throw out every moral consideration and consider the case merely as a case of cash and the necessary conclusion is that the south cannot and the north and west will not pay for reestablishing slavery in jamaica if then we must take the jamaicans as free what shall we do with them we must govern them as a territory till they were fit for a state and in the mean time must receive their territorial delegate in congress he would bea colored man for as according to modern doctrines in some quarters congress could not legislate tor the territories they must legislate for themselves and as anglosaxon institutions now prevail in jamaica the majority must govern whether upon freehold household or universal suffrage would the members from south carolina take their seats heside the delegate from jamaica even the members from massachusetts would demur as the federal ioverament have never acknowledged the independence of hayti because that would impose the necessitity of recoiling a haytien ambassador we cannot imagine how they would get along with a jamaica delegate and the cane would be much worse when jamaica applied for admission as a statewith about whites and blacks its senators ami representatives in congress would probably be colored how will the advocates of annexation solve the difficulty unless upon the utterly inadmissible and impracticable if admissible basis of reestablishing slavery the thing cannot be done the same dificulty applies to every island in the west indies cuba included several of our journals and one of our senators are earnest about the annexation of cuba but the free states will not consent to its annexation as slave nor the slave states aa free

benedict secretary pro tern adjourned to meet again on tuesday evening at oclock at maiden lane massachusetts on slavery the following resolutions were recently introduced into the massachusetts legislature by mr hopkins of northampton they were ordered to be printed hereas the declaration of independence sets forth the immutable principles of human liberty and whereas the constitution of these i nited slates was framed and adopted to promote a more peifect union for the purpose of securing thereby the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity therefore resolved that the grand object and design of our national constitution and the union resulting therefrom are to secure and perpetuate luilbtv that this chief end was recognized by our fathers in all their primal negotiations and deliberations for union as also in their subsequent acts of legislation that the same end is also regarded by the civilized worid as the true aim and purpose of our national institutions resolved that we love the union and support the constitution because of our confidence in their fitness to the end for which they were formed and established that any use of their powers past or future for the increase or continuance of slavery is the grossest possible perversion of those powers and that nothing can have a stronger tendency to hake tlie integrity of the union itself by rendering it worthless for its great end than any successful persistence in such a course of perversion resolved that the recent policy of the national government with reference to the extension and the security of slavery does involve the grossest perversion and abuse of both the constitution and the union that as we have resisted it so we will continue to do that we protest against the prevalence of that policy and demand its distinct renunciation and disavowal with reference to our territorial possessions by applying to those possessions the principles of the ordinance of concerning the territorial possessions of that period that we demand a perfect absolution of the national government from all connection with or responsibility for slavery and that all the powers of said government be most w isely and efficiently used in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure a domestic tranquility provide tor the common defence promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity resolved that as the examples and in lunctions of our fathers have taught us so should our examples and injunctions teach our posterity that to secure liberty of body and f soul liberty under law and by law is the great and only purpose and value of civil compacts and governments and that we therefore declare our determination hereafter in every available form of political action and by every justifiable means to resist the fostering and increase of slavery under national protection to reclaim the national government from its desecrations and to rcdircet it to those original and noble ends recognized and established by our fathers and that in making tins declaration we are but simply faitli tul to the principles of our country and to the interests of mankind resolved that in view uf questions now pending lieforc the national legislature unprecedented in the importance and the extent oi their homing upon these principles of nation il policy we feel impelled to call upon our k preseiitattves and to instruct our senators in ongress not only unceasingly to oppose the extension ot slavery into our

the opinion of this meeting the institution of slavery is a great political and social evil for the existence of which in kentucky however the present generation is not at all responsible resolved that in our opinion a gradual and prospective system of emancipation accompanied by colonization should be adopted by our state we regard such a project as practicable politic and humane and earnestly desire to see it accomplished resolved that while we declare ourselves in favor of some carefully devised plan of emancipation which should be gradual in its operation we are utterly opposed to any

in kentucky that all slaves bern after a fixed time say the adoption of the new constitution or such latter day as may be approved shall lie free at a certain age say twentyfive years provided they

the sixth degree of north latitude might become a place of note and interest had those into whose hands the destinies of the nation have fallen been composed of a different material morally and qualifiedly in speaking upon this subject we have no sympathy with the degrading expatriating insolent slaveholding scheme of american colonization but look upon liberia in it present state as having thwarted the design of the original schemers its slaveholding founders which evidently was intended as they frequently proclaimed it as a receptacle for the free colored people and superanuated slaves of america but we view it in the light of a source of subsequent enterprise which no colored american should permit himself to lose sight of this being understood we shall proceed to review the

roberts reputed president of the new republic and who for many years previous to the independence held the official station of agent of the american colonization society and governor of liberiaa man whom the colonizationiats and slaveholders in the united states extolled to the skieseven that venerable slavebreeder and preeminent negrodreader the thnee honorable and thrice unlucky henry clay pronounced to be equal to the most eminent executives and statesmen in our country a person receiving such high ctdogium and commendation would at least be expected to possess and in his official intercourse especially to manifest those elevated and ennobling traits of charactera high degree of selfrespect and a high sense of the importance of his positiona demeanor and dignity of purpose commensurate with his station as the executive of a free sovereign independency and honorable to the nation w hose representative he is this could at least have been hoped and expected of roberts whatever contempt we may have enteitained toward him as a fawning servilian to the negrohating colonizationiats this we were forced to expect of him before we could conceive the idea and admit of his

believe that roberts accepted of the position from the american colonizationists through policy accepting of their pationagc pnly until a favorable opportunity would ensue for the honorable establishment of a free independent sovereignty no one conceived for a moment that roberts desired degradation nor would voluntarily solicit submission contemptible as we conceived him to liewe never dreamed of the extent of his miserable crouching baseness immediately subsequent to the independence of liberia either for the want of proper qualification on the part of others or the result of lis own political intriguemost probably the latterroberts though president of the republic received the appointment by his country of envoy extraordinary minister plenipotentiary and commissioner to negotiate with england france prussia and other governments discretionary with himself for a recognition of the indepcnence of the republic of liberia at present the last of republics in the order of their sovereign establishment and though the smallest weakest and poorest we are in hopes that it may yet become the greatest strongest and wealthiest on the globe roberts in his mission to england met with great success having treated with ixird palmeiston receiving many government favors at his hands in france he met with alike success with marks of distinction and attention due his rank many of the foreign ministers of different courts much interested themselves in behalf of president roberts promising to do all they could with their governments to facilitate the objects of bis mission though up to this time roberts had been ignorant of the importance of his position and the destiny of his peoplethough for years he may have existed merely by sufferance as the servile minion of the misanthropic colonizationists of the south and proslavery colonizationists of the north now that a new arena had lieen opened to his vision a new field of action presented itselfan interest of sea and land having called him into active service where he stood unfettered and disenthralled having cast off the menial garb of a slave posted with the dignity of true manhood clothed in the paraphernalia of a nations representative and armed with the proud panoply of a freemans rightsthese the new scenes around him this his new and elevated position in the world were had he been susceptible of it sufficient in themselves to make him sensible of the respect due to his people if not his own importance as an equal but instead of that manly dignified statesmanlike course such as became a minister of state his very first act after the marked distinction and distinguished favors received at the hands of governments and statesmen is an act of the most pitiable degradation the most blasting reproach and civil outrage upon his people that was ever perpetrated by a mendicant like the slave cap in band obedient to the commands of the dons who employ them bidden ou an errand of his master president roberts no sooner concludes the business of his mission a knowledge and official account of which was alone due to his own government but he writes to a g phelps a colonizationist of the united states giving him an official report of his proceedings as the minister of liberia an independent nation if ever the curse of slavery were manifest in the character of manit has fully exhibited itself in this man roberts the degradation to himself might readily be exietmated the act being strictly in character with the man but the insult and disgrace meted to hi people should not find palliation in his plea of ignorance not content with the stigma thrown into the face of the liberians by his first report to phalpsjbut adding aggravation to insult promises that so soon as be arrive home to give him a full and elaborate report of all his doings here faithful to the trust reposed in him by his american while masters this man roberts discards the people whom he feigns to represent

upon the liberians ns anation bat upon the hole colored race in america since descended from the american colored race whatever marks the coarse of progress in his present position will be seized hold of by the slaveholders and their abettors as true evidence of tire american colored mans character and susceptibility hence we protest against his whole coarse in regard to his agency and intercourse

the friends of freedom in ohio but it is at best but an insult to onr colored friends to give a starving man when you have plentya little piece of bread enough only to excite his appetite still more is not only an insult done to him but is an outrage upon humanity the colored population has been in a starving condition for want of the benefits of education and the enjoyments of various precious rights and now our legislature gives them only a small share of what they should have hundreds and hundreds of petitions have been going up from all parts of the state lor the repeal of not the black laws but all laws making distinctions on account of color nothing but this will satisfy the demand of the friends of equal rightsnothing else will satisfy the demands of justice our mock legislature

will leave him as the dew leaves the flowers at the appearance of the nnofoud ed morning sun if that exciting game dues thus destroy the essence of christianity and excite a selfish strife and

of the meanest and most disreputable kind the subscribers aii somewhat dissatisfied they have good reason to be but they will henceforth know to whom the blame attaches the wilmington parcels have been sent weekly with the address written in black ink in avery large and legible hand and i have not the slightest doubt that every one of their reached its destination in safety but this jack in

occurrence not only newspapers but letters also are continually and without any hesitation withheld from their rightful owners it is part of the policy of the slave system of course the postmasters have no right or law to protect them in doing this but what are these to a slaveholder he who can steal a man will not hesitate to steal a letter or to perpetrate any other or meaner villany if meaner there is in the catalogue of crimes it is not friendly to the state of society at the south that even free negroes should be permitted to read antislavery publications or indeed anything of consgguence of any kind unless perhaps colonization tracts or some such trash the infection might spread amongst the slaves they also if the north star and other similar publications were allowed to circulate freely amongst the free colored people might learn from them something of their rights and would possibly become turbulent and discontented to prevent this result the watchful guardians of the slave destroy these publications they afso as i said before abstract his letters it is but a few days since two virginians came to this city in pursuit of a fugitive from that state in consequence as i believe of the arrival there of a letter posted from this office the letter was sent from here but the man was elsewhere this was done on purpose to mislead these slaveholding villains if they attempted pursuit the scheme succeeded and they had their journey for their pains and in the midst of all this people are everyday in the habit of calling this a free country a free country free with three millions of slaves and five or six hundred thousand nnenfranchised colored citizens it is the best condition for the colored race we intelligent whites know best what is good for them they would

article m am first page from the presbyterian herald it is a it necessarily be like all articles written by cofooisatiaaists illogical in its reasoning unchristian in its spirit the wnler sets outwith a statement that the developments of society in this country are rapidly tending to work out the principle that the only safe and sore method of elevating the african race w to separate them from the saxon race this is a hat the writer affirmsbut it is not true for the developments of society are taking quite another and ntore humane direction they are rapidly tending to work out the principle that american prejudice against color although strong is not indomitable and that ere long even those who are roost under its influence will awake to right reason and an acknowledgment of its absurdity further on the writer says whether this desire to get rid of them the colored people on the one hand and not to receive them on tlie other be right or wrong we undertake not to settle at the present time why not undertake to settle it this does appear to me to be ihe most important part of the question nothing else indeed is of any importance if it is right it ought to be if it is wrong it ought not to be in deciding this everything is decided it is fixed fact which cannot b changed until society is completely revolutionized in its present modes of thought and feeling and as a fact it has to be met and dealt with by the philanthropist he must frame his plans to meet the condition of society as it actually exists and not as he would have it to be it was a fixed fact in indianot longsince and that fixed fact still prevails to a considerable extent that when a man died his wife was burned with the dead body according to the reasoning of this presbyterian writer the missionaries in that country had nothing to do with the fixed fact but to frame their plans to meet the condition of societya manifest absurdity what indeed is the avowed object of all missionary operations is it not to unfix every fixed fact that is opposed to the precepts of christianity probably this writer is a minister what is or ought to be his object in every sunday preaching to his congregation is it not to remove the fixed facte of sin ignorance and sufferingto teach his hearers how to live wellto die well his preaching amounts to little if it has not this object but it is needless to follow this writer to the end of the article the most obtuse reader must discover at a glance that it contains little logic and less christianity it is however a fair sample of the class to which it belongs all the writers in favor of colonization among them not a few very pious and orthodox reverends begin jut exactly at the wrong end they find the fixed facts first and then pare down their christianity and their plans to a level therewith who does not see that this is an inversion of the order of things christianity is a protest against all wrongdoing it does not inquire whether the wrong is a fixed fact or any other kind of fact it simply says this must not be those who have a rule of action other than this may be presbyterians or baptists or methodists but they are not christians j d religious knavery the utica contributor gives an account of the doings of a baptist church in vermont which arc rather remarkable in their way illustrating as they do what kind of christianity it is that many of these churches profess the church records are given as fol lows juue church met meeting opened by prayer by br wright voted that there be a committee appointed to bring forward resolutions on the subject of slavery for discussion business meeting jan church met according to adjournment meeting opened by prayer and records read committee reported two resolutions on slavery report accepted and the resolutions adopted as follow s resolved that we will not knowingly admit to membership in our church to the table of the lord or into our pulpit aiiy person who is a slaveholder or a defender of slaveiy or who refuses to testify against it resolved that this church hold no fellowship with slavery or slaveholding churches or with any brother or sister that associates with and voluntarily remains a member of such churches until they repent and forsake such practices so far so good but there is a sequel to this story business meeting july church met and a move was made to rescind the second resolution on slavery which caused considerable discussion and was finally withdrawn for a move with regard to the sisters right to vote the discussion was arrested by a motion to adjourn august church met the subject of rescinding the second resolution on slavery recently adopted being under consideration voted o lay the question on the table voted to rescind ihe last vote taken the motion was tried on rescinding said resolution and was lost so the vote was a second time affirmed a worthy deacon of the church however hasa son who had been south officiating as pastor of a slaveholding churchit is even hinted dealing in slaves who wishes to unite with that church and has brought a recommendation from his aforesaid southern brethren itis therefore necessary that the resolution withdrawing fellowship from the members of slaveholding churches should be rescinded how is that to be done here is one plan hinted at abovenamely that of calling in question the sisters right to vote when their vote appears likely to turn the scale against this worthy deacon and bis slavdeahog son that failed but there is still a last resource here it is at a business meeting held sept one of the brethren presented a communication signed by bimsclf and some halfdozen likeminded stating among other things that they were opposed to the second resolution as it bail s tendency to divide the church and to calling on sisters to vole in business meetings this brought about what follows business meeting oct voted to call a council to consider said communication embracing the grief of the subscribers voted to send to six churches within this association and three without to send their pastor and one delegate to sit in council to gether what did the council dot aa was to be expectedfor when did it happea otherwise when the opinion of a conclave of priests was to decide the msttcr it was decided to crush at once the rising spirit of liberty and rescind the second resolution also to state that the sisters in the church deserved a modest rebuke especially since their tenacity of female rights his been so signally manifested in voting for the several resolutions so thus ended the matter and the slaveholding son of the excellent deacon was christianized and slavery councils hae doubtless ruled in that church as they have in many others and do now for the space of eight years this being ibf last mention of any difficulty on the subject if christiana are to be known by their fruits by what name shall churches that fellswsbip men stealers i distinguished like draws to like the man who can excuse or countenance robbery must le himself at heart a thief he who can hold fellowship with a slaveholder and give him his friendship and encouragement only wants an opportunity tobe himself his equal in that heavendefying iniquity when will the professedly hm tian church set itself right on this matter if those who are called infidels

that lie had the faintest shadow of sympathy for his oppressed kinsmen and have up to this time been soitow fully disappointed if colored men when they have the opportunity fail to cry aloud against the wrongs under which they suffer they at least need not lie surprised that those wrongs ase not removed there arc other enemies of the colored man besides northern proslavery sentiment and amongst i these are their own rascality selfishness and methodism that kind of praying is tho best which brings forth the fruits of action it is an old saying and a true one that heaven helps those who help

published two weeks since in the columns of that paper needs only to life cir culcated in order to meet with a response at least adequate to the request it is a duty as it ought to be a pleasure to the true friends of the slave to ensure for the pioneer sheet that liberal support which its unflinching adherence to the cause deserves to the friends of the liberator it is well known to all interested in reforms that a paper cannot w hile the uncompromising advocate of an unpopular cause subsist on its subscription list if the liberator has been during the last few years in any sense or to any degree an exception to this rule it has resulted from the indirect aid received from the massachusetts society in new england from an excess of saving which is hardly true economy from avoiding many expenses which would add much to its usefulness and from pressing into its service a great amount of unpaid labor when in spite of all this it has been obliged to look to its friends for aid the weight has from various causes fallen on very lew shoulders i believe you would not that this should thus continue so to he the plan suggested by the executive committee seems exactly adapted to remedy it to secure such receipts as will relieve it from the necessity ofa crippling economy and from pecuniary embarrassment experience has shown that it will not do to raise the price generally the committee recommend that those who rail themselves its friends and value it as it deserves appreciating the benefit tliey have derived from it should pay five dollars instead of two for the copy they take for their own use leaving them free of course to distribute as many copies as they choose at the usual price could a hundred names lie subscribed to such a plan and surely that is a small number we should receive oo more than usual and with this slight addition the income would fairly cover the expenses of the paper ami the weight would rest as it should on the shoulders of many instead of

lie makes a personal attack upon ine and my character instead of answering my inquiries put to him hi christian kindness and tor his own good ihe public lias the right to demand of mr wilson an answer to the interrogations referred to from the fact that he stood at the head of the missionary operations in canada and the public charities were as a general ihing committed to him for the benefit of the distressed there the christian donors should and will hold him responsible for a faithful applicatri of md an accounting for them if he fails to do these he cannot escape a righteous public distrust and indignation the logic of mr wilsons letter may do for his pupils at dawn imt never for their friends abroad the letter is unfair unkind and unchristian in its purport and had a will for my pen i would make its author regret that he ever wrote it am indisposed to exhibit the uncomely port of my brethren and am truly sorry that mr wilson has compelled me to write and publish what am now doing all know who have ever heard me speak of mr wilson that i have done it in terms of kindness and confidence while at the same time i have frankly i expressed my dissent from his general modus opnandi or plan hut with all liis faults i love him still i hope his heart is right though his head is undoubtedly wrong would to heaven that the christians head and heart though distinct as the trinity were one in its love my review of the letter shall be as laconic as possible hut read it through patiently if you desire to know ihctruth mr wilson accuses me of being much excited his positively deny head my leltei and see lining so himself he judged was too o he says he has no compunctions of conscience about the said letter if lie has not lie ought to have from the fact that the letter is not true as we shall see think in it lie speaks of himself as an itinerant preacher and missionary c now iie knows that he has not preached in five different colored congregations in canada aside from dawn for as many years does he deny ill lie says his letter was unoffending which infringed upon no one his too kc knows to he untrue will he deny that it was an attempted refutation of an extract from my journalpublished in the christian contributor of aug d ikih had it not been for this fact should have taken no notice of the letter lie talked to me about the extract and expressed his sorrow at its publication did not the executive committee of the dawn operation goad mr wilson to the writing of that letter he seems surprised and cannot understand how his letter should suggest the resolutions to me this he says am unable to see an unwillingness to see will check the operation of the laws ef suggestion everybody knows that it is one of the most natural things possible for one untruthful document to suggest another and especially when they both emanate from the same source and one of them got up from malice and the other to cover up iniquity one advocated by the dawn mendicants passed for public service by the perjured spoilseekers of the peoples donations and a few good hut ledastray men and published by a man who lias treated me as judis did the saviourthe other drawn up as a bank to stop the current that was about to wash away the gold dust from the canadian missionary streams both of which are as black as the smoke of the pit and as false as the records of the infernal regions he charges me with having someprivate antipathy this is also untrue if it means malice or hatred heaven is my witness this day that have no malice or hatred in my bosom against any creature of godm not even against satan himself this statement is made like many other ot mr wilsons w ithout knowlpalge and i hoe he will take it hack for his own credit sake he cannot know my soul better limn do mself are we to understand him as saying am cod mr hill may be all and even more than mr wilson says he is hut certainly his being at oberlin is no proof of it nor is his being in a high place there as everybody knows who is acquainted with its history ojh r jjjj g heart is better than his head leave him in the hands of a holy and a just god aik j fe ia jj continue to pray for him as do for mr wilson and all my enemies tiuly trust that i shall have some belter evidence of mr hills friendship than have had as i belong to the oppressed ones of whom mr wilson sjniaks j am disused to adopt only the views of toy beloved and devoted friend prof geurge hippie who wxotc trie not long suit on the subject and who taya i think hr hill erred in publishing the resolutions but believe he did what he ihooght the cause of truth and justice to mr wilson demanded mr hill either knew or supposed there was something wrong aliont the resolutions or he would not have w ithheld from the public the names of the chairman and secretary of the conference this i believe and does mr hill deny it mr wilson says in all fairness mr newman should have introduced the resolutions to which he alludes or said nothing about them every child ten year old and almost every fool knows better ihe logic of this is if a man in writing for a newspaper is reminded of something that happened in the city of london and he mentions the fact then he must in all fairness paint the city of london for the pages of the paper or say nothing about it such nonsense is unworthy a man of education am not at all sorry that mr wilson introduced the resolutions and their source he is truly welcome to all the pleasure arising from the supposed injury their publication does me it is very doubtful whether they emanated as it is said fiom the conference them is good reason to believe that they were written out of and sent or brought to it and by one too w ho is not a member of it does mr wilson deny this let him say so confess i fee myself honored by the misrepresentations and abuse of any conference called by the name of that great awd good man john wesley that is so degenerated as to have a known blasphemer and cutthroat minister to preside over it it should have been said that the resolutions were signed for and not hv the chairman of the conference they were believe drawn up and passed more from haired to me than love to mr wilson dont he believe it too will he deny it f hefore examine the preamble and resolutions permit me to say that i am a clous communion baptist preacher and quite popular as such among my methodist brethren in canada i shall be pardoned for this seeming selfpraise i state the fact because it seems necessary both episcopals and wesleyans for ibis i w as hated and the more so from the fact that some of the wesleyan members would not hear some of their own ministers preachsome who are big ones in the conference too but would come and hear me do they deny it let them say so the sydenham wesleyan preacherth institution dronesthe moneymongers wore desirous of rendering me if possible unworthy of public confidence because they feared what is now coming to pass a revelation of the darkness of dawn and thus shield themselves from public suspicion and odium as it respects the public meeting and statements at oberlin it seems it is uncertain what i said i believe i said that rev hiram wilson did not preach in the colored churches in canada and because he did not at that time he knew that the colored people there did not want to heai him he was and is still almost universally disliked by the colored people does be deny it intended so to i did not w day esq who ws secretary of the meeting tells me that the language used by me w as that rev hiram wilson did not preach among the colored people in canada because lie knew that they did not want to hear him mr day will correct me if have misstated it for write from memory mr hill takes the affirmative of this question and he is hound to prove it true or his testimony is not to be taken hut to the statement of mr hill this letter as read in the conference says at which meeting the said wm p newman staled that rev hiram wilson could not preach in any colored church in canada hut ihe conference says in the first resolution he was not allowed to preach c is there no difference between could not and not allowed to thus the conference is guilty of falsehood by affirming that said what never did say and even what mr hill admits did not say is it worthy of confidenae it is also said after the reading of the letter mr hills in the conference it was asked w hether any of the seventeen delegates knew of a disposition existing in any of the churches where they travelled to close their doors against rev hiram wilson or prohibition from preaching in any of their places of worship mark every delegate slated without hesitation that no such feeling or spirit existed in their neighborhood this i j affirm is base falsehood in proof of which ij give the testimony of dea george johnson and rev henry cooper of dawn permit me to remark here that dea george johnson is one of the trustees of the dawn school and is regarded by all who know him and they are not a few as a christian gentleman and one of the first gentleman of color in canada and rev henry cooper is now the pastor of the true wesleyan church at dawn geo johnson says i will take oath at any time or place that mr robert jackson of the queens hush c w a member of the wesleyan conference did oppose the passage of those resolutions by the wesleyan conference against w p newman if he voted for them it was after left the house and further i affirm the day after they were passed by the conference i asked rev peter curtiss a member also of said conference why he voted for said resolutions when he knew they were not true and he said he knew it but the only reason why he did it was that he did not wish to appear obstinate rev henry cooper stales i did not vote for the resolutions in the conference against hr w p newman because knew they were not true i know that mi wilson was denied the privilege of preaching in the colored wesleyan church t dawn by father robert warren sen the steward of lire church georoe francis sen witness charles h harrison dawn c woct h who has lied is the conference worthy of confidence nay verily hut the testimony of neither mr llill nor wilson u to be taken for they are personally concerned in this case and further it seems that either one or both of them are guilty of forgery in this matter for which they deserve the public odium or penitentiary in tbs first resolution as published in the oberlin evangelist of oct isa over the signature of mr hill the last clause of it reads thus this conference deems it its duly to say that the said report isenurely incorrect this is what mr hill says the conference said hut mr wilson says mr hill has lied for the conference did not say so but said according to the rdoluttoos published in the north star jan tb m this conference deems it their duty to nj that the said repoit is founded io falsehood from this it is difficult to know what the conference did say but we know that it did say enough to show they were a set or the most of them of detestable hypocrites and that they were aided m their hypocrisy bv two men one of them a professed minister of the gospel of truth and the other a socalled religious secretary of the oberlin institute and that their object was to injure an innocent man cod will judge them mr wilson says the resolutions alluded to by mr newman are the naked truth my own experience and consciousness bearing testimony and concurring with the statement of the conference the resolutions of the conference as published by mr hill then mr wilson has forged a part of the first resolution as published by hiinaelf hence by his own showing he is a vile hypocrite has mr wilson forgotten the fact that the colored ieople of toronto were about to mob him when lie lived there and also that the eoplc of dawn but a few years ago talked of doing the same thing this i learned from good autboriiy has he forgotten that he told mr gcoige francis that the colored jieople did not want to hear him preach has it slipped his frail memory that he told me he had no heart to go out and preach among the colored jieoplc from the fact that w hen he went where they were they did not even invite him in their houses to get a bite to eat and that he had to buy himself a sixpence loaf of bread and eat it by the wayside has he lost sight ot the undeniable fact that they would not permit him to preach in the colored church at dawn if rev j h fairchild rev nashvilleflogged amos dresser at d s b cox esq a gentleman of color and distinction who weie the committee that wrote to rochester and of whom mr wilson speaks but fails to give the public their language will say that i said what mr hill affirms did i should be disposed to think i did say so and that it was a mere slip of the tongue though it was true as have already shown in all fairness neither mr hill nor mr wilson nor the conference is to be believed in this matter for i have proved them false in fact did not mr hill either know or believe that there was something wrong about these resolutions hcitce he withheld from the public the names of the chairman and secretary does he deny this if he does let him say so the second resolution expresses the confidence in and good will for mr wilson by the conference and its appreciation of his efforts in canada of the sincerity of such expression the public may judge when i tell it that i have a letter in my possession written by peter b smith and dictated by josiah henson sen lioth members of the j conference which affirms just the opposite of this i would insert it here but it is too long do they deny it for the truth that such is the purport of the letter refer to president mahan of oberlin to whom showed it mr george johnson saysl will testify at any time and place that i have heard some of the very men who voted for the passage of those resolutions against w p newman among whom are peter b smith and josiah henson sen say that they had no confidence in hiram wilson and further mr henson said wilson is a rascal has mr henson forgotten that he told me he had no confidence in mr wilson and that lie wanted to get a colored man in his place does he deny it in the third j resolution call mr wilson our brother if he is a rascal as he is called and the chairman highly appreciates his labor then he appreciates the labor ofa rascal and it follows that he himself is one mr wilson says when i wrote to the liberator had then no official connection with the dawn institute and have not at present i affirm positively that mr wilson told me when at dawn in novemlier last that he had accepted the trusteeship in the place ot friend f stover for the dawn school does lie deny it and also that he was then acting as chairman of the ex committee of the same school this too i dare him to deny he tries to get out of answering the interrogations by saying ido not feel called upon to answer sixteen interrogations over the heads of the trustees and committeemen mr wilson has been the president of the institution till very recently and he is the one and the only one upon whom we ought to call foi such information besides the donations of the people for the poor were given to him for the most part to be faithfully applied fur their good and we hold him responsible to see it done and to give us an account of it this is as much as we can spare room for this week the remainder will appear in our next number reciprocity of trade with canada the

occurred in mississippi in which washington and james billioes were killed a man named brown and his oninlaw wages were concerned in it wages for a time disappeared a few months back fie reappeared in the county and with a roan named mcgrath got into a difficulty with young harvey upon whom wages pretended to have some claim harvey shot them both as lias been reported in the mobile papers copied by us since then the tragedy has deepened in atrocity and five more lives have been taken it appears that the father and mother of the wages shot by harvey lived in alabama close to the line of perry county miss where they harbored the gang of outlaws with whom the r son and mcgrath were associated they swore vengeance upon harvey and hired a man named lee to kill him giving him a thousand dollars for the job lee took with him a party of three or four and proceeded to earn his money young harvey had been cautioned not to expose himself and lie had removed from the house or cabin upon his farm to his fathers but was in the habit of visiting his farm once or twice daily to look after it this lee and his party found out by prowling in the vicinity and took advantage of harveys absence to enter his cabin they secured themselves therein cut loopholes foim which to watch his coming and armed with guns patiently awaited his arrival harvey discovered the preparations made for his murder joined by a younger brother j he raised a party of eight or ten men and all proceeded to his cabin the miscreants inside were taken by suiprise butsecured the entrance to the cabin harvey very recklessly led to attack them he rushed upifn the door and buist it in hut they were prepared and tjgc shot him directlpthrough the shoulder and breast killing him his younger brother j immediately shot liec down and as the party inside rushed out to escape lie look a flying shot at them and killed another man named j gcoige jourdan upon receiving news of his sons death old harvey determined upon exterminating the nucleus of the gangold wages and hi wife a party volunteered to follow him and proceeded across the line of alabama to the residence of wages they found the old folks at home seized them and with ropes taken with them for the propose hung them by the neck to the rafters of lire house waiting an hour or so till their victims were dead they then left and returned into ala bama it is due to the harvey family to say that they have long been known as honest respectable people they were peaceable even to a fault until recently by an attack upon one of their number and bis

ten minutes with the roar of thunder hut ther are much more seldom visible and sometimes the traveller crosses the wengera alp without witnessing them at all but we were so very highly favored as to sec two of the grandest avalanches possible in the course of about an hour between twelve oclock and two one cannot command any language to coni vey an adequate idea of their magnificence ou arc standing far below gazing up to where the great disc of the glittering alps cots the heavens and drinking in the influence of the i silent scene around suddenly an j enormous mass of snow and ice in itself a mountain seems to move it breaks from the toppling outmost mountain ridge of snow where it is hundreds of feet in depth and in its first fall of perhaps two thousand feet is broken into millions of fragments as you first see the flash of distant artillery by night then hear the roar so here you may see the white flashing mass majestically bowing then hear the astounding din a cloud of dusty misty dry snow rises into the air from the concussion forming a white volume of fleecy smoke or misty light from the bosom of which thunders forth the icy torrent in its second prodigious fall over the rocky battlements the eye follows it delighted as it ploughs through the path which preceding avalanches have worn till it comes to the brink of avast ridge of bare rock perhaps more than two thousand feet perpendicular then pours the whole cataract over the gulf with a still louder noise of echoing thunder to which nothing but the noise of niagara in its sublimity is comparable nevertheless you may think of the tramp of an array of elephants of the roar of multitudinous cavalry marching to battle of the whirlwind tread of ten thousand bisons sweeping across the prairie of the tempestsurf of ocean beating and shaking the continent of the sound of torrentfloods or of a numerous host or of the voice of the trumpet on sinai exceeding loud and waxing louder and louder so that all the people in the camp trembled or of the rolling orbs of that fierce chariot described by milton under whow burning wheels die steadfast empyrean shook throughout it is with such a mighty shaking tramp i that the avalanche downthunders i another fall of still greater depth j ensues over a second similar castellated ridge or reef in the face of the mountain with an awful majestic slowness and a tremendous crash in its concussion awakening again the reverberating peals of thunder then the torrent roars on to another smaller fall till at length it reaches a mighty groove of snow and ice like the slide down the pilatus of which playfair has given so powerfully graphic a description here its progress is slower and last of all you listen to the roar of the falling fragments as they drop out of sight with a dead weight into the bottom of the gulf to rest there forever now figure to yourself a cataract like that of niagara for i should judge the volume of one of these avalanches to be probably every way superior in bulk to the whole of the horseshoe fall poured in foaming grandeur not merely over one great precipice of two hundred feet but over the successive ridgy precipices of two or three thousand in the face of a mountain eleven thousand feet high and tumbling crashing thundering down with a continuous din of far greater sublimity fhan the sound of the grandest cataract placed on the slope of the wengern alp right opposite the whole of the visible side of the jungfrau we have enjoyed two of these mighty spectacles at about half an hours interval between them the first was the most sublime the second the most beautiful the roar of the falling mass begins to be heard the moment it is loosened from the mountain it pours on with the sound of avast body of rushing water then comes the first great concussion a booming crash of thunders breaking on the still air in mid heaven your breath is suspended as you listen and look the mighty glittering mass shoots headlong over the main precipice and the fall is so great that it produces to the eye that impression of dread majestic slowness of which i have spoken though it is doubtless more rapid than niagara but if you should see the cataract of niagara itself coming down five thousand feet above you in the air there would be the same impression the image remains in the mind and can never fade from it it is as if you had seen an alabaster cataract from heaven dr cheevers pignw in the shadow of the jungfrau alp the clergy in olden time a young levitesuch was the phrase then in

that the country attorney and the country apothecary looked downwith disdain on the country gentleman but that one of the lessons most earnestly inculcated on every girl of hon ourable family was to give no encouragement to a lover in orders and that if any young lady forgot this precept she was almost as much disgraced as by an illicit amour macaulay hi j fory of england arab wombs and workmen when first employed the arabs the women were sorely illtreated andi subjected to great hardships i endeavored to introduce some reform into their domestic arrangements and punished severely those who inflicted corporal chastisement on their wives ina short time the number of domestic quarrels was greatly reduced and the women who were at first afraid to complain of their husbands now boldly appealed to me for protection they had however some misgivings as to the future which were thus expressed by a deputation sent to return thanks after an entertainmento bey we are your sacrifice may god reward you have we not eaten wheat bread and even meat and butter since we have been under your shadow is there one of us that has not now a colored handkerchief for her head bracelets and anklerings and a striped cloak but what shall we do when you leave us which god forbid you ever should do our husbands will then have their turn and there will be nobody to help us these poor creatures like all arab women were exposed to constant hardships they were obliged to look after the children to make the bread to fetch water and to cut wood which they brought home from afar on their heads moreover they were entrusted with all the domestic duties wove their wool and goats hair into clothes carpets and tentcanvass and were left to strike and raise the tents and to load and unload the beasts of burden when they change their encamping ground if their husbands possessed sheep or cows they had to drive them to the pastures and to milk them at night when moving they carried their children at their backs during the march and were even troubled with this burden when employed in their domestic occupations if the children were too young to be left alone the men sat indolently by smoking their pipes or listening to a trifling story from some stray arab of the desert who was always there to collect a group around him at first the women whose husbands encamped on the mound brought water from the river but i released them from this labour by employing horses and donkeys in the work the weight of a sheep or goats skin filled with water is not inconsiderable this is hung on the back by cords tied over the shoulders and upon it in addition was frequently seated the child who could not be left in the tent or was unable to follow its mother on foot the bundles of firewood brought froma considerable distance were enormous completely concealing the head and shoulders of those who tottered beneath them and yet the women worked cheerfully and it was seldom that their husbands had to complain of their idleness some were more active than others there was a young girl named hadla who had particularly distinguished herself and was consequently sought in marriage

well remembers the time place and scene which are firmly fixed upon his boyish recollections there dwelt in the town of in old england a remarkable oddity in the person of an attorney at law who although not fair to look upon for he wa in trutlf one of the homeliest specimens of humanity ever i beheld by mortal man was withal a person of sound judgment great bene i volence varied learning a poet a painter and a wit of no mean order it so happened that the aforesaid gentleman g g esq was appointed high sheriff of the town of he was a man of fortune and had a kind heart as many a poor prisoner could testify who partook of the good cheer with wich the prisoners were liberally supplied at christmas and other well known festivals from the private purse of the high sheriff it was of course the duty of the high sheriff to summon a grand and petit jury to attend at the quarter sessions of which the recorder mayor and aldermen of the borough composed the court in the performance of his official duty in summoning the petit juty our high sheriff indulged in some of the strangest and drollest freaks that have probably ever been heard of in any other town or country in the first place he summoned for the october court a jury consisting of twelve of the fattest men he could find in the borough and when they came to the book to be sworn it appeared that only nine jurors could sit comfortably in the box after a great deal of sweating squeezing and scolding the panel was literally jammed into the box and when seated they presented to the eye of the court the barrister and the audience the tightest fit of a jury that was ever seen in a court room literally they became much to the astonishment of the court and its robed advocates a packed jury and no mistake for the january terra our ftfrtitrus high sheriff in consequence it was said of some hint from the recorder that there should be no more fat pan nels aummuwml to his court went into the opposite extreme he sum mooed twelve of the ummul and tulle men he could find in the borough and when they took their seats in the box it appeared comparatively empty there was indeed room for twelve more of the same sort and dimensions j for the april term of the court our humorous functionary sugpnoned a jury consisting of twelve barbers now it so happened that among the latter were the very perruquiers who dressed the recorders and barristers wigs and some of the latter arriving late at the bar had to appear that morning in court with their wigs undressed or half pressed so as to cut a very ridiculous figure amidst the smiles and halfsup pressed laughter of the bystanders j the high sheriff enjoyed the fun amaz  ingly but looked grave as a judge while he tried to keep silence in the court room but the crowning joke of this waggish functionary occurred at the sum nooning of his fourth and last jury at the summer session in july for that court the high sheriff not having the fear of the recorder the mayor and the aldermen before his eyes actually summoned a squinting jury twelve as queer looking bipeds as ever took their seats in a jury boxa jury that was probably more looked at and laughed at than any of the appointed twelve that ever were sworn to well and truly try and true deliverance make between their sovereign lord and king aud the prisoner at the barbut the scene was so irresistibly droll that the learned recorder could not maintain his gravity the mayor and aldermen followed suit the barristers laughed while their wigs became bald powderless nay even the poor prisoners in the dock who were to be put upon their trial and some of them undergo transportation could not refrain from joining in the general cachinnation and when the learned recorder commanded the high sheriff to bring the court room to order and intimated with a halfsuppressed laugh that the latter ought to be ashamed of himself for summoning such a jury the drollery of this court scene was heightened considerably by the quick ready and sonorous response of the high sheriff who looking at the same time at the squinting jury exclaimed all good and lawful men your honor american hoises a foreign tourist has observed that the democratic character of american institutions is sufficiently attested by our houses and edificeseach property owner expresses his peculiar idea of architepture and independently carries them into effect in no city is the latter more striking or absurde than in the three sections of new orleans the architectural tastes of every nation have been consulted perhaps in some part of them a tartar or japanese sojourner might feel at home on one block will stand a row of buildings that might have been transplanted bodily from marseilles or lyons their chambers filled with revolutionary memories upon another block a dozen straggling dwellings remind one of spain or mexicoa pair of dark eyes and a head of most picturesquely uncombed hair here and there beheld wonderfully assisting in the illusion inone part a downeaster has faithfully copied in wood and plaster his old homestead on the kennebec or housatonic in another kentucky taste so
