nothing but slavery among those who participated in the discussion on mr golfs resolution in congress for the abolition of the slavetrade in the district of columbia was mr sawyer of ohio he said f l have listened to gentlemen who have discussed this question is it possible that no other question but that of slavery can be debated look at the situation of affairs on your calendar there are seven hundred private bills and thousands of petitions are coming in daily there is in addition a hundred or so of laws to be acted on but from morning till night nothing is talked of without having negroes and negro slavery introduced i appeal to the good sense of the house and the patriotism of the country and ask them to abandon this infamous means of legislation ha ha ha we ought at some time to get rid of it what domy constituents care about the subject there are other questions of more importance and yet we are spending our time day after day arguing an abstract question it appears that certain gentlemen embarrass us in our legislation my constituents understand these things very well and they never ask me about them unless there is something practical the session is half out and there is a large amount of business before us the people are suffering you hear a voice of warning the cholera is approaching ha ha ha youll laugh the other way if it catches you it may soon be in our neighborhood you cant keep congress together if it comes i ask gentlemen to take into consideration these matters and proceed to business and leave negro slavery to the people themselves our constituents did not send us here for such pur posess how is it with my constituents there are other questions which involve their interests much more than this what are they it reminds me of an anecdote of a little hoy who went to a neighboring woman to get a patch puton his pantaloons ha ha the boy resembled the boy in the slashes going o mill with bis streamer behind in the breeze the woman asked why does not your mother mend your pantaloons why he said she is making up clothing to send to the greeks ha ha attend to your own households and then attend to the greeks i have constituents and nota tear is shed for them around them the banks are breaking and there is not a word of sympathy let us goto work and have a tariff on a proper basis so as not to make the wealthy richer to the detriment of the poor and not to tolerate the banking system which cuts the throats of ninetenths for the advantage of the few let us not be led away by the tgtttt fatu an of negroes the greeks are at your door as john randolph once said legislate for free whites first and then i wi be time eitougii to let your sympathies rm for the black population i repeat that the course which we are now pursuing tends to degrade us and the character of this house when thousands of honest claims are pressing onus we are consuming the time in disgraceful scenes ask mr speaker how we can get c b ar j thi can it be by moving to lay on the table to indefinitely postpone or what move the previous i demand it and wont withdraw hold on to it south carolina apprehensions the south carolinian published at the the north star seat of government of the palmetto state says yve care not for the bluster of all abolitionists from the st lawrence to mason and dixons linewe ware not for their fanatical ravings so long as the alaveholding states present an unbroken front at home we are not of those who would fear for the safety of the institution even if an overriding and lawless majority of congress were to pass direct enactments forits immediate abolition if there were no shrinking and heretical morbidity of feeling among certain schools of politicians and classes of individuals scattered everywhere throughout the southern country but so it iswe soon will have all our enemies abroad to combat and will be compelled to strictly watch intestinal traitors to the very land which gives them bread to eat selections speech of mr j r giddingb on the ml to pay the heirs of antonio pacheco for a slave sent west of the mississippi with the si mi note indians in ft conclidfcd j if the doctrine contended for by the friends of this bill be correct if slaves be property slave markets may be opened in boston and massachusetts will have no power to prohibit there the revolting scenes which are witnessed in this city if the doctrine contended for by southern men be correct no state can exclude slave markets from its territory or consecrate its soil to freedom it well becomes southern gentlemen to examine this subject before they base themselves upon the principle that slaves are property let that be established and congress will have power to prohibit the internal slave trade at its pleasure i now proceed to another branch of the case with great propriety the gentleman from new hampshire inquired at what time the liability of government to pay for this slave commenced the question has not been answered nor do i think it can be answered the undertaking was hazardous in the highest degree the troops werejall killed but two or three by the enemy and those were supposed to be dead this man alone escaped unhurt this danger was foreseen and the master put a price upon the services to compare with the risk did this contract bind the government to pay for the masters loss admitting the slave to have been property was it any part of the compact that the government should insure the property it strikes me that no lawyer would answer in the affirmative the law of bailment is surely understood by every tyro in the profession the bailee for hire is bound to exercise the same degree of care over the property that careful men ordinarily take of their own property if then the property be lost the owner sustains such loss now conceding this man to be property the government would not have been liable had he run away or been killed by accident or died of sickness yet sir when property is lost or destroyed by the act of god or by the common enemy of the country no bailee is ever holden re sponsiblenot even common carriers and that is the highest species of bailment had this officer acting on his own responsibility agreed to take the negro through the country for hire admitting the man to have been property and governed by the same rules i of law as though he had been a mule oran ass and he had been captured by the enemy no law would have held such bailee liable but sir an entirely different rule prevails where the owner of a chattel lets it to a bailee for wages had this man been a mule oran ass and the officer hired him of the owner for wages to ride through the country or to work in a team or in any other manner and he had been captured by the enemy the bailee would not have been liable upon any rule of law or of justice nor would behave been liable if lost in any other manner except by neglect of the bailee the gentleman from south carolina mr burt said he would place this case upon strictly legal principles sir i meet the gentleman on that proposition i too for the sake of the argument am willing to submit it on principles of law and i believe that no jurist or even justice of the peace i would hesitate to reject the claim on j those grounds all must admit that the liability of the government concerning this man ceased when he was captured by the enemy up to this point the government was not liable i understood the author of this bill mr burt to argue however that we become liable under the contract of bailment that contract was ended when the man was captured the claimant then failed to perform his part of it the stipulation on the part of the master was that the negro should pilot the troops from fort brooke to fort king the place of their destination at the rate of twenty five dollars per month he was captured when only half the distance was accomplished here the master ceased to perforin his compact it was beyond his pqwer to do the contract then ceaseo to exist and from that time forth the claimant had no demand on us either in equity or in law i now enter upon another vifw of this cue i i shown by the testimony of gen jessup that this man was supposed to have kept up an understanding with the enemy from the time he united with dades command until the massacre ot that unfortunate batallion that while he wu with the enemy which right is of no sextroth is of no colorgod is the father of os all and all we are brethren was more than two years he united in committing depredations upon the frontier settlement in short that he was one of the enemy our army was sent there to protect this claimant and his wife and children and neighbors against this very man who in company with others murdered the people of florida and destroyed their property this expenditure of blood and treasure by the united sates was occasioned in part by this very negro for whom the master now claims compensation with his extraordinary intelligence with a knowledge of the wrongs which he and his people had suffered at the hands of those who claimed themas property he must have thirsted for vengeance he could no attachment no reaped people at whose hands he had received nothing but abuse and degradation it was natural that he should have sought revenge and it was natural that his master should become his victim if within iiis power but our army was sent there to protect the people against their slaves who were with the indians and their effective allies it was under these circumstances that lewis was captured with other enemies general jessup says that he would have tried and hanged him if he could have found time this under martial law he might have done and the gentleman who reported this bill admitted that in such case this claim would never have been presented suppose he had been slain in battle i think we should never have heard of this claim but why had general jessup a right to hang him because he was an enemy dangerous to the people and to the government but who will for a moment hesitate to say that he had the same power yea greater power to send him out of the neighborhood than he had to slay him in battle or to hang him humanity surely would dictate that he should be sent out of the neighborhood rather than his life should be sacrificed has the claimants loss been greaterthan it would have been had the negro been slain or hanged not at all he had been taken in arms had committed depredations upon the people he had occasioned much loss of blood and treasure to the nation could gen jessup have left him in florida consistently with his duty i think not here another important question arises had the claimant right to keep an enemy so dangerous within any civilized community is there a member of this body who will rise in his place and assert that any master possesses the right to retain such a foe on his plantation has any man a right to keep a rabid dog or other animal and suffer him to go at large in the community i am now arguing the legal question i am considering this manas property the same as though he were a mule or an ass and i lay it down as clear and indisputable lawthat had such mule or ass killed the people and destroyed their property as this man has done any member of the community might either haye shot him or chased him out of the neighborhood with impunity i therefore meet the gentleman who reported this bill on every point involved in this case legal equitable or constitutional and i canfind no merits in it but sir as i am for the moment engaged in a legal examination of the case i desire to follow it a little further this man was guilty of treason against the united states or he was an enemy to our government i think it doubtful whether slaves can commit treason as they owe no allegiance to our government but if he was not a traitor he was surely an enemy to the country now sir whether traitor or enemy and the master knowing the fact had harbored him adhered to him or given him aid and comfort would not the master have been guilty of the i crime of misprision of treason against the united states and punishable under our laws of this i think there is no doubt and yet we are called upon to pay him a thousand dollars for taking away a man thus dangerous to himself who if he had remained with him would probably have subjected him to the gallows let gentlemen reflect and vote as menas intelligent states men another question arises in this case which to me is equally fatal to this claim a state of war existed gen jessup was the commanding officer in florida he was the agent of the government and whatever the govern ment might do to insure the safety of the people their agent for the time being could accomplish under the martial law by the term martial law mean the war power which is the most dangerous the most indefinite the most unlimited exercised among nations do not refer to the rules and articles of war but to that vague indefinite undefinable power which knows no limits it is that power which in time of war may do anything in the power of manto accomplish may command any sacrifice of the people or of any portion of them in order to secure the safety of the government and of the subjects generally it is that power which authorizes the military commander in short to do whatever he deems necessary tor the security of the public by which suspected men were arrested and imprisoned in connecticut and new york during tbs revolution by which others were ordered to leave the country and by which others were shot down their dwellings burned and their estates confiscated it is the power exercised in sooth carolina during the revolution by sumpter and by marion and their compatriots it was by virtue of this power that jackson at naw orleans suspended the writ of habeas rochester n y friday february  corpusadjourned the legislature ol louisianaordered old men and boys not liable to do military duty by law on to the lines to defend the cityseal all foreigners out of the city as he regarded them as dangerous as this max was supposed to besuffered no communication between the city and coun tryordered a portion of the slaves also into service and sent the others back into the interior many of those slaves were killed but we have at all times refused to pay for them bui does any one deny these unlimited powers not at all if general jackson had the right to send freemen and slaves away from the scene of danger had not gen jessup the same power most assuredly he had but the best illustration ofthis tremendmfes power is said to have occurred at fort erie at the time the british attacked i in a lieutenant commanded a picquet guard t the west of the fort perhaps a mile distant a beautiful plain extends in that direction some half or threefourths of a mile bounded by a dense forest he was posted in this forest as the british coluthn advanced the brave lieutenant with his little band retreated in front of them keeping up his fire in gallant style in order to retard their progres and give notice to our men in the fort and time for them to prepare to receive the enemy an officer who had command of a heavy park of artillery on that wing of the fort am the british column emerged from thffe forest and he saw its force opened a tremendous fire upon it our little guard and their brave commander were directly between the fort and the advancing column of the british army they of course fell beneath the fire that cut down the hostile column as the story is related gen brown was informed of the fact and sent peremptory orders to the officer to cease his fire to this order he paid no attention but kept up such a shower of grape and cannister that the british column was broken and scattered before it reached the fort so that not a man scaled its wails but the whole of our picquet guard with their commander were sacrificed not a man survived for this conduct the officer wss arrested and on trial showed conclusively that the sacrifice of our own guard of thirty men was necessary to save the fort and those in it they sir were freemen their lives were surrendered for the safety of the army these five southern gentleman who reported this bill now insist that the wid tows and orphan children of those men shall contribute a portion of their substance to pay for a southern slave who for the safety of his own master as well as others was sent out of the neighborhood if therebe a northern man in this body willing to lend his vote to conspmmate such an insult to the honor of the free states let him stand forth and avow it were it not chilling to the heart of humanity i would give another illustration of this indefinite and unlimited power i refer to the execution of those lads on board the sloop of war somers a few years since when several midshipmen and apprentices were hanged by order of a lieutenant without trial in order to secure the safety of the ship and crew shall we now tax the fathers and brothers of those young men to pay for this slave but sir to come more immediately to the present case before us i refer gentlemen to the southampton riots in the newspapers of that day informed us that slaves and indeed colored freemen were shot down in the streets others sent to prison and others sent out of the neighborhood shall northern men be taxed to pay for them certainly if you pass this bill we must expect to open the treasury to the slaveholders in all these and in ten thousand other cases by virtue of this same power exercised at southampton general jessup in ofdct to secure the safety of the people rida sent this man lewis with the indians west of the mississippi and nowthe master instead of paying the expense of arresting this maninstead of refunding to this government and to the people of florida the losses he has occasioned by bringing this slave among theminstead of paying for the property this man destroyed he comes here and demands that we should pay him a thousand dollars for preventing lewis from killing more people ud destroying more properly i have now stated my own views in regard to the powers of gen jessup to send this man out of the neighborhood if he possessed these powers to deal with him as with any other enemy noman will urge that we are in law or justice bound to pay for him admitting however for tbe sake of the argument that general jessup had no right to deal with him as an enemy but that be was bound under the order of the war department to deliver him over as a slave that be disobeyed this order and sent him west upon his own responsibility nd in violation of his doty in such case i ask is there a member on this floor who for a moment would suppose the people bound to pay for a slave taken by general jessup in of bhi duty mid of pomtive orders from the w ar department every member must be aware that the rule which cootrol a public agent are the same as those which govern in private life snppo i empiojr a mn to act as my k while he coniines himdfclf to the business on which he is authorized to act i am bound inlaw and to justice by bis contract suppose i employ my friend on my nghl to go and purchase a horse for me he indies a contract for tbe horse in my name lam bound by it and mart perform k but nppem be porebue j farm in my name no man would suppose me obligated for a moment to take the farm military officers are the agents of government to do all things pertaining to their office and which come within the line of their duties gen jessup was an agent to send out of florida all enemies of the country but he was not our agent to send the friends of government west of the mississippi j if he has done so the act is bis not ours it was unauthorized and hei alone is liable now i understand the gentleman from south carolina mr burt to urge that he was an enemy i and dangerous to the country i admit i the fact and say that he sbould be treated as an enemy but if he were not an enemy then there is no claim on the government i but the committee are not content with urging that he was ail enemy to the country and dangerous they suddenly change the argument and say that he was taken for pubile use an enemy to the nation is taken for public use well sir the argument is ingenious it never found a place in the mind of grotius or puffendorf or of any writer upon the law of nations or the rights of government but the point was adopted by the argument of the gentleman from south carolinaand perhaps i ought to notice it for what use was he taken to what use was he applied the gentleman admits the right to shoot or to hang him would not this have been as much a taking for public use as it was to banish him the use of sending him out of the country was the preservation of the lives and property of the people that would have keen equally attained by shooting or hanging the negro but the reply to this is he was property well i repeat suppose he had been a rabid dog or a vicious mule killing people and destroying their property and general jessup had shot or chased him out of the country to prevent him from killing his master or others would the government have been liable i will not argue this point further again it is said that by the act of hiring we admitted the slave to be property and that the government is now estopped from denying that fact we are bound to treat all on this floor with respect but to suppose that this obscure lieutenant who perhaps never read a commentary on the constitution and who i dare say never dreamed that he was affecting or doing anything to affect our rights or our duties i say that to suppose his acts would estop congress from maintaining the constitution or that such acts would have any weight whatever with this body is a proposition which i will not detain the house to examine he was our agent for the purpose of doing his military duty but we never authorized him to legislate for us or to give construction to our constitutional rights why sir i may hire out my son or apprentice or my hired servant but would that be an admission that they were my property or suppose i should agree that the gentleman from south carolina mr burt attend the speaker to st given place does that imply that i hold him a property no sir the only fact implied is that i have a right to receive the wages when the labor or duty is performed according to my contract in this case the claimant agreed that lewis should accompany the troops and the officer agreed to pay the master twentyfive dollars per month the claimant might have made the same arrangement in regard to any freeman as he did in regard to lewis and when the labor was performed he would have the same right to the money but in such case would the government be obligated to pay him for the body of such freeman no doubt the obligations would rest upon the hirer that now rest on the government and no more but the gentleman from south carolina mr burt says that the act of levying direct taxes recognizes slaves as property that law provides that such law shall constitute a lien upon the real estate and upon all staves of individuals upon whom said tax shall be assessed my presumption ft that this bill was drawn by some southern man who did not reflect that slaves were less property under the federal constitution than they were under the laws of the slave states the gentleman does not pretend that at the passage of that law the question whether slaves were persons or property was i raised or discussed or thought of i need not say that a kill passed sub silentio constitutes no precedent in our i courts of justice the judge takes no notice of questions not made by the parties nor do the proceedings of a court form any authority on points not raised nor discussed by counsel nor examined by the court the case of depeyrter to which i referred was a stronger case than that of the law of my friend from pennsylvania mr dickey as well as myself stated that that case passed when no one knew it i knew that my lamented frtqnd mr adams and myself both intended to oppose its pasi aage and we were both watching it but it got through when we were unconscious of it does any manl will not say lawyersuppose that its passage constitutes any precedent showing that slaves are property yet this law of so far as wo know received no more attention or at least that part of it relating to slaves than did the act for the relief of depeyster it can therefore constitute no precedent tbe force of a precedent consists in tbe respect which we pay to tbe judgment of n former congress it is tlwrsfbn necessary to give the precedent any force whatever that tbe jndg roent of the tribunal should have bee exercised upon the question whether i be a judicial or legislative precedent thus in each case that i have cited as precedents either in this house o committees the questions now unde j consideration were discussed and deliberation had and a judgment givei  upon the point before us now sir let me say with all due respect t southern gentlemen that i challenge them to produce an instance in this house or the supreme court othe united states or any respectabb i court of any free state has decide slaves to be property under the federal constitution in any case when that question has been raised or examined i desire to see gentlemei come to a definite issue on this subject i wish to meet them fairly and distinctly they must admit that the framers of the constitution intended to exclude from that instrument the idea that thert could be property in man to thal point i intend to hold them and i call upon them to meet the record of mr madison to which i have referred let them deny that record or carry out the intentions of tho framers of that in strument the gentleman from south carolina mr burt says he should like tc know what was contemplated by that clause in the constitution which stipulates for the surrender of fugitive slaves unless it be that their owners hold property in them i answer that clause means just what it says il i gives to the holder of sdaves the righl i to pursue and recapture them in a free state precisely as it gives me the righl to pursue and retake my apprentice ot my son in any state to which he ms escape it no more admits the slave tc be property than it admits the apprentice or the minor to be property lan tired of hearing this clause of the constitution quoted to prove almost every doctrine advanced by southern men its provisions are of the most plain and obvious character it merely provides for the recapture and return of slaves and nothing more but my hour has nearly expired my constituents hold slavery to be a crime of the deepest dye the robbing of a man of his property or the seizing of his ship upon the high seas we regard as grievous offences which should exclude the perpetrator from human associations for the time being but we look upon those crimes as of small importance when compared with that of robbing a man of his labor his liberty his social his intellectual enjoyments to disrobe him of his humanity to degrade and brutalize him on this account we protest solemly against being involved in the wickedness and in the crimes of that institution today we are asked to pay our money for the liberty of our fellowman we hold that he was endowed with that liberty by his creator that it is impious and in the highest degree criminal fora man or for a government to rob any portion of our race of their godgiven rights as the representative of a christian and a moral constituency i deny the right of congress to involve them or me in the support of such crimes by our compact of union no such power is delegated to congress by the passage of this bill we shall become slavedealers ourselvestraders in humanity the people of our state shrink from the foul contagion with mr gerry we hold that we have nothing to do with slavery in the states but will be careful not to give it any sanction with mr madison we hold that it would be wrong to admit that there can be property in man and with the signers of the declaration of american independence we hold that it is sell evident truth that all men are created equal we believe our rights to enjoy these doctrines unmolested by this government as clear and indisputable asare the rights of the slave states to deny them in theory and in practp we claim no superiority of privileges under the compact w e admit them under the constitution to enjoy their slavery unmolested by congress or by the free states its blessings and its curses its horrors and its disgrace are theirs we neither claim the one nor will we share in the other we will have no participation in its guilt itis the object of our perfect hate southern gentlemen may continue to misrepresent us by saying that we seek to interfere with that institution in the states but thank god we have at last obtained access to the public ear the people of the free states now understand that all our efforts politically are based upon the constitutional right ol being exempt from its support for years i have made it a practice when have spoken in this hall tw guard against misrepresentation by avowing my doctrines i am aware of the efforts now making by northern presses letter writers from this city and editors who pander to the spirit of servility to misrepresent my views and assail my motives sir let me smy to tmse men before heaven if they will come up to the work unite their inauence and separate this government from the support of slavery and the siavetrade and leave that institution where the constitution placed it with the statei in which it musts with gratitude tc god and with love and good will to al my fellowmen i will retire from the halls to the obscurity of private life sir may on the present occasion disabose myself of the imputation thai wish to embarrass the friends of tin incoming administration those win have done me the honor to observe j course in ibis bail for tbe last ten years must do me tbe justice to say tbs my efforts here have been again exwtmj evils desire to soe every member ol titty pmtj ta htattmcttowr john dick pvausnsß whole no i j port tho constitution of my country tnj the

to uphold tbe slave trade by congressional law or lends his inauence to continue within this district or on the high seas a commerce in human aesh i know that the sympathies the consciences and the judgment of the people are with me recent events have demonstrated the power of truth its omnipotence is irresistible it is rolling onward no political paltering no party evasions no deceptions no dodgings of responsibility will satisfy the people no gentlemen must come up to the work they must take theirposition upon the line of the constitution and maintain the rights of the free as well as of the slave states or they will be overwhelmed by the indignation of a free and virtuous people gen taylor and his friends will have an opportunity of gaining immortal honors and of deserving and receiving the gratitude t the american people let them at once abolish slavery and the siavetrade in this district and upon the high seas let this government cease to oppress and degrade our race let us cease to legislate for slavery let the powers and inauence of government be exerted to promote human liberty to elevate mankind in his moral and physical being and the honors of men and the blessings of heaven and the gratitude of this and of coming generations shall be theirs but if their inauence be exerted to maintain this commerce in human aesh now carried on in this district and

negro man named ben thomas belongong to wm h goff was convicted in talbot co md of enticing and assisting slaves to runaway the other day he was sentenced to years and months labor in the penitentiary this is tbe way in which slavery law and slavery courts administer justice for endeavoring to persuade bur human beings to exercise a right which in our declaration is held to be inalienable a man is doomed to fifteen and a half years labor in the penitentiary had he attempted to kidnap four white persons with a view to enslave them the same laws would have sent him to the same prison if this be justice itis only slavery justice cltre o true dem the slave trade in washington citv recent events especially those connected with the affair of the sale and redemption of harriet madison and the dmondson family have greatly aroused the public mind with regard to the atrocities of the trade in human beings now openly carried on at washington city that trade is too inhuman and disgraceful to be borne any longer by the people of the united states the inhabitants of washington owe it to their own civilization to unite their efforts with those of other citizens to put a stop to it the time is now favorable for taking up and disposing of this one subject disconnected from every question lei us have a united movement on the part of all who wish to see this trade abolished by law however widely they may differ on any or all other points let our petitions oe aimed at this one thing let us see if our american congress can be prevailed upon to take a step which was taken by the bey of tunis more than five years ago and forbid the trade inhuman beings for the glory of mankind and todistinguish them from the brute creation surely this is an object which ought to unite at once the

which it has been ret aside may fairly he regarded as one of the moot fatal blows ever received by the sooth sad the eaton a jht raaoot be more concisely sod correctly mated than h has been by two of the learned judge of the supreme court of tire united state in one of his deo smos judge story said lifotorirauy it ii well known that the effect of this clause was to secure to the citizen of the slavebotdiag state the complete right and title of ownership in their slaves as property in every state the union into winch they might escape from the state wherein they were held in sarvitude the toll recognition of this right and title was indispensable to the security of this peies of property in ail ihe shareholding stales and indeed was so vital j to the preservation of their institution

ptevalent m the nonmaveholding slates by preventing them front intermeddling with or rstrict ijig or alioushing the nghtf ol the owner of slaves again tlte clause was therefore of the last importance of the safety and security of the mnh i cm state and could not be surrendered by them without endangering their whole property in slaves i the clause was accordingly adopted n lie conwi i tut ion by the unanimous conaent of the framers of ita proof at once of its intrinsic and practical aecesfoty again the clause manifestly contemplate the existence of a positive unqualified right on the i part of the owner of the slave which no state law or regulation can in any way regulatecontrol qualify or restrain the opinion of the other learned judges was not less emphatic a to the importance ol this provision and the unquestionable right ol the south under it judge baldwin in charging the jury said r if there arc any rights of property which can be enforced il one citizen have aoy rights of property which arc inviolvable underthe protection of the dipirine law ol the state and the union they are those which have been set ati naught by some of these defendants as the owner of property

a ground oil which the government itself is based it the defendants loan he justified we have no longer law or jov eminent i again after referring more particularly to the provision for delivering up fugitive la ve lie said thus you see that the foundations ot th govern mem are laid and rest on the right of properly in slaves the whole structure must fall by disturbing the comer stone j these are grave and solemn and admonitory words front a high source they confirm all for i which the south has ever contended as lo i the clearness importance and fundamental cliar acter ol this provision and the disastrous oonse  quences which would inevitably follow from its vio  huion but in spite of these solemn warnings the violation then commenced and which they were intended to rebuke has been fully and perfectly j consummated ihe citizens of the south in their attempt to recover their slaves now meet instead oi aid and cooperation resistance in every form resistance from hostile retof legislationintended i to baffle and defeat their claims by all sorts of devices and by interposing every description of irn pedimentresistance from judges and magistrates and finally when all these fail from mohe composed of whites and blacks which by threats ori force rescue the fugitive slave from the possession of his rightful owner the attempt to recover a slave in most of the northern states cannot now r be made without the hazard of insult heavy pecuniary loss imprisonment and even of life itself already has a worthy citizen of maryland d lost his life in making an attempt to enforce his claim f i to a lugitive slave under this provision j but a provision of the constitution may be violated indirectly as well as directly by doing an actin its nature inconsistent with that which is enjoined to be done of this form of violation there is a striking instance connected with the provision under consideration we allude to secret combi j nations which are believed to exist in many of the r northern states whose object is to entice decoy i enrap inveigle and seduce slaves to escape frome their owners and to pass them secretly and rapict i ly by means organized for that psrpose into j canada where they will be beyond the reach ol s the provision that to entice a slave by whatever artifice u abscond from his ow r ner into noni i slaveholding state with the intention to place him i beyond the reach of the provision or prevent his y recovery by concealment or otherwiseis as conj  pletely repugnant to it as its open violation would lie is too clear to admit of doubt or to require il t lustration and yet as repugnant as these combi t inationsare in the intent of the provision it isbe lieved that with the above exception not one oi the states within whose limits they exist has adop any measure to suppress them or to punish r those by whose agency the object for which they were formed is carried into execution on the contrary they have looked on and witnessed with indifference if not with secret approbation a great t number of slave enticed from their owners and placed beyond the possibility of recovery to the great annoyance and heavy pecuniary loss ol the ordering southern stales when we take into consideration the great im porlaneeof this provision the absence of all uncertainty as to its true meaning and intent the i many guards by which it is surrounded to protect and enforce it and then reflect how completely the object lor which it was inserted in the constitution is defeated by these twofold infractions we doubt taking all together whether a more fla fhjrant breach of faith is to be found on record we language we have used is strong but it is not less the than strong there remains to be noticed another class ol ag r gressive arts of a kindred character but which instead of striking at an express and specific pro vision of the constitution aims directly at destroy j ing the relation between the two races at the south by means subversive in their tendency of one of the ends for which the constitution was established we refer to the systematic agitation i of the question by the abolitionists which coni mencing aliout ia still continued in all pos i aible forms their avowed intention is to bring almut a state of things that will force emancipation on tle south to unite the north in fixed hostility t slavery in the south and to excite dimcoiitent among the siaves with their condition are among the means employed to effect it with i a iew to bring about the former every means are i reorted to in order to render

have i been continued with more or leas activity for af series of years not without doing much towards effecting the object intended we regard both object sod mean to be aggressive and dangerous to the rights of the south and aubverahre as ata i ted of one of the ends lor which the cunsmotmul f was establishd slavery is a domestic ineittauoo i it belongs to the states each for tself to decide j

oceurrences connected i with it and the consequences io which it has di rectiy fed in the latter part of the then territory of missouri applied to congress in the i usual furtu for leave to form a

make it ai condition of her admission that her coosaitution riiould have a provision to prohibit slavery tbi i brought on the agitating debate which with the effect imat followed has done so much to alienate j the south and north and endanger our political institutions those who objected to the amend i meats rested their opposition on the high ground lof the right of selfgovernment they claimed tlist a territory having reached the period when itis proper for it to form a constitution and govern mem for itelt brcoines fully vested with all th rights of selfgovernment and that even the ron j dition imposed on it by the federal constitution i i relates not to the formation of its constitution and government but it admission into the union eoi i that puriwseit provides as a condition that th government must be republican r they claimed that congress has no right to add to this comillion and that to assume it would b tantamount o the assumption of the right to make i its entire constitution and government as no lim i iiation ronld be imposed as to the extent of the right if it be admilted that it exists all those who supported the amendment denied these i grounds and claimed the right of congress to im jwse at discretion what condition it pleased ir ibis agitating debate the two sections stood ari rayed against each other the south in favor ol the bill without amendment and the north opposed to it without it the debate and agitatioc continued until the seiuii wcl advanced r but it became apparent towards its close that the i people of missouri were fixed and resolved in theii opioitioii to the proposed condition and that thej i would certainly reject it and adopt a constitutior wills nit it should the bill pass with the condition such being the i ape it required no great effort o v mind to perceive that missouri once in poesessioi r of a constitution and government not simply orb paper but with legislator elected and officers appointed to carry them into effect the grave ques turn would be presented wheiher she was of righ a ritate or territory and if the latter whethe f congress had the right and if the right of power p to abrogate her constitution disperse her leg y islature und to remand her back to the territoria r condition these were great and under the cir f cumstances fearful questionstoo fearful to be ihe i by those who had the agitation from tha time the only question was how to escape irom th difficulty fortunately a means was afforded a compromise as it wad called was offeredbase t on the terms that the north should cease to oppose the admission of missouri on the grounds for which the south contended and that the pro vie i ions ol the ordinance of for the governmen i of the northwestern territory should be appliei f to all the territory acquired by the united state from france under the treaty of louisiana lyinj f north of except the portion lying in tin ii state of missouri the northern members em i braced it and although not originating with them adopted it as their own it waa forced througl congress by the almost united votea of the north t against a minority consisting almost entirely ci members from the southern states e such was the termination of this the first conn diet under the constitution between the two sec j tions in reference to slavery in connexion with thi e territories many hailed it as a permanent am final ajubtment that would prevent the recurrenci n of similar conflicts but others less sanguinetool the opposite apd more gloomy view regarding io as the precursor of a train of events

determined and hostile character to their conflict tit north no longer respects the missouri compromise e line adopted by their almost unanimous vote f i instead of compromise they avow that their des ftrmination is to exclude slavery from ail the ter ii iilorfes of the united states acquired or to be acquired and of course to prevent the citizens oi the southern states from emigrating with theii i

excluding slavery therefrom the president gave hi sanction to the bill and ornt a special message to congress assigning his reasons fordoing so the reasons presupposed that the missouri compromise was to be ami would be ex leaded west of the rocky mountains to the faeitir ocean and ibe president intimated his intention in his message to veto any future bil that should restrict slavery south of the line cf lhat compromise assuming it t have been the pnrpose and intention of the north to extend the missouri compromise line as above indicated the passage of the oregon bill could only be regarded aa evincing the acquiescence of the south in that line but the developments of the present session of congrrs have made it manifest to ail that no such purpose or intention now exists with the north to any considerable extent of the truth of this we have ample evidence in what has already occurred in the house of representatives where the popular feelings are soonest and most intensely felt although cougrrss has been in session but lit tie more than one month a greater number of measures of aggressive character have been introduced and they more aggravated and dangerous than have been for years before and what clear iy discloses whence they take their origin is the fact that they all relate to the territorial aspect of the subject of slavery or some other of a nature j and character intimately connected with it the first ot this series of aggressions is a resolution introduced by a member from massachusetts the object of which is to repeal all acts parts of acts which recognize the existence of slavery or authorize the selling and disposing of slave in this district on question of leave to bring ir j a bill the vote stood for and against leave the next was a resolution offered by a memhei j from ohioinstructing the committee on territories to report forthwith bills for excluding slavery from california and new mexico it passed by a vote of to that was followed by a bili introduced by another member from ohio to take the vote of this district on the question whethei slavery within its limits should be abolished the bill provides according to the admission ol the mover that the free negroes and slaves should xote on the question to lay the bill on the table the vote stoodfor against to thii succeeded the resolution of a member from naw r york in the following words wherea the traffic now prescuted in thii metropolis of the republic in human beings ai chattels is contrary to natural justice and the fundamental principles of our political system and ii notoriously a reproach to our country throughou  and a serious hindrance to the progress of republican liberty among the natiqpa o the earth therefore resolved that the committee for the distric of columbia be instructed to report a bilj as soot as practicable prohibiting slavery in said district on the question of adopting the resolution thi f votes stood for and against he was followed by a member from illinois who offered resolution for abolishing slavery in the territories and all places where congress has exclusive powers of legislation that is all forts magazines ari senate dockyards and other nerdfol buildings purchased by congress with the consent of thf legislature of the state this resolution was passed over under the rule of the house without being put to vote the votes in favor of all these measures wer confined to the members from the northern state true there are some patriotic members from tha section who voted against all of them and whoa high tense of justice ie duly appreciated who ii the progress of agressions upon the south have by their votes sustained the guarantees of the con slitution and ol whom we regret to say inanj have leen sacrificed at home by their patheth couroe we have now brought to a close a narrative othe series of acts of aggression and encroachmen connected with the stlbject of this address mclud i i ing those that are consummated and those still ir progress they are numerous great and dangerous and threaten with destruction the greatest and most vital of all the interests and institution of the south indeed it may be doubted whetb er there is a tingle provision stipulation or guaranty of the constitution intended for the security of the south that has not been rendered almost nugatory it may even be made a serious qoes tion whether the encroachments already made without the aid of any other would not if per rained to operate unchecked end in emancipation j and that at no distant day but be that aa it may it hardly admits of a doubt that if the aggression already commenced in the house and now in pro grets should be consummated such ha the end j would certainly be the consequence i little ia truth would be left to be done after we bare beea excluded trom ail the territories including those to be hereafter acquired after slavery is abolished in the district and in the numerous places dispersed all over the south when congress has the exclusive right of legislation and after the other measures proposed are consummated every outpost sod bonier would be carried and nothing would be left but to finish the work of abolition at pleasure in the btataa themselves the district aad all places over which icoogre has exclusive power of legislation would be asylums lor fugitive slaves where aa soon aa they placed their feet they would become according to the doctrines uf our northern assailants free on less there should hi some positive enactments to prevent it under such a state of things the probability fo that emancipation would soon follow without soy final act to abotifh slavery the depreaaag effects of such measures oa the white race at the booth sad the hope they would create io the black of a speedy emancipation would produce a mate of feeniig inconsistent with the ranch longer continuance of the existing relation between the twp but be that an it may it fo

furnishes a very faint picture of dte calamities it would bring on the south the circumstance under which it would take place with ns would be entirely different firm tlwwc which took place with them and calculated to lead to far more disastrous results there the government of the parent country emancipated slaves in her colonial possessionsa government rich mod powerful and actuated by views o policy mistaken as they turned out tobe rather than fanaticism it was besides disposed to act justly towards the owners even in the act of emancipating their slaves and to protect and foster them afterwards it accordingly appropriated nearly as a compensation to them for their losses under the act which sum although it turned out to be far short of the amount was thought at that time to be liberal since the emancipation it haa kept up a sufficient military and naval force to keep the blacks in awe and a number of magistrates and constables and othei civil officers to keep order in the towns and plantations and enforce respect to v ther formei owners to a considerable extent thege have ata substitute for the police formerly kept on tht plantations by the owners and their overseers and to preserve the social and political superiority oi the white race but notwithstanding afl thistht british west india possessions are ruined impoverished miserable wretched and destined to b abandoned to the black race very different wouk be the circumstances under which emancipatiot would take place with us if it ever should be ef tected it will be through the agency of the tedira i government controlled by the dominant power othe northern states of the confederacy against th i resistance and struggles of the southern it can then only be effected by the prostratioi of the white race and that would necessarily cn gender the the bitterest feelings of hostility between them and the north but the reverse woul be the case between the blacks of the south anthe people of the north owing their emancipation to them they would regard them as friendi i guardians patrons and centre accordingly a j their sympathy in them the people of the north would not fail to it ciprocate and to favor ihem instead of the whitei j under the influence of such feelings and impels by fanaticism and love of power they would nci stop at emancipation another step would be t kento raise them to a political and social equal i ity witii their former owmrs by giving them th right of voting and holding public offices unde the federal government we see the first step tc ward it in the bill already alluded to to vest th free blacks and slaves with the right to vote othe question of emoncipation in this district bi when once raised to an equality they would become the fast political associates of the north sc ing and voting with them on all questions and b this political union between them holding th white race st the sooth in complete subjection the blacks and the profligate whites that migh unite with them would become the principal re ripients of federal offices and patronage and woul in consequence be raised above the whites of th south in the political and social cale we would in a

slaveholders and slavelrnders charged with accounts terrible of dire confusion and threatening the very existence of this republic turns out to be but an old speech of john c calhoun newly vamped up and dressed to suit the taste of some forty other slaveholders besides himself the alarmed and appalled nation lias at last seen the baseless character of its fears and we presume will not be so easily alarmed again the thousand eats in the cellar are reduced to our cat and another old black cat but lest we should be accused of treating this grave address with too much levity wo shall venture a brief review of it the subject of the address is called the most solemn and important ever presented to the consideration of the southern people the subject is sunuped up in the following ambiguous terms we allude to the conflict between the two great sections of the union growing out of a difference of feeling and opinion in reference to the relation existing between the two races the european and african winch inhabit the southern section and the acts ot aggression and encroachment to which it has led just reail this statement of the subject over again anti try to understand what is meant by it the difference of feeling and opinion relation existing between two races inhabit the southern section acquisition and encroachment now the meaning of all this is the difference of feeling and opinion in the northern states from the slaveholders in the southern states the people of the north thank heaven are becoming more and more deeply impressed with the awful crime of slavery and are manifesting it by hesitating to extend its blighting influence to territory now free and this is tin point that gives solemnity to the subject this is the calamity which produces nppre hension and alarm how carefully the abov sentence is w r orded european and africai races stands for slaveholders ami slaves which inhabit the southern section thi very soft way of sliding over tle hatefcl won slavery shows the slaveholder conscious o his hateful enrne and is itself a confession o guilt the signers of the address say we have made it a joint address becaust we believe that the magnitude of the subjec required that it should assume the most inn pressive and solemn form poor fellows how much chagrin musl they experience when they witness the mirthful levity produced by their impressive solemnity a band of forty manstealers solemnly defending their right to plunder then fellowmen of all rights and liberties an impressive scene which ought to excite as much respect as the union of so many ajjeep stealers if ever a body of men were deserving of scorn and contempt this band ol fleshmongers do deserve it their whole proceedings have amounted to less than an admirable farce the address gives a history of the difference of feeling and opinion in reference to the relation between the two faces oh the deceitfulness ot sin i this difference disclosed itself in the convention that framed the constitution would that the difference had been stronger what the address has to sayon the subject of the compromise entered into on the part of the free states with the slave states every northern man should ponder well and draw from it a lesson that will forever preclude him from entering into another like it it will be seen that the address assumes a clear recognition of slavery in the united states constitution by the clause relating to taxation and representationthat relating to the return of fugitive slaves and that respecting the importation of slavds we deem it unfortunate for these honorable menatealers that in no instance have they been able to find a word in either of theae clauaes which bears the definition of slaves or slavery the word slave in all these references is the word of this conclave and not of the constitution the laageage in each of the provisions to which the addrem refers though doubtless intended to bolster up slavery and to tespeet slave property has been so ambiguously ter rded as to bear a very different construction sod taken in connection with the preamble of that instrument the very opposite of the construction given it by this wily band of slaveholders and they have just reason to apprehend that such a construction may yet be placed upon that instrument as shall prove the downfall ot slavery but granting that the slaveboiding construction is the one by which the nation is to he bound and governed we are glad to seethe issue plainly put to northern men we say to the slaveholder insist upon your right to make northern men your bloodhounds to bunt down yoor slaves and return litem to bondage we say let this be inst med upon the more streneously the better as it will the sooner awaken the north to a sense of then responsibility for slavery not only m the district of columbia and in forts arsenals and navyyards but m the states themselves and will the sooner see their duty to labor for the removal af slavery from every part of this mom unhallowed union is any ease nought but slaveholders hare anything to fear the moral senes of the north m k filming rest lies on this subject ft revolts at the idee ef send toning slavery and it roust and will aseh some mode by which to romp the rnepam bihty of an foul mean aodfeuel a system ef wrong n is slavery and it would ant he strange if pressed by the demand for the penad at flesh they is turn shield forbid the meed and thus thwart the guilty mm stealer of ihe rewards of the gmhy bargain bat we are for aduulthtfr that the constitution is jest what these slaveholders m this address say it is and en eonsciestioos grounds demand the immediate dissolution of the arm rican union as required by liberty and the law of the living cud what man will say that the union ought to exist for a single moment if under it northern men ate content u actis the bloodhounds of the south to hunt down recapture and return to slavery and chains every brotherman who mxy be so fortunate as to escape from bondage who who would stain hut soul by keeping a bargain so wicked and inhuman as that imposed by ibese merciless forty thieves in the name of the united slates constitution the person that would o do is a traitor to cod ami mail these slaveholders say in tlieir address j that there is not m the clause u inch they allege relates to fugitive slaves on uneei tam or equivocal word to be found in tha whole provision this is not true if the provision hi question refers to slaves escaping from slave states into free states ami was intended to define the right of masters to ap prelteud their slaves and the duty of free stales to deliver them up the language used is most ambiguous and inappropriate the words held to service ami labor for instance does not necessarily imply the relation of master and slave and tv rather a description of minors and apprenties than of slaves then the term person is not this term in itself equivocal are slaves in i law regarded as ereoiis ate they regs rd ed as piopertv and is there not a distinction broad deep and wide between property and persons if they are properly tliey cannot tic regarded by lie law as persons and it they are regarded both in the light of persons and prierty the term is imperfect equivocal and inappropriate in this same clause the teitn shall be delivered upon claim ot ths pat tv to whom such service or labor may be due carries upon its face the appeaiancc of j a contract by winch one patty has a just claim i upon the service and labor ot another j whereas the slaveholder has no just claim upon the lalmr or service of a slave and the slave has never ami can never make any contract with lus master and can never violate a contract or owe his master any service or labor it strikes uslliat the whole provision is uncertain equivocal and carries upon its face no recognition of the right of a slaveholder to recapture his slave so that while we admit that this clause was intaided to apply to fugitive slaves and to enable their piratical owners to arrest them and the free states to deliver them op to such claimants wo utterly deny that the clause in question is either clear or explicit suppose a man from from another country should read that clause tif the american constitution with no other knowledge of tho character of american incautious than what he derived rum the reading of that instru j ment will any one pretend that the clause in question would he thought to apply to slaves j vve think not nor would he dream of such au outrage such a savage monstrocity un reading any other part of the constitution blot slavery from existence and the whole framework of the constitution might remain unchanged there is therefore nothing in the constitution which means slavery only slaveryand nothing else than slavery the fact is the framers of that cunning instrument were ashamed of the name while they had not the honesty to renounce the thing slavery and it is the same sense of shame today which leads the friends and defenders of this inhuman system to u se the term peculiar institution jjie relation subsisting between the european and african races and the like it is with a view to hide their great moral deformity from the eye of the world and to shield slavery from the assaults and bolls which must ever descend upon it when its gross form is presented to reflecting and humane men but we pass from this to another point in the address it is this the clear and positive testimony it bears to the efficiency of the antislavery agitation at the north in undermining and destroying slavery at the south the old moonshine about putting back the cause of emancipation by agitation has no countenance in this document mr calhoun and his forty thieves see and clearly comprehend the moral forces now operating againt slavery and is too honest towards his fellow companions in crime to conceal the danger which besets or to affect to despise that danger he is proud haughty and bitter but not defiant he sees in the systematic agita tionthe tracts pictures papers pamphhts and bookssocieties lectures and petitions the most efficient means to bring about a stale of things which will foice the south into emancipation we thank mr calhoun fir this testimony it is given in circumstances which add materially to its intrinsic value it is extorted against pride and precedent two very strong resisting forces heretofore abolitionists have been spoken of as fanai ics madmen altogether a mont contemptible body the only effect whins efforts would be to rivet the fetter more closely on the limbs of the slave that they are not so viewed now is evident if mad there isa method in their madness as alarming to mr calhoun and his forty thieves as that of hamlet to his murderous and incestuous uncle abolitionists remember this testi atony of mr calhoun and thank god and take courage ut view of the adatotted adapt adoessof our measures to the aeeoanplfehmefii of our grand and coommaduig objectthe entire abolition of slavery throughout this countryas well in south carolina as in california we like tbe testimony of mr calhoun better than his reaaoouy lie says slavery is a demesne institute it u long to tbe states each for use if to feedr whether it shall ba eatebhshed or not and il it be established whether it should be shot ished or mn sugfi being the clear and uu questionable rights of the states it follow aaerenarily that it would ha a flagrant act oi hlfressron on a state destructive of its rights i and subversive ol its ladepemleuee for tb j federel government or one or more states or their people to undertake to force on u tbs emancipation of its slaves but it is a sound bmsint in politics as well as aw and morals that no one has a right to do that indirectly which ha cannot do directly and it may be added with equal truth to aid or abet ot countenance another in doing it belter call it domestic jldhry imm horn to buy and sell to brand and scourge human beings with the heavy lash to rob them of all the jut reward of their labor compel them to live in ignorance of their relation to uod and man to blot out the institution of matnafe to herd men and women together like the beasts of the heldto deprive them of the mean of learning to read the name of godto destroy their dignity aa human beingsto record their

ironsto tear their backs with the poiao iou daws of a living cat to shoot stab and hunt humanity with bloodhounds for one clam of men to have exclusive ami absolute power over the bodies and souls ol another dam of human beings this the whole of this infernal catalogue is comprehended in the soft and innocent term domes he tnxhtuhon this is the established ordei of things in carolina and mr calhoun and his forty thieves would have the same order of things in california but now to the doctrine laid down m the above extract it goes the length of denying on tnorai grounds to any and every person out of the state w here slavery exists the right of saying looking or doing anything directly or indirectly for the overthrow of slavery according to tins reasoning it would be immoral for northern men to refuse to wear cotton or to eat slavegrown rice and sugar since by pursuing such a course jhjradventure they might decrease the value ol the slaves and tliereby indirectly affect the permanence of slavery we are not to write speak or publish anything on the subject ol human slavery lest it serve to darken the fame of slavery and lessen it in the popular estimation and tliereby indirectly destroy slavery by exalting liberty to do so would necessarily be a flagrant aggression a violation of the rights of a state and subversive of its government for what we have no right to do directly by legislation we have no right to do indirectly any other means this is strange logic for one of the most powerful minds and renowned statesmen that america affords coming from another quarter it would demand no answer or comment buj from such a man endorsed by such a company lead so universally and put forth so imposinglyand solemnly aiming as it does at the very foundation of the antislavery movement it may lie proper to spend a few thoughts upon it how completely has slavery triumphed over the mind ot this strong man it holds full complete and absolute control in his mind so much so that seeing it he cannot and does not desire to see anything else than slavery the right of speech the freedom of the press the liberty of assembling and and the right of petition have iu his judgement no rightful existence in the constitution of the united states slavery is there he knows it to be there it has a right to he there and anything inconsistent with it is wrong immoral and has no right to be there this is evidently the state of mind which mr calhoun brings to the consideration of this subject to reduce his reasoning to its real point and pith it amounts to thisthat where a people have no power to legislate for the overthrow of what they think an evil they have no moral right to think or speak or do anything else which may induce those who have legislative power to exercise it for the removal of such evil ii is on this reasoning that he builds his complaint against the northern states as wanting in respect to the institutions and sovereignty ot the southern states that they have not by legislative enactment silenced the voice of free speechand suppressed the publications of the abolitionists if mr calhoui is right in his first position he is right in hii conclusion hut he is wrong in both wi have no legislative power to dethrone thi queen of england but have we no mora right to say that england would be bette under a republican form of government w have no legislative right or power to alter o abolish the british tariff hut have we m inoral right to say that it is unequal and op piessive and that england would be better ol without than with it we have no legislativi power to abolish the union between englani and ireland yet is it not obviously our righto speak and write in favor of the repeal othe union mr calhoun sinks the rights othe man in the duties of the citizen and b confounding things which are separate am distinct perpetrates a logical fallacy abovi and before all human institutions stands tin right of sympathizing with the oppressed am denouncing the oppressors of mankind slavery is not only a wrong done to tin slave hut an outrage upon mannot merely a curse to the south but to the whole union and has no rightful existence anywhere slaveholders have no rights more than any other thief or pirate they have forfeitei even the right to live and if the slave shouu put every one of them to the sword tomorrow who dare pronounce the tenuity dispro jtomoned to the crime or say that th criminals deserved less than death at th hands of their longabused chattels l all thii talk about the rights of slaveholders and tin rights of slave states is the height of impu deuce by what equity by what morality are they justified and upon what foundatioi do they rest the r right of property in humai flesh l why none other or better than maybe set up by a band of robbers we uiee iolm calhoun and the forty thieves associated with liun as being no better o more entitled to respect than a ships company of pirates and the time is coming whei hey will be so regarded generally it shal not avail that the constitution and laws sane lion slavery there ia a law above al earthly statutes written on the heart and by that law unchangeable and eternal no mai an he or hold a slave we intended to have said something on th extension of slavery in connection with oui remarks on this address hut have neither tinu nor space sufficient tor the purpose wi leave this task to the free boilers both u the w hig and the democratic ranks thi journals of each of tliese parties will aitem to the address on this point as well a to on nght of congreiw to break up the dmgracefu and inhuman slavemarts in the district u olumbra and abolish the whole system o wickedness root and branch as to the probable effect of this address we believe that its most injurious ewwfwites bare already taken place ita power te injure is destroyed it was terrible in the distance bet tame on its approach in the south h mtj stir a slighi fever he alaveboblera may be ajenpcd enraged and may twmr terribly about it bet the north will despite the address and the grey fox and forty thieves who gave it to the world we think it an exeelfeol means of agitating tbs public mind on the subject of slavery and promoting the antislavery cause and should not regret if mr calhoun would favor sa with another meet mg and make another address we are quilt sure that another meeting though it would not probably be so large aa the first would be do leas effective in exciting contempt foi the whole slave power of the country r d rochester jan  fredericr

i think may be done to have thi discussion immediately and will cheerfully meet you at any time and place in this city which you may propose provided it shall be soon a h business will call me from the eity ina few days the resolution to be discussed as you doubtless recollect one which presented at the anuskvery convention recently held in this city at which time you challenged ine to debate it and i accepted the challenge resolved that the constitution of the united states if strictly construed according to its reading is antislavery in all of its provisions the word all was accepted from your suggestion an immediate answer ia especially requested respectfully and truly yours c h chase mv dear sir l owe you an apology for not sooner publishing and replying to the above letter on a close examination of the constitution i am satisfied that if strictly construed according to its reading it is not a proslavery instrument and while i disagree with you as to the inference to be drawn from this admission you will see that in the resolution between us there is no question for debate now hold as i have ever done that the original intent and meaning of the constitution the one given to it by the men who framed it those who adopted and the one given to it by the supreme court of the united states makes it a proslavery instrumentsuch an one as cannot bring myself to vote under or swear to support very respectfully frederick douglass fugitives from labor discussion in the if y senate in the senate of this state a bill for the protection of personal liberty recently came up for discussion by this bill it was proposed to make the delivering up of runaway slaves a personal concern between the slave and his pursuer that the civil authorities of the state should take no cognizance of the matter until a breach df the peace was com mittedwhen both pursuer and pursued would become amenable to the law the morality of this kind of legislation may well be doubted it is either right or wrong that the slave should be returned to the man whe claims him as his property if right whj should not the constables magistrates jus ticesand all be bound to help on the good caus of catching the runaway l if wrong what necessity is there for sneaking out of the difficulty by the back door of a miserable subterfuge but so it is the usual mist othe compromises of the constitution rises uj between the senators of new york and thei distinct perception of moral rectitude on after another endeavors to proveprob abb succeeds in provingthat the proposed bil conflicts with that clause of the constitutioi which says that no person held to service or labor in on slate under the laws thereof escaping inti another shall in consequence of any law oi legislation therein be discharged from suet service but shall be delivered up on claim ol the party to whom such labor may be due io one who merely wishes to get at tht i root of the matter all this is very farfetched suppose it provedit establishes j nothingdecides nothing but simply shirks the responsibility of arriving at any conclusion but why so l this is a question which must one day be decided to blink it now is the basest cowardice or the meanest subserviency this is not the way in these days to deal with a great truth men have not time nor do they caie to follow the sophist through his interminable and flimsy webs of finespun casuistry one senator argues on this wise in the true spirit of pettifogging there are citizens in this stale who own i slaves in maryland and virginia supposing such a citizen finds one of his slaves in thii state and claims and attempts to detain him by this law he would be lietble to fines and imprisonment what would be the result he would say here is my defence and arrant in the constitution of the united states more than that the laws of maryland authorized him to control the action of his servant and by the constitution we are bound to regard those laws he would tell tht state tribunals that they had no business ti discharge his servant from service yoi cann t change the relation between us if thi j constitution says you shall not this mode of reasoning involves the entirt subversion of every principle of moral rectitude in the same way if the framers of uu constitution had seen fit to legalize murder any kind of theft besides manstealing wha would be the result why in the words o this solonthe murderer or thief whet brought to the bar of justice might say here is my defence or waiiant in the coo stitution of the united stales of com the defence would be entirely satisfactory the man who committed the crime would bi set at liberty and the gloiious constitutioi would have ike high honor of sanctioning lb worst of crimes and of throwing the sbiek of its protection over the most guilty of crun inals and so it does if it be true so tht senator affinwsm b dsuse quoted refer to slaves for is it not the most daring am heavendefying crime aeal

within ike four wails ti auburn petrftttitfcry do not say that the constitution does thisl cannot persuade myself that it is s matter of maeh consequence in so for as future action is concerned whe iher it does or not it appears just about as eaay to say that the constitution does sanction slavery ted aught tn he he amended o changed or left to rot among the rubbish of the hat esotnry as to prove in the snttsctioo of slaveholders and proslavery politicians and bring them to act in accordance with that proofthat the constitution does no sanction shivery or any other iniquity and is therefore deserving of their and oar highest and most reverential regard no one would consider obligatory any deed of his grandfather which bound him to the commission of a murder ora robbery or to return stolen goods to the robber when the rightful owner had succeeded in regaining possession of them it is very clear though grandfathers and great grandfathers and progenitors as for back as the flood bad phed deed upon deed and heaped them up heavenhigh commanding or sanctioning the commission of a murder or a robbery the sin of him who committed either of these offences against the eternal and immutable principles of morality summed up in the words do to others as ye desire that others should do unto you would be in no sense or degree altered or modified what js right for an individual

society for the present year was held in the hall of the house of representatives at washington on tuesday evening th ult in the absence of the president elisha whittlesey one of the vice presidents presided a the reading of the report the following resolution was adopted on motion of richard w thompson of indiana resolved r that twhjgjswy othu pi yaon as developed in the report which has just been read has strengthened our confidence in the great principles of the colonization society and that in their purity and strength we see satisfactory evidence of their ultimate triumph it was further on motion of mr me lane resolved that the efforts of the american colonization society to facilitate the ultimate emancipation and restoration of the black race to social and national indepednence are highly honorable and judicious and consistent with a strict respect for the rights and privileges of the citizens of the several states wherein the institution of slavery is sanctioned by municipal law and further on motion of mr maxwell that the influence which the scheme of african colonization exerts to suppress the slave trade to spread the english language and the principles of republican government and to open new markets for american products and extend american commerce should commend it to the favorable consideration of the respective state legislatures and to the general government the national intelligencer reports the meeting to have been very large and all its proceedings to have been of deep interest the first resolution above makes an assertion that the confidence of those who voted for it has beqp strengthened in the great principles of the colonization society the great principle of that societya principle which is great in its littleness is that colored men liecause they are colored cannot live in this country on an equality with white men it is enough simply to deny the truth of this principle when the unreasoning aud unchristian prejudice of which the colonization society is the offspring is removed where will be the difficulty there will be none the second resolution is very careful to make it known that the efforts of the colonization society are consistent with a strict respect for the rights and privileges of the citizens of the several states wherein the institution of slavery is sanctioned by municipul law this is rather a soft wav of saying it but it means that the right of the slaveholder to steal men is respected by the colonization society the right to steal the tight to be paid for what is stolen the right to convert a man into a brutea chattel and then sell him to this society for the par pose of transportation to liberia or some other place on the coast of africa can such a right be possessed by any human being no it is a wronga foul and horrible iniquity deserving not the respect bat the deepest execration of all men in whose souls there bum the smallest spark of bn mamty on these proceedings

any other portion of the united states hence if we continue debased here the enemies of our cause will point to us and say behold what negroes are in the most favored positions whence they would seek to draw the conclusion that oor elevation is impossible such a convention as you propose i think would do great good especially as none of the methodist conferences none of the associations or other religious bodies of black men ever deign to assemble in any part of our section and indeed the only gatherings we have are om first of august celebrations which cannot from their very nature not to speak of some of their accompaniments answer the purposes to which you call attention besides our state conventions with but two exceptions have sat where delegates from the west could not without great expense of money and time attend them we must have western conventions and other means tot the elevation of oor people or see them overlooked neglected and despised and as a consequence debased

am dow impelled by some unhappy passages in dr baird last lectors to add that it is christianity which has inculcated a nobler virtue than patriotism which is nothing else than a national it may be a mere partizan selfishness indeed you know it has been urged as an objection tochristianij ty that it does not enjoin the love of country true it does not but itj every where purer holier affection which includes all that is worthy in patriotism i mean the fort of man this christianity commands as second only to the love of god and as inseparable from that primal virtue flowing from it as an effect from its cause not with the authority and aporoval of him who made ot one blood all mankind is it that the surface of the common earth is divided and subdivided and the several portions appropriated by this nation or thatnot with the approbation of the heavenly father can it be that lines of demarkation have been drawn over which the children of mien may not freely pass and repass to gather as they can the fruits of honest enterprise and industry the god of peace and love never decreed that rivers or mountains or oceans even should make aliens and enemies of fellowinen far otherwise he has taught us by his beloved son that the true interests of humanity are every where the same and when the gospel has accomplished as it surely will accomplish that whereunto it was sent all political divisions all state lines will be viituaily obliterated and the nations of men flow together as a common brotherhood i was astonished i was grieved to hear from dr baird after so many generous enlarged humane christian sentiments as had come from his lips in his last lecture such a warm eulogium as he pronounced upon british patriotism and that he should have selected as an admirable illustration of that virtue the hearty union of both the political parties in england to prosecutewith renewed vigor the iniquitous and cruel ivar upon afghanistan and beloochistan to such a wholesale wickedness patriotism may lead but the love of man which christ inculcated never i wondered that a minister of the gospel one especially who has travelled so extensively j in foreign countries and every where found men to be essentia ly the same being could commend as he did a sentiment so narrow selfish cruel during our late most unrighteous war with mexico we saw too plainly how unscrupulous this false virtue becomes in the midst of it men of no mean authority in the state and some even of high standing in the church sought to rouse the people to a more earnest cooperation by appeals to their patriotismyes by the impious cry our country right or wrong blessed be god there were many thousands in the land who did not bow the knee to baal and so far from hoping with dr baird that such disunion may cease from our midst my earnest prayer shall ever be that the number may continually increase of those who will not on any consideration ever coqntenance and aid our government in doing wrong then may we look for the time when our rulers shall be peace and our exactors righteousness and never presume to attempt any thing for the aggrandizement of the nation thatwould violate the rights of any other people formy part i would as soon advise and assist my son as i would my country to commit iniquity i was equally pained and not less offended at the gratuitous censure dr b bestowed upon george thompson that excellent man devoted philanthropist and thrilling speaker who having done so much for the abolition of slavery in the british west indies came to this country to raise his voice of strength for the relief of suffering humanity here i know george thompson well and am sure that he was actuated by as pure philanthropic christian feelings and purposes incoming to these united states as dr baird could have been in going to great britain and europe nor was there any more of impertinence or ofliciousness in that noble englishmans coming to these united states to plead that millions of his fellow beings might be emancipated from civil social and persouai degradation here than there was in this benevolent americans going to the catholic countries of europe that he might do something to deliver millions there from a not so cruel thraldom to papal hierarchy and with just as much reason might the catholics of belgium or germany have conspired against the life of our estimable friend dr as the proslavery party here conspired to destroy george thompson i cannot find words to express my shame for thein affable meatless of so many of my countrymen who unable to answer his arguments or withstand his appeals were eager to drive that highly gifted advocate of liberty from our land by insult calumny and violent assaults upon his person i was mortified that dr baird whose heart seemed in other respects to be so much enlarged by his sojourn abroad should have aid what went so far to justify the outrages that were committed upon aman whos only fault waa that he was an abolitionist and a foreigner and i wondered that he did not see that in condemning thompson for interfering with the oppressive institutions of america he condemned himself for attempting aught against the oppressions of europe error or early intellectual training when we are coanderiiig the health of children it is ttnperat vg not to omit the importance of keeping their brains fellow

children who begin their education late as it would be called will rapidly overtake those who have been is harness long before them and what advantage can it be if a child knows more at six years old than its compeers especially if this is to be gained by a sacrifice of health which may never be regained there may be some excuse for this early book work in the case of those children who are to live by manual labor it is worth while perhaps to ruu the risk of some physical injuiy to them having only their early years in which we can teach them book knowledge tbe chance of mischief too will be less being more likely tobe counteracted by their after life but for a child who is to be at bookwork for the first twentyonf years of his life wha folly is it to exhaust in the least the mental energy which afterall is his surest implement friends in council randolph of roanoke john randolph was six feet high he had elevated shoulders a snfall head and a physiogonomy all the parts of which were entirely unintel lecfual except the eye his hair was dark thin and lank and lay close to his head his voice was as shrill as a fife but its clear shrieking tones could be distinctly heard by a large audience the muscles and skin about his face were shriveled and cadaverous like wrinkled parchment his whole form was so attenuated and meager that tall as he was his acquaintance supposed him not to weigh more than jo lbs the author of clinton bradshaw who enjoyed a favorable opportunity of observing this strange being has given us the following graphic description of his person habiliments and man ners his long thin legs about as thick as a walking cane aid of much such a shape were encased in a pair of light smallclothes so tight they seemed part and parcel of the wearer handsome white stockings were fastened with great tidiness at the knees by a gold buckle and over them coming about halfway up the calf were a pair of what i believe were called hose coun trykuit he wore shoes they were oldfashioned and fastened also with buckleslarge ones he trod like an indian without turning his toes out but planking them right ahead it was the fashion in those days to wear a fantailed coat with a small collar with buttons far apart on the back with but few on the breast mr randolphs was the reverse of this instead of being fantailed it was what i believe the knights of the needle cull swallowtailed the collar was immensely large the buttons were in kissing proximity and they sat as close on the breast of the garment as the feasters at a crowded festival his waist was so remarkably slender that as he stood with his arms akimbo he could easily as thought with his long bony fingers have spanned it around him his coat which was very tight was held together by one button and in consequence an inch or more of tape to which the button was attached was perceptible w here it was pulled through the cloth about his neck he wore a white cravat in which his chin was occasionally buried as he moved his head in conversation no shirtcollar was perceptible every other person seemed to pride himself on the size of his as they were then worn large mr randolphs complexion was precisely that of a mummywithered saffron dry and bloodless you could not have placed a pins point on his face where you would not have touched a wrinkle his lips were thin compressed and colorless the chin beardless as a boys was broad for the size of his face which was small his nose was straight wiih nothing remarkable in it except that it was too short he were a fur cap which he took off standing a few minutes uncovered fancy a deadman struck into life by lightning and all his life in his eye and you have a picture of john randolph magoons orators of the am revolution the
