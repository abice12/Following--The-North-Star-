from the new vork evening post slavery or treason have often had occasion to remind our tenderfooted democratic brethren at the north who were as much opposed as any one to the extension of slavery but who were unwilling to wound the sensibilities of their southern allies by making opposition hereto a party test that they had never experienced the same forbearance irom the south we have brought to their notice from time to time the declarations made by the legislatures of five or six southern states that underdo political necessity whatever would they support any candidate jot any pub iic office who nesitated about the propriety of extending slavery to the new territories ond more recently we have referred to the adoption and ratification of the famous address ot the southern members of congress by nearly every county convention in every southern state whereby they severally resolved to resist with violence any attempt to euforce the docilities ul the jeffersonian ordinance our record would not be complete i ive were to overlook the proceedings o a slate convention lately held at jackson mississippi the perusal ot which must prove highly gratifying to the antitest section of the new york democracy at the conclusion of an address of some length in winch the divine origin and purposes are vouched for after the tashion of the chivalry school the following resolutions were adopted among others with entire unanimity resolved that congress has no power to pass any law abolishing slave ly in the district of columbia or to prohibit the slavetrade between the several states or to prohibit the introduction of slavery into the territories of the united states and that the passage by congress of any such law would not only be a dangrous violation of the constitution but w ould afford evidence of a fixed and deliberate design on the part of that body to inti rlure with the institution of slavery m the states thai we would regard the passage oy congress of the wilmut proviso which would in effect deprive the citizens of the slaveholding states of an eijual participation in the territories acquired equally by their blood and treasure as an nnjust and insulting discrimination to which these states cannot without political degradation submit and to which this convention representing the feelings and opinions ol the people of mississippi solemnly deolan buy anil not subnut that the passage of the wilmot proviso or ofany law abolishing slavery in the district of columbia by the congres of the united states would o itself be such a breach ol the federa compact as in that event will make tithe auty us it is the right of the slaveholding states to take care o their owt ufety and to treat the nonslate ho i ding states as enemies to the slaveholding states and their do i ms tic institutions that the legislature is hereby requested to pass such laws as may if their opinion be best calculated to encourage the emigration ot citizens othe slaveholding states with slaves t the new territories of the united states that in view of the frequent and increasing evidence of the determinatior of the people of the states to disregard the guaranties of tin constitution and to agitate the subjec of slavery both in and out of congress avowedly for the purpose of effecting u abolition tfi the states and also new of the facts set forth m the lan address of the southern members o congress this convention proclaim the deliberate conviction that the tim lih arrived when the southern stale should take counsel together for thet evnaon safety and that a conventioi the north star of the slaveholding states should beheld at nashville tennessee on the hrst monday in june next to devise and adopt some mode of resistance to these aggressions and that this convention j do appoint twelve delegates and twelve alternates being double the number of our senators and representatives in congressto attend such convention and that the other eleveholding states be invited to appoint delegates agrees j bly to the same ratio of representation that we recommend to the legislature of this state that at its neat session a law be enacted making it the duty of the governor of the state by proclamation to call a general convention of the state and to issue writs of i election based apon the ratio of repre j sentation in the state legislature upon the passage by congress of the wilmot proviso or any law abolishing slavery in the district of columbia or prohibiting the slavetrade between the states to take into consideration the act of aggression and the mode and measure of redress it is a little singular that the valiant pistols of the south who get together and bluster behind such newspaper ari tiliery as the above never discover the absurdity of complaining of the north for violating the constitution when they never open their own mouths at a public meeting without speaking enough treason to hang them it has never been proposed by any political party at the north to attempt to interfere with slavery or any other institution except in a constitutional mode to be determined upon by the representatives oft the people in congress assembled j the north expects in all things to abide by the will of the people as expressed through constitutional channels uor has it ever been proposed among us as far as we know to modify the laws or institutions of the country by any other process j nearly every one of the slave stales on the other hand have threatened so frequently to abandon the unioo andi set up as independent nations during the past half century that it is now taken as a matter of course whenever the southern representatives find them i selves voting in a minority that the union is to be dissolved straightway of course nothing of the sort has ever occurred or ever will occur and if and the impotence inconsistency and j folly of those who make such threats are becoming more conspicuous every i tune they are repeated and yet there are those at the north who think wet ought not to agitate aqy question about which the south differs with us because ihrritates the feelings of southern wo ple and provokes sectional confwwmr sies then we may as well withdraw our northern representatives from congress the southern people are not educated to abide by the will of the majority they cannot reconcile themselves to the supremacy of any law by which they imagine their own interests are not to be promoted and it is idle to suppose that the rights of the north j can be preserved if northern statesmen are td be silent whenever southern politicians fhreaten disunion here within the current month we have the state of mississippi resolving in a state convention not to submit to the constitution of the united states a single moment after a majority of the members of congress shall have prohibited the introduction of slaves into california and recommending the governor to be required upon the occurrence of such an event to order an election of an independent legislature for the state jof mississippi what pretence or motive has mississippi for promulgating treason like this why according to the address of the delegates to abolish slavery from the territories is to pre r vent an advance in the price of slave i property in the states the planter i with a hundred slaves may not be able to sell them for ten percent more than they will bring at present unless the california market is opened to them this may be a very good reason to slave owners for resisting by all constitutional means the exclusion of slavery from california but it is a contemptible pretext for practising treason had massachusetts or pennsylvania threatened to leave the union and to set up independent governments while the tarif bill of was pending they coulc have justified themselves upon as higl ground as mississippi can justify the adoption of the resolutions we quoted indeed the pecuniary loss sustained b them from the exchange of the tariff o for that of was undoubted much greater than will be sustained b any two southern states from the exclusion of slavery from the territories it never occurred however to the citizens of either of those states toque lion the supremacy of the law or t relax in their devotion to the union foi they are educated to believe that wist governments are instituted fortbe greatest good of the greatest number ant that it is the first duty of a minority t learn to obey when the southern states learn thest  important truths we shall all

of the state of california i accordance with a resolution of thi house requiring the appointment of committee of five to report what i tbeir opinion should constitute th boundary of the state of california have had the same under consideratio and beg leave to report the following your committee are of the opinio that the present boundary of californi comprehends a tract of country entirely too extensive for one state and tha there are various other forcible reason why that boundary should not be adopted by this convention the area i the country included with the presen boundary is estimated to be square miles which is nearly equal t to that of all the nonslaveholdin states of the union and which deduct in the area of lowa is greater tha half of all the residue of the nonslaveholding states your committee are of the opinio that a country like this extending alon the coast nearly miles and mor than into the interior cannot b conveniently or faiily represented instate legislature here especially as greater part of the interior is eutirel cut offfrom the country on the coas by the sierra nevada a continuou chain of lofty mountains which is cot ered with snow and is wholly impasss ble pearly nine months in tbs year yolircomrhtftee are also of the opir ion that the country included within th boundary of this territory as now cs tablished must ultimately be divide and subdivided into several differer states which divisions and subdivk ions should the present boundary b adopted would be very likely to d vest the state of california of a value ble portion of her sea coast you committee are therefore of the opinion that a boundary should now be fb ed upon which will entirely preclude th possibility of such a result in future another important reason which ha aided very much in producing the cor elusion to which your committee hav arrived is predicated upon the fac that there is already a vast settlemei in a remote portion of this territory the population of which is variously e timated to be from to human souls who are not represente in this convention and who perbap do not desire to be represented here the religious peculiarities of the people and the very fact of their ha ing selected that remote and isolate region as a permanent home woul seem to warrant the conclusion thi they desire no direct political connet with us and it is possible and high probable in the opinion of your con mittee that measures have been care now being taken by these peopl for the establishment of a territorie government for themselves for the above and forgeoing reason your committee are of the opinion the the following should constitute th boundary of the state of california vii commencing at the northeast corne of the state at the intersection of tb parallell cf latitude degrees norti i with the parallel of longitude west thence south upon and along that parallel ot longitude to the boundary lin between the united states and mexico

will be given next week the bazaars the last no of the north star speaking of the edinburgh ladies antislavery society says this society has been applied to for assistance by the managers of the philadelphia bazaar but they have resolved to sand as formerly to boston will the north star please to correct this mistake the managers of the philadelphia fair have not applied for aid either to the edinburgh ladies antislavery society or any other society in great britain they did make a general request tor aid to such of our english friends as might be inclined to assist them and their appeal was successful but they had no wish or intention to draw to their fair any portion of the contributions which have before been sent to boston we believe that the english friends who have been active in piocuring contributions for them have never worked for the boston fair the philadelphia friends thought that a little effort might elicit more aid from england for our fairs than has usually been given to them and we trust that the results of the boston and philadelphia fairs will prove that they were not mistaken we thank the standard for directing our attention io this matter while this subject is before us we will ask the editor of the north star how he received the impression that some objections are felt here against the north star fair which is in course of preparation in this city we have never heard any one object to it and believe that as far as it is known it is regarded with friendly interest by the abolitionists of this region it certainly has our hearty wishes for us success as has the paper which it is designed to aid reply to the bovt the alleged mistake to which the freeman referswas made on the authority of a member and officer of the edinburgh ladies antislavery society the explanation of the matter by the freemen a quoted above does not show the alleged mistake to be a real one but the contrary the freemen says they did make a genet al request for aid to such friends as might be inclined to assist them wo think thisbroad and general enough to include ftiends anda reliable member of the edinburgh society informs us that they considered themselves included and felt themselves applied to for now why should tbi be denied jflhat if the philadelphia friends did so apply was it a erime so to do or why should the freeman disclaim the deed as if it wore a mean and disgraceful tiling the freeman says they had no wish or intention do draw to their fair any portion of the cun iftbuttons which havi been before sent to boston who said they had any such wish or intention the north star never charged them with any such wish or intention it stated a simple fact and we can give our authority if necessary for that fact we accept the freemans of friendliness to the north star fair shortly tobe held m philadelphia and shall hope to see it evinced by the presence of some of our aotialaveiy friends at the occasionr b tm dhiramchibd americana friend in philadelphia saji that he think we have tamed a wrong estimate of this paper and that our notice of k was unjust we still think otherwise we quite agree with ou correspondent that the colored people in philadelphia would he benefitted by having a well conducted paper amongst them to our thinking the ramt hum which was published in philadelphia at the time the ihsramdutej amnu an

scarcity of roods which last year for several month necessitated the closing of some if not ot all the schools both while and colored it was bought by every rattonal man that altogether independent of the impolicy of establish ng colored schools and thereby fostering a tricked and unmeaning prejudice against eof jr there were reasons urged in that report jot only amply sufficient to discourage ue establishment of new colored school but also lead to the entire overthrow of the system ot teparale schools in thi city but prejudice it woald seem is beyond reaion it will not luten to reason i argument and sets every motive ot right and christianity at defiance the following note will show the result of the agitation on this subject rochester lec d ma douglass sir the recent action of the board of education of this city in establishing a school on the east side of the river for the instruction of colored children has made it my unpleasant duty to dismiss from the school all such children that they may attend the schoolhouse mentioned youts respectfully w c fegles instructor in no j of course f lie colored children tyho thus summarily received theii dismissal from the district school for the crime of color will not go to the new school which pride and prejudice have prepared for their accomtuoi dalion it were belter that they should pickj up their education in the gutter than submit to such degradation we invite all the colored people on the east side of the river to adopt this plan if your children are good for anything they will be all the more likely to ptosper because of the opposition of tbe j board who the persons composing the board ot education now are we know not and it is not a matter of much consequence who or what they are but we may say respecting them that by establishing a second colored school and by bribing the poor mean men who are the trustees of zion church to allow the basement of that church to be used for a schoolhouse they have done what they could to perpetuate slavery and prejudice the colored people desired it they say some of them did we allow either instigated by i white influence or under a mistaken idea that their children would in this way be delivered from insult and ill will some of the colored people did desire it say that it is sowhat then will the board assert that they thought the petitioners had consulted their own interests by urging such a request and if they did wasit needful that the board should accede to it is it usual for americans to be so marvellously ready to give colored men all that they ask nay verily the petition was in accordance with the mean and vulgar prejudices of the board themselves they desired the separation of the colored children some of these gentlemen we have no doubt can declaim bravely and by the hour agajnst the tyranny of european aristocracies gentlemen we would say to them your censure is well merited your indignation is just the aristocracies of the old world are tyrannical despotic oppressive we rejoice that you have minds to ap predate and hearts to teel for the oppressed in other lands we would not say a word calculated to damp your ardor or to chock the outpouring of your sympathies the masses of europe are poor oppressed degraded i raise your voices in their behalf cry aloud and spare uot tell the oppressor of his wrongdoing hold the mirror up to nature and let the tyrant see his own guilty teatures reflected therein but remember that ev j ery word you utter against the wickedness of the wicked in other lands if it tells upon them at all must cut you to the quick the aristocracy of skin is meaner and infinitely more irrational than the aristocracy of rank ty j ranny is at all times and in all circumstances mean the man of true nobility can never be a tyrant for a man to tyrannise and puton aira of supenorty because he is descended from a percy or a vilhers or a nell gwynn sufficiently ridiculous hut to assume superiority on the ground of having a pale face i is an act so simply absutd and idiotic that it would seem impossible tin any out of a lunatic asylum or drivelltmg idiocy to be guilty of the tank aristocrat has a halo of mysterious antiquity thrown around him and possibly the glory of wealth and a great name which may require a certain degree of irreverence to cast asuie tbe akin aristocrat ha nothing but the fortuitous circumstances oi being born of white parents and in aoolddi mate on the same ground and with an equal show of reason the polar bear and the beasts if there are any that live amid the perpetual snow of tbe arctic circle may claim superiority over every animal that inhabits both tbe temperate and torrid zones and the ignorant greenlander and esquimaux tie smeared in grease and filthiness must also rank above tbe polished inhabitants of the temperate conatriea of europe and america is it so let ilie poor victims of prejudice and coiorphobia m this country answer and let ibeir anawei prove the irrationality absurdity and wickedness ot their procedure toward their colored countrymen it is this prejudice and nothing else that excludes colored children from the district

statement that particular care will be taken in the census about to be made to ascertain the numbers the length ot life ac of the colored people in this country what practical put pose this measure i intended to seme we do not see if it is to determine what climate is suited to ceitsm constitutions w conceive it to be a rather damay mode of making the inquiry we art of opinion however that it is neithei mote nor less than another exhibition of american prejudice and hate against the colored man which is ever on the outlook for some new scheme of insult oppression and injury the proposal is made by mr clingman of north carolina and is in part as under this extiact shows to what hope the enemies ot the colored man turnno other than his ultimate extinction americans have well nigh exterminated the indian and now they would exterminate the negro pray heaven that the hope of the american negrohater may be blasted we almost wish that the colored people of this country aright never cease to be colored though weare of opinion that climate does much in a tew generations to modify both the color and the constitution and that their mies may thus be compelled i n spite ot their pride and prejudice to acknowledge that the black man is not less than the white man the image of godthe son of god the equal child of an all beneficent father mr clingmana suggestion it is said will be carried out to some extent desire to call your attention to the importance of obtaining fuller and more accurate information than has hitherto been elicited with reference to that portion of our population which is a mixture between the pure white and the black iaces would therefore suggest to you the propriety of ascertaining not only the number of all such persons whether free or slaves but of presenting further inquiries for example let there be an inquiry as to the parents of such mulatto oi mixedblooded persons if they are ascertained to be white and black there would beno need of any further questions but should the patents or either of them be of mixed blood then direct an inquiry as to the grandparents and so on until if practicable in every case the pedigree should be tracej to the individual white and black races i would also recommend that in all cases ol adult females of mixed blood the number ol children if any bestated by adopting this mode of examination we shall not only ascertain the number of persons of this description in the united states but we would also be able to determine the length of their lives and their powers of reproduction as compared with those of the puie races  we also determine whether from their numbers they constitute such a percentage of our population as to lead in any given period to the destruction of the less numerous or black race we should likewise be able to decide whether the mixture thua produced would be a permanent addition of an inferior grade of our population or whether it would be totally extinguished by running in some instances into one of theotigi nal types so as to exhibit no traces of the other there is a hint at what is in the mind of mr clingman it is no less than this that mulattos are a hybrid racs and like other hybrid animals die ont what an awful accusation against slaveholders is involved in this supposition abolitionists never charged them with the commission of any such revolting and unnatural crime the mosaic law says and if we mistake not u status law agrees therewith that when one commits this sin he shall suiely be putto death the conviction upon very circumstantial evidence of not a few honorable men would be a work of no great difficulty will the census bear mr clingman out hi his surmise l jack ketch may have business on hand if it does j d thirtyfirst congress we have at

inhabitants of the laud have heen made to heat and under stand again our cause has been a pi oneer movement before the abolition uf chattel slavery could be effected a host of other reforms needed to

meeting of the ladies in buffalofor the purpose of heai ing the report of their committee sent to the venerable gerritt smith with means and in irucuons to present him with a silver piteh ti as a token of respect and regard for hie generous patriotism and christian philanthrope toward their people the people of color with whom he and hope i feel to all intents and purposes identified teel the most exquisite pleasure when i am able to inform you that that meeting was one arguing most strongly the claims of the coloied people to the rights and immunities extended to and enjoyed by other men of other complexion in the united states although it is said of public meetings held by ladies that there is a vacancy there which can be filled only by man yet at this meet ng held on tuesday evening nov th there was a degree of ordet interest and impressing solemnity characteristic only of a generous intelligent patriotic and christian people the meeting was opened by some introductory remarks by abner h francis their committee to mr smith in relation to his intellectual and moral character his sincerity and the demonstrations of his philanthropy he entered into an account of mr smith s ultimate design in the belowment of land tour people of color the situation and fertility of those lands and the importance of immediately improving the opportunites heid oul the merits of mr smith aa he had ascribed and forgone any and all high stationa in he gift of the people for the sole purpwee oi defending the oppressed nominally free men color together with the utility and practicability of presenting him this token of regard it is truly mallei of importance and has added much to their intellectual and moral weight this token confirms what i have often said that that people may own no superiors in point ot gratefulness for friend nip and favor this token will not only have a tendency to atimnlate mr smith m his labor of love but others and mt aftei this mr francia proceeded to deliver or rehearse mr garnet s speech on the presentation of the pitcher the nature of the address and the occasion rendered it truly solemn and impressive mr smiths speech on its reception was next read with his expression of thanks for such a token mr francis speech which was delivered before mr sith at this interesting gathering o triends was next read ihe whole scene as represented by mr francis was really magnificently solemn and imprestve nothing oi the kind in my opinion could have interested me more than to have been present on this occasion but the meeting of the society the vast number of people in attendance together with the decorum end ability with which it was conducted rendered it quite an imposing occasion let me rot forget the people til detroit it is impossible to eiptese the feeling i possess for that people for their kindness mani fevted low aid me whie there in october and the industry economy politeoeeeand vigilance of that people touching charitable sad religious subjects especially the eauee of the slave there is a spirit kindled there daily among the dry prepared wood in the heerfr ot those who were once slaves be who nothing can now enslave say nothing because first of til they possess power of bind and next they have secured the good will ai the comrnuhity and in the last plaoe it ie out of the power of the south to enslave them thank god i

responsibility with which ahe is now burthened in her impoesible attempts at the distance of miles to govern wisely a tree people whom her statesmen never see and of whom they know nothing beyond what they find recorded in sheets of foolscap we find in the newcastle guardian a very full report of a reform soiree given in newcastle to that distinguished reformer and friend of the slave geo thompson in the course of his speech referring to the jobbing propensities of the british government mr thompson said you have heard what the government spend in the african blockade no man will accuse ms of indifference to the interests of the sieve and fearlessly say that a grosser job was never perpetrated than that of keeping up a squadron on the coast of africt a million a year is spent that the hon capt penman and my lord lapdog may walk the quarterdeck receive pay and get bloodmonej for every man they capture on the seas many who wished to attend this soiree were unable to gain admittance and on request mr thompson spoke at a second meeting held a few day after which was alsc densely crowded we should like to copy the entire speed of mr thompson on this occasion for th benefit of the homestead journal and a mar by the name of william hick who for somt weeks past through the columns of that paper has been making himself exceedingly ridiculous by accusing mr thompson of indifference to the cause of the laboring classes r william hick can be excused only on th supposition that be speaks ignorantly it ii a great pity that som men do not know thi extent of their ignorance it would save mud time if evary one would talk only on subject i upon which ha has taksn the trouble to inforn himself such lamentable exhibition of lgno oocc and arrogance combined as those pie tooted by that

modeling that inhuman traffic less profitable we yet consider tbe blockade not only impolitic but entirely wrong in principle much might beurged against it on the ground of inexpediency it bas been found that one and perhaps tbe chief effect of the blockade baa bees to increase the horrors of the middle psssege the wretched portions of humanity engaged in tbe traffic entirely regardless of the sufferings of their victims now sacrifice every thing to speed they employ small vmeels and cram large numbers into a apace wholly inadequate for their reception more suffering and death are the consequence we hare no faith in anything but the destruction of slavery for the overthrow of tbe slavetrade cutup the tree from tbe root and its branches of course perish we entreat england to

feelings for energetic action while opportunity is yet afforded considering the disabilities we an laboring under and the apathy of the mass around ns on this vitally interesting subject much ha been done in these pans during the past year but a steady petsevering uncompromising devotioo is indispensable and we hope that while we labor with untiring zeal to stnke at the root of this infernal system we shall remember that bursting the falters should be followed by the genial influences of sympathy and elevation and that during our deliberations some suggestions may be made with regard to devising means to place the escaped bondmen in situations in which their long buried intellect their manhood shall be called out that they may be prepared to receive the truth that they may be

pronounced him its leader and projector and as such he wa condemned his own bitter wrong the terrible recollections of his f life of servitude the impunity with which the mot dreadful outrages upon the persons of slaves were indicted acting upon a mindfully capable of appreciating the beauty of freedom furnished abundant incentive to an effort for the redemption of his race and the humiliation of his l oppressors the heruldo of madrid speaks of him as as the celebrated poet a man of great natural genius and beloved and appreciated by the most respectable young men of ha ivaua it accuses him

the doctrine that green wood for fool is better and of course mote economical than drywe think the present season one most admirably adapted to cure such an error as we conceive this opinion to be end now white the farms is suffering with cold fingers from his green wood fire end he ts in good earnest lamenting the leanness of his wood yard we would request him candidly to renew the whole subject and ask himself whether he bad not better desert a position which sound theory and daily experience show is so longer tenable the direct experiments of dr black on file and the later ones of count rum ford as to the best mode of producing and economizing heat have in conjunction with the labors of others demonstrated the very great loss those sustain who use unseasoned wood for the purpose of fuel making an estimate of the various kinds of greenwood hard and soft together and of the same wood when thoroughly seasoned by exposure to the air the difference is found to be equal to at least one third of the whole and if dried ata temperature of one hundred the difference will exceed this proportion green wood therefore contains at least one third of its weight of water and allowing a cord of such wood to weigh three thousand pounds there will be one ton of wood and half a ton of water in every cord that the wood will not burn so long as this water is present in the wood all will admit it must therefore be evaporated or driven off in the form of steam or in other werds caloric or heat enough from other sources must be combined with the water to boil away half a ton qf about one hundred and twenty gallons and as this heat mostly passes off in a latent stale no possible benefit is derived from so great a waste the amount of dry fuel necessary to perform this operation of boiling away half a ton of water every farmer can estimate for himself and we think no one can avoid seeing that whatever this amount may be it is a total loss to himself it is true as many argue that the consumption of a green stick of wood is less rapid than that of a dry one but such forget it seems that a much larger quantity must be constantly kept on the fire to produce the same degree of heatand that until the green i wood has absorbed from other sources sufficient heat to expel the water with which it is charged the tire is dull andr the heat feeble there is abundance of smoke but combustion goes on slowly i or not at alle since the fact of the difference between the weight of dry and greenwood as stated above is indisputable we think that those who have erahte quantities of wood to move would do well to bear this in mind as by attending to this circumstance al very great diminution in the amount of labor requited may be made and the striking off the transportation ol thirtythree tone iu one hundred all will agree is no trifling affair tu labor is honorable but it is tiiqe opt farmers should learn that to expend il needlessly is not profitable gentset i farmer a i ivjb are all
