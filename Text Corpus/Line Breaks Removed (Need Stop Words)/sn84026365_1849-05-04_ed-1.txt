there is trouble brewing in south carolina the rest of the union does not seem to be aware of itbut there is no doubt of the fact the genial j warmth of the spring instead of animating hrt more kindly symapthies seemi only to ferment the sap of her asperity her patriotism and her palmettoes become green together the temperature of her heroic ardor rises i with the mercury and by the time of t the dogdays she will be equally ready i for the hydrophobia or a fight the newspapers of south carolina are talking of committees of safety and correspondence nonintercourse confiscation and such revolutionary things all this is very alarming yet such is the apathy of the public mind that we observe no signs of a wholesome terror anywhere the little state is quite in earnest yet he public will not believe itand if they did believe it so much is heroism at a discount j that we seriously fear nobody would j care about itbut for our own part such is the admiration we cherish for chivalry that it is always sure of our applause even though it appears mounted only on the stump or figures nowhere but upon paper it may be a perversity of taste but we must confess that our idea of a hero is the greater in proportion as his stature is less we prefer gen thumb to the belgian giant and cannot imagine a perfect champion except in highheeled boots and of such altitude only that he would have to stand on tiptoe to pull an ad versarys nose south carolina is remarkable for perseverance in wrath she varies only in the aspect of it she will not be in a good humor on any terms her nose like her musket is always cocked shb would consider it an abandonment of dignity to put on an affable look and state rights would be in danger if she should once relax into a smile the price of liberty is eternal vigilance and she watches hers so closely that she has no liberty to do anything else the latest pronunciaraento from the land of lofty doings is to be found in the south carolinian of the th inst it is to the followingeffect the people of this state may after due deliberation and reflection adopt astrict nonintercourse in trade and commerce as regards the northern states this if adopted would doubtless have the same effect but to make it thoroughly effective it must receive the full consent of the mass of our people it must be adopted only after mature and calm deliberation yv e want to see no storm raised within our own confines we would deprecate any measure that would array one portion of the people of this state against the other either in sentiment or action yy hatever course is deemed desirable to be of any avail it must be adopted with the greatest unanimity when agitation was necessary to arouse the people it was our duty to be diligent in the matter now that the people have taken the initiative in their district meetings our duty and the duty of the press throughout the state we believe to be the securing of perfect harmony and unanimity of opinion in their further acts and deliberations to this task the south srolinian will apply iuelf and will endeavor to avoid ihe agitation ct any scheme which might carry within itself the elements of ts own destruction and consequently defeat our purposes confinealion of the property of the people of the north has beeu hinted at and suggested we the north star j believe such a proposition wholly indefeasible at this time it is an extreme measure and should only be adopted at the list extremity and is there any man of common sense who does not know that such a procedure would at once involve us in civil war better far better would it be for the whole south calmly to avow their determination to withdraw from the confederacy and define the limits of a new republic the course to be pursuedthe mode of action to be adoptedis now we consider entirely in the hands of the committees of safety and correspondence they must get to work the people did not appoint them under any other expectation but that they would work we feel confident they will not abuse the solemn trust committed to their charge and that we will hear from them at an early day our time or limits will not permit us to consider the nonintercourse proposition today we will do so probably hereafter we believe the suggestion j to be a good one and that no better means could be used to bring the people of the north to their senses but it must be the voluntary sacrifice of the whole people and must be the policy of two or more states to render it successful to any great extent it is lamentable that with a heart so set upon treason this unfortunate commonwealth should never find her way to it the tantalus of states she pines within sight of what she longs for yet cannot rrach she is always baffled when she plots rebellion and cannot by any accident stumble upon it the disclosure is given forth how sver that it must be the policy of two or more states to render it successful to any great extent there is the drawback she would willingly break into the citadel of the union and despoil it of its treasures but she cannot ventnre w ithout an accomplice she must have a centrebit and a hoy but thus far she sits alone in the realms of noncontent the augusta ga chronicle one of the best papers of the south gives some wholesome advice to the little termagant state which the latter of course will not follow the chronicle intimates that the best way to establish a proper degree of nonintercourse with the north is for the people of south carolina to manufacture for themselves every article now made for them in new england that antiabolition resolutions will not prevent the state from losing a representative under tne ratio of the next census and it has the temehty to add that a cartifi ofgood manure is worth more to tlie than a thousand such resolutions the idea state rights and guano liberty and limethat it should come to this disdainful chivalry expands his offended nostrils but it is further added that the trade and commerce of a small aggregate of deserted desolated cotton planiations meaning thereby the magnanimous state of south carolinawill be of j little consequence to the rest of the union and that instead of exporting so many emigrants and their property j for which no return whatever is left j behind south carolina should take measures to invite immigrants with their capital their industry and their enterprise to come and settle permanently within her limits but as we have said this advice will not be followedat least not yet south carolina will stick to her two staples politics and cotton and as the latter falls off she will cultivate the other more largely she will manufacture nothing but resolutions in proportion as she loses her representatives in congress those that remain like the sybilline books will increase in importance as the number grows less if but one should be left the whole state would scarcely be large i enough to hold him if all should dis

been pent up for twenty years in syracuse with only n occasional peep at the country this few monthsresidence amid scenes ofsoi much beauty is charming but i have only to look upon the cultivated held where women are following the plough under the direction of a taskmaster tobe reminded of the system of unrequited toil which crushes to the earth more than half the population the icelander says of his icebound isle it is the pleasantest spot the sun ever shone on and so i am disposed to say of toy northern home for though nature may sometimes wear a cold and dreary garb and the sun may not shine as bright as here its rays fall upon a free intelligent and enterprising people i cannot but feel a deep interest in the vexed question of the day as i see it developed in city and conntry and learn something of its real character southern papers teem with what they call northern aggression and every one who stands up in defence of the peculiar institution especially if he is a northerner is the man they delight to honor in some recent editorials in anew york religious paper the observer the slaveholder is apologised for on the ground that the system was originally forced upon him and that the south has already done more for emancipation than great brittain with her boasted that if the north will not interfere the south will soon abolish the system and the editor longs for restoration of the state of feeling and opinion on that subject which existed twentyfive and fifty years ago right is or no sextruth is of no color god is th father of us all amd all we are brethren when no anlisl a very society existed north of masons and dixons line this he calls the golden age of our republic extracts from these editorials are going the rounds oft he southern papers amid rejoicings that a paper of such high authority can be quoted in defence of the institution tne hon mr brown of pennsylvania is receiving the compliments of the press for a recent speech in congress in defence of the south where he is reported to have said he did not think the same number of laborers could be found anywhere better clothed and fed than the slaves at the south but he says they should be educated good books put in their hands the marriage tie should be made binding as that of the whites and families should not be separated every intelligent northerner who has seen anything of slavery as it is must know that the comparison fhadfe between the slave and the mass of free northern and western laborers is alike insulting as untrue the alavea of the south are almost entirely included in two classes the field hands or tillers of the soil and domestic or house servants if we attempt to compare the food and clothing of the slave with that of the free tiller of the soil and the free domestic the comparison will utterly fail and even the irish ditcher upon our canals and railroads can obtain better clothing more palatable food and comfortable shelter for his family than is provided for the slave but i will only state facts and leave others to judge how the home comforts ot the free and slave laborer will compare the food of the slave is of the coarsest and cheapest possible kind the former consists of principally corn meal and bacon portioned out to them by an overseer they are sometimes allowed to keep a few fowls which adds something to their meagre fare wheat flour molasses sugar butter tea and coffee are luxuries entirely beyond their reach the free laborer returns from his toil to his noonday or evening meal and plain though it may be he finds it prepared and partakes of it with the wife nad children he calls his own the slave wife leaves her plough or hoe behind her and returns to her desolate home and partakes of a cold preparation or else the hour usually given to rest is spent in preparing the necessary ineal when the mothers go out to their employment in the morning the infants and young children belonging on the plantation are brought together and taken care of through the day by j some negress appointed for that purpose of their clothing ii is uneces bary to say more than thisit corresponds with their houses and food probably it is as comfortable as though ofa finer texture bnt as i pass the fields and see my own sex following the plough making fence or ditching by the road side and in such unsightly garb hanging perhaps in rags about them feel indignant at the system which degrades woman almost to the level of the brute but of their houses i have said nothing the slave cabins on the coast between baton rouge and new orleans are whitewashed and have a neat appearance from the river but from what i have seen in other parts of the country am prepared to say they are like whitewashed sepulchres not made for inside examination negro houses in the country are built ot logs with chimnies of sticks and mud usually but one room a rough unmatched floor no windows sometimes as a substitute a hole filled by a swingtight blind and not the first article of decent furniture in them around the houses there is not the least appearance of domestic comfort while the ragged clothing the indian blankets hanging about and the dirty half clothed childen growing up in filth and ignorance remind me of the indian huts on the onondan go reservation i had expected to find them better housed than they are with more of the little comforts that everyone loves to gather around his home i had heard of the garden patches where they could raise vegetables to sell for their own benefit and of the saturday afternoon when they were exempt from toil and could spend their time for their own profit or amusement but all this sounds better abroad than here where facts deny the assertion negro houses in the cities are built with a little more reference to outside appearance but of the inside arrangements little better can be said of them than those iuthe country who can be found to say that the physical condition of the slave does not need elevating r but of how small importance compared with his condition mentally in this age of the world when the march of reform is onward and we are called to w itness the deaththroes of despotism and the birthstruggles of freedom when humanity is asserting its rights and oppression is loosing its grsspsurely the slave should begin to take rank in the common brotherhood ef mam h the false refuge of the guilty it seems by the baptist religous herald of v irginia one of the popular religous papers of our day that after nine years from its publication a copy of charles

entitled a scripture manual c by charles simmons n y m w dodd and is recommended by many distinguished men of the north one of these tells us that the author has had particular reference to the prevailing errors of the times this looks somewhat suspicious coming as it does from a northern region and the book itself shows that slavery is one of the errors against which it is aimed the author gives us passages of scripture on servitude and then as something distinct from it on slavery and oppression under this latter head he says see rights of man and on turning to it we perceive that it is directed mainly against our institutions the scriptures are perverted passages being cited which really have no reference to the subject if northern men choose to pervert the scriptures they ought not to palm their impositions on us and if they deem slavery a sin they ought at least to have the decency not to attempt to make money by selling their antislavery books to the slaveholders the book is moreover unsound in its theology no baptist no southernerought to countenance it now one word more if northern men deem slavery a sin they ought at least to have the decency not to attempt to make

endowed yet we would have him remember that these are gifts which he has received and the only j credit due to him is that he has ctihi j vated them the object of mr douglasss visit ati this time among us is twofold viz to lecture to us on the subject of improvement and procure subscribers to the wyoria star and to accompany some friends to his resident in rochester whom he expects will aime from europe in the sarah sands steamer mr douglass had an interesting meeting on monday evening last in brooklyn where his remarks were listened to with pleasure and profit and it is to be hoped that

farthing he cannot have a meeting among us without we being profited by it we are happy to state that two of the churchesmr pen ningtons and mr gloucestershave been thrown open to him without charge as for zions where he holds a meeting this wednesday evening we shall take occasion to say something at another time c l remond our distinguished advocate of equal rights is also here and will labor

without a custom house the most remarkable point in the social economy of switzerland is the universal principle of freedom in trade in which respect it has no equal on the face of the earth while in great britainjthe principles of a free exchange of commodities are still nothing more than a theory in switzerland thev area practical good a free tv import are permitted the government has no custom house establishment either in aeference to the general frontiers or the frontiers of the respective states the only impediment to the transportation of goods in any direction is the exaction of tolls at the rate of about one pennv per hundred weight for the benefit of the cantonal revenues from which however the roads are kept in repair at all the great outlets of switzerland strayng bodies o douaniers or armed custom house officers are stationed by the authority of other nations for the purpose of rigorously examining and taxing all articles that come out of the swiss territory but within the swiss side of these outlets there are no officials to pay any attention to anything that comes into the country and in point of fact the french germans and other neighbors export to switzerland whatever goods they please including all kinds of foreign produce without being charged with any duty whatever this very remarkable state of things is partly ascribed to the contending state of the different cantons some cantons are agricultural and others contain large seats of manufacture but the agricultural cantons would feel it very hardi to be biiged to buy manufactured goods from a neighboring canton at a dearer rate than they could buy them abroad the peasantry of vaud have no idea of emptying their pockets to benefit the manufacturers of basle and zurich another cause perhaps is the vast expense which would necessarily be incurred by attempting to watch the widely extended boundary beset by active contrabandists it is iat the same lime fair to state that in ail the deliberations of the swiss authorities for a number of years there appears to have been a great unanimity of feeling on the propriety of abstaining from restrictions on commerce a committee appointed by the diet in i to consider the subject of foreign relations made the following report one ol the most extraordinary ever uttered by the members of a legislative body firstthe swiss confederation shall irrevocably adhere to its established system of free trade and manufacture secondunder no circumstancei t and on no condition shall it form a part of the french custom bouse system of the prussian commercial league oi j the euston house line of any toreign nation thirdlt shall use every effort for the establishment and extension of the principles of free trade fourth it shall as far as possible discuss and conventions with the neighboring states for the disposal of agricultural and vineyard produce and cattle or obtaining the free ingress of corn and for maintaining the daily reciprocal economical neighborly and border traffic and market transactions fifthwherever a free trade ts not obtainable it shall endeavor to remove all prohibitions to lewei duties and to secure the power oi transit on be most favorable terms sixthwhen exceptionable favors car be obtained they shall be used for tb advancement of those measures whicl fond to the accomplishment of the end proposed o however that exchange ioui dick pcai whole no be not thereby limited nor pareomi liberty interfered with seventhln the intemor of switzerland it aha make every exertion to assist industry and to remove impediments to intercourse taking care however that it no not interfere with the personal concerns of merchants and manufac turers all restrictions on the importation of articles from other countries being thus removed it might be supposed by soma that the country would he deluged with foreign manufactures greatly to the injurv of native capitalists and workmen but this does not appear to bethe case in several branches of manufacture the swiss excel and the opportunity of buying certain kinds of foreign produce at a particularly cheap rate enables the people to encourage the growth of other manufactures in tbeir own country the peasant who buys an english made knife for half what he could a swiss one fer has half bis mosey remaining wsnrwith to purchase a nativemade ribbon hence swiss manufactures of one kind or another are sure to be encouragedcham bers miscellany the cords that huxci taheli whatever inay have been his fears his hopes his fancies or his thoughts suddenly

friends ot education in the various slave staes have made to get common schools well established there is not a slave slate in the union in which there is any soefa school system in operation it is not because atuetu of slave states do not make proper efforts but it ia owing to the fact that where slavery is tolerated the population trill be tot sparse for common schools tbe advocates of slavery hate statistic and they do not hate them without a cause statistics prove that the slave states are in a deplorable oondititioe of ignorance tbe rich and those who are well to do in the world are

colonization society and through this means to raise funds with which to carry on the machinery of this old abuser of the colored peo ple it was enoughthat the meeting was called to expose this two faced hypocrite and persecutor of the colored man to rally a large audience there were in attendance not fewer than twelve hundred persons made up of the most respectable and intelligent part of the colored people of this city it did ray heart good to look out upon that audience i hailed the sight as ample evidence that our people though crushed beneath the heel of american tyranny are yet alive and willing to assert their rights and denounce the cunning contrivances by which their guilty oppressors sek to prolong their oppressive rule and to put far away the day of our deliverance as a people the meeting was organixed by calling the rev j w c pennington to the chair and j appointing several vicepresidents and sej cretaries a series of spirited resolutions were reported by a committee appointed for that purpose and after a very animated discussion of them which continued urtl eleven oclock they were unanimously adopted the speakers on this occasion were messrs w c pennington george t downing charles b ray charles reason charles lenox remond tunis g campbell and f redcrick douglass with such anarray of ieakers a meeting for any purpose could neither be dull nor uninteresting but met to expose end denounce tho detestable and nefarious designs of the american colonization society and especially its present efforts to seduce the british public into its recognition and support the theme was such ss to excite al mnds warm all hearts and make all tongues eloquent remond poured forth a pertect torrent of indignant eloquence fairly blistering and stinging the very life out of colonization his speech was listened to with the profoundest interestevery word telling with thrilling effect upon the multitude before him i have seldom beard him when his soul was more thoroughly aroused and his eloquence was more powerful the whole assembly attested their delight bv frequent expression of applause the interest excited this evening suggested the propriety of holding another on tuesday evening the question being put resulted to an unanimous vote in favor of bolding another meeting the next evening the fire was kirdfod nd the people were alive accordingly another and larger meeting was beld on the tuesday evening full of internet to the la t ai d continuing till near the noon of night i have seldom seen anything surpass mg those meetings

they deemed it wise to suffer in alienee it is well they did so while they would have been in po bodily danger they would have been terribly handled nevertheless they ware compelled to sit and hear

the influence of liberia upou the slave trade and proving that so far from preventing the slave trade the liberians were actually engaged in this infernal traffic and that amid all the flourish about

anda cataract of eloquence is the result h spoke grandly and to the pointcarrying his audience or rather his audience carrying him with them mr an reosellaer spoke short but said much his rough rarus

sometimes mistaking friends for foes his war club makes sad havoc among his own roldiera he may be disciplined but must not be dismissed from the ranks of freedoms army in this country i frederick douglass followed van rensellaer dr mccune smith spoke last and made one of the neatest speeches to which i ever listened his speech was mainly devoted to the history and noble conduct of aexander cruranaell now in england awarding to that gentleman a generous tribute of respect for his boldness and the prompt manner in which he had met our common enemy in that land as well as tor his manly conduct towards that piince df offenders bishop underdonk i am not sure that i have not got the cart before the horse in giving you this account w ithout first stating fully the immediate cause for holding these meetings but i write in haste and you must excuse had composition the facts are briefly these soon after president roberts visited england and made a favorable impression there went from this country an agent of the colonization society this agent has represented to the british public that the colored people in this country are generally turning their attention to liberia aa their future home that immense number wish to go and would immediately emigrate if they could that the want of funds is their only hindrance this agent has been very active and has made a j decided impression having almost succeeded in establishing a british colonization society to cooperate w ith the american and would have done so but for the timely interference of alexander crummell now in england and to whom the colored citizens of new york are indebted fot this note of warning i rejoice that so able and faithful a representative of the colored people of the united states happened to be in england at that time the meetings just held will prove a very acceptable reinforcement to him and have no doubt he will use those proceedings successfully against our common foe there is no end to the impudent and insulting schemes of the american colonization society that society has been again and again assured by the respectable and intelligent part of the colored jieople that they neither wished nor wanted its services if they desite to go to liberia or any where else f they would go independently and at their own expense but ihese assurances in the shape of resolutions and addresses go for nothing running before they are sent they are everlastingly begging money in our name and appropiating the same to their own pur posesagainst our moat earnest remonstrances exposed in england a few years ago at the instance of william lloyd garrison by wilberforcc clarkson and oconnell the graves of thesa noble men are scarcely green when this society sends its agents into that country on a second mission of fraud and deception that it will be worsted in the ptesent conflict have no doubt british philanthropists are quite suspicious and justly so of any propositions emanating from iw hite persons aiming to affect iu any way the condition of the colored people of this country i have little fear that they will unite with our old enemy against ns in this i trust their last effort to injure os r d the new york colored oiphu asylum i have just spent two hour at ibis institution the building is situated on fifth avenue between fortythinland fortyfourth streets and so deeply am interested and impressed by what i saw and beard there that i foal prompted to say a word about it at once for this visit i am indebted to dr j mccune smith the constant physician of the establishment wo arrived there just aa tbe children were ruing fifrotn the long dinner table and were attracted to the room where they were by their vocal music they had finished their plain but substantial repast and were warbling a song of thanksgiving and praise praise god from whom all blearing flow went upon the wings of a hundred and forty orphan votets we reached the room in time to catch the dosing strain of tbie precious old hymn and to soe the children as they stood ringing it and were who would ootbe deeply affected by it had often beard this hymn before and seemed to taolme

utmost ease and order highly creditable to thoon having charge of the institution j after dinner they went to their plays and presented a lively scene as they seats per od m various directions with merry songs and sprightly dance from this scene the dr gave me a hasty glance at the different apartments of the building the school and sleeping apartments were admirably sdapted to promote health and secure the comfort of the iu mates tbe whole building though plain and unpretending is the very picture of neatness and comfort i felt like uniting in tho holy hymn praise god as i beheld those dear children snatched flora damp and gloomy cellars deserted and desolate garrets from the abodes of rice and crime from want and wretchedness from disease and death to this delightful abode of virtue aud intelligence where their tender hearts are moulded and impteseed with the love of virtue and their minds brought under the broad light of education and their hands are early trained to industry order and frugality here i found religion in its appropriate sphere taking care of the fatherless and lightening tbe burdens of the loody widow thank god that new yorkgiven up to moneymaking

consideration is the largest i believe in this city the female department is under the care cf mrs jme forten a lady of large attainments and i should think well qualified for her station the children were neat in their attire and orderly in their conduct mr reason carried them through a few exercises in geography astronomy grammar and arithmetic the questions were put in a familiar way without any routine formality and were answered in a manner that led me to believe that they were not only taught to remember the thoughts of others but to think for them teives the examination was deeply gratifying to me although i found boys of twelve answering correctly questions in geography astronomy arithmetic and grammar which i could not answer i ant not the leas proud and joyful on this account i rejoice that such colored lads arc on thir road to manhood they will grow up i trust and occupy a hgser position than iliat to which tbe presert uneducated fugitive has yet attained w hile looking out upon this multitude of sable yet bright faces felt a deep wish that j f calbuun and all hi guilty companions in the crime of roanatcalmg and libelling my humble race could share with me

would not lose sight of tbe many colored men all over the country now excelling in tbe various departments of science mechanics and letters also we are not without examples in our ranks the fault is that they are too slowly imitated the man who has only ability to blow the bellows should not aspire to play the organ any one ean buy a pippin in the marketplace and tie it to the bough of a tree

newspapers have sufficiently informed ua of the public events whict occured during the last week of february but many a sad tale connected witk these days of horror remains unknown save to the tew who acted in them on one of these occasions when the noise of firing and drumbeating sounded at a sufficient distance to lead me to suppose actual danger was equally far off i setout to see a friend who lived about three quarters of a mile further from paris than the street i then resided in it was a hue fresh spring day the lower branches of the lilactrees began to burst their leafy buds the snowdrop crocus hepatica and gay yellow daffodil enlivened the gardens and the wallflower filled the air with fragrance after the sleepless nights and anxious days i had lately passed was more than commonly susceptible to these sweet perfumes and sights which seemed to speak of peace and quiet so strongly that they almost induced a feeling of security for the moment and i began to comfort inysell with the hope that the worst was over and that although it might he long ere commercial or social confidence wm restored still life and property would be safe and by degrees those who lived out of the gay world as i did would return tothe usual routine of their former quiet habits and that to them at least a monarchy or republic made little difference while political matters would in due tiuic be settled and arranged on a new plan kpcouraging myself in these pleasing anticipations though i then more than half feared they would turn out delusions as they asuredlv have done walked briskly forward when all at once the peculiar tap tap tap of the drum and the heavy unmeasured step of a large body of men struck upon my practiced ear telling too plainly it was not military who were approaching while deliberating which way to turn i looked up and saw there was no retreating without showing the alarm which was always dangerous at this time making therefore a virtue of necessity walked boldly toward and addressing a tall fiercelooking rather sullen youngman in a blouse i said that sure of the politeness of frenchmen i ventured lo request him to conduct me past the advancing body of citoyeiis who perhaps as the wit equaled the gallantry of his brave countrymen might be led to make quizzing remarks on a lady walking alone ainid so many men during such stirring times at first he looked as if disposed to be insolent but as i proceeded with ray speech his vanity was no doubt satisfied for his countenance relaxed and he smilingly assured me he would with pleasure accompany me and accordingly we walked unmolested and almost unobserved through this martial crowd all were armed variously some had swords drawn many had their arms bared up to the elbows ready for bloody work and thered flag of the revolution waved every here and there whih fries songs and howls rent the uu at length we arrived at clear ground and i smilingly thanked my conductor salut citoyenne said he vive la nation vive la repub lique responded i and walked on somewhat relieved arrived at madame de vann ions house and found her at work with her daughter celestinean only child of about nine years of age a little girl of much family consequence as she was heiress to an immense fortune on the death of hergrondfather we talked ofthe times and i related what i had just passed through ah said she many bands of insurgents have gone by this house hut we do not approach the windows and none of them have ever molested us but god knows w hen our turn may arrive there you may hear their horrid revolutionary tap now at a distance shortly after it became more audible nearer and nearer it approached and we looked at each other with alarmed countenances at last the pikes and flags became visible louis louis cried madame de vannion tothe servant boltthe doors and at your peril look out of the win dow the noise increased and celestine began to cry her mother tried to comfort her and we talked ot the unreasonableness of being frightened at a mere sound but as there was some reason to apprehend a slight derangement in the action of the heart in her case her mother acting upon the advice of her medical attendant rose to prepare a soothing draught they were in the habit of giving to the child when any unusual circumstance agitated her had heard of their alarms on this subject without myself sharing in their fears for celestine was sturdily made bright complexioned fond of play and accustomed to live so much in the air and to take so much exercise without ever appearing overfatigued that i almost inclined to think hv parents were aver anxious about their precious charge and used the doctors name asin excuse for spoiling her a little par icularlv as even he announced that by careful tending she would outgrow hese symptoms at this moment however her unusual pallor struck me aud i drew her kindly towards me while madame de van nion proceeded to the next room in tearch of a draught of water upon opening the door we discovered mon lieur louis standing staring at the open windowcome back louis said madame de vaimion quickly did i not tell you on no pretence to approach the window be easy toadame it will be nothing they are past at this moment he started and exclaimed ah one of them looks hack he looks angry the window cried we striving to drag

no robbery be replaced it are they going to kill us mamma asked little celestine my child i cannot tell but if they do we shall go to god and in heaven there are no terrors i am saving my prayers mam ft ma she shed no tear she uttered no cry but amid all the uproar of this fearful scene the beating of her little heart was distinctly audible we trembled yet our words were calm and our looks firm atlast there were signs ol departure the noise lulled the bayonet ted the bread drank the wine putting the bottles to their lips and then breaking them afterwards they pushed us rudely about under pretence of shaking hands with us saying they would on their return settle matters with the man who had only escaped a cowards death that time by running away to conceal him selfthey then left us amid oaths shouts and laughter and when the door was closed und the fearful sounds had died in the distance wc began toj feel a terror that during the scene i have just described we had not been conscious of all was put in order by our own hands in silence for we durst not speak and we felt that active exertion alone could preserve us from fainting on m do yaunions return toj dinner when his wife related to him the events of the morning he appeared anxious about the effect such a fright must have had upon celestine the child assured him that she hardly remembered the scene she recollected at first error and then a feeling of faintness and that her heart had beat very quickly but that she feared nothing now that her own papa was beside her still she did not regain her former cheerfulness nor was she calm and gentle as heretofore she became irritable with her companions impatient with ier companionwith her bonne and frequently left her plays complain i ing of headache the unsatisfactory state of her health ended in an attack of fever from which in due time she recovered although her complexion never regained the brilliant hue for which it had been remarkable but remained pale as a marble statute another singularity was that neither before nor during her illness after her recovery did she ever name the visit of the insurgents and she showed so much uneasiness when any one else alluded to it that her parents requested their friends to avoid the subject and talk ofother more cheerful matters before her she soon returned to her toys plays lessons and seemed as happy at the noisy usual though a drum a sliuot always turned pale one evening as there appeared to be more than connnorn disturbance in the street and celestine appeared uneasy her mother proposed that she should retire early to rest hoping to get her to sleep before the uproar increased she obeyed at once and was soon in her little bed good night my child said her mother kissing her but stay i

the pittsburg visiter to all our female readers mrs swisshelm is doing her gex a good by writing such lectures there is more truth philosophy and common sense in this lecture than in twothirds of the volumes written by the medical men of the world true democrat well girls got such a scolding from one of your number for w riting no letter last week that am afraid to neglect it this time you know i said i could quilt almost as fast as two of you the reason is take care of my hands one half of you are too proud to do this you would not be caught putting a glove onto sweep or hoe or weed in the garden because you think it would jook as if you w ould like to be fine ladies if you sec any one taking care of her hands or careful to wear a sunbonnet to preserve her complexion you say she is proud and stuck up but it is you who are proudtoo proud to think you require any care to look nice you have an idea you look well enough at any rate so you just make yourself as rough and course as ever you can byway of being independentyour hands grow as stiff and hard as if you held a plough and swung a scythe and when you take a needle you can scarcely feel it in your fingers this is wrong there are many things which women ought to do which require your hands to be soft and pliable and they should be careful to keep them so in order to make them useful ever woman who lives in the country should knit herself a pair of gloves with long fingers closed at the tope not mils to let the fingers get hard there should be a piece of ribbed work at the wrist to make them stay on wbn you use your hoe rake or broom put on your gloves when you take hold of skillet pot or kettle handle take a cloth to keep your hand from being seared and hardened v hen you wash clothe or dishes do not bare water so hot aa to feel unpleasant many gftfs scald their hands until they can put them into water almost boiling such bands are unfit to use a needle ora pin they are not so good to bold a baby or drear a wound take care of your hands and do not forget your faces i hare seen so many country giria who at sixteen had complexions like alabaster and at their faces would look like runuet bag that had hung six weeksin the chimney corner one reason of this is they do not wear a bonnet to protect them from the sun another reason is the habit they have of baking their faces before a wood hre i have seen some women stand before agreat roasting fire and cook until i thought their brains were as well stewed as the chickens and they would get soused to it they would make no attempt to shield their heads trom the heat nay they will set down in the evening and bake their faces by the hour and this is one of the reasons why american women grow old withered and wrinkled fifteen years before their time but another and the greatest reason is your diet people in thi country live too well and eat too much hot bread and meat country people usually eat richer food than those who live in the cities and that is a reason why with all their fresh air their average age is little greater than that of city tolks thousands of beautiful blooming country girls make old sallowfaced women of themselves before they are thirty by driuking coffee smoking tobacco and eating hot bread they shorten their lives by these practises about as much as city indies with their fashionable follies ido not know what you think about it girls but i think it is about as much of a sin for w omen to get old brown withered faces by eating to much as it is for men to get red noses by drinkingtoo much very few people think it a disgrace to have a bilious feverbut i had just as lief the doctor would tell me that i was drunk as that i was bilious the one would come from drinking too much the other from eating too much r all this is a serious matter for it alfects health and life and the reason why i talk about your complexion inspeaking ofit is that everybody loves to look well whether they will acknowledge it or not now people cannot look well unless they are well and no one can be well very long who does not try to take care of herself the w r oman who roasts her head by the fire disorders her blood brings on beadaches injures her health and makes her face look like a piece of leather when she swallows hot colfee hot bread greasy victuals and strong pickles she destroys her stomach rots her teeth shortens her life and makes hersell too ugly for any use except scaring the crows otfthe corn j g s effect of shade on manures lt is a well known iact that the earth is capable of being converted into the best manure if densly shaded it will undergo chemical changes apparently similar to those which vegetable and animal matters do when they are converted into manre namely it is changed in color cocsistence and fertilizing qualities this fertilized earth known as vegetable mould or virgin earth tobe the best of all manures it has hitherto been considered the residue of vegetable decomposition vegetable matters upon the earths surface exposed to a free circulation of air appear to be decomposed by a different chemical process termed mouldering which forms a trifling carbonized residue destitute of fertilizing qualities and this is the case also when ploughed under and deprived of contact with the atmosphere unless they are previously saturated with water or lime be added they do not undergo fermentation but by mouldering becomes useless if not pernicious to after vegeta tion the astonishing fertilizing effect of vegetable matters when thickly covering the surface of the earth for a length of time cannot be accounted for by their decomposition for the quantity of the residue of clover leaves or straw would not be sufficient even if it were always equal in virtue to the best peruvian guano straw spread thickly upon the poorest landland completely exhausted of alkalieswill enrich it by the time it is decomposed leibig when a boy leibig was distinguished at school as a booby the only talent then cultivated iu german schools being verbal memory on one occasion being sneeringly asked by the master of the school what he proposed to become since he was so bad a scholar and answering he would bea chemist the whole school burst into a laugh of derision not long ago leibig saw his old school master who feelingly lamented ins former blindness tiie only boy in the same school who ever disputed with leibig the station of booby was one who could never learn his lesson by heart but was continually composing music and writing it down by stealth in school this same individual leibig lately iouud in vienna distinguished as a composer and conductor of the imperial opera house his name is reu ling it is to be hoped that a more rational system of school instruction is now gaining ground can anything be more absurd and detestable than a system which made walter scott mod justus leibig boobies at school and so effectualy concealed their natural talents that for example leibig was often lectured before the whole school on his being sure to cause misery and broken hearts to his parents while he was all the time conscionus as the above anecdote proves of the poses sion of talents similar in kind to those he has since displayed scientific ame rican when a drop of chloroform is applied to the leaf of a
