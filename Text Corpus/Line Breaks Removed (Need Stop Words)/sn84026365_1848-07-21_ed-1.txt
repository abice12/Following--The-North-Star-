she will not throw the christian garb if she can increase thereby her own influence and as the devil qu tea scripture to justify himself to his children so she will make broad her phylacteries with texts from the law and the gospel it thereby she may swell the number cfl her devotees we have before us an address to the american churches issued recently and signed by the rev lrs spring ting and some three or four other wellknown clergymen of the gospel according to the new ork pluttorm the object it aims at is preeminently a sectarian one and the prejudice it appeals toit appeals to that and national vanity aloneis the popular one against catholicism it is crowded from beginning to end with the cant ol orthodoxy and fairly hisses with the sniffling pietism of the american meetinghouse its ostensible purpose is to solicit aid for a mission to france protestantism in france has sent an emissary to this country to fraternize with the protestantism of america this is a matter which concerns the catholicism of that country and this and site is abundantly able to take care of it our private opinion is that the religion of paris is as good as the religion of new york and that an exchange could one he effectedwould be decidedly in our favor we doubt if the men in blouses would know or perform any better their duty to their fellows were they to have the advantage once a week of the droppings from the sanctuary opposite our office where the spiritual ladle is in the hands of the rev or springor of any of those of ids cosigners to this address and we are quite sure that these rev gentlemen and their flocks might learn a valuable lesson from the men in blouses there are certain great princples of christianity which the french people are striving t carrv j tl t very practical operation just now under the motto of liberty equality fraternity nevertheless we are very willing that at lo i ism and protestantism should tight ml hr d ialoe and do not at ll wonder that

to rashness their bravery is nothing but effrontery their sectarian zeal has overstepped the bounds of prudence and modesty and put on the brazen front ol impudent hypocrisy had they kept within t leir proper sphere and advocated a crusade in france only because protestantism is better than its old en the north star cmy we for one should have hardly cared which succeeded io building up a sectarian organization at the expense of the true church there is an old proverb with which honest men may comfort themselves in such a scramble but dr spring and hts friends have chosen to make their appeal to the american churches in a new language i the signs of the timea they nay cannot well he misunderstood j the governor among the nations is coming out of his place to shake terribly the earth it is not tliey hope with unhnllpwcd emotions that they j regard at such a time the prominence i which the god of heaven has assigned ito our own favored land it is a rei markabh fact that the revolutionary nationsare looking with hope to the american people an appeal for aid they add comes emphatically from france from paris from the land of the huguenots where they have sought in vain for ages the liberty wherewith christ makes us free but where the gospel has now free choice where the word of god is not bound where the pure gospel is now accessible to the people in every form and whose affecting cry come over and help us france now solicits the word of god an open door is set by him before the american churches which shall remain open if the call be answered and france be beautified with his salvation if the governor among the nations meant ever to shake terriblv the earth in any other sense than that corrupt institutions in the fullness of time bear corrupt fruit we doubt if it would have been put of till the th century there has not been wanting any time these five thousand years good cause of interference of omnipotent power to overthrow wrong and establish right if such were the ways of i gods providence but we marvel that these men all reverend and almost divine as they are can venture while they bold to ouch a faith to stay among brick houses of all the nations on the face of the globe should jus j tice be meted out eaefully there is j not one tiiat so much merits a shaking as our own should she get her dei serts a terrible shaking indeed would be hers such an one as would make a residence am mg brick meetinghouses like this which frowns upon us from over the way dangerous in tiie extreme hid we with these gentlemen believe in such general shaking as a special pyowdence such is our faith ittcarnal iwctkst ve should fifferup with the strongest hope of immediate response the prayer of the scotch puritan who referring to some popish opponent cried out shake him o l id shake him right over the pit of hell hut dinua o lord let him fall in hts not hr spring some fear of retributive justice had he and his friends no compunctious visitings while preparing this address w ere there not in their mental vision dim spectres in multitudesmillions of weeping women wretched childrenand strong men bowed down in agonyof the black slaves of their own country could tliey close their ears to the dumb inarticulate cry of the poor enslaved at home who appeal to them for deliverance from captivity they remember and they hope with no unhallowed emotions the prominence given to our favored land prominent indeed in her opportunities and her promises hut alas prominent now only for having forgotten the one j and used the other lor evil have the reverend gentlemen no emotion to spare for this could they not get beyond the thick folds of their protestant sectarianism one glimpse of the fact that however much the gospel may have been a sealed book in france or opened only by proxy that in the united j states it is a forbidden bookforbidden under pains and penaltiesto one sixth of the people and opened by themselves the authorized expounders of the word as the authority fot wrong the protestant colporteurs in france could find at least protestant churches to whom to preach or give the printed gospel but the colporteur in new orlea ts or charleston whether protestant or catholic would be rewarded with imprisonment if ceught with the bible in his hands or the word of god in his mouth wherewith to teach the

confidence in the fi j nal and speedy triumph of the glorious cause of freedom and humanity this convention do now adjourn without day tiig difference it is amusing if not instructive to look over the whig and democratic papers übout these times it is wellknown that there is great dissatisfaction in both parties with respect to the nomination of cass and taylor and if all signs do not fail there will be tens of thousands who will ifolt in november and cast their votes for freedom but the way a whig or democratic editor treats these disaffected onesand how easy he can make wrong right and right wrong as the case may heis a caution fake for instance a whig editor and bear hint discourse of the wilmot proviso democrats of new york these are set down as men of stern integrity and unbending principle who nobly spurn southern dictation and are not governed by the motto our party right or wrong and after some more hackneyed phrases the article winds up with assuring them that posterit will do them justice in another column the same editor indites an article respecting those antislavery and antiwar whigs who repudiate the nomination of taylor but oh what a change comes oer the spirit of his dream they axe spoken of as professed whigs men of narrow views wiioaim at distracting the party and working its defeat to the lasting injury ofthose who want office they are petted then coaxed then scolded in order to bring them back into tin whig fold and are plainly told that they have no right to private judgement after the grand sanhedrim has spoken the sarna course is pursued by the democratic papers although rev rsed in the application they see evident marks of returning sanity hi the proviso democrats and are expecting areal political mil le ilium in the demo eratie family before the ist of november with respect to the w higs how everthey see irreconcilable difficulties the antislavery portion of them are composed of sferorer stuff tbarf to abandon their faith and bind themselves four years longer to the slave power we presume there editors tike great credit to themselves for the ingenuity displayed in splitting hairs and showing that a certain coarse of action oa the part of a whig in little else than treason on the part of a democrat and tut vtrta bat we think their readers will arrive at a different conclusiontad judge that if it is the duty of a whig to repudiate bis party when it sacrifices principle it is the duty of a democrat to repiafcate iris for the srine reason mercer laumnar j ict nothing is more easy than l magnify a trifling

ripe rotten ripe for dissolution long enough and too long already have they keept men fighting about shadows while oppression corruption and venality have borne away all the trophies the mask is at length thrown off the leaders of both parties now stand clothed in the garments of treachery so that all men may see their rottenness and we rejoice that it is so it is meet that a crisis like the

slavery for its cornerstone but in answer we say god reigns and will yet vindicate the right he ia now teaching the world by french example the folly of injustice oppression and wrong and of relying upon the sword for that which can only be accomplished by the foolishness of preaching respecting the immediate eause of tlie insurrection there seems to be considerable doubt some in france think it the work of foreign emisaries who sought to overthrow older and the government by corrupting the people with gold this might be to a certain extent true but the real cause must be deeper doom than this supposition implies wretched must be the lot and dark the minds of those who could be bought for paltry gold to involve their country in a common anaichv and ruin that designing and disappointed politicians have bad a hand in this bloody work we have no doubt men who foiled of their ambition by honorable means have resorted to this as the last expedient to accomplish those purposesdeeming it better to rule in hell than serve in heaven they have sought to gain their preference through the wild and wicked means of anarchy and bloodshed it appears from highly intelligent sources that this whole plotofhorrid destruction had been maturing for weeks in the national workshops and that the leaders and chiefs on the side of the insurrection exercised as complete authority over their men as that exercised by the officers over the regular troops this fact shows plainly that the event has been the result of no mere accidentbut a longdetermined regu larlyorganized and skilfullycontrived plan to subvert all orderthat out of the wild chaos and fury itsprojectotsmight snatch the bloody reins of government but while this may have been true to a certain extent if the warcry of the revolutionists means anything the communists of paris are chiefly responsible for this last confused scene of human slaughter they have been the agents if not the principals in the con ccin and to them must attach the gloty or shame of the foul undertaking dark and gloomy as is the prospect we will not despair of society in france even amid the wildest elements of revolution and what are called the baser and more profligate sort the prophet may scan certain rays of character which may kindle in his bosom a blaze of hope the people however mistaken and deluded evidently felt that they were fighting for their just rights they regarded themselves deceived and defrauded by the government and whether correct or incorrect they acted upon their belief two important lessons are here taught the statesmen first that the people will not endure oppression and injustice when they believe the means in their power to throw it off secoud that however just and impartial may be the laws and institutions of a country there is absolutely no safety while the great mass of the people are ignorant and uneducated educate the people educate the people for herein is the safety of society the

effort will be interesting to those who believe the law of moses to be above the law of right to ns however weare free to confess it does not possess much interest could it be proved to a demonstration that moses and the hebrews practised aqd approved of slaveryslavery as hellish and abominable as that which is sanctioned by this republic it would not stir us one iota either in one direction or the other all that we could gather from such a fact would be that moses and tie hebrews were bad men devoid of every sense of moral right we know full well that they could not have divine

their sug gestures of improvements in their plans ant by clearly showing them how completely theii owd interests axe involved in the observance of the rules adopted by their mutual consent amongst these rules is one which perhaps more than any other has tended to the comforts both of employers and men none bu those who totally abstain from the use of al intoxicating drinks are admitted into their littli community and the penalty of an infringemen of this rule is immediate dismissal a reading room and library are provided for the rec ieation of their leisure hours and an evening school for the more youthful them who would otherwise be debarred by thei circumstances from the inestimable blessing of education and we must not omit here tc remark that during the past winter a younj brother of j d carrs has generously devoted several evenings every week to the instruction of such of the men as are inclined t improve themselves in writing and arithmetic and that this experiment was attended witl the most encouraging success the young folks are also lured to the path of learning by being permitted at certai hours on every sabbath to assemble on th premises of their kind

connected with this establishment which we must not omit to mention which is the excellent conveniences for bathing which the workmen have always at hand the value and importance of which are too obvious to need comment it will easily be believed that all these provisions for their improvement and comfort have the effect of attaching the men warmly to their employers such is indeed the case and there is no lack on their part of a due appreciation of the privileges they enjoy in the strength thus afforded them in the resistance of temptation to evil and in the growth of all the highei

in previous tears they had beento the sea coast up the east and west of the island and one loog bright day they had spent amongst the lakes and mountains of their own beautiful country revelling in the wild loveliness which surrounds windermere the queen of the english lakes but tins year a still greater treat was in store by the magic aid of steam they were to cross the scottish border set foot on scottish ground ind explore the wonders and beauties of scotlands renowned and romantic capital no wonder then that for months past their hearts beat high with anticipation no wonder if prospective visions of the first sight of that noble city and of the delight of having one whole day to spend within it came often vividly before their mental eye when busily engaged w the duties of their every day life jiving a fresh and joyful stimulus to their ndusuy both for their own sakes and for the take of their kind friend who was blending heir happiness and interests with his own so ndiasoiubly and

gives a narrative of his own observation on the morning of the dafter stating that the porte st denis was the focus of all the disorder he says that on approaching that neighborhood he was surprised not to see a single soldier or national guard but on the other hand several thousands of the conspirators in possession of the whole of ihe district and already entrenched in bat tirades of the most formidable description across the boulevards was an immense bar ticade formed of four or five omnibuses several carriages a huge wagon and pavingstones taken from the streets torn up for a considerable distance on both sides a little beyond the hue st denis was another fully as formidable and composed of miscellaneous materials and still further on toward the porte st martin wa a third not so large as the first hut still sufficient to be a powerful defence the end of the rue du faubourg st deni was also closed up with a hug barricade which prevented the approach of troops from the outskirts the rue st denis the rue villeneuvc bourbon the rue de clery and the other streets abuting on the spot in possession of the insurgents were similarly defended and thousands of gamins were industriously working with pikes aud spades tearing up the streets and adding to the defences the mere enumeration of these extensive woiks shows how much tune must have been pent in their erection and it is wonderful to think the authorities who had been fonvarned of what was doing and who show so much alacrity in calling out the troop when there is no occasion for them should have allowed them to be completed without interruption the barricades were defended by tome hundreds of people in blouses of whom many were not armed or at least did riot show ifieir arms they had a great number of tricolored flag stuck upon the lop of the barricades with the words ateliers nationauj inscribed upon them the porte st denis which was in the hand of the conspirators was decorated with the black flag and on the lop of it were arranged heaps of paving stone apparently for the purpose of being hulled upon the heads of those who might attack it oil lkt on u morning of the d about oclock about

francois waa wounded in the course of the evening the insurgents captured a post of garde mobile aud made them march with them all round the temple the town was in postession of the insurgents who were defending themselves with intense energy the platoon discharges replied to them every minutes it w as estimated that not less than i of the oufriers and the dregs of the population of paris and the banlieu were gathered together in the deperatc attempt to make another revolution and recover the mastery such was the nature of the work on thursday and friday it is fearful to contemplate the bloody scenes of these tw o days and of saturday sunday and the morning of monday what was enacted in those two days was repeated with more or less accompaniments of horror to the end of the con flict the insurgents shouted down with the national assemblywith lamartinewith jjcdru kullinwith marie ling live the republic democratic and social these were the chief cries but othets exclaimed vive napoleon and that pretty numerously others again but few and faint vive henri cinq but these were mere party cries the parisian mobwhich is far too commonly confounded with the french pcyple poured forth earful cues of bread or death then was shouted death to jjamartine and to the other leaders once so popnlar in fact the names of the parties tfius denounced could only be distinguished by their being as familiar a household words borne however could not be distinguished and the most fearful ciy of all was death to death to the name being lost in the roar of the crowd or the noise of the musketry a correspondent of the london times thus describes the principal scene of struggle when those who have been at waterloo learn that for more than a mde the wall of ihe city of part was as

southern prison house we ae frequently brought painfully to remember that no only is their labor wrested from them unrmunera ted not only do thoy suffer from intense hunger and cold not only are the

good fruit therefore knowing that without associative action we cannot render efficient aid to this holy cause we affectionately invite the cooperation of the citizens of rochester and the public generally we ask them to bear in mind the injunctions of jesus all things whatsoever ye would men should do to you do ye even so to them remember also the beautiful parable in which he calls our

laboring to banish forever the diinon of slavery from our land and in j so doing instead of an example of corruption and wickedness we should be a light to the world we hope no olo will feel too poor nor any too rich to enlist in this holy cause the christians influence in whatever situation is always salutary and will certainly produce its good effects we ask for the aid of men and of wumenwe call on the old and the i young the firmer the jnechaaic and the merchant we ask all and every one to give us their help to devote what they can spare cither of money or of the fruits of tneir labor to the work of restoring men and women to themselves to their manhood to the rights and blessings with which they were endowed by our creator for this object vre propose holding a fair in december next we ask the females in the adjoining towns and country around us to get up sewing circles and prepare such arti  cles as will be most saleable and to come fur nish tables give us their company and help j us not only in selling those tilings thus prepared but in convincing the public mind of the necessity of our perseverauoo ami fidelity and thus be helpers in hastening the day of emancipation an appeal is made to ike friends of liberty to unite with those who have i recently detached themselves from the two political parties with which they have hitherto acted in elevating to the presidency some citizen who has gooe no farther in the great work of antislavery reform than to avow his resolution to oppose the farther extension j f slavery and this appeal we regret to say is endorsed by a few individuals in the liberty party who ned streuu ous chotts to bring about the nomina j tion of messrs hale and king permit us therefore in this exigency to entreat you to be steadfast snd unmovable to adhere to the wise policy you have already marked out and the rnaiute  nance of which has made you so influential even many of those w ho ccn pured you at the last presidential election for voting for a third candidate i under tie pretence that the nominee ol either the whig or democratic party j would certainly be elected and therc i fore vour votes would be

postpone the j great work of emancipation and substi j tute a new issue for the glorious one already made and which has been so successfully maintained you will injure those who now seek your alliance you have associated to use the sentiments of the address of the southern and western convention of not as partisans but for the purpose of subserving truth and right to oppose not merely the extension of slavery hut to bring about by all lawful and righteous acts its complete overthrow j your association is founded upon the i great cardinal principle of true democracy and of true christianity the i brotherhod of the human family you have resolved on waging war against j slavcholding as the direst form of oppression and then against every other species of tyranny and injustice you are aiming to carry out the principle of liberty in all its consequences out as a more abolition party but as a party that aims at the extinction of slavery because slaveholding is inconsistent j with christian and republican princi piesaiming at it not as an ultimate end but as an illustrious era in the ad j vancemcnt of society to be wrought outby its action and instrumentality by asserting and maintaining these high and uncompromising principles you have with gods blessing niatfe adeep impression upon your countrymen commanded the respect of mankind and induced large numbers of the considerate and

instead of lowering your standard you have elevated it thus you have infused coinage into your ranks and gained the respect of other parties is it said by uniting with the disaffected of the other

styled unconstitutional unnecessary disgraceful and h barbarous neither is h to be imagined that a single individual tbo prises libert am abhors slaver who loves peace am values our christian

cast his vote for a politician who has when in power proffered his aid to the slaveocracy othe country and the world and whe has not evinced any desire that the record should be expunged thougli ready to award due praise to him whe has repeatedly and ably advocated the doctrine of the nonextension of slavery we cannot believe that while hf rests there and is decidedly opposed to any important principles of th liberty party you will be instrumental in elevating him again to the presidential chair but there are apprehensions that nola few disaffected whigs and democrats men who refase to bow the knee to party dictationmen who have independence and conscience men who are opposed to the extension ol slavery to the elevation of a warrior a slaveholder or a demagoguemen who profess to abhor slavery nay whe avow their belief in the truth of antislavery doctrines will alter all nominate and vote for some mere wilmol proviso man this once rather than meet the crisis manfully and unite with

entreaty a truehearted friend and advocate of liberty stands before you as the nominated representative of the antislavery sentiment ol the country he has shown that he is honest capable and independent why not thenunite with the friends of liberty in giving him the entire antislavery vote of the country he might bo elected but if not the demonstration made in favor of liberty equality
