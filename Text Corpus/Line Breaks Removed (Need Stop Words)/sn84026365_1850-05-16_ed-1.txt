speech of mr haleon tiie territorial question delivered in the senate of the united states tuesday march  continued in january the senate on motion oftha senator from south carolina mr calhoun passed acvorai tnngent resolutions against the movements of the abolitionists one only of which i will read to the senate as a fair specimen of the whole resolved that this government was instituted and adopted by the several states of the union as a common agent in order to carry into effect the powers which they delegated by the constitution for their mutual security and prosperity and that in fulfilment of this high and acred trust this government is bound so to exercise its power as to give as far as may be practicable increased stability and be curity to the domestic inatitfions of the states that compose tho union and that it is the solemn duty of the government to resist all tempts by one portion of the u t as an instrument to ck the domestic institutions ofmother or to weaken or destroy institutions uch sir was the manner in which both parties united in the language oth senator from south carolina in insisting that the petitions should be received and that congress should take jurisdiction of the subject for which they prayed now sir i want to call the attention of the senate to the manner in which this movement was received by the people at the north i have at some trouble looked up the necessary documents to show how they were received by the people at large meetings of the people have been held in nearly all of the chief cities and towns in the northern states at which the proceedings of the abolitionists were rejected and disavowed with great unanimity and much zeal niless register october these meetings as will be seen by the papers of the day were holden dt new york boston albany and the other principal places in the free states of the character of the resolutions passed at albany the richmond enquirer maid amidst these proceedings we hail with delight the meeting and resolutions at albany they are up to the hub they are in perfect unison with the rights and sentitnents of the south they are divested of all the metaphysics and abstractions of the resolutions of new york they are free from all qualifications and equivocation no idle denunciation of the evils of slavery no pompons assertions of the right of discussion but they announce in the most unqualified terms that it is a southern question which belongs under the federal compact exclusively to the south they denounce all discussions upon it in the other states which from their very nature are calculated to inflame the public mind and put in jeopardy the lines and property of their feliowcitiaens as at war with every rule of moral duty and every suggestion of humanity and they reprobate the incendiaries who will persist in carrying them oq ee disloyal to the union i will not waary the senate by reading reports ol such meetings holden in the principal cities and tdne of the north the papers of that day contain gbuodant evidence to satisfy the most incredulous but all this did not satisfy the south they demanded that the abolitionists should be put down bylaw in the free states the newspaper southern patriot said let the declaration that discussions which from their nature tend to inflame the public mind and put in jeopardy the lives and property of our fellowcit izens and are at war with every rule of moral duty and every suggestion of humanity be only embodied in some legislative act with appropriate penalties and the south seeks no higher and better

main street tbrriver in which they pre cipitatll them ageing ell this violence lod the hostile sentiment out oi which grew tbe antislavery men contented until the public opinion of the city was changed and the liberty of speech and f the press completely established mid there is now no large city in tb union inwbieh te antislavery soiament is mere decided uut tow ipytvrutn wf of hundreds with which the records of that day are filled of the manner inin which abditivnum was ridiived by the northern people every principle of law and every safeguard ot propriety of emitted society were violated by both parties at the north to put down this movement and sir they tied with each other to see who might go the farthest and the men that said the severest things and vho did the severest things against the abolitionists were those who sipposed they were coinmending themselves most to public favor and yet sir in the face of this undoubted history of the fpets of the case it is now asserted that they were received with favor be both parties at the north and that both parties did their bidding ji has been charged against the abolitieiists also again and again that throughout this movement they were setting emissaries to the south preaching insurretion to the slaves in phen this mouement first started it is die in justico to the abolitionists to sat that they disavowed it in the most ilemn manner and have continued tofduavow it from that day to the althought the assertion is repeated he e almost every time than any gentletpm has occasion to speak upon thisjubject the facts are that from thekne when this movement first had itsangin at the north down to the presat time these same abolitionists hae disavowed any such intention i readtir an extract from the authored position of the views of that spiety made in and signed by aljtheir officers in behalf ofthe american antislavery society ve solicit the candid attention of the public to the following declaration of uf principles and objects we hold that congress has no more right to abolish slavery in the southern states han in the french west india ulatis of course we desire no natiea legislation on the subject  wo hold tilt slavery can only be lawfully abolisid by the legislatures of the sever states in which it prevails andthatiie exercise of any other than moral jufluence to induce such abolition is jnconstitutional  we belief that congress has the same right to polish slavery in the district of columbia that the state governments havliti their respective jurisdictions and at it is their duty to efface so foul a ot from the national escutcheon t we believe hat american citizens have the r tit to express and publish their opini sof the constitution laws and ini tutions of any and every state and a ion under heaven and we mean nev i to surrender the liberty of speech f the press or of aonscienceblessi js whieh we have inherited from our athers and which we intend as far we are able to transmit unimpairt to our children we have u formly deprecated all forcible attemp n tbe part of the slaves to recove their liberty and were it in our pov rto address them we would exhort hem to observe a quiet and peacs demeanor and would assure ther that no insurrectionary movement m their part would receive from us ie slightest aid or countenance  we would eplore any servile insurrection both in account ot the calamities which w ild attend it and of the occasion it ght furnish of increased severity a oppression r cfciv with sending ncendiary publications to the south if by the term incendiary is meant publications containing arguments and facts to prove slavery to be a moral and political evil and that duty and policy require its ibolstion tbe charge in true but if this charge is used to imply publications encouraging insurrection the clisvlels false we beg our fellowcitizens to notice that this charge is muds without proof and by many who con ids that they have never read our publicwtp and that those who offer it maw to the public no evidence in supportpf it we arc accused of sending our publications to the siaves and itis asserted that their tendency ie to excite instirnctims both the chargee are false the publications are not intended for the davs and were they able to read they would find no encouragement to insuntetion  we are sccjised of employing agents in the slave states to distribute our publications we have never had one such agent we sent no packages of our pap to any person in those states far retribution except to ave respectable resident citizens at their own request glut we have sent by mail single papers addressed to public officers editors of newspapers clergymen and others if therefore our object is to excite the slaves to insurrection the masters are our agents that is the exposition which they put forth in i when this excitement first began these sentiments have bean reiterated nearly evory year from god is the father of us all and all men are brethren that time to this and as far as i know anything of the movements of this organized society they have religiously and scrupulously lived up to them have yet to see the first resolution they have passed the first line they have printed in contradiction or contravention of this platform thus laid down in  what was the state of feeling at the south at the time when this body was so smalhand contemptible want to read a few resolutions passed in south carol tw the yeer to h o who was getting up excitement at a meeting of st jamess and st georges parishes south carolina they resolved unanimously that should the nonslaveholding states omit or refuse at the ensuing meetings of their respective legislatures to put a final stop to the proceedings ol their abolition societies against the i domestic peace of the south and effectually prevent any further interference by them with our slave population by efficient pena aws it will then become the aplemn duty of the whole south in order to protect themselves and secure their rights and property against the unconstitutional combinations of the nonslaveholding states in the murderous designs of their abolitionists to withdraw from the union there was the issue presented in if the nonslaveholding states did not pass penal laws to put down the abolitionists in it was the solemn duty of the southern states according to these resolutions passed in south carolina to withdraw from the union well sir i have in my hand another remarkable paper taken from the charleston mercury published about the same time headed the crisis this paper says the proper time for a convention of the slaveholding states will be when the legislaturesof pennsylvania massachusetts and new york shall have adjourned without passing laws for the suppression of the abolition societies should either of these states pass such laws it would be well to wait till their efficacy should be tested the adjournmeut ot the legislatures of the northern states without adopting any measures to suppress garrison tappan and iheir associates will present an issue which must be met by the south or it will b in vain for us ever after to attempt anything further than for this state to provide tor her own safety by defensive measures of her own if the issue presented us is to be met it can only be done by convention of the aggrieved states the proceedings of which to be of any value must embody and make known the sentiments of the whole south and contain the distinct annunciation of our fixed and unalterable determination to obtain the redress of our grievances be the consequences what they may we must have it clearly understood that in framing a constitutional union with our northern brethren the slaveholding states consider themselves no more liable to any interference with their domestic concerns than if they had remained entirely independent of the other states and that as such an interterence would among independent nations be a just cause of war so among members of such a confederacy as ours it must place the several states in the relation towards each other of open enemies to sum up in a few words the whole argument on this subject wtavould say that the abolitionists can only be putdown by legislation in the states in which they exist and this ean only be brought about by the embodied opinion of the whole south acting upon public opinion at the north which can only be effected through the instrumentality of a convention of the slaveholding states for this we believe the public is not yet prepared especially in our sister states that was to be the time for the convention if the legislatures of massachusetts pennsylvania and new york then in session adjourned without passing laws to put down abolition societies then the time for a southern convention had come mark tbs expression r should either of these states pass such laws it would be well to wait till their efficacy can be tested ifow air was the south arrayed against tappan garrison and the societies designated in the speech of the senator from south carolina as small and contemptible iftheleg islatures of massachusetts pennsylvania and new york did not come to their rescue it was time for a convention of the slaveholding states for this we believe the public mind is not yet prepared especially in our sister states not yet prepared there was something u be done to prepare the public mind for it we believe the public mind is not yet prepared in the sister states it seems that the public mind was pretty well prepared in south carolina but something was tobe done to prepare the sister states and in this connexion it seems to me that the letter i read yesterday has a most pregnant and significant meaning mr calhoun writing to duff green says since you passed through the south the excitement in relation to the northern fanatics has greatly increased chow far short of ditfdnion was the remedy w be found why if they could be so far prepared tq put ai certain man at the head of the union would they atop thus far abort of disunion that waa the meaning of it but the thing was not then prepared in the sister states though suppose the gentlemen who thought tht sister states not sufficiently prepared fifteen years ago suppose they have got them sufficiently prepared by this time the senator from south carolina speaking of the antislavery agitation at the north says which as is now ikudsad has endangered the union now sir that is not the case the union was safe enough the public mind was safe enough fifteen years ago i hold in my hand a newspaper called the union published in this city the th of february last and this editor who suppose will be admitted to be good authority on the subject says the following fact stands out prominently in the history of parties in new hampshire via that before the annexation ot texas and the treason oi john p hale to the democratic party which act of treachery he sought to justify on the pretext of opposition to the admission of texas that party was as free from all taint of abolition or freesoilism as the democracy of virginia they opposed all agitation of the slavery question and they opposed the abolitionists in every form now sir you have this declaration coming from this sourceone that will not be disputedthat up to the annexation of texas in there was as little abolitionism and freesoilism in new hampshire as in virginia herself and if the same be true ofnew hampshire it is true of all the northern states generally so far as anything affecting the public councils are concerned but at that time what did the north see they saw then the proposition clearly and unblushingly pu forih that the whole purposes and ene ergies of the government must be brought to bear for the purposes of strengthening and sustaining the institu ion slavery the following is the of aunouncement that was made by the secretary of state a movement of this sort abolition of slavery in texas cannot be contemplated by us in silence such an attempt upon any neighboring country would necessarily be viewed by this government with deep concern but when it is made upon a nation whose territories join the slaveholding slates of our union it awakens a still more solemn interest it cannot be permitted to succeed without the most strenuous efforts on our part to arrest a calamity so serious to every part of our country the establishment in the very midst of our slaveholding states ot an indepnnd ent government forbidding the existe nceeof slavery and by a people born for the most part among us reared up in our habits and speaking our language could not fail to produce the most unhappy effects upon both parties this sir is the great secret of the opposition to the admission of california it is because they are a people who accord with us in their hearts and speajg our language and have forbidden the existence of slavery among them after the announcement to which i have referred of the secretary of state mr upshur the government went to work and negotiated a treaty of annexation i think it is wrong however to say of annexationthat texas was annexed to the united states it is not so the united states were annexed to texas as the matter was consummated texas applied to us tor annexation messrs van buren and forsyth belie they had not the right to do it consistently with national faith and they rejected it then we applied to texas and she rejected us and then a second time we asked texas to take us and she consented to do so and i therefore protest in the name of justice against calling it annexation to the united states texas stood off and we went to her a second time and she took us and the avowal we made to induce them to doit was that we could not maintain and defend our institution unless they came to our fescue the communication of mr calhoun to mr green the american charge to mexico communicating the annexation of april  says and in the next place that the step was forced on the government of the united states in selfdefence inconsequence of the policy adopted by great britain in reference to the abolition of slavery in texas it was impossible for the united states to witness with indifference the efforts of great britain to abolish slavery there they could not but see that the bad the means in her power in the actual condition of texas to accomplish the objects of her policy if accomplished it would lead to a state of things dangerous in the extreme to the adjacent statesand the union itself seeing this the government has been compelled by the necessity of the case anda regard to ita constitutional obligations to take the step it has as the only certain and effectual means of preventing it that wae the doetrine advanced by mr calhoun in his letter to mr green and the same doctrine waa insisted on ia his letter to mr pakenham the british minister which iwill not trouble thp senate with reading the letter is dated the th f april end declares in effect that measure must be taken to prevent abolition in texas to guard against the injurious effect on john sice pftihtm whole no j us it was the avowal of theae sentiments by the the general government thus boldly and unblushingly made and the declaration of mr calhoun that unless those efforts should succeed it would involve the whole country and not the slaveholding states alone in great calamity that awakened and aroused the public sentiment at the north they saw then the revolution about to be effected in the glovernment and hat instead of quietly employing ourselves at home we were seeking to strengthen our hands by the in corjroranon orrttjrergn this union to sustain the institution of sla very now tn connection with this subject of th annexation of texas i come to the recent speech of the senator from massachusetts mr w stxr and i regret as much as any man beiug compelled to differ from the honorable senator but have this consolation that if i differ from the honorable senator from massachusetts in agree with him in ina speech made by him in the senate in the distinguished senator from massachusetts used this language m opposition to the increase of slavery in this country or to the increase of slave representation in congress is general and universal it has no reference to the linesof latitude or points of the compass i shall oppose all such extension and all such increase in all places at all times under all circumstances even against all inducements against all supposed limitation of great interests against all combinations against all compromises mr webster in the senate august  agree with that sentiment of bis however i may differ from soma later things which he has said i want now to call the attention of the senate to some other remark of the senator from massachusetts made upon this subject in the senate of the united states mr president there is no citizen of this country who is more kindly disposed toward the people of texas than myself from the time they in ao extraordinary a manner their independence from the mexican government have shewn i hope in another plaie and shall show in all situations and under all circumstances rf just and proper regard for the people of that country but with respect to ita annexation to this union it is wellknown that trom the first announcement of any such idea i have felt it my duty steadily uniformly and zealously to oppose it have expressed opinions and urged argument it everywhere and on all occasions in which the subject came under consid erationand could not now if i were to go over the whole topic again adduce any new views or support old views as far as i am aware by any new arguments of illustration my efforts have been constant and unwavering but like those of others they have failed of success i will therefore in a very few words acting under the unanimous resolution and instructions of both branches of the legislature of massrchusetts as well as in conformity to my own settled judgment and full conviction recapitulate belore the senate and before the country the objections which have prevailed and which always will prevail with me against this measure of annexation in the third place sir i have to say that while i hold with as much integrity i trust and faithfulness at any citizen of this country to all the origonal arrangements and compromises in which the constitution under which we now live was adopted i never could and never can persuade myself to be in favor of the admission of other states into the union as slave states with the inequalities which were allowed and accorded to the slaveholdwf states then in existence by the uon titution ido not think th states everxpected or ould expect that they would be on to admit fbrther slave having the advantages th fltqnal advantages arising tothern from the mode of apportioning representation under the existing con stitution sir i have never mad an effort and never propose to make an effort i have never countenanced an effort and never mean to countenance an effort to disturb tbe arrangements as originally made by which the various states came into the union but i cannot avoid considering it quite a different question when a proposition is made to admit new states and that they be allowed to come in with the same advantages and inequalities which existed in regard to tbe old now sir as i have said in all this i acted under resolutions of the state of massaohusetts certainly concurring writh my own judgmentso often repeated and reaffirmed by the unanimous consent of all men of all parties that could not well go through tbe cries affirming not only tbe impolicy but tbe uncoiistitutionalit of such an nexation besides experience shows us that things of this sort may be sprang upon congress or the people it wee so in the cese of texes it was so in thn twentyeighth congress the members of that congress were not cboaen to decide tbe question of annexation or o annexation they came in on other grounds political aqd party and were supported for reasons not connected with this question what tbeo the administration sprung upon them the question of anonexsuon it obtained a snap judgementupon it and carried te measure of annexation i think i see a course adopted which is likaly to turn the constitution of the land into a deformed monster into a curse raher than a blessing in fact ft frame of unequal not founded on popular representation not founded on equality but on the grossest inequality and i think it will goon or that there is danger that it will go on until this union shall fall to pieces i resist ittoday and always whoever falters or whoever flies i continue the contest i know sir that all the portents are discouraging would to god i could auspicate good influences would to god that those who think with me and myself could hope for stronger support would that we could stand where we desire to stand i see the signs are sinister but with few or alone my position is fixed if there were time i would gladly awaken the country i believe the country might be awakened but it may be too late but supported or unsupported by the blessing of god i shall do my duty i see well enough all the adverse indications but lam sustuained by a deep and conscientious sense ot duty and while supported by that feeling and while such great interests are at stake defy auguries and ask no omen but my coun trys cause there sir is where the senator from mtlmcbuiett in i the measure is unconstitutional and itis a snap judgment now i ask can any roan be bound by a snap judgment unconstitutionally obtained and yet sir in answer to the question i proposed to him a few days ago if he thinks that this joint resolution adopted by a majority of the two houses of congress imposed a contract upon us which was binding he said that he does and that we are bound in good faith to carry it out and to admit four new slave states out of that terrritory by the force of the obligation imposed on us by those who passed the resolutions i have nothing to say as to how that question will be met when it comes up and it is not very probable that i shall be in any public position to meet it when it does come up but i undertake to say for the present and hereafter these resolutions imposed no obligations on me whatever i trust i shall always be reaey to do justice to texas but no consideration of justice or anything else is imposed npon me by any obligation growing out of those resolutions it is true that by the constitution congress has the right to admit astate but because it can do that it has no right to connect with that act a treaty with a foreign nation out of which any obligation whatever can reston this government it is claimed that congress made a compact with texas it is put on that groundand my answer to it is that texas and everybody else knew that congress when it undertook to make that compact did what it had no power to do and what it was expressly prohibited from doing did not the president andsecretary of state send the matter to the treaty making power and when it failed did not the president and those who had the matter at heart set aside the tribunal to which in the first instance they resorted and then appeal to the two houses of congress as i conceive in derogation of the rights of the senate and in violation of its constitutional privileges there is no obligation binding on my conscience growing out of such an act i trust i feel as strongly as any senator here the weight of every obligation which is imposed on an honorable or an honest man but i do not consider that this subject addresses itself tome in any such capacity well sir there are some curious coincidencies in relation to this texas annexation the senator from mas achusettsin that very patriotic speech for which he has been so much lauded that i cannot in anything in which i may say about those laudations and therefore will not attempt it the senator undertakes to charge on the democracy olthe north that they were governed by the purpose in their support of the annexation of texas avowed by the administration seeking it and that was the desire to extend slavery but the senator from illinois mr douglass says that it is not so and he shows us the record as exhibiting the fact that every northern man in congress who spoke on the subject cast from him the proposition of the administration and took another broad comprehensive liberal enlightened wriotic and christian view of it and auppted it solely on these considerations well sir there had been some remarkable od most astonishing coincidences and thwsurely is one ot them remember reading m the pickwiek papers of another equally remarkable one young weller was relating the circumstance of his father being once engaged to take some voters in his coach to an election poll while thus engaged the committee on the other aide met him and suggeated tohim that there was a dangerous place on the road where the coach must certainly upset at the same lima insinuating ao note in bis hand and said the aon in telling of the circumstance one of the most extraordinary circumstances was that when father got to the place the coach actually upset and the voters were all thrown into the ditch and did not get to the polls to vote well air it aeema that in this transaction in regard to texas there is a coincidence equally astonishing th moment the senator from south carolina perceived the necessity of the annexation oftexae for the purpose of sustaining strengthening perpelua ing and rendering eternal the institution of human slavery that moment the northern democracy before opposed to it opened their eyes and saw it asa great and glorious national measure just at that moment did they see all this and supported the measure not for the reasons assigned by the administration but for other reasons of avery different character this in my judgement is certainly one of the moet remarkable and astonishing coincidences on record there is another equally astonishing on this sidd of the chamber exhibited in the course of the honorable senator frtm massachusetts who nted a caveat against anybody taking a patent out for the use of hit thunder and who avowed his determination to defend it at all times and on all occasions at the very time thunder becomes little annoying in some quarters and threatens to mpbarass the administration the senmor discovers all at once that the laws of god take care of the proviso and that it wants nothing atour hands where were these laws of god when the oregon bill was under consideration were not those laws in as full operation in as they are in does not the law of god take care of the proviso up to degrees as well as below degrees minutes oh sir are the laws of god and the institutions of piety more potent under the present administration than they were under the last then it was absolutely necessary to insert the proviso into the oregon bill but now that a new administration has come in and thii thunder is very annoying and disturb ingto them all at once it is discover i ed that there is no sort of necessity foi haviug any thunder at all and that th laws of god take care of the

as usual for three days hitherto unequalled among all the annivei sary meetings whatever their objeet orwhei ever held in this country in regard to ih interest awakened by it and the absorbing nature of its proceedings there is every reason to believe its reputation will be heigbren ed and the attendance npon it augmented aits approaching anniversary of the man crises that have arisen since the antislaver agitation was commenced the present is obviously the most stirring and momentous ant therefore an unprecedented mustering of tht friends of freedom and emancipation should be witnessed on that occasion in behalf of the board of managers of tht massachusetts antislavery society francis jackson president edmund quincy secretary letter front the editor the sixteenth anniversary of the ameii can antislavery society was hejfl pursuant to announcement on tuesday morning may th at broadway tabernacle new york at an early hour the spacious building was densely crowded and presented i scene quite animated and exciting there were present on this occasion an unusually large delegation of the oldest and staunchest advocates of our muchdreaded cause and of the rank and file of our army there were many in attendance who had never before participated in the proceedings of our annual meetings at ten oclock william lloyd garrison the piesident of the society called the meeting to order and gave the usual invitation to any who might desire to address the throne of grace whereupon prayer was offered by the rev mr grew of philadelphia this was followed by the reading of scripture by mrgtiaoa after which francis jackson treasuter of the society submitted his annual report showing that the receipts of the society for the pam f or publications and donations amounted to the nm of aoven thousand iseven hundred snd nineteen dollars sod that seven thousand four hundred and three dollars had been expended on newspapers and agents thus leaving the society out of debt and cash on hand to the amount of three hundred dollars the business being now completed mr garrison vacated the chair and was announced by mr jackson who was called to preside as the first speaker he opened bis address by declaring the objeet of the american antislavery slavery society to be beneficent glorious and christlike and he proceeded for several minutes in a strain of earnest argument to vindicate the antiala very movement from the charge of infidelity up to this time the entire audience appeared quiet orderly and respectable and although s feverish excitement was observable to a practised eye an outbreak was scarcely to have been anticipated the delusion however was soon dispelled mr garrison took occasion to expose the hollowness and worthlessness of the various testa by which the proslavery churches of the land decide as to what constitutes christian character and in so doing be had the temerity to lay heavy hands upon the great idol of american slavery general taylor this was the signal for a general outbreak and here commenced a scene of tumult ami uproar which baft a my powers of description a loan sad wirylooking nan whom i afterwards discovered to be be notorious captain rbyodera rote in the gallery immediately behind the platform and in ahoarae and thundering tone asked mr garrison if the roman catholie church was the only one whose members held sieves here there was a general yell firm the outer circle in approbation of the interruption mr garrison quietly replied will the friend wait will answer him in reference to the other ehurcbes the tempest was here lulled fora moment and mr garrison proceeded but was speedily interrupted again by hisses groans and other hideous noises it was now evident that a band of rioters had encircled the platform and the audience both fn the galiery and in the body of the house and that capt ryndera was their acknowledged leader whose call they were ready to obey in any emergency mr garrison proceeded in comparative quiet until he charged upon general taylor this thoroughly roused the notorious mobo crst he sprang to his feet ea if in s guei of passion and in a loud and angry voice addressing himself to garrison exclaimed t i will not allow you sir to assail the president of the united states you shani do it following up his menacing words in a violent rage he rushed from the gallerj to the platform uttering furious threats towards any who should insult the president he was instantly surrounded by a gang o his own fraternity and for a few minutei all was boisterous and terrific uproar criet of put him out from some in the autji ence and defiant threats from the mob for i time silenced all discussion and completec the reign of discord in the very midst uf this the hutchinsor family in the hope of stilling the tempest commenced one of their plaintive snd heart touching songs but this only provokec louder demonstrations and more insullinf jeers from the rioters jt was impossible for them to proceed quiet was however again partially restored but all hope of proceeding in order was over hooting groaning hissing yelling and low ribaldry were kept upwith little intermission throughout mr garrisons speech at the close of which the rioters called aloud for mr grant snd would not permit any speaker to be heard prior to their selected champion mr grant mounted the rostrum and strangey enough for the champion of such a cause he at once announced his reluctance to interfere with the rights of the meeting and would not press his claims to be heard in opposition to the will ot the society the rev mr furness now took the platform and addressed the meeting amidst loud interruptions for about thirty minutes i mr grant then came forward snd said the assertions made about the colored race being equal to the white man were an outrage upon our heavenborn institutionsan imposition upon those refined portions of our inner nature which exemplify the voice of god in the laws of man it had been assumed that the black was a man in the full sense of the word this he respectfully begged leave to deny it was a ridiculous pretension which bad been tolerated too long the speaker then entered into proofs drawn from nature and reason to show the inferiority of the colored race and that the creator had designed the negroes to be inferior in their original formation in conclusion he said i repudiate this most abpojious abolition gathering and movement as unworthy the age in which we live snd that goodly land where w were born and i entreat you all to leave your wild speculations in view of transcendental ngr louun and confine your etforta to the elevation of those capable of being elevated and as sure a the sun shall rise will success then orown yosr efforts while as certainly as he sets at night will defeat degradation and ruin overwhelm those who in their insane course violate their own glorious instincts and the lawa of nature and of natures qod this ridiculous speech of whiph the above ia only a faint report though the speaker was exceedingly grave called forth ahouta ol merriment when mr grant gave way frederici douglass was called for snd at once came forward snd addressed the meeting thi readers of the slar will probably have full reports of all the speeches tnaee on the occasion snd it is therefore needless that the writer should speak of his speech in this place f douglass was followed by samuei r ward who for about twenty minutes poured forth a brilliant stream of wit and humor and argument fairly blistering the grant who had presumed to identify the former with the outsng outang at the close of mr wards speech the society adjourned to meet at the nsw york society library rooms broadway at three oclock io the afternoon thus far the rude disturbers of our meeting had little to boast of io the way of success they had annoyed snd hindered but had not defeated the celebration snd as il conscious of their defeat they rallied in numbers in the evening snd by a wild chaotic tumult and other rowdy gantra tions they succeeded in breaking up the meeting this they did in the presence of alarge body of police whose oathbound duty it was to protect the society in its natural and constitutional right of pesesful assembling and freedom of speech broken up in the evening the society again assembled in the morning snd was again assailed by the rigters in the saost coarse and disgraceful manner all sense of decency snd propriety seemed to have forsaken the poor snd despicable creatures snd their behaviour even proved them desiitute of all respect fur women their ribaldry snd obscenity were poured forth in shameless profusion snd the presence of ladies so far from restraining it seemed to provoke this vile conduct several of the antislavery speakers mr grew mr garrison mr burleigh snd mr phillips essayed to speak but in vain the mob triumphed sgain abd that too in the presence uf the police and the meeting was broken np the owner of the hall not being willing to risk the building longer in the hands of the mob the vigilance committee muting this was held in the shiloh presbyterian church it was

if further investigation be nude into the causes of these disgraceful proceedings it will not be found that the violence of abolitionists is among them for the mob assembled and commenced operations before anything was said on the subject they bad no right to expect that the proceedings if the meeting would differ materially from three of meetings peacefully held by the same society in former years it is therefore to be affirmed that the mob must find responsibility for its existence elsewhere than in lbs unprudence and violence of abolitionists i tbuk he was not far from truth who declared that for this riot daniel webater and recreant northern senators ought to be md responsible it would be a shame to ax we blame upon the ignorant and misguided tven who only acted the part

such a spirit at now prevails in this antislavery society governed the councils of the men who framed it tne meetings must not be held even though van buren himself shonld bring the buffalo platform

and attempt to break up and abolition meeting at riie tabernacle the infamy of such tmmhings are only raached by their folly the right to meet and discuss any and every public question is undeniable the au tempt to put down free speech by violence is as undeniably wrong the course therefore can have no other effect than to increase and extend he antislavery feeling and sentiment by all such incendiary teachings and lor all such outrages abelitionism pro fits such papers aa the herald and globe therefore are largely influential in promoting antislavery action and aggravating antislavery

professor thought ho belonged to the genus homo and then he launched out into the sea of learning cited naturalists quod latin talked of veitebias cerebellums c using scientific and medical terms in such profusion as to make himaeil ridiculous and excite the risibility of the audience hugely a person of due shrewdness and learning might possibly have rendered this position plausible but those qualities were sadly lacking on the side of the democracy on this occasion frederick douglass took them in hand and skinned them but the democracy wouldni give it up so o yo i are not a nigger

crawling through a very small knothole tribune from the n y evangelist am aatlblasry society the meeting of this society was disgraced by one of those violent outrages which we had hoped belonged only to times gone by for some days the columns of a notorious print of this city had teemed with calls upon the mob to be present at the meetings of this society but little apprehensions were felt that the call would be responded to at an early hour therefore the tabernacle was filled with an assembly of whom a large portion were ladies the meeting was called to order by mr garrison who in accordance with the usage of this society announced that if any one felt disposed to engage in audible prayer to the god of the oppressed an opportunity was now presented this invitation was embraced by theodore parker mr garrison then read a series of extracts from scripture which he sarcastically remarked was recognized by the american people as containing the will of god francis jackson esq the treasurer then read an abstract of the treasurers report mr garrison having resigned the chair to mr jackson proceeded to say that the object of the american antislavery society was the entire abolition of slavery in the united states by peaceable and moral mesns the society however lay under a great weight of popular odium and all manner of evil was said against them falsely they were chuced with being infidel in their views and designs with bavins in view th uherior onject or subverting the church of christ he wished to take the ecclesiastical bull by the horns end in order to do this and show the falsity of the charge he must do something else and show the utter worthlessness of all the usual and ordinary tests applied at the present day to determine christian char ter we all agreeed he mid that slavery is an svil and to be abolished aa soon as possible this be done by the churches he took ip then one by one the leading religious de lominations of the country and prooeeded to irgue that they were aii implicated in the sin if slavery and so could not do inythiog forts overthrow he was speaking in particu ar of the roman cathoik church when the irst interruption was made by a notorious in ividual known as captain rynders who sked if the catholics were the only ones vho held slaves mr garrison replied that le waa about to answer that very question nd went on in hia speech alter arguing hat all denominations of christians were au sagued hand in hand in favor of oppression ie proceeded in his peoulisrlv calm and cut ing style to speak of all the various tests ommonly applied to christian character ando declare them perfectly nugatory inasmuch a conformity to them waa fashionable and very body was in favor of them thus belief i the bible was nothing for that was the rost fashionable book in the country every ody had it except the slaves observance f the sabbath was popular so that we had ven united church and state iu order to unish those who ahoold violate it belief in esua was not a test for hie praises were on very ooes ups everybody believes in hus at this poiet tbe interruption began in iroest and a scene ensued which defies ail tempts at reporting rynders and his tends advaosed to tbs siege shouts sod tes wers heard from aii parts of the house the tabernacle presented an almost frightful scene rynders m the chief spokesman ho waheard vociferating that do man white be lived should abuse his country its laws or rolera mr garmon kept the floor duriof all the uproar smiling calmly sod not appenng the least disoomposed a momeota lull occurring be proceeded to finish his speech in the esme strain in which he hsd commenced asserting thet when s cause was persecuted then only was it s teat of christian character and declaring that at the present day the senslavery cause was that teat and concluded by offering a resolution to that general purport the mob now recommenced their outcries calling upon rynders for s speech hut the fellow had screamed himself hoarse and wished to devolve that task upon a confrere one dr grant the chairman then announced that rev dr futnisa of hhiladel pbia would address the meeting the mob cried out for grant it its at last announced that after dr f hsd spoken an opportvnity would be given for dr g to spesk which was seceded to on condition that he should not occupy more than fifteen minutes dr furnisa then proceeded to make a very eloquent speechin which he declared that he did not shrink from the name of abolitionist from anv fear of the obloquy connected with it but if at all from fear that he had nc right to bear it persecution obloquy and danger was the price at which a man earned the right to that name and these he had noi encountered he a marked tribute u frederick douglass as being an abolitionist for not only was he opposed to slavery bui had abolished it in his own person he spoke of henry jbrown and the magical bos into which a slave was put worth a few hun th l ol was jolted a few milei l wwwancea and wher opened up sprung a freeman worth a suer beyond computation dr furmaa spoke with great animation and fluency and it ma easily be conceived that it required no bligh degree of moral courage for a man of the retiring and studiouacharacter that characterize him in a high degree to stand up in such i scene and amid such frequent mleriuptiom as he was subjected to dr grant the champion of the mob non look the floor thisworty if we recolleci alight some years since engaged in a controversy with dr j mccune smith in whict he was sadly worsted hia remarks are u terly unworthy of mention being directed tc prove from physiological giounds that the negro was not a human being they wen irterlarded with technical anatomical terms every repetition of which caused roais ol laughter from his worthy associates aiu were evidently only made to pass away the time until the mob might decide upon some course of action when dr giant had finished what h could say loud cries were raised for frederick douglass who advanoed to the front the stage which was now completely covered with the mob we shall give no sketcli of his speech which considering the occasion and circumstances was one of the moa masterly which we ever heard to everj interruption from the mob he replied with i keenness of wit which drew down repealec bursts of applause from the mob themselves and which their worthy leader himself war fereed to lead he described himself as the son of a slaveholder and only half a nigger shouted rynders and so halfhrother to you yourselves said douglass yes yea wel done waa the answer he described himself as bearing on hia back the marks of th whip as himself having stood up in the marl for sale of himself having been a refugee as kossuth waa a refugee but the other day he spoke of amalgamation enforced by slaveholders of the colored woman who should she lift a band in defense of her virtue mighi be suuck dead with impunity thats false said hyndeis it is true the law of virgi ma declares that a white man against whoa a slave raises a band may strike him dead thats another thing at least in intent answered rynders jj e poke f himself ant his race shut out from every honorable avocation and forced tq jive h such swj  nnu considering the narrow limits ir which they were forced he was astonisbec that they did as nobly as they did all they asked was that the foot should be taken ofl them and they would risenot rise to cui their masters throats that waa not theli way they had had the razor in their handi for years and the worst they had done wat to cut hair i care not said he if lam dee cended from a monkey aa dr grant asserts have eyes and that is proof that was mad by god to see i k e a bead to think i heart to feel and a tong to speak anc that is proof that god made me v think anc feel ud speak he declared that iw war his country and heie he would stay and v it would contribute whatever honesty integrity and industry could do the speech waa throughout admirable anc the rioters themselves found it so a flush partly of shame partly of admiration passed ever the visage of the leader of the ruffians as he stood within a yard of the speaker whe occasionally turned his addrvss to him and bie confreres who certainly never before had an opportunity of listening to so sound a speech rev samuel ward a colored man then spoke his speech was remaikably appropriate and eloquent and was received with equal favor but our limits forbid us attempt a sketch the time for adjournment having arrived the meeting was closed on oui passage from the room we heard rynders exclaiming to his comrades he spoke the truth it was all true and it waa right foi htm to say it so that after all the only result of this last mobattempt waa to give i ceitain class of men who otherwise nevet would have enjoyed the opportunity occasioi to listen to two most eloquent and able vindications of the coloied race made by cotorec men themselves and we are much mistaken if they are not found wiser men for the lesson second day the sctndalons effbits made op tuesday by the grmmt captain of the empire club and his gang to bieak up the meetings of the society did not seem to produce much effects upon the members for some before the period for opening the doors on wednesday they began to gather in ibe library hall and from the little observation which they seemed to attiaet there appeared reason to hope for a tolerably quiet meeting the audience of meobers got quietly seated before the gang began to appear perhaps not more than or persons were there for quiet and orderly purposes of these some or more were ladies and about the same numbei colored persons at the eotnom nf aa garrison some little applause was given and close at hia heels came the law and order party headed by rynders they at first took their station around the upper tier ot seats in the lobby and were very respectfully quiet for them during the first minutes of the proceedings wm loyd garrison president of the society called the meeting to order and inquired for the resolutions which were offered to the meeting on the day previous sami brooke jas w walker and sami macy jr were then named a a finance com mittee and a nominating committee waa appointed the resolutions haying been brought forward were then read reaolved that while daniel webster has most

elaborate and arguraentive with an earnest appeal to the citizens of the free states to give no countenance to the scheme for surrendering fugitives from slavery which he pointedly condemned as hostile to every sentiment of religion and humanity after mr jay had brought his remarks toa close hon samuel lewis ol cincinnati proposed a resolution that no aid should be given in delivering up the fugitives from bondage which he accompanied with a few briel and pithy romaiks the tabernacle by this lime had become crowded with an immense audience among which were a great number of ladies and a small band of obstreperous persons on the northwest corner of the gallery who kept up a running fire at the apeakers wherever the chance for a good shot occurred mr lewis tappan then read a brief ab atract of the annual report and presented a long seiiea of resolutions from which we take the following resoloed that slavery still exists contrary to the letter and spirit of the constitution and the intention of its framers and that iu introduction into newlyacquired territories would be an act of treason to liberty and an outrage upon the memories of our fa thers resolved that in the language of senator seward there is a higher law than the constitution and in the language of sir william blackatone human laws are of no validity if contrary to this and that all compromises between right and wtong and all atalutea which are repugnant to humanity and justice are null and void resolved that we are cheered with the noble conduct of the libertyloving member of congress who amid threats of violence and disunion b j fnvpagniniisis are true to the ordinance of and the cause of freedom and humanity and that the thanks of this meeting be specially given to the senators and representatives who have so eloquently vindicated the constitution the friends of the slave and the right of petition and who have contended so ably for california union and fieedom without compromise and illustrated with so much force southern aggression and the comparative effects of slavery and freedom resolved that daniel webster by his disregard of early profession his treachery to humanity and freedom and his servility to the slave power has forfeited the respect and confidence of his constituents and coun ty resolved that we view with astonishment the abetting of the massachusdtts senator in his aposiacy and inhumanity by then eminent in the learned professions in literature and in the cffurch and that the chain recently presented to him in this city is a fit emblem of the spirit of those who bestowed and him who received it resolved that the great antislavery struggle is not between the northern and southern states but between the slaveholders of the south and the friends of liberty throughout the country and that we consider it a highly encouiaging sign of the times that antislavery sentiments are so rapidly gaining ground in the slave states and in the district ofcolumbia resolved that the illegal imprisonment of colored sailors from the north in southern ports the outrages upon northern citizens travelling at the south on lawful business the violations of the post office and the many other breaches of the constitution by the the slave power should be sternly withstood by the competent authorities rev henry ward bccoser then came imon the platform in front of the pulpit evidently desiring a large space a fair field and no favoi with several pamphlets under bis arm laying those on the desk he said that he hoped nobody weuid be alarmed at the sight of his notes as if he was going to preach a sermonthey would hear something before he got through quite different from the common run of sermons he intended to consider two points the wrong stand point which many took on the subject d the question which is often asked what do you mean to do he wished the question to be looked at ina christian point of view he would ask what made a chrhtian nation not the perfect embodiment of christian principles in her institutions forjudged by this test no nation could claim to be christian this was the woik of time by gradual progress it will be long before the sublime idea of a christian commonwealth will be fully real iced but we apply the term christian to auy nation that professes to square its opinions andregulale its conduct by the laws of christianity in this sense great briiain and the united states might be called christian for they professed to direct their course by the rulea ot the bible new what is th radicalessential idea of slavery it is that a slave js not a man do not said mr trip the slaveholder into tins definition i take it from their own legislators and jurists igo to southcarolina and louisiana for authority add no one can doubt that they are othodox in matters of slavery mr b then read several passages from the laws ot those slates in illustration of this point the slave then said he is a cbsitle not a person but a thing a beast of burden and hard worked at that deprived of every human right and no one suffered even to teach him to read without being sent to the penitentiaiy thats a lie said a voice iu the gallery lve no doubt you know said mr b for ill bet youve been there he then went on to show the enormity of the frinciple rtf transforming a man into a thing shquld like to see it tried in newyoik could you reduce our industrious cartmen toa level with the horses they drive no the love of liberty springs up immortal in the haman breast have been a gaidener something of a farmer and of all earthly emblem of eloinuy l know nothing thtt mir paues purslain in a garden you dig it up out it up by the roots smaller it in piles bury it below the surface it will live for a month spile of all you can do and take root befoie you think of it bo it is with liberty in the soul no power that does not kill its immortal life can deprive it of this blessed aspiration mr b then alluded to two important facta one that slavery in this view never existed in newengland and newyork the system there regatding the slave not as a chauis but as a perpetual apprentice the other that the comparison of a southern slave with a northern laborer is altogether icltactuun it is impossible said mr o to such a system by any piinciple of the bible it is contrary to nature to god tor god is nature and nature lagod though not in the pantheistic sense and at war with every sentiment of christianity in answering the second question proposed mr b said everyman and especially every minister is bound to express bis abhorrence of this damnable system even though he should incur the aortal hatred of the south and be exposed to the gibbet or published in the journal oj commerce every man must let it be koown not that lie is an abolitionists in the technical sense of that term but that because he is a christian he has no tolerance of slavery tbs preacher ia not to weave his finedrawn subtleties toor sport his abstruse views set tc thetorical music but come right down on the iniquities romp and not outaide the tabernacle and in it too mr b drew a eatirieal picture of thoee evangelical champions who first look circumspectly round and see where the deni has been an d then let fly and after a tribute to webster whose blunders era never mads in bis log ice or his knowledge but never fail to be made in his torsi action and a few ironical compliment to the journal of commerce for lately putting on a pair of long ears in discuasing the dutiei of the pulpit he concluded h highly orig pal and affective address from the n v tribune newvork state vigilance committee the newyotk state vigilance committee held its anniversary last night at the shiloh presbyterian church corner of prince and manson sis the meeting was called to order by rev mr josselyn there was no written teport but the secretary made a verbal statement of the doings of the committee during the past yesr they have assisted fugitive slaves beside carrying on several cases in southern courts some of which have terminated favoraby one case in prinec georges co md is still pending the committee have also taken the initiatory steps for prosecuting for the freedom of a family of children and grandchildren their hope is based on the freedom of the grandmother who was kidnapped proof of which is abundant this case will require to carry it through and bonds to the amount of must also be entered for each person there is one more case concerning persons the maternal ancestor of whom was a free irishwoman the committee have had for the past year a salaried agent by whom these cases in court have been prosecuted the treasurers statement wss then read from which it appears that have been received during the year and l go expended there areat present in the treasury the treasurer read exuacts from a letter of gerritt smith which gave the signal for a set of disgraceful rowdies who had just entered to get up a tumult many of these fellows came upon the floor of the church at first but finding too many respectable people there crept sheepishly out and conrgegated in the dark corners of the gahery quiet was soon restored whereupon rev mr ward a colorod clergyman addressed the meeting vuunenced by reading a resolution to the effect that the committee is cheered by the snccess of the past year and the smiles of divine providence and will continue in spite oi any laws that may be passed and any opposition they may encounter to help the fugitive from bondage he responded entirely to the sentiments of the resolution there are circumstances conceivable under which every person present would give his hearty assent to it there are a great many men who cannot appreciate what the abolitionists must do or what the bjack man must feel bravery is a national characteristic of the americans applause our people never showed themselves otherwtse than brave but among the elements of bravery is generosity there have been occasions when the ameii can people have shown their brave and generous feelings in a manner to do them honor the speaker referred to the efforts of american missionariesto the general liberality toward all sects and to the ready interest they express inallstruggles for freedom elsewhere the american heart beats with sympathy for all who suffer under oppression applause the cases of france ireland and hungary were then adduced when reference was made to those countries the american people expressed their sentiments in a brave and generous manner but when we consider the case of men who are born on our own soilwho endure such crushings and oppressions as no people have ever enduredour gope show a different feeling here i cannot agree with them am an american laughtercries of a black one yes a black american the son of a father who fought in the revolution cheers a black citizen of newyorka black american am iapplausegloriously black laughter and applause i am black but i wear what black have on the outside laughter when the case of a black man comes before our fellowcitizens they dont feel with the same sympathy they exercise toward oppressed of other nations yells and disturbance it seems that there is some difference of oppinion here but it is one of the peculiarities of american citizens that they cas differ and differ kindly may we differ kindly tonight theeste people who make exceptions in their sympathy i make none let any man apply this matter to himself and then he will reason jum wu m xbolitionui his thoughts would be like oursand every fibre of his feelings would be wrought up in behalf of the freedom he had lost i am bound to take this for my standpointto feel for all that is done for the slave as if it were forme sir we only need to make out a case in this son and we shall have no lack of sympathy the doctrine of the revolution is a correct doctrineit is sanctioned by the bible and the constitution of the united slates yells cries oi fiieand a general attempt by the rowdies to break up ihe meeting there was considerable alarm among the audience one lady fainted but on the speaker earnestly enjoining them to keep quiet partial order was restored some policemen in the grllery ejected a few of the ruffians and the yells began again sit still cried mr ward if you want to see anything interesting look at ruethis produred a general laugh which settled the meeting the speaker continued it was not easy work for the despised nazarene to prove himself true to the people whom he died to save but he welcomed the tasl with all that is rugged in it and freely proffered unto us a salvation from sin in the name of the  free blacks and of slaves in this country we will do our duty to our brother man regardless of the consequences mr ward then spoke of his fathers flight from slavery with himself his boy sam at his side and related an incident concerning a physician in whose office he studied medicine he was not a mean cringing cowardly northerner but a yioble son of virginia yells and hootings he was no more to be compared to a northern doughface than daniel webster to a southerner and the friends of daniel webster think it about as easy to find a southerner like him as for a nantucket eel to tow a shadboat through lxng island sounds laughter yells and applause cries of douglass douglass hisses and hootings mr wsrd then went on to show that there was nothing in the constitution prohibiting the committee from assisting fugitive slaves besides they were acting with perfect legality in the matter in the southern courts on southern soil their agent is testing the legality of the tenures by which certain slaves are held and in some instances he has been successful he then went ioto a shrewd examination of the clause in the constitution referring to persons held to service he then read an extract from masons bill providing that whoever shall assist a fugitive slave shall be mulcted in the sum of oo a voice good somebody cries good said mr ward but let him not be too fast the resolution says nothing about the color of the afrfn buppoe somebody should be a fugitive fiona justice himself would lie then cry geodl yells and laughter the rowdy who cried good is silent and dont think of laughing then too there are all shades of color in slaves suppose he should be apprehended as a runaway slave by miiki and it might easuy happenwould he cry good yells hisses and laughter a voice mr webster is black i know mr webster is a darkskinned man and im not asmied of himrenewed laughter and tumult cries from all parts of the house why do you laughbecause im not ashamed of mr webster great laughter and shouting mr ward continued fora quarter of an hour longer in a strain of mingled wit and eloquence and closed amid te newed cries of douglass douglass abby kelly yells and whistling from all parts of the house chaiimammr burleigh will addreae the beats yells hisses and cries a voice in the gallery i have friends here and mean to be beard a mr hill then came forward and read in i atne manner two resolutions about the union which were responded to by boots and yells from the rowdies hi cyrus m burleigh tbes spoke for about twenty continually interrupted by yells and cries of douglass and abby kelly mixed with oaths and brsyings one fellow in the front rank of the gang yelled out your ad d liar a policeman standing near expressed his intention of taking him out but some of rynders men crowded about him and the official quietly cared in mr wm h burleigh afterwards spoke fora short time with the same interruptions and the meeting adjourned ending another most disgraceful chapter in the history of our city xxx ist congressln senate correspondence of y evening post washington thursday may a very interesting debate took place in the senate yesterday in secret session upon the nomination of captin cotton to be marshall of wisconsin it was interesting for the incidents which marked its progress and iin partant tor the extraordinary principles asserted by a portion of the speakers senator seward of new york was as he so frequently is the target at which the champions of seuthern pretensions to a monopoly of influence and office discharged their shafts i learn that foote and jefferson davis and others men of great powers of mind and corresponding audacity assailed the new york senator for his supposed agency in procuring this appointment with unexampled violence the statement is that the administration disregarded the wishes and recommendations of the delegations from wisconsin as to appointments iu that state and are governed in a great degree by the influence of m beward eiw j itotnslcing caiter of a milwaukee papersuch is said to have been the case in repect to this particular appointment mr seward replied to the assaults made upon him by admitting every count in the indictment and volunteered the confession that he had been guilty of other enormities far more flagrant if viewed from a southern ex ssure than even those charged upon hime had recommended cotton if that is the mans name but he had gone much further he had urged the appointment of applicants for office in the slates represented by all liis assailants he had endorsed the applications of men in south carolina for federal office in that state and been gratified to learn that their worth and fitness had been acknowledged by the appointing power this roused mr butler the old judge with more than a white heal defended his state from the imputation of harboring men who would seek such aid for the attainment of thetr desires the debate continued for about three hours and was only adjourned because of the gnawings of hunger i learn that some of the speakers perhaps all on the southern side maintained with the arrogance befiting the advocacy of a proposition so intolerably insolent in itself that they should insist upon the rejection of every person nominated to the senate who was tainted as they phiased it abolitionism and that the fact of having been by any antislavery senator or any antisouthern influence would be deemed and taken as evidence of the charge this is in brief the very thing announced by foote in open session the other day and is perhaps about as clear a definition of the shibboleth of office as taught and required here at washington any lime within the past years as could easily be given gov dodge of wisconsin undertook a defence of seward from the charge of undue interference in their local appointments butin bis present extremely feeble state of health he lound it quite useless to undertake to breast the clamorous torrent and yielded to the pressure of the time the matter was continued over for consideration today such is substantially the account of yesterdays proceedings given me by a gentleman who i have no doubt receives his information upon the subject from reliable authority andi have perfect confidence in his correctness so far as it goes i would go any length to usiain any man democrat or whig who sets himself against the infetnal spit it of pro scripion by wwch the negro breeders now govern this country an d put under the ban so much of its worth i therefore think the course of sew r d on this and other occasions involving the sa e principle deserving of the highest comiw n dation it is expected that the injunction of screcy will betaken off these proceedings washington may mr jefferson davis presented a resolutvap of the legislature of mississippi in defence of the proceedings in that sute in relation to holding a southern convention he read at great length from the address of the state convention to show that all efforts to charge that it originated in any desire for disunion were either maliciously false or ignorantly oeuceived he contrasted the mississippi proceedings with the proceedings of free sotl conventions in the east and west which were allowed to pass without rebuke and which lead to the discontent and alarm at the south the resolutions were laid on the table and ordered to be printed mr clay is reading the report of the committee of thirteen the report contains the following points firstl he committee are unanimously of opinion that new states may be formed out of texas under the terms of the compact entered into by the united states in the reannexation and that when they are so formed they have a clear and undoubted right to be admitted into the union as states but the committee do not think that any plan for the formation of new states out of texas should be originated by congress but should be left to the people of texas also that such new states should be admitted without any objection on account of the exclusion or permission of slavery secondln considering the qaeetion of the admission of california a majority of thd committee are of the opinion that every irregularity in the proceedings antecedent toher application for admission into the union should in consideration of the many circumstances of her position be overlooked and recommended the passage of the bill recommended by mr douglass for her admission into theunioo as a stater but thecommiuee aiao thinks it quite as naceasary that territorial ffovßvnmefita should be futnuhed for the let ritonee of utah and new mexico they had been abandoned were inhabited by a mixed and unusually varied population and were equally deaerving of proper governments and should have them speedily they were unfit at ptesent for stale governments and the committee recommended that the bill for the admission of california and the bill providing territorial governments be incorporated in one measure and passed together as one measure they also recommend that the bills be passed without the wilmot proviso being attached to the teiritories they considered the wilmot proviso as applied to these territories ft mere abstraction thirdthe committee report as an additional section to the california and territorial bill a provision determining the boundaries of new mexico and texas as follows the boundaries of texts stall be the rio grande up to a point ms north of el paso del nortethenoe the line shall run due north alon the one hundredth parallel of longitude till it strikes the red river and this line of longitude shall be the eastern boundary of mew

trade mr phelps one of the committee acid he did not agree with the committee except on the conclusion to be drawn from the resolutieaeel annexation of texas mr maaeo one of the committee said that he was so unlortnette to differ from ihfe committee upon nearly all questions reported upon hyju mr cooper ne agreed with the committee upon several points but differed on several particularly with the reasons and argument ol the roport mr downs one of the committee expensed his dissent from tbe report en all grounds particularly upon admitting california with her present boundary mr berrien one of the committee differed from the report of the committee on nearly all the points he could not consent to admitting california with her present boundaries or with two representatives in the house of representatives mr mangura one of tin committee said he differed from the result of committee on the number of inhabitants tobe admitted and that there was an mmpera tive necessity for a state government he denied all these assumed factsot despatch is obscure here but we beliete tbs is its meaning mr clay denied the justice of pounci on a report before its contents were know perfectly mt foote said he would support he report of the committee if it conmintd anything more than mr clays resolution and they bad been condemned long age he should not support it mr borland opposed the whole affair mr hale hoped the south would mind firm in its opposition but he was very much afraid the opposition was s mere feint mr houston advocated the motion to print was in favor of compromise and unioo and wanted to read the report before he madr up his mind mr cass said that the report shoum he examined before it was condemned he would support it as a whole measure mr dickinson said that he was in fr ir of printing the report as a whole measui i the matter had his hearty concurrence hi had resented to the report though the reas sing was not his own he had consented ttthe conclusions of tbe report to which the committee had arrived though he would have irawn the reasoning differently he bould lupport the bills reported because of the cir tumsiancea while we was free to adml they were very different from what he would have irawn himself mr jefferson davis said he was willing he report should be printed but he was pre tared to vote against it mr bright said he would support the neasure as s whole but if it could uoi be tarried he would go for the admission of cal foinia at the earliest moment the bill aud report were then ordered te ie printed and the senate adj house of representatives washington may mr wilmot fiee soil of pennsylvania asked that the committee take up the cuifor uia message to enable him to make some re marks by the unanimous consent of the house the census bill was laid aside californiaspeech of mr wilmot the members crowd around the ganlhmao and the confusion which prevails suiudes into respectful attention mr vv ilmut said that the debate in the subject of the admission of california and questions connected with it had illhs judgement produced wonderful results sthe settled and fixed purpose of the soupern men have been disclosed there wasfcow no ioohn for doubt as to the termination of the conflict it was to extend slaverytver the territories if there was any rood for doubt hetetofore these was doubt no loiter there was no question more fraughtwitb consequences than the ultimate deciei of that now in hand and which is to defenne the character and position of the sou tern portion of the country it will settle anchor questionnamely whether the government is to be administered in this which rave it birth or whether an aristocracy bases on slave property and slave representation i mil control it in this aspect it has been vit redby the south on the part of southern len bordering almost on madness they ire bound by no sacred ties to the union but ire banded together as one man for the ac m plishment of their object and that is the rr petuation of slavery there is no disgi ie the existence of the union and the stab ty of the government is threatened by the so hin his judgement their spirit of thfesiedhg and defiance must be resisted or he nspth are ret test of slaves what beaded shall the line of our duty be prescribed idder the pressure of treasonable threats stall we be told what we shall or shall not do at the peril of the existence of the governaent itselt if we submit to this any longer eur freedom here and the fuudamental principles of the constitution are undermined the rights of the majority must be respectedor we are the vilest of slaves these gende men not only assume to interpret the comti tution for us but to dictate our line ofrftnw congress may admit new states is clear and unequivocal language of the constitution and yet we are told if we prmmke to exercise this clear and admitted power without making certain concessions to slavery measuies of a revolutionary chmettr will be resorted to and the ordinary satfhbs of government w ithheld and the ye and naya called in defiance of parliamentary law and usage until the end of the present sakn of congress is this the position in sfiieh freemen must e placed or as sis vet be taught their duties and obligations shall the acknowledge power of this government be exercised or shall a band of oonapfetow set it at defiance on the question of cku iornia this defiance is hurled in our tseth he had made up his mind not to obey it sounds like the crack of the whip he who submits is better fitted for the plantation thsn for service in this hall a voice tbate true what is not this aristocracy of slaveholdets content with their share of power under the constitution without daiming absolute control of the government whti is more arbitrary and improper than to sk the existence ot this government depend on the scquiesoence in the behests of a minority the south say that there is no power w pass the provisothe north think th ire is the latter find their opinions fortified we believe under god that it it our duty to paaa a prohibition against slavery and yet we are told if we dare to do the government mast be overthrown the power to yule should be given to the minority mus would be s dee the fleet slatedhbmt of south cue oliiut mx calhoun scorned all inspection ho marched up to the object and t opened amendments to th constitution to puce the government in the hands of a minority the i object could be seen and understood demands are now made upon ua more objectionable if the great fundamental principles are to he subverted let it be put down in writing let our masters print it in the constitution is this the tenure by which we bold our libeities and is the government to be preserved by submitting to certain interpretations of gentlemen who strive to fotoc them on us i want to see whether the freemen of the north will dare to stand up to a conscientious discharge of their duty and whether this position of the south is to drive mss form a position deliberately assumed whatever may be tbe fact now time wa when the north were united on thisqueaion when we assembled in december last i believed there were not five individuals who were in favor of mixing up california with other questions there was then but one sentiment at the north its admission was demanded by an unanimous voice here the north were to take a firm stand and were not to be driven from it by threats nor seduced by promises how stands the matter today god only knows but if the declaration of the south can be relied on the friends of california are in a minority she is to be eoapunuaed and the terms of her admission is the extension cf slavery over the territories i trust in god this will not be done if the north prove recreant on this question where tm me ask do they propose to make manful lesislmee against the threats and the exorbitant demands of the slave power the outposts of the north are all abandoned and we are called upon to make an unconditional surrender they arc lnu off by threats and political preferment the ranks are di videduie forces broken until there is danger of general rout the alltea of alavery at the north all at once discovered that the agitation was premature and abandonad their attachment to freedom and the proviso he referred to the change of position on the part of gertlemen among them to mr broadhead of pennsylvania not now incongress who was now a travelling missionary in the cause of the sooth he said that the dodge was not original with mr webster and he did not think it fair in massachusetts to run sway with all the new inventions mr mcclernand dem of illinois asked whether mr broadhead ever voted for the proviso mr wilmothe did not mr mcclernandbut often voted against it mr wilmotwhen the proviso was offered broadhead went homepennsylvania was then united all the pennsylvania delegation voted for it except broadhead and liigersoll who were not heie he referred to the proviso offered to the uvo million bill in mr stephens whig of georgiadid not mr broadhead vote for the missouri compromise as applicable to the tetritories mr wilmotl have not referred to the votes i predicated my remarks on speeches made in this hail the progress in this defection was gradual the south told then allies that they must wear the cloak no longer the presidential election came on the south with characteristic arrogance said they would support no man who gave the least countenance to the proviso every othei party consideration sunk in insignificance they made the candidate of tbe northwest speak and put words into his mouth in the shape of the nicholson letter this was the first time any man assumed the ground that the proviso was unconatitution al a v oicemr dallas assumes that ground mr wilmotlf so it has escaped my recollection we hear much said about aggression by the north i charge hat the south tempt our men beyond their strength they lead them to a high mountaia and show them the principalities and powers of the world and they fall down and worship this is aggression of the deepest dye hethen insisted that slavery was aristocratic and that the press was under the tyranny ol of the elevehoklora notwithstanding ihe present state of things the men are now being born who are to wreet the government frotq the control of the south and fulfil the high destiny of democracy he was a friend of party orga nation and would asfiimly resist slavery as he had heretofore monopolies he would follow no organization based on slavery extension he insisted that the soil of the territories if we are to believe the ac counte of it can support slavery and southern men had declared that they would take their slaves thither further remarks were made by him mr winthrop whig of massachusetts obtained the floor the chairman said he would be entitled to the floor when the presidents message should again be taken up  the new york heraldiwe slated ina former article that the inititulion of tha south had no advooates north of mason and dixons line but ibis remark bhould be qualified for though the new york herald is not an advocate of dur sieve institution yet that fearless and able journal has ever stood forth as ths defender of the south againet the violence and injustice of the north and in this respect the hered has taken aud maintains a position that no other journal at tbe north has dared to assume or probably could have assumed without being crushed by the overwhelmicg public opinion of the country but the herald always received a larger share of its support at the south than any other northern paper and in this crisis it is but justice that its pstronage should be etill more widely extended amongst usgalves ton texas news circumstantial evidence bt mbs bell smith on saturday afternoon some years since about the barroom of tbe only publichouae in the little tillage of s on lake erie were gathered a number of gossiping idlers seafaring men and farmers although early in the afternoon the heary clouds of an approaching storm so darkened the shore that candles were ik and in their dim light the gathered crowd listened to the beating of the wares upon the beach and the distant roll of thunder that announced the coming strife it is one of those scenes that occur when a mighty tempest come down on eries inland sea and the dullest seemed struck with its impressive grandeur sailors drank from their poisoned cups with less noise and the village politicians were less absorbed in the presidential electionone of the number seemed more uneasy than the rest a young man of mild prepossessing appearance with a rifle in his hand a powder horn slung over his shoulder for he bad bat a few minutes before come i fro gmattiag paced to and from tbe door looked at the troubled bay and cloudy sky and frequently asked an old captain of a schooner when he would be able to sailto night tonight

with the dogged air of one who makes up his mind to be content with a positive evil m w had been in s but a few weeks and although a stranger had impressed its inhabitants favorablyso quiet retiring and as all thought kind was he in manner and disposition the business that brought him to the place was by no means settled and the intelligence he had received must have been of a very pressing nature to make one naturally so timid anxious to brave a storm that caused the hardiest sailor to shrink from duty he had been sitting with a look of gleomy discontent but a short time wheu the clatter of horses feet were beard in the street and a man pale and trembling stood within the doorway his first discordant utterance was the word murder no expression of pain or terror can send the

preacher it was a time when the gathered feeling checked by some great obstacle pauses in its rash career and for a moment there seems a doubt which way the tide will flow the awful passage so solemnly quoted fell on the crowd at that moment when the slightest word wouldhave turned them from their purpose and stimulated as it seemed to them by a command from heaven they once more seized their trembling captive when the old captain whom w had importnded for a passage claimed to be heard comrades said he squire b thinks we hadnt ought to hang this fellow well ill tell you what well do he wanted to sail with me this day he shall do so well take him outside the baylie him in an open boat and set him adrill then the lord have mercy on him what say your a shout of approbation was the response and they hurried w to the shore in the meanwhile the storm grew joud and when in the dark night their torches beaten out by wind and rain the great crowd heard the angry waves dashing over the rude pier their courage failed and seven only were found ready for the enterprize clambering upon the deck with their victim in their midst the cables were cut and the little bark like a frightened bird flew out to sea perhaps no scene ever painted itsell on the canvas of real life so startling wiled and strang as this while the stouthearted skipper steered the bark the convict assisted by four of hit companions tied w to the open boat and the preacher kneeling upon the deck was beard between the pauses of the thunder far above wavei and wind calling upon heaven to blesi their unholy act the open lake was gained and the wretched man regardless of his entreaties and screams was given to the foaming waters in a glare of lightning that was followed by a deafening peal of thunder they saw their victiir rise upon a huge wave then plunge into darkness and death beyond short time had tc dwell upas the ruthless deed then lives were in jeopardy a qjortn sc violent has seldom been equalled and the little craft wai worked save skipper by unskillful hands desperate efforts were made to regain the bay but the entrance was narrow and intricate while commands grossly misunderstood were promptly executed so that the bark run upon a ledge ol rocks and quickly went to pieces two only of its strange crew were saved the clergyman and the convict together reached the shore some tnree after these strange events the rev h was awafcn one night by a request to come immediately and administer religious consolation to a prisoner who in attempting an escape from jail had

village of s grew toa city jdany of its old citizens had emigrated or were dead and among the remaining the events i have narrated had faded almost into an uncertain legend when one sunny afternoon an elderly gentleman of staid respectable appearance accompaniec by his wife and children made his wa from the evening steamer to one of the principal hotels alter securing rooms be walked into the streets he earnestly scanned the sight as he passed he stopped before one that reac attorneyatlaw he paused anc thee with a start as if the determination had a spice oi the desperate in it he ascended the stairs and entered the office an eldprly man with a bale head and wrinkled face was seated aia table surround ty books and papers inviting the new comer to be seated he peered at him through bis spectacles and inquired his business mr byou do not remembei lie i cannot say that i do answerec the attorney slowly as if in doubt do you not remember pleading ir behalf of a poor fellow about being linched for a murder some thirty yean siace w exclaimed the lawyer joy fully can it be possible i lever forget a face and yours i saw ini frame work that night that ough to impress it upon my memory forever bi thought you dead years ago si downsit down and tell me all after i was thrown irom the vesse that night said w seating him selfl was so frightened tbat for sometime i had no consciousnes of wha occured on becoming more collected i found my little boat half filled witl water riding the short heavy waves and every second i expected to go under or be capsized and so drown this not occurring i began to l about me i found the cord by whicl i was tied passed over my shoulder j managed to get it in my mouth ant soon gnawed it apart this loosenec my bands so that in a few minutes j freed myself and sat up with an ole cup that i found in the boat i balec out the water and then breaking up one of the seats i managed the little affair so as to ship no more of the waves and in this way rode out the storm and the night by morning the wind had somewhat subsided but so exhausted was i by fear and fatigue that i was forced to lie downand soon was sound alseep when i awakened the sun was setting and ts far i as could see on every side wars dreary waste of waters strange as it may sound i was greatly relieved i feared nothing so much as falling agate into the hands of that terrible mob the full moon came out making the scene light almost as day and a gentle breeze springing up took my coat fastened it on the broken seat and with this for a sail dirifted near as cquld make out by the stars in a northeasterly direction i knew soontr or later i must strike the canada shore but how far i had been carried in the storm i could not of course determinethrough that long night i floated on i saw the moon go dowf and the stars fade into the cold gray light of morningand then the sun cams up with the clear calm day but no land could be seennothing but water i imagined atone lime seeing in the dim distance a tail but if one it immediately disappeared about noon i noticed something floating near me and on paddling my boat alongside found it a bale of goods carefully corded together i fastened it almost without motitre to my boat and again lying down was soon asleep i was awakened by shout and starting up found i was running in close to a wooded bore and a number of men staring in vooder at my appearance in answer to my request one of them waded in and pulled my boat to the land i learned to rov great relief that i reached the canada side within a few miles of it was supposed that i had been shipwrecked to which my bale of goods at once gave coloring and a kind reception on opening this bale asxt day found it filled with costly silks and velvets and so admirably packed that water had not damaged them thia had probably been tost from a reck during the late stormand noticing the address with intention of repayment some day i sold the contents and with the proceeds mads my way to new york where i after hearing of ny mothers death joined an expedition fitting out for in south america in thia now home i married and engaged in merchandise there i lived antil i learned a few mouths since my innocence of that cruel deed had been known by the confession oi the real criminal when ho had finished recounting his strange escape the lower rising abruptly naught him by the arm and pomteiftto the open window the looked and saw a gaunt figure with sunken eyes pals cheeks long gray hair ip the gloom ofths evening more silently along that said the lawyer ia mr since that night of the criminals confession his intellect nerer very strong has been a complete wreck every evening he wanders to the lf stormy no entreaties can induce him to seek a shelter but hour after hour he paces the shore as if every moment he expected some revelation from its troubled waters
