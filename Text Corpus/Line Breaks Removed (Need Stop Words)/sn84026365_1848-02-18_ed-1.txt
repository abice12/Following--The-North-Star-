sixteenth annual meeting of tiie massachusetts antislavery society the annual meeting commenced in boston on wednesday morning jan th at the melodeon the chair was taken by francis jackson president of the society at ten and a half a m and it w as voted that the society do now proceed to business opportunity for prayer being given prayer was offered by john m spear voted that samuel may jr and anne w weston be assistant secretaries during the annual meeting henry c wfight from the committee on business reported the follow lowing resolutions resolved that while we deeply regret that the slave power should have been able to find one of its most willing and useful tools in the pilgrim blood of massachusetts we must still recognize one virtue in robert c w inthrop that unlike his fellow whigs he has never been a hypocrite in politics he has never pretended to own himself or claimed to be anything but the mouthpiece of cotton whether in state street or at the capitol he cannot be accused of getting ollice like briggs under false pretences neither like the hon mr facingbothways did he signalize his youth by thunders against slavery on plymouth rock and then with the fame of many years upon his brow say his prayers backward before the capitol at richmond on the contrary we are hound to allow that he has glways gloried in being a doughface from the beginningat honfr and abroad in every sphere however bounded i nnd be the shame more or less that lie has not sought for his bargain the decent cover of secrecy but his prostitution has been open in the marketplace and ne has worn its w ages inso jcuiu aud without shame that to guard against suspicion of hypocrisy evt u ia p cripture he took can to pul fiiul record beforehand in fmt nil la a pledge t remind the world that ii fiis ease at least there were many things beside the lord which make men to be of one mind in a house  resolved that our deep regret to find such a character linked w ith the name of winthrop is forgotten in the sad reflection thatlike wax beneath the seal he is but what the schools and churches of boston have made him the faithful representative of the opinions of his native city and that could we succeed in changing those opinions the weathercocks upon our steeples would be laggards compared with him in shifting with the wind resolved that the reelection of geo n briggs to office with all the sins of hi peijured and treasonable proclamation places massachusetts among the active supporters of the mexican war that not all the resolutions wtpch even her legislature has passed the north star or can pa l arc able to bide that fact and that if geo n briggs has as hi friends claim repented of that disgraceful act he should he as ready to make as public proclamation of his repentance as he was of his servility and not leave hia friends to sacrifice character in supporting one eonvieled of treason out of his own mouth with nothing to justify their confidence but chimneycorner confessions whereas the boast of the people of these united states is that they are the freest people on earth while they hold and use onesixth of their fellow countrymen as rlem that they are an enlightened people while they punish as heavy crime the acquisition of knowl edg jmrokp three millions of their number that they arc a civilized people while onesixth of the inhabitants are compelled by law to live in absolute heathenigm that the blessings of liberty and free institutions arc extended to all while three millions of their number are outlawed and hunted with bloodhounds and rifles for attempting to raise themselves fivim the com n of brutes to that of men fi a the condition of slaves to that of freemen therefore  resolved that this misnamed republic is a wilful liar and a shamelfst hypocrite against which the friends of freedom in great britain and throughout the world ought to he warned as against the deadliest cnerny of the human race wednesday afternoon william w brown who came for ard he raid by request to com wment upon a letter received by e quincy from enoch price of st louis missouri and which letter he mrbrown had now for the first time seen tho writer of it declared himself the owner of win w brown said lie had seen aud read the narrative which w w b has lately published and which he admitted to he true in the main and after setting forth several particulars as to the manner in which he became possessed of w w brown then known by another name offered to give him free papers if he or his friends would pay to his ogent in boston the sum of three hundred and twentyfive dollars mr brown said i have always felt that i run a great risk in passing around here as i do in massachusetts and now i am more thanever sensible of the risk i run for at an unguarded moment i may be seized upon even here and dragged back to slavery in st louis mr brown spoke with evident agitation the audience expressed great sympathy with him and by loud responses testified that there were many who would stand forth in his defence tn any time of danger wednesday evening the society assembled in fancuil hall according to adjournment the president in the chair resolutions i and were again read by the secretary and the large audience present was eloquently addressed in thtfir support by edmund quincy wendell phillips h c wright win w brown and stephens foster h c wright offered the follow ing resolutions  resolved that while this republic exists in its present form as a republic that sanctions slavery there car be no reasonable hope that the miseries and oppressions inflicted upon the masses by the despotisms of europe can be removed inasmuch as the might of its example goes to strengthen the hands of tyrants and to weaken those of the champions of freedom therefore we would earnestly entreat all whe arc laboring for the freedom of inan ir great britain and irelandin austria italy russia and in all landsto unite with us in our efforts to procure the dissolution of this slaveholding union by a moral and peaceful agitation ant thus to rid the world of this gigantic foe of liberty aud of the inalienable righl of manat

that while we would express our deep gratitude to all those earnest men aud women who find time and strengh amid their labors in behalf of british reform to study understand and protest against american slavery to give us their sympathy and aid by munificent contributions and by holding our union up to the contempt of europewe feel that it would not be invidious to mention william and mary howitt henry vincent and george thompson as those to whose unabating advocacy our cause is especially indebted in this country as well as for the hold it has gained upon the hearts of the british peoples resolved that the discriminating sense of justice the steadfast devotedness the generous munificence the untiring zeal the industry skill taste and genius with which british aboli i tionists have cooperated with us for the extinction of slavery commands alike our gratitude and admiration cheering us under the discouragements strengthening us under the difficulties and consoling us in the afflictions of the cause and shall ever be to us both an incentive and an example in its sacrifices and its labors remarks upon these resolutions were offered by s s foster w l garrison el quincy d

fancuil hall according to adjournment edmund quincy in the chair win l garrison chairman of business cormnitteo reported the following resolutions  resolved that the abolitionists ol america hail with pleasure the irmve meat of george thompson and his faithful coadjutors for the encouragement of the culture of cotton in british india in order to supply he demand of that staple in the british manufactures instead of importing their cotton as at present from the slave states of this country believing as we do that the success of his object will materially forward the antislavery enterprise resolved that henry chtf oi kentucky in hh hie speech at tho aa naal mealing of the aaaertcaa coloni rochester n y friday february that this country is only for the white and not fir the black man that the free colored nativeborn inhabitants cannot and ought not to be admitted to equal rights and cquajld in the united states hut should troddm down as to render existence intolerable here and banishment tojyfriea a desirable alter nativedcingnprably proves that he is the deadly mo impartial libertythat his pretensions to philanthropy are hol loar mockeries and that the colonization seciety of which he is the president is the the slaveholding villajiyspf tnvsouth and of the proslavery ruffianhm of the north resolved taat this society strongly syiapa bifces with the people of ireland and the lovers of progress throughout the world in the deep sense they entertain of the services of daniel oconnell as a champi n of human freedom and especially as a friend of the african slave that we gratefully recognize tiie faithfulness of lus emphatic testimony against american slavery of his indignant rebuke of american slavehold rs and of his cordial cooperation with american abolitionists and that wc regard w ith profound sensibility the event of his death which has occurred during the last year as one in which wc have a common interest with them and with the whole human race resolved that it becomes us on this our first meeting since the venerable presence of seth sprague has passed away from our assembly and from the earth to recall to mind the clearness of vision the purity of purpose the fidelity of principle the freshness of enthusiasm which this antislavery patriarch the connecting link between the elder and the latter dispensations of liberty brought to the assistance of the slave and to resolve that we will show w hat reverence and love we bear to his memory by the earnestness of our endeavors to live worthily of las example  resolved that while ve are willing to believe that many supporters of the wilmot proviso rcallv consider its passage sufficient to prevent the extension of slavery and while we rejoice at every such dibit as evidence of awakening interest on the subject of slavery and tending ever in its very failure to throw light cn the path through which alone safety can be found still we regard it as a matter of comparative indifference whether receives the sanction of coftfgjrass or not feeling that the attempt to restrain slavery by laws and imprecisely equivalento damming up the mississippi with bullrushes and the man who expects anything but failure from such a plan has still the abc of his countrys history to learn resolved that an instrument which binds those who svcar to support it to commit crimes of the blackest hue and sins of the most tremendous magnitude is one that cannot be intelligently sanctioned or executed without aggravated guilt and ought to be rejected with indignation and horror that such an instrument is the constitution of the united states which pledges the whole j physical force of the nation to keep securely in their chains three millions ol slaves makes the entire national domains slavehunting ground and pro j vidcs for a slaveholding diarchy incomparably more despotic than any or der of nobility ever existing in any age j of the world resolved that this is not a question that can he postponed or eva i ded by any plea of policy or necessity by the assertion that the powers that be are ordained of god by the ex cusethat there must be a government by any disastrous consequences that may be predicted to trade or property it is a question cf humanitya question of morals involving the highest responsibilities and relating to our obedience to god and cur duties to each other the meeting was addressed on the different subjects embraced in these resolutions by dr grandin of boston wm l garrison wendell phillips andi henry c wright nahum osgood of salisbury a member of the liberty party then asked leave to take the platform which was grauted and he addressed the meeting in defence of the rofiiinatien of john ip hale by the liberty party he was much cheered by a delegation of his party which had just conic from a meeting which had been addressed by mr hale wendell phillips again took the floor in reply to mr osg f d who afwwards rejoined and was then followed by ss foster in a most searching exposition of the nurrown ss and iiliberaiity of the nocafled liberty party the resolutions which had been under discussion during the evening were then taken up terudiut aud adopted i tho following resolutions were prepared for preeniatien to the meeting but were accidentally mislaid and nu i found until after the final adjournment j undoubtedly if offered they would have been adopted vrth great unanimity resolved that we receive with deep j gratitude the address of tbrty thousand scottish women to the women of america on the subject of slavery sensible of the vast amount of devoted labor requisite to embody so imposing a testimonyof the striking example it sets us to use with scrupulous fidelity all the means in oor power lor the imanci pation of the slave and the rebuke give ta one lagg l ze j untiring j iutayest of these noble women in the welfare of a race whom they hare nerei seen resolved that we recognize with iuiiiji ilwfisfiirit mf hie sagacity of oni oiilorri friend in this city lad their correct appreciation of their own position and the welfare of the slave in refusing to be made the tools of the liberty party on a late occasion i resolved that we deplore the con tinned degradation of our national t character and purpose which find then iincet and most welcome representative and candidate for the nations highest i office in that bloodhound of the texan war zachary taylor j resolved that while we accord tc j p hale full honor for his magnanimous opposition to texan annexation and the further extension of slavery and would not abate one tlt e due j him for his manly copra in that mat i ter wc feel bound to point out to those abolitionists whom the plausible professions of the late liberty party have in times past been able to delude the utter recreancy to antislavery character of a set of men who with the claims of being aa abolition party continually on their lips hold up for their presiden i tial candidate a man who has never been willing to be known as an abolitionist aud whose principles on the subject no one ha yet thought it worth while to find out and call upon them to mark i that the event we have always prophesied has come to pass namely that the party has bartered its profession for votes and sacriiicd the only principle it ever claimed to have to the availability of its candidate resolved that we rejoice in the firmness of purpose integrity and sincere devotion to his idea of antislacrv duty manifested by john g palfrey in refusing to put into the speakers chair one whose course had been sedulously meddled to suit the slaveholders resolved that the choice of robert c winthrop for speaker of the u shouse of representatives was a grave insult to the people of this commonwealth that under the guise of respect for new england his election was the triumph of south carolina cunningly seizing as a tool for her own purpose a man xvhose only title to preferment was treason o his birthplace and whose only characteristic is unbounded servility to the insolent assumptions of the basest diarchy that ever crept into power resolvcd that w hile we are rejoiced to perceive as indicative of the change which is taking place in public sentiment a growing religious sympathy with the antislavery movement we are still under the necessity of proclaiming the deplorable fact that the great body of the american clergy and churches are giving aid and comfort to the southern traffickers in human flesh either by direct participancy in slavery by religious fellowship with those who enslave their fellowmen by using the pulpit an press as potent weapons with which to assail abolitionists by silence and indifference or by treating the question of emancipation as foreign tc their callinga fact which proves their claims as the true embodiment and gen nine representatives of christianity tc be utterly spurious j voted on motion of h c wright that the society do now adjourn sine die francis

outrages iuliictcd upon hcrseli through her colored sailors in entering into the federal compact she gave up her right to avenge them by tbree agreeing to submit any disputes that might arise between herself and her sister states to the arbitrament of the supreme court pursuant to this agreement she sent an agent to present himself in the j courts of south carolina for the purpose of having the

before christ and that the nincteentl century alter christ they run for tin same goal though slavery started firs and had the smoother road it is safi to say that the machinery of the free states has greater productive ability than the bond i of tht south while slavery continues the machinery will n t appear steamen gine and slaves come of a different stock the foreign trade of the south consists mainly in the export of the productions of the farm and the forest the domestic trade in collecting those staples and distributing the articles to be consumed at home much of the domestic trade is in the hands of northern menthough mainly with southern principles the foreign trade is aim st wholly in the hands of foreigners or men from the north and is conducted by their ships in the south little is demanded for home consumption so the great staples of southern production find their market chiefly in the north or in foreign ports the shipping is mainly owned by the north of the atlantic states seven have no slaves maine new hampshire massachusetts rhode island connecticut new york and new jersey in they with pennsylvania had tons of shipping in all the slave states which he on the seaboard there are owned but tons of shipping in the young state of ohio two thousand miles from the sea had tons the state of south carolina  even virginia full of bays and harbors hud but tons the single district of the city of new york had tons or more that nil the southern states united e the difference in the internal improve nients of the two sections is quite as remarkable in general the public highways in the slaveholdiug states arc far inferior to those of tile north botli in extent and character if the estimates made arc correct in there were omitting the fractions miles of railroad actually in operatior in the united states in all the slave states there were miles taking the cost of such as are described ii trustworthy sources and estimating the value of those not so described by tin general cost per mile of railroads in tin same state then the slave states have invested in this property in the free states there were miles of railroad which had cost  thus the free states have miles of railroad more than the south the value of which is  above the value of all the railroads of the slave states the railroads in pennsylvania have cost within less than a half a million of the value of all the railroads ia all the slave states maryland from her position resembles the free suites in many respects besides those of this state all the railroads of the south are worth only while those ol massachusetts alone have cost  and are now on the average five or six per cent above par the state of south carolina has only paid for her raiiroad stock will not undertake to estimate its present value nor need i stop to enquire how many miles of the southern road have been planned by northern skill paid for by the capital of the free states and are owned by their citizens let us

aggregate real property of the eight slave states was of the eight free in by the above ratios the real estate of the southern states would be worth and that of the northern thus the real property of these eight free states would be almost three times more valuable than the eight slave states yet the free contain hut square miles while the slave states contain rut this in part is a matter of calculation only and liable to some uncertainty as the ratio of virginia and new york may not represent the increase of any either south or north let us come to public and notorious facta in ikk the value of all the annual agricultural products of the south as valued by the last census was  that of the free states  yet in the south there were persons engaged in agriculture and in the north only ami the south has the advantage of raising tropical productions which cannot be grown in europe the agricultural products ofthc south which find their way to foreign lands are mainly cotton sugar rice and tobacco the entire value of these articles raised in the fifteen slave states in that year was  while the agricultural productions of the single state of new york amounted in that year to the

earnings of all the slave states ivas  of the free the annual earnings of six slave states north carolina south carolina georgia alabama mississippi and louisiana amount to those of the state of new

including the school fund was leaving the actual indebtedness above their stateproperty only the absolute debt of the slave states was their productive stateproperty including their school funds leaving their actual indebtedness above their stateproperty more than twice the corresponding indebtedness of the north besides this it must be remembered that in the free states there are b men engaged in the learned professions while in the slavi states there arc bul in addition to that in all the free states there are many employed in teaching common schools thus in in massachusetts there were  engaged in the common schools in the slave states this class is much smaller still more in all the free states there are many not ranked in the learned professions who devote themselves to science literature and the fine arts in the south but few in the south the female slaves are occupied in hard fieldlabor which is almost unheard of in the free states tims the difference in the

hartford ct the charter oak of lasi week contains a full statement of s cowardly mobocratic assault upon the printing office of that paper togethei with the editors house by a gang o some three hundred ruffians who evidently intended to do serious injury t person and property as their revenge upon the editor for some bitter anc stinging truths which he had told them of our national land piracies upon mexico and of the robber hordes which art actively perpetrating them for two hours iu the middle of the night the enraged mob were howling about his dwelling and office am kuring out their curses and threats but the city police attempted no arrest though they were present much of the time the mayor harangued the lawless crowd advising them to disperse which they did after having the charter oak sign and dashed ir the panels of the doors of both the lioust and printing office further then that they did not venture as they were in formed that they would be met from within by resistance which they probably were not expecting the immediate pretext for this dast nrdly outrage was an article in thf charter oak severely commenting upon the reception given by the wai patriots of hartford to a petty officei j of the army who had recently returned from mexico w ere it true as wa alleged that this article was personal insulting to that bloodstained fighter the plea would not

summing up of the whole matter bfj the antislavery standard refciringto a letter received at their office as pertinent to our own case this is the three hundred and sixtyfifth specimen of the kind received every day forj j the last three hundred and sixtyfire days and j wo presume that there is not a newspaper publislier in the city that could not produce his daily letter or letters of the same sort j our correspondent has the good sense to f believe the fault is not in this office we wish all our subscribers were equally considerate the blame most frequently is imputed lo us lt us show how little probability there is of this being just the name of each subscriber whose paper goes in a single wrapper that is by itselfand tjic names of post offices w here more than one paper goes are all j transcribed carefully and systematically from the mail books to their proper wrappers j during days and hours set apart for this particular duty before the paper goes to press when the paper cotnes from the press and is folded the single wrappers are pasted each upon a single paper and a clerk with the mail book before him transcribes upon the margin of the paper the names of subscribers at postoffices where more than one paper is sent these are folded on tle spot in the wrap i pers addressed to their respective post offices j and pasted at once it is evident that a mistake in our office in the mailing of papers must be a rare thing a clerk with even ordinary habits of care and order must be almost uniformly correct the name of a subscriber or a post office may occasionally be omitted but it must he accidental and is not likely to occur two weeks in j succession iu the same case we are confident that in our office it is of very rare occur renee it cannot at all events account for the frequent miscarriages of which we receive such very frequent complaints our answer to this correspondent is an answer to all our subscribers who are annoyed as much to our chagrin we assure them as to theirs in the same way his paper goes in a package with the rest to his post office and if it is not received so often as the others it must be because some person about the post office docs not choose that he shall have it it is by no means an uncommon thing fora postmasior or a postmasters clerk to take upon himself the direction of the reading of a whole village the north star rochester february id after an absence of two weeks during which i have attended and addressed numerous meetings held several private interviews with old and tried friends obtained a number of subscribers for

give them my assurance that i am one with them even unto the end f d the piiilometiiean society on friday evening last we had the privilege to attend a meeting of this useful society of colored persons in albany in the present j proscribed and isolated condition of our peo plesuch institutions seem almost indispensible to our social happiness progress and elevation we however think that they should always lie regarded as temporary institutions forced upon us by the unjust aud wicked prejudice which excludes us from the like institutions among the whites and ready to be given up whenever a sense of justice and liberality shall assert its dominion in the ame j ricun mind the question which engaged the attention of the society and which was quite fully discussed on this evening related to the subject of colonization a young man from liberia now a student at the medical college in albany submitted a resolution aft firming it to be the duty of the free colored people of tills country to emigrate to liberia as the only means of elevating them among the nations of the earth he said that he hoped all prejudice would be discarded and that the society would discuss the subject with the calmness and seriousness which it importance demanded he also hoped that no reference should be made to the conduct of the american colonization society as hei humbly conceived that the good or bad actions of that society had nothing to do with the question before the meeting tbe principal argument urged in support of the resolution was the invincibility of prejudice against the colored people in this country and the duty of our civilizing and evangelizing africa he said that colonization is slw ays the precursor of civilization and that without it africa must continue in ber pieeent barbarous ondition he urged that an individual was expected according to the merits or demerits if the nation to which he belonged and that while africa was uncivilized it was utterly ibsurd to suppose that her children would br espeeted among mankind these view were enforced with much apparent earnest teas and made quite an impression on the udieorc in reply it was urged by messrs popp cutler aad others that prejudice war tot invincible that the condition of the free cloved people in this land was steadily im woving and that thus far colon nation had mly served to retard the progress of this roprovement that it had fostered aad strengthened prejudice by declaring it to be evincible that individual emigration might e very wed but that any general movement n that direction

speech of mr palfrey and thank god with us that sunken and slaverysmitten as the land has become the voice of truth and freedom may yet be heard in the councils of the nation wc are glad to see this speech going the rounds of the press and being regarded with such high interest by persons of all political opinions we hail it as the beginning of a political crisis which must soon give the falling blow to the slave power of the laud or result in the severance of this most unhallowed union god speed the flay ir fitly to mb collins lt is a sufficient answer to the letter of this gentleman which may be found among the correspondence copied from the springfield papers to say that he is at this moment laboring to build up a colored church in that town and that his j reason for building up such a church is that the white churches arc such respecters of persons and are so incurably and wickedly proslavery that the rights of colored members arc trampled upon and their feelings outraged by being stowed away like rubbish in the negro pew why such a man should defend such a church can only be explained by the wisdom which makes friends of the mammon uf unrighteousness at the expense of truth why does not mr collins find thoso good american churches of which he speaks who have not defiled their garments and invite colored persons to join them instead of building up at great expense and with injury to the cause of human equality a colored church in springfield it must either be because no such churches exist or that he seeks to raise hmself to a soft seat on the hacks of a few well disposed hardworking colored persons who arc already too poor to give their children a decent education when he shall cease calling upon colored persons tocome out from proslavery white churches to join his we shall regard him as beiug much more consistent and not less honest than he now shows himself to beer we make no pretensions to infill bility and are far from being too proud to listen to the counsel and advice of men devoted to the interests of our enslaved fellow j countrymen we therefore cheerfully insert the letter from mr middleton of springfield which will be found on our third page it is evidently written in a commendable spirit and designed to promote the cause of truth and freedom we hare but two objections to itthose are the vagueness of its charges and the indefinitcncss cf its advice it ia the j same old complaint of harsh language on the ione hand and exhortation to mildness on the other we have no doubt that the writer is sincerely grieved at what he thinks the existence of the one and the want of the other in our case but we roust say in all candor that if we ever reproach ourself for anything connected with our public efforts more than another it ia that we can deal so gently with the wicked slaveholders at the south and their guilty associates at the north and especially do wc feel our shortcomings when dealing with our manstealing ministry and our bloodstained church regarding them ns the bulwarks of slaveryaa justly chargeable with its continuance in the land and responsible for iu innumerable crimes and cruelties we would gladly concentrate the whole truth into ene living thunderbolt and hurl it at them till their bloodstained walls should be krrelkd to the ground the except too to our charges will take eare of

whether shielded by the statutes of despotism and tyranny covered by the sacerdotal garbs of a miserable and fabe religion or guarded by the point of the bayonet it must be a terror to the evil doers of our land and the beaconhope of the bond man the good people of this gloomy city have for the past two weeks had the cloud and darkness dispelled from their moral vision by the highly entertaining and edifying reform lectures and sermons of mr john allen a friend and brother from the old bay stats assisted several times by the heavenly and divinely chaunting tones of the eddy family from the same state who also have been entertaining the citizens with their almost inimitable music they are said to be not inferior to the hutchinson family mr allen though a hightoned land reformer takes the highest antislavery ground viewing theone as coessential with and inseparable from the other church robberies are of frequent occurrence in this place of the ninetysix churches in the two cities and

them there is a great religious revival at present going on among the colored people tinder rev thomas lawrence this is right and good taking the orthodox religious view of the subject but i could wish as i know you also do that the temporal of our people was asmuch cared for as the spiritual or in other v r ords we could wish that they possessed as much of the earthly as they do of the heavenly inheritance in view of the latter they relinquish or neglect entirely their right to the former this is one among the greatest errors with which reformers have to contend our brethren seem to be insensible to the fact that the wellbeing of man while upon earth is to god of as much importance as his wcllfarc in heaven man is superior to all earthly beings or tnings he having here but a temporal existence therefore his i temporal welfare should first be cared for there was held in this city in the lafayette assembly rooms on tuesday last a mass clay meeting of course to enter into

chain offered up their jives fortunes and honors upon the altar cl liberty to prevent similar results from the operation of the minds of slaves laws are enacted in southern states making it penal to teach slaves to read the name of the god that made them in several of these states the death penalty is inflicted for the second offence ol teaching slaves ii sabbath schools what think you pious sabbath schoolteachers of the north many of whom gather around your colored youth to teach them the ways of salvation that if you should commence your labor of love in the christian city of new orleans the gallows would be your reward and this in the land of liberty bibles and missionaries why this filtering of the mind this interdiction of sabbath schools this spreading the veil of mental darkness but to enable the ruthless inanstcabr to fetter the body and restrain it from bursting ifs chain yet we hear much about religious instruction of slaves of revivals on plantations at the south but is this the religion of christ that teaches man to glorify god by discharging his duty to ins fellow man that places the word of god w ithin his reach and enables him to worship his creator intelligently or is it a religion of superstition and idolatry that teaches the victim of oppression to look up to his oppressor as gods own agent and his commands as the commands of high heaven bishop meade in lus published sermons to he used in the promulgation of this same religious instruction among slaves says that faults against their masters are faults against god who hath set their masters and mistresses over them in his own stead and expects them to do ail tferwce fur them as they uouki for him and if as contcisusuf the revolting and blasphemous character of these assertions he furthermore says pray do not think that mean to deceive you when tell you that your masters and mistresses are gods overseers and if you are faulty towards them god himself w ill punish you severely for it page could blasphemy hypocrisy and impudence go further than this was there ever a clearer case of giving stone for bread a serpent for meat such are the idolatrous teachings of the south the system of slavery causes the enslaver to disregard the most sacred ties of our common humanity the effect of possessing irresponsible power is to render callous the heart and sour the milk of human kindness the great mistake that has obtained in the public mind is that kindness is the rule mid cruelty the exception w hereas cruelty is the rule and kindness the exception in the treatment of masters tow ards their slaves said the presbyterian synod of south srolina and georgia in a keport on slavery those only who have itte management of servants know what ihe hardening effect of it is upon their owr feelings toward them there is no necessity to dwell upon this point ai ai owners and managers fully understand it he who commences to manage them with tenderness and with a willingness to favor them in every way must he watchful otherwise he will settle down in indifference if notin severity said the late lamented general win harrison in a letter to general bolivar but trust me sir there is nothing more corruptingnothing more destructive of the finest and noblest feelings of our nature than th exorcise of unlimited power the man who in tin beginning of such a career might shudder at lie idea of taking the life of a fellow bung might soon have his conscience so seared tiy the repetition of crime that the agonies of his murdered victims might become music to his soul and the drippings ol the scaffold a third blood to swim in thcsr testimonies and the daily records of the south are sufficient proofs of the cruelties that tht slave is subject to property w only valuable in consideration of the right of the possessor to purchase w hen he has a demand and dispose of when he hasa surplus if there be a deficiency of male hands on one plantation arid a surplus on another they are transferred regardless of the uea of relationship ho of the other sex wt hrve seen this statement denied will our torrindcc give us the proof tip and of children thus severing husband from wife parent from child leaving the hearth desolate and the hut vacant the right of the fanner to pomeaa any kind of stock without the right to transfer when he has a surplus or to purchase when he has a demand would be a valueless if not a burdensome one now after a careful examination of the natural results of a cruel and unrelenting system of oppression i would ask if there can be an abuse of such a system can slavery exist eiccpt in name without the em bargau m of the rays of intellectual light ihe crushing and degradation of manhood the disregard of the most sacred and endearing ties of

to the beat of my knowledge about three jean g  most eon few that i have felt a secret joy ever since i first heard your name spoken of in connection with the north star tour position is of great prominence cod will call into action all the power energy and resources of your mind you are engaged in a no  ble work and wing a native of ute same state with yourself i moat sincerely wish you every success in ymrr new enterprise the i whole civiliaed world seem to have turned j their attention somewhat towards the suhjtt j of human rights therefore you will not be j entirely alone in your new undertaking i write very little and never for the public j press therefore i beg you will make a rea sonablc allowance for my w ild and unconnected manner of addressing you but to the subject on looking abroad over this land and reflecting on the impoverished condition of our unfortunate and disfranchised countrymen adan has occurred to me which if it is worthy of notice i beg you or some one elae will urge its claims after putting it into a favorable shape the plan i allude to is similar to those which are now in successful operation in canada this plan if it can be made to work would i feel quite sure have a tendency to better our condition in the point of wealth and consequently improve our condition in several important respects we are all too poor as a general thing and we must be awakened to every species of enter prise i shall here present you with a general view of the plan which is in its details about the same as tliat of the building societies in canada with the exception of a difference in the name and a slight difference in the object suppose for example a society is organized with shares of l and each shareholder is a member of the society the instalments on the shares are per month or fifty cents per week but more can be paid by any one who chooses these funds are let to members who may desire assistance in purchasing realestate and for the improvement of the same at ten per cent u year this would make it an object to those who would not wish to purchase if there should be any to invest their httc weekly savings at a good rate of interest let us for instance suppose there are members the monthly receipts of the society are ooo this sum could be divided between two onjoan of oo or less each if there are more than two applicants for a loan they draw for their chance of getting it the person who obtains it gives satisfactory personal security or otherwise that the funds are to be applied immediately in completing the purchase for which it was obtained and as soon as possible after the title shall have been made out and completed a mortgage shall be taken upon it naming the trustees of the society if nut incorporated in this way the society would have abundant security and the purchaser would be enabled to pay cash for his property at the lowest market prices the purchasers would then generally occupy their own premises and their next ambition would be to reduce their loan by paying into the society all they could monthly spare from the support of their families and all good wives would use every economy necessary to help their husbands payback the loan so as to own clear of all incumbrance their own premises the money paid to the society would be immediately relet to assist some other member of the society to do the like again c ci would now say to you to urge our people to push forward and make themselves owners of the soil this certainly can be brought about by using great persevering industry joined to the most rigid economy by making use of the above means no one need fear the result fur i tell you that all attempts to crush a whole people in their efforts to succeed in a good cause to cheek the favorable progress of things must fail these principles of human justice which have been put on foot must strengthen with the advancement of man and the progress of civilization butin the

you air express your sentiments on the subject of slavery and it is in reference to what fell from your lips on that occasion that i now venture to address you and in so doing although may intiuds somewhat upon your valuable time i hope that it may not prove altogether unprofitable that the subject of slavery is one of it not the most important that can possibly occu  py the public mind at the present time is to my view unquestionable and therefore i can readily conceive that to yous it must indeed be paramount therefore without adverting to the melancholy facts that make it so and which have provoked so just an indignation in your breast i shall without further preface or apology proceed to offer a few remarks andr which i sincerely hope may be received hv you in the same spirit of kindness as that iu which they arc dictated and here permit me to say that no spirit of controversy has suggested them for with this letter the matter rests but they have been made with a view rather to aid the cause of the oppressed than to retard it it has ever been a principle of belief with me that the most efficient advocacy of any cause is mainly if not wholly attributable to zeal tempered with discretion while isten tto your remarks and witnessing the glowing ardor which animated your features while describing the feelings of the injured and the miseries of the oppressed i felt a secret hope jthat those feelings of just indignation and that spirit of honest denunciation against the t foul wrongs of so many millions of the hu j man race might never slumber until the cruel fetters which bound the limbs of the last slave should be broken oft and the multitude ol wretched victims rise in one body from their loathsome darkness and despair to the glorious and refulgent light cf freedoms joyful day but my dear sir while occupied with these hopeful feelings i was much hurt to hear upon a question from one of the audi dience us to when and where the circumstan jees alluded to had taken place a most violenj i and vituperative attack upon the main body oi the ministers of the gospel imputing to them j motives most mean and dishonorable and which as a body upon sober reflection you i will i think feci if you do not admit it they do not deserve yet while there are many whose actions aic ill in accordance with the j doctrines of that blessed gospel which proclaims liberty to the captives and the opening jof the prison to those that are bound and whose conduct is a reproach to the cause ol their master yet i trust there are unmbers to be found whose characters are unimpeachable and whose whole lives have been devoted to the good of mankind and who are ever found foremost in redressing the grievances ol the wronged and firmly and faithfully advocating the liberty of the captive and the cause ol the oppressed it is then to the unconditional and sweeping censure together w ith the contemptuous ridicule which you cast upon them as a body that i advert as likely to do the cause an irreparable injury for you well know sir that in almost all public meetings there are bul too many who exult in a reproach brought upon the ministers of religion and are thereby led to treat its sacred cause w ith scoffing and contempt and who are they generally arc they the individuals whom you expect to sympathize in the siffterings of the poor slave oi aid him in gaining his freedom i think tliey do not but let the answer as to who they are who both feel and do most be fouod iu the donations and subscriptions usually madt in aid of the cause of emancipation now sir permit me to say that as the wisest policy is ever based upon truth so i can conceive no effort secure even in the cause of truth bul that which is supported by discretion much sir as i admire the undaunted boldness of a nathan or the unflinching courage of a paul yet imcomparaldy above these is the example of him who spake as never man spake who when he was reviled reviled not again hut amid all bis accumulated load of suffering even to the death could in the plenitude ol his love look even upon his murderers with pity and say father forgre them for they know not what they do the cause of truth whenever and wherever presented will i feel tooaer reach the hearts of men and win them to hself by mildness in an appeal to tbeir sympathies and their better

thomas middleton lo the following correspondence appeared in tle springfield papers in refrrmre to mt rectal rant to that city from ike springfield renjikaa m editor x wish through the columns of your paper to mj a few words regarding the a duress made by mr frederick lkmgtosn on tuesday evening of the ist inst at the town lliill am aware of the disadvantage of one who attempts to criticise the remarks of one who is the editor of a paper as is the case with mrd but i feel in some measure bound la duty to that portion of th eonjkiaty with which mr douglass and myself are identified to notice a tew of the remarks w bich were made by him in his address in the fireplace be without qualification denounced the church ami the ministry as being utterly deaf to the crus of god s poor aud said if tlie il it had spoken out le need not have been there to speak for them hut that does not go to prove that the whole church deaf to the subject and for one am led to conclude that there are a few names in sanfis who have not defiled tiieir garments by the foul ain of slavery nor have lliey faded to declare the whole couise of god therefore to make as sweeping a denudation as was made by mr douglass u unwarrantable and contrary to the spitit oi christianity there are sins as old iu this country as slavery and notwithstanding the denunciation pronounced against them in the yv ord ol god notwithstanding the application of rigorous discipline to such as are guilty notwithstanding the civil authority punishes the guilty still these sins live iu communities and some in the church now we believe there are many both inchurch and state who feel their individual responsibility and aro laboring to correct those evils just so with regard to slavery there are many in the american church that commiserate the condition of the slave and denounce slavery many who believe that there are redeevina qualities in the church and that there are indications ef a reforming spirit manifesting themselves every day other portions of mr douglass address i will notice in a future communication l collins from the spring field republican there was a large audience collected al th town llall on tuesday evening to listen t frdsrick douglass the runaway slave th writer was in the llall for a few moments during the evcr ncr and although we profess t be friendly every reasoiue l o hnd o freeing our country from the curse of slavery we cannot approve of the course or languag adopted by frederick douglass lie de nouueed the new york papers for calling hin a liar and a scoundrel and from what w heard we should judge that he labored hnr to make his titles clear and unquestionable fo instance he stigmatized the whole country li as a slave hunting community an assertioi which liis position in the speakers stand falsi tied we would like to ask of douglass friends who cordially responded amen this assertions if this town can be a siavi bunting community when fredeiick douglass a runaway slave on whose head rests s price dead or alive is permitted to walk tht streets and breathe the air as free as arv of liis auditors has the history of the fast shown this community to be a slave turning community have any runaway slaves been seized by their southern masters in this town and forcibly bad to servitude these questions must be an sweredin tlie affirmative before douglass as scrtifhi can be called true so much for hi first title for his claims to the second henr him would welcome the cause ivhtibr it ite an ait oj htm t or a thunderbolt from jill ichicj should break in pieces and shatter this unioi of zdates and he further continued to advise his auditors to redouble their eliurts t effect this object yes to dissolve the union to create civil war of unknown duration to convert the now iron shackles of the slavt to adamant to put back the great work ol america viz the evangelizing of the world to deluge the whole country in blood and take forever away from the north what power they have towards hastening emancipation these are mr douglass motives and those of his friends they would have all this and more for the purpose of breaking away from the south which would be all that could be effected by disunion froa thu springfield gazette we give place to the following corn l ill lection which was refused an insertion in the republican with no purpose of enlisting our columns m any controversy on the subject otherwise we should express oar dissent from some of its doctrines but solely from a willingness to see fair play in the matter if we recollect aright the writer of the article in the republican asked sundry questions of the friends of douglass an answer to which involved a point of veracity we have taken the liberty to omit a single sentence in reference to colonization bseam it is opprobrious in us character and irrrlccrnt to the matter at issue friend editor i noticed an article in the republican of the j instant from a professed friend of the slave who appears to beat his old trade of fostering the old prejudice against him as usual if i mistake him not this professed friend has reckoned without his host in saying that his douglass

constimmasfn at the other end of the capitol cf the measures taken by the champions of slavery for the admission of a foreign nation into this union for the purpose j of strengthening and perpetuating that institutionthe eenthman from carolina mr clingman addressed the committee on what in the pamphlet publication of his remarks he has called the political aspect of the slave question he treated the subject with great courtesy fairness rrutderation i and dignity i am not cure thrt his speech w ill not permanently connect yet another class of associations with that famous date i see in it evidence that the time has passed away when it was thought necessary to banish this great question from the deliberations of this i hall i joyfully accept the omen see other indications of the same wcl rornre improvement in the state of feeling amund us it is ut a litte while since i read two articles in the southern review on this subject of which th temper aad tone were as commend hli is the argument seemed to me fal lrcius i understand that there has hern a plan for a newspaper in this district to he devoted to the interests of southern slavery and on the other hand a plan has not only been projected hut executed for the estahlish ment of a paper witli the opposite design the national era it is conducted with distinguished ability and i am told enjoys a w idc circulation there were some threats of violence l believe at first hut they came to nothing the friends of liberty it seems have at last a fair field give them that and they ask no favor i said that in my opini n the gcntle i men from north carolina was right in introducing the subject and i am struck with the propriety of the title i which he gives to his published remarks j the political aspect of the slave question sir it is the great political question of the country and has been fom the beginning of this century though not hitherto so prominent as j now it is the question which underlies all other great questions and determines their solution i must pass entirely over many things and lightly over many others i as to this political aspect of the slave question how r has it dealt withr our j right of petition and our freedom of speech and of the pressthe two lasi belonging to the inheritance of our anglo saxon manhood the former commonly recognized in the poorest vassal that crouches before a despots throne i for several years the petitions of our constituents for the redress of what they feft to be offensive grievances were contemptuously thrown back by a standing regulation of this house and now the most that we have gained is that they may go into the hands of the committee i on the district which committee it is just as well understood as if it wcrc formally set down and ordained in your rules and orders is to do its office by simply burying them out of sight and taking care that they be no more heard j of forever liberty of speech and liberty ofthe press what arc they worth in nearly half of the states of this union if one would exercise them in relation to the great moral social and political question of the time on that subject within those borders who does not know that a man is not to speak or print his mind except at peril of life and limb nor docs personal liberty incertain cirtumstances fare better by the constitution of massachusetts established in people of color are citizais of that commonwealth as much as whites and by the federal constitution which w ent into operation in all citizens of each state are entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states by the constitution of massachusetts say freedom is universal within her limits and citizenship has nothing to do with color there was never an act of emancipation in that comnion wealtli emancipnti n took place hy force of the organic law three years after its adoption a colored man prosecuted a white man for asaut and battery the fact was admitted hut justified on the ground that the black w asa slave and that the assault was the lawful chastisement of the master the court held that under the dauetf the bill of rights declaring that ail menan born tiec and equal and have certain natural essential and inalienable rights among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties language almost copied from that w ritten by a yirginiau pen in tlie declaration of independence no such relations as those of master and slave could subsist in mas saehusetts the master was convicted and lined and slavery took its last leave of her jurisdiction the colored citizen of massachusetts goes on his lawful occasions to a southern state with just as good constitutional right to trend its soil in security and at will as the heir of its own longest and proudest lineage but not only is he forbidden by i lie pseudole gislation of the place to land there in freedom he is not permitted even to remain in freedom on braid the ship that has conveyed him he is forced on shore to a prison aud when he is discharged and departs it is on the i payment of a ransom cakd the expense of his detention if he comes a second time he is scourged if a third he is sold into perpetual slavery so decrees the soculh d law massa chusctts was uneasy to have her unoffending citizens treated thus she remonstrated hut to no purpose except to draw down fresh insult she could not nor did ehe desire to cscstce the responsibility of adopting all means in her power tor their protection she sent one of her most respected citizens a man of admirable w isdom discretion dignity and purity of character siirt plv to try the question of the validity rf those provision which south carolina persisted in affirming to be law though that ene of her most eminent aonawho had cognizance of it on the supreme tribunal of the nation bad said oni the tmconstitutionality of the law it is not too much to say that it m ill not bear argument a new political aspect of the slave question w as new thselovrod the slave question had closed the doors of the federal ccoits to which it belonged to extend the security that the federal constitution liad assured the mas saehusetts lawyer could not reach the bench before which he woukl have pleaded for the liberty and rights of masarhnsetts freemen nor only so the slave question had yet further aspects for himself he was expelled and sent home w ith indignity it it were p ssihle for indignity to reach such airan and laws socalled were forthwith enacted making it liighly penal henceforward to seek legal redress in that region under such circumstances for the extremest outrages offered to anew england freeman j mr chairman we have no present remedy we cannot raise a regiment nor fit out a ship for the inuintainance of the rights of those to whom the state owes protection as much as they owe allegiance to the state we are disarmed by those compromises of the constitution which massachusetts respects i shudder while i refer to such expedients but in other times they would have been resorted to it maybe we ffiall sec hereafter that these dismal transactions are not merely tobe deplored it is such extravagances that attract attention arouse indolence and excite to action it is a method of providence to provide for the ultimate overthrow of great evils by the practical development of their enormity the excess of an abuse conducts it to its fate i said to mr hoar when i welcomed him back that i could not wholly regret the annoyance he had endured for they seemed to belong to that blackest darkness that just precedes the day i believe it was so and that while the pen of history was recording that shameful chapter the pen of destiny was writing the certain and not distant downfall of the oppressive and insolent institution then came for the strengthening and perpetuation of slavery the disastrous measure of the annexation of texas with its long train of political aspects of the slavery questiqn long enough already and still stretching far away into the unknown and threatening fu lure the first fruit of that proceeding was the repeal of the tariff act of a measure which took the bread from the mouths of thousands of the working men of the free states and a measure carried hy two votes cast at the other end of this building by men who had no more constitutional right tocome in and act upon cur affairs than any two who might have been brought over from england or france or algiers tlie next blossoming of the tree was the pending war with mexico gentlemen please themselves with making distinctions between the occasion and the cause of that war but nobody i take it doubt that if texas had not been annexed war would not have taken place mr calhounwhose sagacity all the newspapers extol thought he could set fire to a barrel of gunpowder and extinguish it when half consumed he has lived to rue the failure of the hopeful experiment we have spent a hundred millions of dollars and arc going on spending no matter for the money if it had only been buried in the deep blue sea deeper than did ever plummet sound instead of being used to purchase so much disgrace and mischief but it has been made to carry widowhood and orphanage into thousands of the homes of a sister republic the homes of men and women who never injured us it has been made to carry widowhood and orphanage into thousands of our own american homes to write a chapter in our history for the execration and loathing ofthe civilized and christian world and the bitter shame of our own wiser posterity t again the gentleman urged to this point the natural inferiority of the negro race page he lias no doubt examined and knows how to expose the seeming paradox of those ingenious men who have held that the balance of power was iffiirt d and the sceptre of the world passe d fu m the colored to the white race some centuries ago at the capture of babybn by the persians and i presume he decides that question lightly r clinginan interrupted ami w as understood to say he had referred to tlie egyptians and relied on the formation cf the egyptian skull the gentleman speaks of the egyptians undoubtedly he has attended to the curious hint in herodotus bearing on that question the gentleman reads apptan a writer not commonly in the hands of professed scholars he is a reader cl polybius and has weighed his merits and fhcae ofthe other great masters in that department of composition in such exact critical scales as to feel justified in placing him at the head of the listin respect to political sagacity page he cannot have overlooked that singular passage in so common an author as herodotus in which the old chronicler has been thought to say that the ancient egyptians ihe remote source perhaps of gjeck civilization were woollyheaded negroes i will not defend that inter pretnti n of his words but it is no invention cf any of ycur highflying abolitionists of the present day it has been received by grave and plodding englh and german doctors who read and pondered and smoked and annotated long before such a lusus luiturtf as an american abolitionist was ever heard of the gentleman has ascertained the complexion of the great captain of antiquity the carthagiuian hannibal aud knows bow far it resembled that of the lybians and nubians whom he led to twenty years triumphs over the sharphc akeef eagles of rome he sees how to dispose of the phenomenon of the french mulatto alexandre du urns that miracle of pmhfic genius he can show that no stress is to be laid on such a case as that of the american frederick doug lass now of rochester opiiiim uf jadg iuhnwii augti h in rijte hear w frucii ikliiwilinc of rl ip new york tea years ago wretched slave picking up scraps of leaves of the bible in the gutters of baltimore to teach himself to read then working three years on the wharves at new bedford without a days schooling presume in his fife yet now speaking and writing the english language withs force and eloquence which i hesitate not to say would do no discredit to any gentleman oa this floor but do not discuss the question whether the negro inferiority is to be traced to a congenial incapacity or to the depres j sion and low culture of many geaera j tions it iis a great problem i hare r not tune for it it is too intricate and vast nor determined either way would it have any material connection with the main question i hive in hand or directly bear on any measure now i in the contemplation of this committee i have been stepping aside a little way in tlie gentlemans track again he appealed to the failure of the emancipation of the negroes in the west indies page the geni tleman gets his views of this from the english merchants who try the question of success or failure by the amount of their importations of coffee and sugar from the islands mr clingman w as j understood to sav that he had his information from those who had personally visited the islands the statements of visitors mr chairman are coni dieting i have statements different from what have reached the gentleman on which i am disposed to rely i am very anxious to see the recent parliament ary reports and have sent for them for the purpose of being aided to clear up the contradictions i have before me a table show ing the amount of sugar exported from the british west tndia islands in five successive years it is as follows in imi lmgheal tierres in in in in i showing on the whole a constant and very gratifying increase of the exportation but supposing it were otherwise the gentleman like myself i believe is a friend to the protective system and if so he knows the worth of the home market mr jefferson point ed it out long ago and showed how on account of the saving of the cost of transportation and lor divers other good and weighty reasons it was better than the foreign and if part of the sugar and coffee winch used to be sent abroad is now consumed within the islands which is the case to a large extent in consequcnca of the negroes being now in a condition bo indulge in such luxuries the decrease tn the amount exported is little to the purpose and supposing even that less of these commodities were raised the negroes being disposed to turn more of their industry to other productionsto raising yams bananas plantains pineapples anythingfor the market or for their families what then the better the farmer can suit himself with his farming the more rent will he be willing to pay and with the rise of rents of course comes the increase of the i value of land and of the wealth of the proprietors is it not so and is that failure even in an economical point of view h but mr chairman i am ashamed to argue the question on such a basis the failure of west india emancipation do the gentleman and i speak the same language do i understand the geni tleman and docs he understand himself i failure when human chatties were quietly changed in a day to men and women endowed with the possession and care of their own bodies and souls introduced to the relations of humanity entitled to cull their children their ow n empowered to have husband i and wife brother and sister in some i intelligent sense this a failure and mark the decisive practical contradiction given and forever sealed to all that had been said and nowhere more loudly than in these islands of the danger of such a proceeding four hundred thousand negroes in jamaica to forty thousand whites the whites would have been but a mouthful for their vindictive maw if vindictive passions had had sway but not one act of violence sullied that magnificent triumph of christianity and right and from that day to this a peace and good order have prevailed which would do honor to any civilized community if that isa failure will some one tell me w hat woud have been triumphant and glorious success i should be glad to be informed the idea has not yet dawned upon me once more the gentlemen took ground against the pretty common opinion that as he expresses it the continuance of slavery is injurious to us as a nation page he will excuse me for saying that rarely has it been ray chance to fall in with so palpable a non ttxjituur as that which lies in the chasm between his premises and his conclusion it may be remembered he said that the view derived from the decennial census is well calculated to deceive more than one han dred thousand foreigners annually arrive in the united states who settle dow n almost entirely in the free states j do they and why because in the free states the occupation of the laborer does uot place him in a degraded caste and because in the free there are common schools for him to send his children to in which they can be trained undei the same advantages as the richest and from which they can start in an equal competition with the sons ol the richest for all the prizes of j society nor only is this the case with foreigners those who emigrate irom the old northern states aluiott all go to hu nei r free states while on the other hand a very large proportion of the emigration of the old southern states goes into the free states of the northwest indeed and what is it that sets the prodigious current of etnigra  tion so determinately in that direction winning even the sons of the sunnysouth from the homes of their childhood and the graves of tjieir tiyhers and all the associations of afadrefl and of memory to seek the hardships of an untried condition and a northern sky just the intense desire for that equality and those social advantages w hich the presence of slavery absolutely excludes hus i have observed myself the gentleman continued is eminently true of the north carolina emigrants and i may add too that buf for this emigrmtion population would increase in that state as fast as it would in ilsf country there being an abundant supply of the necessaries of life among the entire population ah mr chairman much virtue is in baft as well as in if but for this emigration north carolina would rapidly increase because of this emigrnl ion it does not so increase and what causes this emigration the gentleman told us what does net cause it it is no want of a supply of the necessaries of life vulgarlyso called of them he said truly they had abundanceplenty to eat drink and wear but of what are equally necessaries of life to right minded peopleequality of social position and opportunities for personal improvement and advancementthe nonslavcholding north carolinians have not cncugh and therefore they go elsewhere in search of them keeping down the population of the state aswell as its wealth and consequence of which in a wellorganized community the industrious classes aro always the support and strength this remark on the tendency of emigration to the free states said the gentleman was uii nenily true of the north carolina emigrants should expect it from the wellknown sound sense and independent character of the good old north state the free tender and open spirit which george fox found among the planters of albemarle has not died out there and it is not satisfied with inferiority and stagnation let them get rid of slavery and they can live at home without either and when we have got at the cause which keeps down the comparative population prosperity and consequence of north carolina we can answer the same question in other applications vc can tell why the growth of beautiful kentucky keeps no better pace with her sister ohio across the river not so large and scarcely so fertile yet the latter though starting later now nearly tripling the free population of the former we can tell why virginia in the first half century of the federal government increased her population from about three quarters of a million to about a million and a quarter while new york on a much smaller territory enlarged her numbers from about to nearly two millions and a half and her estimated property had become nearly three times as great as that of the state the most favored by natare of any in this union we can tell why maryland most eligibly situated has free inhabitants to the square mile and bleak and barren massachusetts we can explain how it came abou t that michigan in ten years before increased her free population percent and arkansas erected into astate about the same time only percent washington saw the difference between pennsylvania and virginia in his day and his infallible discernment described the cause to be in the laws for abolishing slavery laws said he for once too hopefully which there i nothing more certain than that maryland and virginia must have and that at a period not remote and his august wisdom pointed out the proper method of relief as well as the crying need there is only one proper and effectual mode he wrote to robert morris by which it can be accomplished and that is by legislative authority and this as far as my suffrage will go mark it george washingtons suffrage for abolition shall never be wanting an institution so salutary and beneficial to the body politic the gentleman from north carolina would have extended into territories and states as yet untouched by its influences and he offered bis own scheme for that purpose page upon that i will not now detain the committee with any of my remarks i may have an opportunity to do so hereafter when the question of extending slavery into new territory may come up but as to two or three things which he said about it i must briefly throw in my caveat at the present time the gentleman said the supposition that the states would exclude from ail the territories of the united states an institution which prevailed so generally among them seems improbable in itself and those who maintain it may well he required to furnish tire evidence there is not sir in the whole constitution any one clause which either directly or indirectly favors the idea that slavery w as to be limited to the states where it then existed or to be excluded from any part of the territory of the united states page i think mr chairman that the constitution had it been faithfully executed agreeably to the sense of the convention which framed and of the people w ho adopted it contains enough safeguards against such a wrong ami that construed in its true meaning and spirit it could never have been used to extend the benefits if they were such of the original compromises compromises bad enough any way to the free statesto new parties not ewbiaced in the original paitnership the gentleman it seems thinks otherwise and unfortunately he has recent constructions in his favor the past has come and gone we may have opportunity to look at the question farther when further usurpations as i esteem them shall he attempted upon the liberties which it was expected to secure to the freeman to ratify it enlightened by the dismal experience we have had i own i could now wish that the constitution had uttered more positive and explicit prohibitions though have little belief that even they would have at all availed against such unscrupulous influences as have been in action to nullify it in all cases in which slavery was concerned but that no farther precautions were taken is no matter of surprise the gentleman must read the debates of the convention which framed this instrument and of the state conventions that ratified it w ith very different eyes from urine if he docs not see that the statesmen of that day expected that the discontinuance of the slave trade after twenty years for which they made provision and the discontinuance of slavery itself would be pretty nearly simultaneous events such i think was the general expectation that pro ii k vailed everywhere except in south carolina and georgia which it must be owned clung to the evil with a tenacious fondness no sir the tree of the constitution which nr father planted bore a natural fruit salutary and palatable a noxious branch war grafted upon it which grew rankly and overshadowed and poisoned the rest a mildewed ear blasting its wholesome brother

be challenged for an example of higher achievements from so low a beginning in all the elements of true greatness his character will bear a comparison with that of any hero ancient or modern lie was truly the washington ol hayti and if his final success did not equal that of our own revolutionary leader it must not be attributed to any lack oftaleuts on his part but to the incomparable lascness and perfidy of his enemy it is to that baseness we mainly owe our ignorance of the life of this extraordinary man the results of hb powerful intellect undaunted courage and generous philanthropy could not be hid but the same tyranny which meanly murdered him in a european dungeon blotted out all the best sources of information as to the means by which he accomplished them but the facts which are derived through this very enemy unsmothered by avalanches of abuse are quite sufficient for our pur pose toussaint was born on the plantation noe managed by m bayou de libertas his early years are said to have been marked with an extraordinary evenness of temper and an enthusiastic benevolence towards and wonderful control over the brute animals which it was his business to tend though his masters name ought to have ensured him full opportunity to cultivate his mind he seems to have been indebted to his own unaided and clandestine efforts for his education a french writer reproaches m bayou de libertas for his culpable negligence in not being aware tjmt his sluve had learned to read till he was familiar with the writings of the abbe kaynal his master however lived to see good reasons for not repenting of any kindness he had bestowed upon this slave tous saint did not join the negroes w hen they rose in till he had seen his master and family safely embarked for the united states with liberal supplies he then devoted himself to the cause of his brethren w ith such zeal activity and talents that he ultimately secured from them the most cordial and universal obedience and a respect little short of adoration complete emancipation was offered by the french commissioners to all who would take up arms against the british invaders in it was with their characteristic energy and perseverance that the british attempted to wrert this opulent colony from their old rivals acd reestablish the peace of that despotism which they considered essential to the safety of their own west indian possessions and it was to the energy and superior military skill of toussaint that his country men owed the preservation of their newly acquired liberty the british were not compelled to retire till he was made generalinchief and governor of the colony after the expulsion of the foreign foe toussaint applied himself to the arts of peace not leas successfully than he had d me to those of war we are assured by the roost respectable french authorities who were themselves planters and eyewitnesses that the colony under hi government marched as if by enchantment towards its ancient splendor the colonysays malenfnnt  flourished under toussaint the whites lived happtjy and in peace upon their estates and the ncgroc continu d to work for them no one who ha not weighed the difficulties that lay before him can duly appreciate the fmnor which these facts throw upon the character of toussaint the field of his operations was a country desolated by seven years of fierce and complicated civil war in w hich all the bad passions of human nature had burst into th wildcst madness that oppression could possibly drive to and had been urged l on in the work of destruction by the most powerful foreign influence worse materials for the establishment of peace industry and god government could not well be imagined ycf toussaint not only surcr d in governing the country but he succeeded in attaching to himself ail the parties ami castes into which its distracted inhabitants were divided it was this very success which doubtless stirred up against him the wrath of napoleon leading to the suspicion which was contrary to tact that it was his design to make the country indepemh nt of france the disgraceful expedition under ie clerc is said to have been urged upon bonaparte by the whites who were dissatisfied with the loss of theirlaves but these whites it would seem were chiet ly those who had tied to france those who remained on the island till tous saint rose to the government u ore mostly satisfied with the system ot free labor which under his administration wis more profitable than the old slavery on this point we have the best testimony that could be wished the historian who w as employed to luil ow french people salve the wounded fame ami pride of bonaparte for the defeat of le clerc andßochatnbcau and drown the cries of the widow s and orphans of go frenchmen assigns the disaffection of the whites in the colony itself as one great reason of the failure he says it would seem to have been the natural course to organize into a national guard the inhabitants who were found in the towns on the arrival of the army but there was not a man in win m anv confidence could be placed the majority of the inhabitants of the ton ns lea d the government of toussaint because he hud gorged than xcith riches again in excusing rochainbcau for the same failure to avail himself of the aid of the colonial whites he says it may be said for him that he could not anymore than captaingeneral leclcre put confidence in the w hites the majority of the inhabitants of the towns mourning i repeat it for the regime of i toussaint which hud cmichul tin in toussaint is represented by those who knew him well and bad no motive to overrate his powers or his virtues as a man of deep sagacity and untiring activity veracious to a proverb humane and affectionate extremely temperate and remarkably exalted above the vanity which prejudice affirms tobe characteristic of his race jle slept little ate sparingly drank nothing but water and habitually tired five secretaries in the transaction of ins official business in war he conquered by the foresight ot his combinations and the celerity ot hi movements in pence he repressed opposition by listening to complaints and making it the interest of all parties to uphold the law the same author to w hom we have already referred in describing the system of toussaint in regard to the former slaves who were required by law to work says they had a fourth part of the produce tehich teas too mmi so it seems he not only enriched the citizens of the towns but the loborers such was the man whom bcnaparbr resolved to crush but mark how lie trusted to lying and treachery rather tlwin to the valor ot his bravest v eterans lec lerc invaded st domingo with double the number of men toussaint had then at command yet he gained nothing in the field at last by deceitful proclamations and french gold he allayed apprehension and cut the nerves of resistance till toussaint too honest to fathom the deceit of his foe retired from public life to his plantation upon the pledged faith of france that his peace should not be disturbed his sword was no sooner sheathed than he found himself a prisoner on the way to france if the
