speech of the honorable edward l keyes at the close of the worcester convention mr president i think it is notan evidence of taste or judgment on the part of this audience to call upon meat this late hour when it would require the eloquence of a sumner or at least a cicero to speak here with success loud and prolonged cheering by the few feeble attempts which i have made on other occasions i have learned that the flowers of oratory never bloomed for me and that i am wiling to appear upon this platform at all must he accepted as a proof that i am disposed to sacrifice all even the grace of modesty itself on the still nobler altars of right and liberty i rejoice that so much attention was bestowed upon the remarks af the gentleman who preceded me but i tear we have not yet paid sufficient attention to the taylor party we are assembled mr president in the heart ot the commonwealth we are under the guardianship ot hei lawswe are assailed by no mobs composed of gentlemen of property and standingwe feel no danger as we walk the crowded streets but we cannot disguise from ourselves the fact that a large number of persons belonging to the two old parties regard us as intruders in the political field as poachers upon the lordly domains of our bettersas stragglers and vagabonds stalking up the broad aisles and disturbing the worship of the whig and democratic churches our first duty is to teach them as our lathers taught the royalists and loyalists of the revolution that we ask no favors and will suffer no dictationthat we know our rights and dare maintain them that not unmindful of the power of combined wealth we still have learned that thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just and what they will regard perhaps of still greater importance that like the youthful hannibal we have sworn it on our countrys altar that we will not lay down our arms until the victory is achieved the despots ofthe old world may succeed in stifling the aspirations for freedom which are welling in the bosoms of their subjects but intelligent freeborn men republican citizens of a free commonwealth graduates of the free schools of new england sons of revolutionary sires ice regard the threatened indignant frowns of our new slaveholding chief magistrate with indignation largely m ogled with contempt i am reminded by the presence of a gentlei nan before me that seventyfour tears ag a ou ng and ardent friend of america q independence whose name had been pla ed on the roll ofthe proscribed by the oyalst officers of boston came to this place and resumed the publication of a new spaper which had already been for several years the organ of american liberty in boston the name of that paper was the massachusetts spy cheers and considering the changing and unstable nature of all earthly things itis a significant and cheering circumstance that after the lapse of three quarters of a century with another of its editors proscribed not only by i the royalist officers but by the royal family itself of worcester it is still ibt faithful and fearless advocate of the doctriuen of the declaration of indew nt we assembled here a yeara b supposed that the great crisis uc wt l dotsnniue ths question of very or freedom in the tsrritoriee j m ftirtvtd w were not mistaken i the north star the crisis hsd arrived and as far ai j human penetration can detect the operation of moral nod immaterial forces it was owing in some good part to tba convention that the vast territoriei of new mexico and califotnia wen preserved to freedom a short time lon geranother year and that we havt a feeble hope they will be so preserve for all time to come our proceedings had hardly been recorded before that genuine free soil taylor whig john m clayton introduced his motionon the th of july for the appointment of that more that janus faced committee composed o two northern and two southern demo cratsand two northern and two southern whigs charged with the duty of devising some plan for the settlement othe question and here it would b proper if had time to trace the pro i gress of the slaveholding movemen i through that and the succeeding sea sion of congress that it might be seei how narrowly we escaped and hov clayton johnson and preston members of gen taylors cabinetuni formly battled on the side of slavery against the principle and measure othe wilmot proviso but canno now pursue the enquiry go on go on no the emotions whicl already agitate you inform me tha you need no labored arguments t arouse you to a full comprehension oi the importance of our movement i your thoughts mounting upward ii contemplation of the great and universal principles which we seek to cstab iish disdain even the fetters of elocution and would rather circumnavigati at random the wide empire of civilization and of mankind mr president we are told that th whig party is the only safeguan against the extension of slavery anthe encroachments of the slavepower the brazen impudence of this state meat has not been equalled since satan uttered his blasphemous counsel to the fallen host the great gul which leads to destruction lies concealed under the hypocritical banners o whiggery the plans of nationa locofocoismofthe cass democracy are as bold as they are infamous they will entrap none but the willing and the determined while the tayloi party with its slaveholding president and slaveholding cabinet fights for slavery like the pirate under the dovelike banners of innocence and peace i tell you mr president that the taylor party the administration at washingtondoes not even promise any assistance against the extension of slavery much less against the encroachments of the slavepower the washington republicthe taylor organ at the seat ofgovernment founded and to a great extent supported by the patronage of the general government says that the whigs everywhere north es well as south are in favor of withdrawing the slavery question from the arena of party politics this is true but suppose it was not so suppose the taylor party should put on a northern whited sepulchre face what then it would not deceive us it has fed us on falsehoods from the com mencment the whole series of its violated promises now hang like millstones about its neck general taylor we are told would not seek to influence the action of congress yet he had been scarcely a week among the slavepens of the capital before his organ was called upon to excuse and justify his interference the decisions of congress he would obey in good faith yet his minions are at this moment engaged in establishing a government in california directly in the face of a vote of congress refusing him authority to do so he would not proscribe yet the bodies of fallen office holders proscribed for their political opinions are piled in hecatombs all around us in regard to the last we do not so much complain of the act as ofthe violation of faith which led to it general taylor must proscribe the taylor victory without proscription would be no victory the praetorian bands the swiss mercenaries the hessian flies who dragged him from his camp stool in mexico and floated him on one unbroken tiamof falsehood to washington must be paid the laborer is worthy of his hire the taylor administration is upheld by the grand central pillar of proscription remove that and it would sinksink hoplessly where no fathom line could reach it but as lord chatham once said in reference to another administration laboring under embarrassments it is a miserable condition wherein disgrace is prudence and wherein it is necessary tobe contemptible it is but prudence in the taylor party to court the disgrace of falsifying all its promises and whenever it ceases to be contemptible its entire distinctive character will be gone mr president we were accused on every stump during the last campaign not only of being factionists but office seekers desiring nothing but our own honor and profit where now are those incorruptible patriots whose lips moved by the inspiration of their own mercenary hearts gave utterance to these flaming falsehoods where are the b hammett nortons the lawren ces the charles w denisons the hudson the lunts the woodmans and also the slaveholdiog chandlers where is that brace of beauties who renouncing all other u p at f na d voted themself y and nightbody and

honored will of fanoil od right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren full view of the portrait of some of the fathers ot the republic endeavored in vain to lisp his uxorious love for our venerable commonwealth where are the hopeful heirs of those two great worcester houses who became surety for taylorism in the heart of massachusets where are those twin cherubs who tired of obscurity and panting for an opportunity to serve the republic laid all they could of the state ol maine a willing sacrifice at the feet ot the slavedriver where too are those cravenhearted men who originally affecting a disgust for taylorism turned back to pliinge into its filthiest pools where are they fattening at the government crib haltered at the government stalls where i trust they may have time and opportunity to con over some ofthe contemptuous diatribes which in other days they put forth against locofoco officeseekers and learn in part even from themselves something of that full measure of contempt with which honest men regard traitors and hypocrites these are the men who trumpet the glories the virtues and the patriotism of the whig party these are the men who have seized theory of the one idea party and have applied it to us and who have to use a strong figure of edmund burke flyblown it into all the weak and rotten parts of the country in hopes that when the insects shall have taken wing their importunate buzzing may sound something like the public voice mr president have already detained you too long go on kc i will only add a word or two in a more serious strain other parties promise it belongs to us to perform the whig party if promises and good resolutions were effectualmight long ago have scaled the empyrean height but its ground and lofty tumblings of late have thrown into the shade the harlequins of the stage the principles which we advocate are destined to triumph in this countrywhether our party shall triumph or not firm and unyielding minorities are always powerfulsometimes almost omnipotent our strength at this moment is immense the countenance of many a politician blanches at our tread the temples of whig and democratic hunkerism shake to their foundations at the echo of our voices in eleven ofthe free states we hold the balance between the two factions and can elevate one or the other to victory or consign them to defeat two senators and eighteen members of congress now hold their seats by virtue of our permission and hannegan allen breese hudson rockwell and others have ceased to play their fantastic tricks before the nation only because tee have so ordered it gentlemen the path of our duty lies plain before u it is to summon together the stout armed champions of liberty to drive the monster institution of slavery away from the home of re publicanismto drive it not through the golden gates of the east into despotic turkeynot across the mediterranean into those barbary slates peopled by the descendants of pirates and rohbers for they would spurn the insulting invasionbut into the deep dark fathomless abyss of annihilation so that it shall be remembered only as years of earthquake pestilence and famine are rememberedso that in the midst of the broad territories so long desecrated by its presence a monument may arise to meet the sun in his coming on whose sides lookingi to the north south east and west shall be inscibed in golden characters justice humanity god and lib erty circular of the provisional committee for the promotion of education among the colored people in such of the slave states as are or may be accessible the organization of this committee is the work of necessity it grew out ofthe consideration that the labors and prayers of the friends of the slave had been blessed in the deliverance of many thousands from the fetters of legal bondage but their condition when thus emancipated suggests the important inquiry that how glorious soever maybe our success in the future whether the consummation we so arlently desire would not be reft of half its interest and importance if we were denied the reasonable anticipation that a blow so well aimed and effective would be followed by a ready zeal fidelity and insight in ample preparations to impart the rudiments of sound knowledge with healthful moral discipline to the youthful masses just escaped from legal bondage what is true of our slaves and colot ed people is true of every people long outcast and degraded such can secure the recognition of their rights only through an intellectual and moral regeneration they roust burst the fetters of ignorance and vanquish the dominion of low sensual passions or live and die in a condition in no way more exalted or worthy of a divine manhood than that of the veriest slaves the time has fully come in our judgment when a well advised and effected plan may be vigorously prosecuted for the enlightenment and elevation of our colored people who are at least nominally free though in the slave states in some of those states they are not seriously interrupted in the pvnnit of knowledge they way be reached in either of two wya to wit by establishing schools directly among them or by electing young persons of good mortis and endowedfriih adit mroag powers of mind who when sufficiently rochester n y friday october best social influences to be found at the north may return to labor in tbe department of instruction among their friends and the people of their peculiar class at the south this latter is the idea which strikes us forcibly and which for the present we shall seek to make available by our efforts through tbe events of providence we have it in our power just now in an easy quiet way to make an experunent in the direction alluded to and under lh most agreeable and gratifying circumstances tbe edmondson sisters mary and emily you know by reputation their brief history is singular and affecting it is enough to say that they were for seven months in the hands of slavetra ders in washington baltimore alexandria and new orleans that their virtuous and christian character afforded them a shield of completedefence that by a rare impulse of social sympathy twentytwo hundred and fifty dollars were raised for their redemption they are of a good family are now in this neighborhood uuder the most favorable circumstances to be thoroughly taught possessing highly respectable capacities with most exemplary industry and a rare deportment for propriety they are anxious to acquire information that will in every way render them competent and effective as teachers and examples among their people in the district of columbia this committee propose to take charge of them to advise them and to raise whatever means may be required in the course of their education others of equal promise will no doubt soon offer themselves indeed we are well informed that any number of persons adapted to the object we have in view can at anytime be selected at washington or bal timore allow us to say that it is not our purpose to make pets of our beneficia riesto spoil them by indulgence orby superficial shallow views of the relations and duties of life it shall be our aim to foster and assist their own exertions and by no means to supersede them nor is it our design in anyway to build up schools exclusively for colored children we shall place them where the chances for sound instruction exact discipline and real elevation of character are the most completely satisfactory our limits forbid addition to this hasty outline of our plans we wish to regard you as a corresponding member of our body and to look to you constantly for counsel and support as a cordial and active laborer in a common field of enterprise and responsibility is it not a delightful thought that by a united effort the women of new york can in a brief period place in the district of columbia or the state of mary iand a dozen intelligent welltrained colored females as teachors of schools and models of manners behavior and character to exert an influence among those who are most sadly in need of its quickening power you are left free to raise funds and to bring this interesting subject before the community around you in such way as seems to you most convenient and at the same time surest to reach a speedy and desirable result the committee will take care that you receive frequently a full report of what they design and accomplish and especially of the manner in which all the money and resources put at their disposal are applied your friends truly p s please to direct your communications to our secretary c g ham blin farmington ontario co n y hannah c smith phebe hathaway j maria e wilbub com anna p adams j c g hamblin j slavery ix cuba with respect to this foul curse mr turnbull has the following rernancs as the experience of years had taught me to believe that the spaniards are a kind of warm hearted race and as i had frequently been told that the slave owners of the havana were tbe most indulgent masters in the world i was not a little surprised to find as the result of personal inquiry and minute observation that in this last particular i had been must miserably deceived and that in no quarter unless perhaps in the brazils which i have not visited is the state of slavery so desperately wretched as it is on the sugar plantations of the queen of the indies the farfamed island of cuba the same error is commou among persons who have never visted the island and even with those who have but have not visited the interior to those who are not wilfully blindfold there are not wanting even at the havana not to speak ol the sugar or even of the coffee plantations a thousand palpable indications of the misery which attends the curse of slavery independent altogether of the horrors ofthe slave trade when a stranger visits the town residences of a cuba proprietor be finds the family surrounded by s little colony of slaves of every vanety of complexion from ebony to alabaster most of them have been born in the house have grown with ihe growth of the family and are perhaps the foster brothers or foster sisters of the roaster or his children when these slaves are unwilling or disobedient they are sent in order to save tune and labor or perhaps to spare the too tender feeling of their masters or mistresses to a building just outside the gates of ths fortified portion of the city in the interior of which are a aerie of whipping ports but although by the means of the parapets tbe authority soeceed in shutting oat the inquisitive glances of the futtn b h wt xelul ft hlie view the streaming mood and lacerated flesh of the sufferers they cannot shut in their piercing screams and piteous shrieks for mercy mr turnbull also says it is the policy of the court of madrid to keep tbe island of cuba in her dependence and this it is supposed can only be done effectually by the salutary terror inspired by the presence of a numerous j halfsavage negro population the existence of such a population seems at mice to justify and require the presence of a peninsular army which under the command of a captaingeneral enjoying the confidence of the court and zealously aided by a numerous train of public functionaries and empleados pro jlgces such a pressure oo creole interests as to have hitherto deterred the native inhabitants mom any open attempt to assert their independence these public functionaries with scarce ly any exception are europeans by birth and therefore decidedly opposed to a separation which would instantly deprive them of all their emoluments the philadelphia riots again from the philadelphia inquirer the second riot quiet continued until about oclock this wednesday rooming when the ominous taps of the state house bell announced another riot this second outbreak commenced about oclock when the hose of the morris hose company which was doing service at the scene of action was cut this was the signal for the rioters to commence an assault brickbats and tones were hurled by them at the firemen and firearms were used with considerable effect several persons being wounded the mayor sheriff and police were soon on the ground and succeeded in restoring order mayor swift himself who arrived before the military arrested two men approach of the military the military which had been down at the scene of the first riot had returned upon the restoration of quiet and it was some time before they could be collected again for the suppression of the renewed disorders about a m however they began to assemble in independence square many delays occurred and it was nearly nino oclock when a body of five or six companies with their ranks but partly filled marched to the scene of action the whole were under command of gen patterson and col bohlen their approach tost mary street soon became known to tbe rioters and by the time they came upon the ground these had disappeared into their various haunts the companies were assigned positions at the various avenues leading to the scene of riot so as to command every approach completely the military are provided with ball cartridges and have full authority to fire upon any renewal of the lawless and outrageous proceedings by the rioters arrest of the leader the leader in this and indeed in the former riot is said to be a black man named george hosey formerly a head dogcatcher in the city employa big powerful negro about noon today he was arrested after making a most desperate resistance in the struggle with the police he was considerably bruised and beaten before he could be secured j from tbe philadelphia ledger the riots deplorable results the killed and wounded we resume the details of the riot from the point at which our account of yesterday broke off the rioters ascertaining that the military forces had retired recommenced their lawless acts and by davlight the disturbance was raging furiously some of the rioters jumped the fence above the california house and set fire to the frame building in the rear of the open space between it and the dwelling above the colored papulation residing in the vicinity commenced moving when even the females were pelted with stones by the rioters while carrying off articles of furniture the flames spreading tbe meanwhile brot firemen again to the spot they sallied down the street and the rioters retreating before them the phcrnix was put inservice in a short time however the rioters returned and let fljf a volley of bricks with discharges of fire arms and the members of the phcecix were forced to fly from their carriage the firemen however were reinforced by citizens and returning again to the fire the goodwill and phcenix were put into service and prevented the further spread of the fire which at this time had communicated to a row of courthouses running west from sixth street the roofs of which were all damaged the robert morris hose company had laid their hose for tbe purpose of assisting in extinguishing the fire when the members were beaten off the carriage and it was takeu possession of by the rioters who ran off the hose which was cut by them and then carried off the apparatus into moyamen sing it was afterwards restored to the company by john kneass and some other watchmen of that district the hose of the diligent fire company was hacked with koives so as to be useless the state house bell tbe signal for tbe assembling of the military at this time sixth street from walnut to

a young man the son of capt walker the keeper of a tavern in seventh below south was wounded during tuesday night a marble fired from a musket struck a rib and glancing in dieted a severe flesh wound the marble was extracted by mr rizer the following is the verdict of the coroners inquest upon the body of l charles himmelwright charles him melwright came to his death by a wound in his breast inflicted by a musket ball which perforated the heart at the jnne tion of the main artery the weapon j being in the hands of some persons unknown to the jury on the night of the th of october while

have been converted into barracks for the use of the military with the exception of several discharges of firearms in moyamensing apparently intended for signals by the rioters no disturbance occurred last evening in visiting the scene of the late disturbance we found the streets in the vicinity completely deserted the rain having had the effect of driving the rioters as well as the spectators to their homes mcshane died at the hospital last evening about dark this makes the third fatal case he had arrived in this country but a few weeks since and was making preparations to return intending to start the last of this week arrest for rioting during tuesday night and yesterday thirty men and boys black and white were arrested and committed to the city lock upon the charge of having been engaged in the riots five of them were subsequently discharged those in custody will have a hearing today or tomorrow the outbreak was one of those sud sudden explosions of brutal passions which could not have been foreseen and owing to the employment of the police force on duties incident to the election could not be guarded against still the public authorities ofthe country are justly censurable for allowing a lawless gang of ruffians to gain by impunity for former frequent outrages the audacity that showed itself in the resistance they made to the laws on tuesday night the rioters have been guilty of the highest crimes known to the laws arson and murderand we suggest whether it is not the duty of the governor to immediately offer a reward for the arrest and conviction of every individual known to have had a hand in the outrage from the n h independent oeukrra slave holding chrintiann it is difficult here at the north to believe that the writer of the following isa christian minister or that he is not jesting in what he says of the holy wise and beneficent institution of slavery it is difficult to conceive how any men upon whom ha ever beamed toe light of modern civilization canthus talk in earnest of an institution which tramples on the most sacred affections of the human heart and annihilates those domestic relations to which christianity and civilization owe all their efficiency to redeem the world it is however with slavery as with other sins those who make a gain of the bones sinews and souls of their fellow men are the most hopeless victims of their own crimes against god and their race we take the following extracts from a long address in the augusta igs republic to tbe editors of the christian review the writer professes to be a clergyman whose soul is grieved at the abolition fanaticism of northern christians in denouncing the godordained institution and what is yet mors alarming says this writer this foul spirit has not only fallen upso and warpod the judgment of your most distinguished politicians who in prospect of human greatness hare sought honor on of another said not tbs honor which com sth from god only who through their miliin miaf john dick praushia whole no ged mountain of fame have found au time to examine minutely the lively or teles and make themselves acquainted with the god of the bible but this ao olilion fanaiicim has also thrown its pestilentisl vapors into the departments of religion and infected and bliodsd the minds of many who profess to mk for the truth as it is in jesus evan many among you who occupy the sacred desk instead of feeding thir flocks with tho sincere milk of tits word desecrate thr sabbath and its services in hurling towards southern slaveholders the poisoned shafts of abolition agitation which hew ever fall not upon themselves and their ocagrega tions proving in truth to be a savour of death unto death for the conss qseace is as might be expected that those who undertake against tks god of the bible roust tail in the conflict many of the strong alobtion minisurs of the north forsaken by tk restraining grace of god hete been permitted to fall into giojs siiz and others into open apostacy or into the adoption of some one of the prevailing heresies abounding in the land of edwards and dwight once distinguished for cherishing the orthodox faith of the gospel we invito any whe arc not bimd icd to madness to look into this holy wise and merciful uurk if a beneficent creator and in defending the eburac terjof the christians god as the author or southern slavery we onl ask tiiat its history may be traced goback then into the wilds of africa and see two of her savage tribes engaged in the din of deadly battle theone and perhaps not the aggressor proves victorious iu the conflict and now the brooding spirit of the god of mercy says to the conquering party do not butcherjyour captives though they may have unjustly assailed you and if conquering might have put you to death and paved their yards with your skulls as many savage tribes of your country ofteu do with their captured enemies but do you act upon the principle of mercy and benevolence make them your servants turn tln m into your money and then they will be grateful to you and you will love and protect them the divine influence prevailed over their savage minds the poor captives destined to destruction were spared by their conquerors and became their kind and submissive slaves the writer warms with his glowing subject and begins to prophesy he seems to see his favorite system ailing our whole continent with its moral and political aromatic hear bun i have no pretension to prnphetio vision but upon the tiiowing of your correspondent our slaves are greatly prospering and the god of heaven has placed not only new but old mexico in such geographical and ciiniatical juxtaposition to our sunny south that i know not but when enlargement for our slaves may require he who hits ever favored those walking under the banner of truth and righteousness may open the way in peace and good will too for mi peculiar instituion of slavery ta carry its blessings still farther west ah why we ask should it not be destined to pass over the battlefields of mexico to the halls of the montezuma bearing thither this glorious banner whose motto is glory to god in the highest on earth peace and good will toward man

knowing that it would lessen his chances for freedom refused to go he was seized and forcibly thrust on board the steamboat for norfolk to be sent to ietersburgb and so closely watched till the boat

and slated that his name was geo jonesthat he would yield to n man m eiihur hemisphere in his love of liber tv in is most enlarged sense he was ais englishman by birth as his name certified i but bad

had given to mr thompson was on t matter of fact and if he had misunderstood the honorabu spaker lie was soirv lor it allpeisons wert liable lu er in hearing as well as in speaking e hut he had understood mr thompson diss icclly to say that in the eastern states oi amer ci the prejudice against the colorec people was as galling that was the phras as slavery itself aud he made a eompaii i son

city of boston meeting with frowns from the americans and tie called on mr brown in testimony to whom tie mr jones would join hands with the meeting but he called upn hnu to contradict the assertion the anniversary of amencan independence i was on the th day of july and the anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the state of massachusetts was on lie th of july and he would call upon mri brown to state whether the colored people mere bad not iheu pi occasion on that day hr i celebrating their emancipation ten days after tic anniversary ot the declaration of independence that fact tie would dare the gen berrien to negative in reply he would alsu i give another proof of the nonexutence of prejudice against color which mr thomp mjn with all tua eloquence could not gainsay he alluded to the fact that ihe chaplain of the senate ol mmaachuseit was changed every r non ill and the minister were taken in roia utlon and the rev mr paul whom they must all koow aince they vindicated the nc gro

mr jones had beet attracted by the trow freedom at the or of the meeting and bad therefore entered it and he declared that the state of the negro in the east wa not aa galing a in the south he made that declaration not only before that meeting but before his god he aaaerted that the charge was the meeting would pardon himi he would not uttet the word in heart woulo dictate for lie te mem be rod be waa before a public assembly he had also years in the south in uginia and had been entertained there by gentlemen although they knew he was oppoaed to slavery on pnnoiple he was not less happy in his residence there slaves there had bought their freedom there woiked as mechanics they had saturday for tbetr overwork and their time was paid for in gold aod in the savings bank ny ot them had enough to purchase their freedom but they would not do it this was the case of col myers tobacco manufactory w hich had colored people in it he mr jones abbot red slavery on principle but lie objected to misrepresentation when mr charles dickens published lus wotk on america some years since be had stated that it w as a common practice of the slaveholders to pod out the teeth of their slaves as a punishment for having stigmatized the americans in that manner he mr jones had refused to give his hand to that excellent writer trusted the meeting would pardon him for having expressed himself warmly while be was an englishman here he was also a citizen of the united states hi public life w as his pledge for him that in england and america he had endeavored on all occasions to defend the wronged and vindicate the oppressed and he was doing so at that time he had come as a stranger to the meeting having no right to the platform hear he thanked mr thompson for his courtesy and the chairman for his fait play in having given him an opportunity to make that speech he only rose to vindicate his negative to thej statement made by mr thompson relative to the poiats he had refetred to with that exception he had given the same british hearty applause which throughout they had given to the noble sentiments of his opponent mr thompson rose and saidhe could neither retract nor modify a single word he had i uttered respecting the prejudice against color hi the united slates cheers notwith btanding what mr jones had said of boston e r thompson would arflira that even in i that city the colored man was the victim of a pieiudice which in its effect upon the mind ofa sensitive and educated person was as galling as slavery itself to one of less susceptible mind cheers let us he continued try boston by a test which better than any other perhaps will decide the question between me and my opponent if there is a place on which men should assemole as on a common level from winch pride and prejudice should be banished where conventional distinctions should tor the ume be obliterated that place is the sanctuary for there tve meet as the children of one father and as heirs of the same promise vv heiher as sinners or saints we aie equal and the consciousness of common necessities and common hopes should leaeh us to fling away the prejudices and prepossessions w inch we are prone to cherish in ihe world how stands the case in boston i why will undertake to say that there is not a church in that city unless one formed tm antislavery principles in which a colored man can hold anduccupya pew in the body ol the building erected for public worship an instance did once occur of a colored citizen becoming the proprietor of a pew but his appearance in it threw the whites into consternation and the man and his family were per seemed until the property was relinquished mr jones cannot point me to a religious denomination in boston that as such hai opened ns doors to the colored man and admitted him on terms ot perfect social equality episcopalians presbyterians congregational lsis methodists baptists unitarians swedenborgians and uuiversahsts are aliki guilty in this matter and if such is the example set by professing christians what cai we expect from those who have no reverenci for religion and no respect for the principle of christianity mr brown on coming forward was greeted with loud applause which lor a lime prevented him from proceeding he presume they had all heard something of the peculiar institution of america from which h had so unceremoniously giaduated laughter in the first place what was the slaver of the united states so much was sail about american democracy american republicanism american philanthropy and american christianity that when american slavery was spoken of people generally suppose that slavery amid all those glorious institutions which they heard so much about mut be rather better than slavery in any other poi tion of the world but what was the fact was it so why the slave of the unite states w as a chattel a thing a saleable cotr mod itv without any legal right to own himself oi to receive the avails of his labor dt pnved of the privilege of protecting bimsel bis wife or children he spoke not from the i ory or hearsay but from actual experience when he thus described the workings of th j slave system in america he was not onl i an american slave but the son ot an amer can slaveholder and they would see in th latter fact another hideous feature of th damning system of slavery hear hear the slave in the united states was unprotee ed by law or public sentiment and occupie the same position as a mans horse or dog in si louis from which he had escaped th horse in fact received more protection than ih slave lor if the quadruped was unmercifull beaten an action might be brought against th man for the offence but it a slave was flog ged with however much severity a cry wj j immediately raised among the bvstandert give it the nigger give it him heai hear if awlave feels that god has give him a right to occupy a higher position tba merely toiling for the man who claims to ow both bis body

chiidrer and sent lo be worked upon a cotton sugai nr rice planuion in louisiana or miasissipp  hear the constitution of the unite states made a man in boston a slaveholder i common with john c calhoun of sout carolina every citizen of the unite stales was bound by the constitution of th country in the event of the slaves atterap ingto get their liberty to take up the rauski and shout down those poor slaves the la of gave the slaveholders a right to g mio the free states to catch slaves and dra them back again to bondage why as l boston the citizens of that place only si vears ago paid

brown was made a tbe commencement of tbe meeting to the lamentable cooductof father matthew hear bear a voicegive it him laughter no one regrets more than i do that he should have thrown his iofiueice into the scale of american slavery hear bear the circumstance proves however the baleful effect which slavery exeits over every individual who cornea within tbe sphere of ha influence here is a man who in in conjunction with daniel oconnell l f rl b an address to america signed by irishmen cal liog upoq ikeir countrymen in the united states to take sides with the abolitionists and have nothing at all to do with proalavery people as far as their influence was concerned telling them that the abolitionists were the friends of the negro and calling upon them to join them bean and hand and telling them moreover that they must oot even keep neutral for there was no neutral ground upon the antislavery platform hear that mangoes to america breathes its corrupting air and mark in a moment he is paralyzed he can do nothing whatever for the poor slave whom he had before recommended to the zealous support of his countrymen in the united states hear he was called upon by the slave in the pernors of the antislavery committee to attend a t irst of august meeting in celebration of that british west india emancipation which he himself had labored to bring about what aashis reply lcannot commit myself while in amenca loud groans hiss and marks of disapprobation the slave comes upon his bended knees to this irish apostle and tells him that his wife has been torn from him and carried into the most miserable bondage reminds him you called upon your irish brethren in america to stand fast by the abolitionists we now only ask you to practice in america what you preach in ireland he turns round and says he cannot have anything at all to do with j antislavery in america hear and why i he had a few days before received an invitation from our slaveholding president to become his guest while visiting washington hear hear hear yes he had received an invitation to the white house and he immediately throws himself and his influence into the of the elave power samson was never more thoroughly shorn of his physical strength by throwing himself into the lap o delilah than was father matthew shorn o his moral influence by his apostacy to the antislavery cause loud cheers the man who in ireland seven years ago said thai slavery was a highhanded sin has found out since he has reached america that there is nothing in scripture against slaveholding cries ofshame it might not be just in me to express my warm feelings upon that point and therefore will quote your own cowper who has said of all the arts sagacious dupes invent to cheat themselves and gain the worlds assent he worst is scripture warped from its intent those men go wrong who with ingenious skill bend the straight rule to their own crooked will and will a clear and shining light supplied first put it out then take it for their guide cheers he mr brown had been asked why he had come to england his answer was in the first place that he might for the the first time in his life stand upon a soil that was really iree cheers he wanted to see the people who had knocked off the chains from of his brethren in slavery oh what a glorious atmosphere was england just tbe very breathing of it so expanded the limbs of the slave that the chains that had hound him for thirty years burst asunder he wished that every slave and slaveholder in america could see that meeting aoothei reason why he came to england was to agitate the question and endeavor to build up public sentiment there so that englishmen would say to americans lf you wish to be thought ol as other nations never again send a slaveholder to represent you in the court ol st james he wanted a public sentiment raised up in england which should point the finger of scorn at evry slaveholder who dared to pollute its soil the welcome which the people of england had extended to him mrbrown would be appreciated by the i slaves and the colored freemer as an honor done to them all men had no lt acted as father matthew had there wa one man who fifteen years ago went fron that country to america to agnate the question of slavery and although he rose oru morning and found in the pious city of bos ton a gallows erected before his door as i warning to him to stop agitation upon that subject yet he refused to close his lips upor the question and in the meeting that gwe hiir mr brown a farewell in boston upon leav  ing america three of the loudest longest and heartiest cheers that were given on tha occasion went up for that man and that mar was george thompson loud and prolonged cheering mr brown concluded a long and most elu quent speech amidst reiterated cheers b the following resolutions drawn up by y mr farmerthe first moved by h t atkinson esq and seconded by w h ashurst e esq the second moved by d mcdonnell e esq and seconded by william geesin esq were adopted with cordial unanimity resolved that this meeting tenders its d warmest and most cordial congratulations u mr william wells brown upon his arrival e in england bevond the reach of the american e manstealer that animated by the common y feeling of englishmen they indignantly repu e diate the doctrine of the inferiority of the african race and on behalf of this nation publics ly give to mr brown as a representative ol f his oppressed people an unreserved recogm tion of his right to perfect social political and n religious equality a right received from then hands of his creator but of which he wasn impiously robbed by nominal republicans ande christians in amenca that having in the providence of god achieved his own deliver d ance from slavery and resolved to consecrate tbe emancipated energies of his mind and the influence of his moral character to the cause of the redemption of bis three million of brethren in bonds this meeting welcomes him tod the metropolis of england and bids him god n speed in bis holy mission on both aides of the atlantic resolved that in the deliberate and deci e ded opinion of ibia meeting the claim of prp erty in man either as practically asserted in the slave stales of the american union oras conventionally abetted in the free is a fear ful invasion of the prerogative of god ande wholly incompatible with the religion ot christ whether professed by individuals or communities that while anxiously desirous j of rendering a full and respectful acknow led mem of whatever is honorable in tbe national character of a people having a common origine with themselves the lequirements of truth h and justice demand from englishmen a sor r rowful but empbatie declaration that ihe eon d sttuiuonal aad legislative establishment ol slavery in any country is a virtual deotruc u tion of its claim to be regarded by the world e as a really free independent and enlightened nation that this meetiog cordially aympa ibises with the selfsacrificing efforts of ihe american antislavery society and ezpress e a fervent hope that ita exertions may speed ily issue in tbe removal of this national stigma r from the american character e r aii oajcuui waxthe following is a copy of a will left by a man who chose to bo his own lawyer this is the last will of me john thomas give all my things to my relations to bo divided among them the beat way they eaa i n blf anybody lucks op a row or makes any fmm about it ho iaat to have ffisgwd hymn jo tmui n the north star rochester october  tw naimi lew it is astonishing an mortifying that the people of all others under the broad canopy ol beaten who ought to be the moat united present to the world the leant evidence of that union smarting under wrongs and denied rights which should cause all bearta to throb together as the heart of one man in a common effort to redress those wrongs and to achieve those rights we are yea a disunited separated and scattered people and we present to the world no grand movement nor comprehensire scheme fot bettering onr con dition without wishing to censure unjustly or to compare unwarrantably we do think that a cause like ours were it in the hands ol any other people would certainly rally larger numbers excite a deeper interest and obtain a belter suport than now falls to its lot it is always grievous to be compelled to speak in disparagement of an oppressed people if we ever do so it is with a view of inciting them to make the needful exertions for their deliverance and this is the only apology we deem necesary there is not an intelligent colored man in the land who does not know that the colored people in this country need organization and it has been a cause of deep grief to the noble minded among us that no eftoit has been made for a general organization by which the moral power of our people could be made available to our cause go where we will we hear a general lament that we are a disunited people yet how few there are who have the energy and the will to remedy the evil of which all su readily complain on the th of august last we suggested the rough outline of a constitution which should serve as a landmark to those of our people who are desirous to secure an union of the oppressedfor the sake of freedom and although a few among u have readily and wholly responded to our suggestion the overwhelming mass have remained silent as the grave on the subject the impartial citizen e dited by a colored man did not even notice it the rams horn hau been dumb over it very few of our public men have as yet given to the idea the slightest encouragement pittsburgh that should always be ready to speak as she always hasan opinion has been silent cincinnati containing a colored population as intelligent active and wealthy as any in the country has not lisped a word pro or con on the subject new york as usual has nothing to say what can be the cause of this apparent indifference can it be that the professions of regret with which we meet from time to time that there is not an union among the colored people are false and hypocritical can it be that the profession is put forth merely as a cloak for indifference and indolence we cannot believe it the true reason of the apparent general apathy and unconcern with which the idea of a national league has been received by the people must be lound in the fact that the subject has not been airly brought before them our leading men have not taken it up nor pressed its importance upon them in addition to this we have reason to believe that sectarianism is not among the least of the causes of the hesitation and coldness with which the movement has been received colored people m common with white people have their different religious creeds and sects to support nor are we disposed to quarrel with them on that account but when they allow their religious differences to stand in the way of proper efforts for their enfranchisement they at once become suitable objects for exposure and rebuke there isnothing necssanly in a difference of religious opinions to divide us on subjects pertaining to our civil social and political rights and relations but in the causes that separate us there is something more difficult and bitter than mere differences of religious opinions it is the bigotry of sect so narrow and neatsighted that it can see good nowhere beyond the limits of its own particular communion it is this ignorance and intolerance that stand directly in the way of that union so devoutly to be wished for there is that among us as among other people which leads us to reject a thing good tn itself merely because the person or the party bringing it forward may entertain opinions on other subjects not stamped with orthodoxy we have among us our little popes and bishops who claim and assume to decide lor the colored people what shall be the religious opinions of those who undertake to instruct them such men love the uppermost seats in the synagogue and they will have tliem oi they will have will have nothing but it is not our purpose to give an expose of the hindrances with which oar ptoposed movement must contend we see no impediments but what may be easily removed it is impossible to keep a people asunder for any long time wbo are so strongly and peculiarly identified together when there i a vigorous effort nude to unite them we shall never despair of our peoplean union shall yet be effected our ranks cannot always be divided the injuries which we mutually suffer the contempt in whieh we are held the wrongs which we endure together with a sense of our own dignity as men must eventually lead ua to combine it will one day become obvious to all that the evils that afflict ua all require the united strength of all for their xe moval at preseoi we as a people do uot feel nor see this we have not yet learaed the j h losophy of reform nor the appreciation of moral forces there are many among us who easily perceive the change going oo in oar condition and eitcumetaneea bo wbo have not the meat remote conception of the means by whieh this change ia effected of the action of mod upon mind they are wholly ignorant tell such persons thats well written address emanating from a colored mao setting forth the wrooga of his people aod pleading for their rights

let no one hesitate speak because he may think he sees insurmountable difficulties in the way of the movement we uant discussion tee t cant action ihe former must precede the latter we call upon pittsburgh cincinnati new york and boston to hold public meetings and to express their opinions freely on the wisdom and desirableness of such a combination as that proposed under the title of the rational league philadelphia chicago buffalo and albany hare already spoken and will undoubtedly stand ready to give the measure their warmest and most energetic support a grand convention in which these cities with others are largely represented by the wise and the good would pruduce a thrilling effect and a lasting impression on the public mind d education among the coloied people one of the most gratifying and encouraging signs of the times is the interest at present manifested in the important work of education among the colored people the time was when this subject scarcely excited any attention among our white fellow country men when they could say the negro ought to he tiee they felt that they had uttered a radical and philanthropic sentiment but as the cause of emancipation progresses and human rights and human duties become belter understood something more than the mere act o emancipation is now thought to be due to thii jong neglected and deeply injured people our attention has been directed to this subject by a circular emanating from a uumbe of philanthropic ladies of farmington whicl document the reader will find on the outsidt of tikis weeks north star with the object of this committee wemos cordially sympathise the work which the have undertaken is an important one for o all the people under the broad blue sky wh stand in need of the advantages of education the colored people of this couutr are preeminent surrounded by a peopl j possessing every facility for improvement ih disparity between us and them is alone j source of great pain and unhappiness bu when we add to this the fact that w e are compelled by a bitter prejudice to follow the mos menial and the least lucrative employment for a living and that we are the constant objects of the scorn contempt and ridicule othe community education which is ever es jseitia to all becomes doubly important to ns we are the competitors of personscompara lively well instructed and were we even wel educated we should still have difficulties tc struggle against to which our oppressors art strangers but how great is the disparity ano how fearful are the odds while education ii common to the white people and denied to us j knowledge is power said bacon and it if about the only power that can at present be wielded by the colored people political power they have not the power of wealth they cannot reachour only hope in this country at piesent rests upon the improvement of oui minds and the elevation of our character knowledge is the preliminary step to all power and for the want of this knowledge the colored man is killed all the day long out ignorance is pleaded as a reason for withholding our lights while knowledge itself has been locked up from us this statement peri haps may bequestioned and we shall be pointed to the fact that in this state school privileges are extended to colored children i but the answer to this fact rnay be found in the circumstance that colored people subjected as they are to the most menial einploy ment have the hardest possible struggle toi live when bread and education are placed before a hungry man it ieav to see which will lie preferred to educate thecolored eople something more must be done than to j admit us into schools and this is the mountain difficulty in the way of our progress j we have not the means in many cases requisite to enable us to send our childien to tschool as soon as they arrive at an age suitable to commence service they are putout and in these circumstances they early i learn to look upon themselves as inferiors andi as being marked out for a life of degradation j the ordinary incentives to the attainment of knowledge are nipped in the bud they are taught to feel that the onlyeducation necessary for theit condition in life is to know what is coming to them at the end of a months work and w ith their energies thus crushed their example and ignorance are most cruelly and unjustly used to feed the flmeof american prejudice whatever serves to remove these difficulties and to smooth the pathway to knowledge is appopriate antislavery work we there lore hail with a thrill of delight this new effort on the pan of the ladies comjioaing the provisional educational committee we must however express the belief that the movement would wear a much more lmpar i nal aspect and meet with greater encourage rnent if other colored persons besides those l born south of masoo and dixons line were included among the beneficiaries there are a great many colored persons at the uorth who cannot understand why fugitives from slavery should be selected out as the objects of special benevolence and educated as ladies while they in our uudt are never thought of having fled from slavery ourselves and been the objects of especial favor as well as of marked hatred we cannot be suspected of a want of sympathy for fugitives ws must also dissent iron the proposition of sending colored teachers into the state of maryland the commutes may sot be aware that therein a law w eitsieoce there which makes it impomwe for colored persons to veturo to that skate after having bstn eta teethe nbeaei frem it the penalty fc ana return is for the fir offence twenty w isrs for the second fire hundred dollars nd n case of inability to pay that sum the iransjjjressor of this barbarous law is liable tobe sold under the

to the porte the suspension of diplomatic intercouse between their courts and that of the tviltan this result having been foreseen caused no surprise the reply of the emperors of russia and anstria is

the d d niggers and raise a mob and then see if be could not get work tbe result has shown that be has fulfilled the first part of bis hellish threat it remains tobe seen whether the ciuieos do not

you are not a btt better than they are they are all a set of thieves an ism certain columbia would be better off if they were all back ia slavery again and the best way i see to get them sway is to burn them out i think they have just as good a right to live and enjoy all the immunities of our town as you or i they all ought to be slaves they were made to obey the bible says so andi am sure vou would not dare to deny the commands of jehovah i am curious to know what part of the bible you get your authority from hand me that bible on the shelf now turn to leviticns th chap and th a th verses and you will find these words you must recollect that this was s command given by almighty god himself thy bondmen and thy bondwomen which thou shall have shall be of the heathen that are around about you of them shall you buy bond men and bondwomen and ye shall tike them as an inheritance for your children after you tu inherit them for a possession they shall be your bondmen for ever now if you can show me where this holy command has been abrogsted why then i will listen to you and not till then and moreover i think american slavery is justified by this one passage alone that i have just read without referring to any more wellnow let us see if the slavery spoken of in the book is a quarter as bad as american slavery slaves in that day went free in the th and sometimes in the th year of their bondage by turning back to leviticus th chap th verse you will find these words and ye shall hallow the th year and proclaim liberty through all the laud unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return everyman unto his family thus you see that there was a limit in those days to slavery which is not the case with american slavery and more than that you cannot show me out of the bible that slaves under the moasic laws were liable tobe sold at auction as they are in this country parents from their childrenhusbands from their wives and so on through the whole family i believe that god approves of human slavery and that the institution is of divine appointment and so care not what you may say to the contrary you may turn fourierite and try to overthrow the word of god but all your efforts will be in vain it has withstood the bhock of ages upon ages the bloodstained banner of christianity will continue to wave over the eternal battlements for time untold yet to come my friend after delivering himself of this pathetic appeal vanished he is an average specimen of a man who considers himself a first rate citizen and goes to church once twice and sometimes three times a week but this is not an uncommon case in our town are to be found caririiansthat have a holy horror of the negro i could name some who if asked to sit down at table to eat with them would turn away indignantly and leave the house but if you told them there was a chance to win fifty or a hundred dollars off them at a gaming table ten chances to one they would jump at it without once turning up their nose or making use of disparaging expressions but it is the way of the world the man that does not feel that christianity andslaveiy are opposed to each other seems to me to be beyond the reach of reason or conviction the principles of universal justice are gaining ground rapidly in our town notwithstanding there are imported occasionally from the south some professional hotspur ora northern doughfaceoffice holder i am aready extending this communication to a too great a length in drawing it to a close i cannot refrain from making some mention of the kind friends of the oppressed in this place and it we are to judge of the past i have no hesitation in saying that the refugee will always find the

accomplished by renewed efforts to change our present corrupt moral sentiment the undersigned members and f riends of the western new york antislavery society again make their appeal to the friends of the slave in behalf of their annual bazaar which will be held in rochester in december next whiiewe have been cheered and gladdened by the progress already made and the good already done and while we rejoice to observe that friends have been raised up to plead the cause of the bondman among persons and in quarters where we had least expected them we still see the harvest to be great and the laborers to be few and instead of relaxing our efforts we are impressed with a sense of the ruty of doubling our diligence and applying more closely our energy to the means of advancing this holy causewe appeal the more boldly to our friends because those for whom we plead cannot plesd for themselves while we are surrounded by our domestic circle with none to molest or make us afraid there are three millions of men and women in our own land doomed to abject slavery and chains robbed of every rightcivilsocial personaland political remembering those in bonds as bound with them we desire to plead their cause as though they were on our own limbs and the knotted lash were applied j to our own backs while to obtain means for enlightening the public mind is the stiong motive for holding our annual fair it is not the only one agreat amount of good may be traced directly to such occasions many who are now active workers in behalf of this holy movement j became first interested in it through the in strumeiitality of those annual exhibitions of antislavery industry tact and skill the present object of the rochester antislavery bazaar is for the general enlightenment of the public mind on the subject of sla very recognizing the north star published in this city as an efficient antislavery instrumentality we propose that the funds raised by the sale of articles at tbe bazaar on behalf of which we here appeal shall be mainly appropriated to the support of that important paper we gaietully acknowledge the prompt assistance rendered to our last f air by our friends and coadjutors in various parts of our own state wisconsin and michigan and we earnestly solicit their continued cooperation with us in the good work that no time maybe lost we especially recommend to them the immediate formation of sewing circles in their various towns with a view to making articles for the rochester bazaar we would also in this connection render our heartfelt thanks to our british friends for the valuable aid extended by them to our last years fair and we would again warmly solicit their generous assistance it t due to our transatlantic friends to say that for much of the interest felt in our last bazaar we were indebted to them and we are persuaded that their continued cooperation will essentially piomote the success of our approaching december bazaar and tbe advgdcement of the cause of the slave in our land we hope that the foregoiog appeal will commend itself to out philanthropic friend on both sides of the atlantic and that they will cordially unite

county ohio to miss angelina adopted daughter of benjamin and sarah brown of pittsburgh several hundred years ago there lived in germany a very gifted and pious artist called george surlin he was especially successful id the production oi sacred pictures and images of saints to which branch of his art he had devoted himself with so much love aud enthusiasm that he could scarcely gel enough to do in it yet he never wanted work or orders for his fame had spread far and near and there were few large churches in the country which did not possets a sacred picture by master george surlin one day as he was seated at work in his studio there came to him some monks emmisaries of the monastery nl blaubeuren in switzerland and asked him whether he would paint a large and beautiful picture lor the altar ol their cloister chapel it was not however to tie painted upon canvass or upon wood but upon the wall back ol tbe altar and george surlin it he would undertake the order must therefore prepare himself for the long journey to blaubeuren he concluded to go not so much on account of the great reward which the abbot of said cloister had promised him but because the reverend lather so valued the limners art and hud sent for him from afar he resolved to devote all his powers and energies to that picture the abbot received the artist with open arms conducted him to a high airy and beautiful chamber the windows of which overlooked a most exquisite landscape and only left his guest to allow him time to rest and sleep in order to enable him to commence his great work as soon as possible w hen the early morning sun cast in its coming a purple line upon the glaciers master surlin was already seated by his window drawing inspiration lrom the glorious works ot nature for his forthcoming great work of art as the painting advanced and more and more approached completion upon the whitewalls of the altar the artist himself became enamored ol his handiwork and at last confessed in his own mind that it was a masterwork of rare beauty and perfection the monks and the abbot himself who was a great connoisseur rejoiced no little that george surlins best picture should adorn their chapel and thus make it an object of envy as well as admiration of the neighboring cloisters they never tired of watching the master at his work and of loading him with praise presents and marks of approbation at last the painting was finished anda solemn service was held to inaugurate the noble work of art the painter then kneeled at the foot of the altar and thanked and praised god who had allowed him to complete his great work and the collected people stared and wondered at the glory of the picture and praised the master hand which hud created it after the mass the abbot addressed the artist and said master you have given us a most rare work of youi beautiful art and you yourself conceive it to be your masterpiece has this labor exhausted your inner resources of design or do you think that you might yet be able to produce even a greater or still more beautiful painting give me an honest answer to my question master surlin the painter who thought of nothing except that the abbot would give him ai new order and who like a true artist on the completion of a great work fell himself imbued with fresh courage and energy for renewed labors replied unhesitatingly that he might venture to make such a promise as art was an inexhaustible lountain ever generating new supplies to her earnest and industrious disciples moreover confined the artist my gratitude to the lord whose mighty arm has assisted me in the work i have just finished urges ine on to attempt a greater and stillmore perfect work to bis praise honorand glory tlie abbot listened to these words ingreat displeasure for it was not his intention to give the master another order but he desired that surlin should never again commence so masterly a work in order that his cloister might have the honor of possessing the best picture by the great master now however be heard to his mortification and anger that master surlin was capable of painting not only an equally good but even a much superior picture and hi foolish vanity revolted at the thought he resorted to a tiend like expedient by which to remain mf possession of george surlins last and best painting on the following night whilst the painter was last asleep the two monks who had accompanied him to switzerland crept to las couch tied his arms with cords and with a sharp knife cutout both his eyes draining the sight that precious font of light and color forever to kill him much as tlie wretched man begged for death as a favor they had not the courage they only circulated a report that the great painter had died on his homeward journey and kept the poor man carefully hidden in a remote cell and now the poor master was forever robbed of glorious light and to the sublime pictures which still lived in his soul he could no longer give life and color lost in mental misery he scarcely noticed the physical tortures and pams he had to undergo it grieved his soul much more to be hencetorth buried in night and never again to be able to distmguish lights and colors one of the monks who was in the daily habit of bringing him a jug of wine and ihe necessary food took pity on the poor mana d adjr emce for your he said wnen he found the painter with his arms open seated by the latticed window of bis cell as iflongmg to rush forth upon the beauteous landscape which be could no longer behold guide me once more to the altar upon which painted my laat picture begged the unfortunate man and the pious brother could not refuse him that reqaect at midnight when the iv bot and the other monka were nelnnp he guided him to the chapel led him toi the foot of the ikar end tkre left him alone promieing to return early in the morning to conduct the painter back to hia cell but the good monk awoke too late on the folloming morning and could not venture to guide the blind men from the church as the other monks would hare perceived it he had barely sufficient time to bide suriiu in a deep wooden confessional chair which had stood unused for a long time behind the altar there the artist had to remain during the whole day and listen to the religious services of the monks secretly his i friend managed at noon to give him some food and promised him to return at night and conduct him back to his cell this he did but the blind paint or had marked the way which led to the church and aa the monks bad gradually omitted to lock his cell since they believed that the poor blind man could not leave his little room without aid he stole every evening to the church prayed in front of the altar and then passed a great part of the time in the wooden confessional where he worked silently and mysteriously upon his couch be had found the kuile which the monks had used to blind him and iu the intenseness of his pains and misery the unhappy man was upon the point of making that weapon the instrument of suicide but an invisible hand restrained him from committing this great sin which would have made him truly deserving of all the misery he had endured heaven never had given him the rare ability of conceiving his glorious pictures to allow him to commit a deadly sin because the power of representing his fancies on canvas was lost to him for ever he was frightened at his own cowardly intentions and determined now to make the instrument of death the instrument of his future consolation ashe could no longer represent his designs in colors he began to cut them in wood and his sense of feeling became a substitute for the sense oi sight with the sharp knife he had obtained and after an immense deal of labor he thus cut the whole history of his misfortune upon the wooden side of the confesional he spent many years upon this labor and forgot his misery in the employment no one discovered his nightly walks nor hie work in the church and gradually the monks felt so secure that they opened the chiirch to any and every strangei who desired to see george surlins fas and bqst picture often at these times was the pool blind artist a silent and unsuspected witness of the admiration bestowed upon his work by foreign artists none oi whom ever dreamed that the master whose genius was so warmly lauded by them whose rare talent they so envied was hidden a blind and wretched old man behind the altar working with indefatigable patience upon a wooden pic ture from the day when his carved picture was finished he remained silently and patiently awaiting his end which came on the third day delivering hin from all earthly pain and sorrow am now only could the monks breatht more freely for the silent lunatic foi such they believed him be when the saw him so often and without a murmur seeming with sightless eyes t stare upon vacancythat silent lunatic now lay deep beneath the sod anc with him the fearful secret of theii guilt was buried nor did they spar masses for his soul to procure for the poor artist whom they had robbed o all the good and beautiful in life happiness in death and heavenly rest ai they in their mental blindness though their masses could do the woodei confessional however was never opened and thus nobody discovered the las work of the blind artist meanwhile the abbot had easily succeeded in exciting the jealousy and envy of other monasteries for the beau titul painting that adorned the altar o his many foreign artists and high noble gentlemen came from far and near to look upon this rare work of art am all regretted the early death of thi great master it happened that one day a traveller visited the monastery who coul scarcely leave the altar or stop gaziug so great was his admiration of th painting nothing escaped his attention or notice and thus it chanced tha he observed a beautifully carved rose upon the pannel of the door of an ole wooden confessional the door am the whole confessional chair were s dustcovered that it was evident the had not been used by the monks for many years besides the greatest painter yoi seem tohave had one of the greates carvers at work here he said in i tone of astonishment to the monk wh accompanied him the rose was in reality a masterpiece in its way hii companion however assured him tha there was no carved or sculpturewort any where in the church and that tht rose must have come there by some unaccountable accident this reply excited the strangers cu riositv still more and he opened thi door of the confessional to see whethei he could find any more carved work b the same masterhand that had executed the rose at tirst the door wouk not open for the old hinges had rusted but at last they yielded sending a creaking and ominous sound througl the chapel the stranger entered tha chair and stepped upon a hard substance which rattled over the fiaga raising it he observed that it was a knife which bore old blotches of moos upon its blade the monk waagreatlj frightened for he it once recognizee the knife as having been one of the twe w hich had been used in the torture othe unfortunate artist how could thal knife have come to this place wau it through a miracle in order to bring now after so many years had elapsed that black deed to light and its perpetrators to justice the length of time had loosed ike panels from the framework of the confessional and as it seemed to the stranger that be copid even in the dusk discover some carving of merit than he raiaed the paoel took it owl and brought it te the tight r it u and no terror end tear betel the mk who had already been horrified at the mffctwltfco knife aod he ruabed from the chapel exclaiming lbiiigiittihfffaheffwi thegrave to acceeehiemurdereie the at ranger now perceived that ic hia hood be held the picture of a man who had been deprived of both eyes as drops of blood seemed to tall upon the cheeks from the sightless sockets his face wore the expression of intents misery sad seemed to implore mercy of two monks who were standing before him one of theae atili held a knife in hia band wbilat tba other whose face expressed a fiendish triumph wai breaking his pallet and brushes there could not be s moments doubl of the import and meaning of this picture nor was the master hand which had painted the altarpiece to be mistaken in the grouping and formation ol these carved figures the strangei needed not the additional evidence ol the exclamations of the frightened monk to understand the connection ol the whole terrible mystery hastily he left the monastery and took the carved picture with him bui he soon returned with a long train and the officers of justice whom he had sought soon forced a confession of theii fearful and wicked deed from the monks these were punished with the utmost rigor of justice and in memory of their wickedness the wonderfully carved panel was inserted in the dooi of the vestry where it may be seen tc this day from the southern christian advocate an original letter of dr franklin messrs editorsln my reading have fallen upon the following original letter from dr b franklin the occasion of its production seems to be the following after the emancipation oi the north american states from the civi and ecclesiastical power of the britisli crown the few remaining clergymen of the episcopal church wishing to perpetuate the office of the episcopate sent some of their brethren to england to obtain from the british king parliament and archbishop of canterbury episcopal prerogatives in this attempt they met with many difficulties and for sympathy and help they wrote to dr franklin the then american minister at the court of france the following is his reply to messrs weems and grant citizens of the united states in london paris th july gentlemen on receipt of your letter acquainting me that the archbishop of canterbury would not permit you tc be ordained unless you took the oath ol allegiance i applied to a clergyman ol my acquaintance for information on the subject of your obtaining ordination here his opinion was that it could be done and that if it were done you would be required to vow obedience tc the archbishop of paris i next inquired of the popes nuncio whether you might not be ordained by the bishop ol america powers being sent him for the purposerif he had them not already the answer was the thing is impossible unless the gentlemen become catholics this is an affair of which i know but very little and therefore i may ask questions and propose means that are improper or impracticable but whal is the necessity of your being connected with the church of england would it not do as well if you were of the church of ireland the religion is the same though there is a different set of bishops and archbishops perhaps if you were to apply to the bishop of derry who is a man of liberal sentiments he might give you orders as oi that church if both britain and ireland refuse you and i am not sure that the bishop of denmark or sweden would ordain you unless you became lutherans what is then to be done next to becoming presbyterians the episcopalian clergy of america in my humble opinion cannot do much better than to follow the example of the first clergy of scotland soon after the conversion of that country to christianity when their king had built the cathedral of st andrews and requested the king of northumberland to lend his bishops to ordain one of them that their clergy might not as heretofore be obliged to go to northumberland for orders and their request was refuced they assembled in the cathedral and the mitre crosier and robes of a bishop being laid upon the altar they after earnest prayers for direction in their choice elected one of their own number when the king said to him arise go to the altar and receive your office at the hand of god his brethren led him to the altar robed him put the crosier in his hand and lie became the first bishop o scotland if the british islands were sunk in the sea and the surfqpe of the globe has suffered great changes you would probably take some such method as this and if they persist in denying your ordination it is the same thing a hundred years hence when people are more enlightened it will be wondered at that men in america qualified by their learning and piety to pray for and instruct their neighbors should not be permitted to do it till they had madea voyage of six thousand miles out and home to ask leave of a cross old gentleman at canterbury who seems by your account to have as little regard for the souls of the people of maryland as king williams attorney general seymour had for those of virginia the rev commisaary who projected the college of that province and was in england to solicit benefactions and a charter relates that the queen in the kinga absence having ordered seymour to draw up the charter which waa to be given with in money m opposed the grant saying that the nation was engaged in an expensive war that the money was wanted for bettor purposes and he did not see the ieast occasion for a college in virgin r represented to him that its intention waa to educate and qualify young men to be ministers of the gospel much wanted there and begged mr attorney would consider that the people of virginia had souls to be saved aa well as those of england
