i have not forgotten the promise that i made you before leaving america lo give you a letter occasionally for the liberator v on have doubtless learned t ie this that the steamer m which came over made i he shortest passage ever known phis need not inform you added much to the pleasure of the voyage among the unusually large number of passengers on hoard were iuur or five slaveholders and among these was a judge chinn a louisiana slaveholder who had been appointed by our democratic government nsj consul to naples and who was on his way out to occupy his post the steamer had scarcely left the shore before it was rumored that an american slave was on board and that he was going out aw a delegate to the peace congress at paris the latter part of the rumor gave additional interest to it and soon there was no little anxiety nini lested on the part of passengers to know soup thing o the history of the ugitive mv narrativea fw copies of which i iiad with me was sought alter and extensively read the reading of which jiiodueed considerable sensation among flu passengers especially the sluve huldnig and proslavery portion of them i bis judge chinn had with him a free colored man as servant and was somewhat anxious to know what kindu protection be was to receive in travelling in this country for you will recollect that i made application to john m layton before leaving america lor a passport which was refused ine so upou inquiring of tins servant lie showed ine his passpor which proved to he nothing less than a regular passport from the hand of the secretary of state true it was not from mr clayton but it was from his immediate predecessor mr buchanan this proves conclusively that if a colored person wishes the protection of the u states government in going into any foreign country be must not think of going in any other capacity than that of a bootblack wherever the colored man gots he must carry w ith him the badge oflavery to receive the protection of the americans the act of government m denying to its colored citizens the same protection that it extends to the w lutes is more cowardly and mean it possible than any act committed for years but it is entirely in keeping with american republicanism i am glui io see that the english press generally has denounced this act of highhanded injustice and oppression pas you are aware the congress met on wednesday the d at i oclock and strange to say among the first tnut saw on entering the hall were ihree slaveholders w ho caino over in the auie steamer with me one ol whom was judge chinn but whether they wt re members of the cougress or uot i am unable to say at any rate they wn supplied with the same card ol admission that members had however they did not show any symptoms of colorphobla so natural to the american taste a circumstance occurred ti the close of the first session which imws how easily americans can lay vmth their prejudices when they reach lns country while i was in conversation with richard cobden esq member of the brgisli parliament and ictor hugo the president of the con liicss observed a man standing near hi whom i recognized as one of the poengerh mi tin same steamer wilh me iron america and who during the k oyae was not at all backward in ex kug his belief in the inferiority ol niggers ad who would not deign j to me during lb whole pas at the close of the conversation jtftl was leaving the parties with the north star whom had bcn talking this man advanced towards me with his bat in one hand and the olhor extended out and addressed me with how do you do mr brown i hope i find yau well sir why sir you have the advantage of mel do not know you why sirsaid he dont you know me i was a fellow passenger with you from america i wish you would introduce me to mr cobden i felt so indignant at the downright impudence of the fellow that i left him without making any reply the change from an american to an european atmosphere makes a wonderful change in the minds of americans the man who would not have shaken hands with me in the city of new y ork or boston with a pair of tongs ten feet long comes to me iu thefl metropolis of france and claims that we were rica m de tocqueville minister ot foreign affairs gave a splendid soiree to the members of the congress i perceived no difference vvhatevey in the attention paid to those of a fairer complexion than that paid to me i could but contrast the feeling that pervaded that assembly of men and women from all parts of the globe to the low mean and contemptible prejudice so common in the united states here were representatives and ministers plenipotentiary from all governments including the united states messrs walsh and rush were there and you know that they are proverbial for their proslavery feeling the whites and blacks were all together and i did not hear the word nigger once if there was any difference paid to one more than another that difference was certainly paid to myself not on account of my complexion but on account of my identity with the oppressed millions in america on being presented to madame de tocqueville i was received with the same courtesy that characterized the reception of others but as soon as it was mentioned to the distinguished lady that j was an american slave all conventionalities were laid aside by a cordial shake of the hand that gave me j double assurance that was not only safe from the slavehunter in paris but that was a welcome guest in the saloon of the french minister of foreign affairs while there i could but think of hie bitter cold night in the winter of when i xvas compelled to w alk the deck of the steamer swallow n the hudson river on account of my complexion i could hut think of my being excluded from the saloon of the steamer huntress on the passage from portland to bath in the slate of maine but a few days before i left america by w hich exclusion i was compelled to fast twelve bourn from the concord iml democrat survey of the

killed a fearful empire does he yet wield over the bodies and souls of men terribly will he straggle to recover the ground he has i lost and to subject again the government and the country to his

it we are now strong it is because our vigilance activity and fidelity to principle have made us strong if we have repulsed the advances of slavery and compelled its natural allies to sue for peace it

on siaetry to the massachuuftti convention of congregational mm liters slavery aggressive we h ave called the period of the adoption of the federal constitution a crisis in the history of slavery because at that time the slavepower which has since made such formidable usurpations was a trembling petitioner for the license to exist even at alla reference to the madison papers w ill show that a continuance of the slavetrade till the year was conceded to the clamors of south carolina and georgia and we think it clear even from such fragments as remain to us of the debates of the federal convention that a majority of the members of that body looked upon the extinction of the slavetrade and slavery as synonymous and it was universally supposed at that time that the number of slaves could only be kept from diminishing by fresh impoitations for this reason the word slave was carefully excluded from the constitution that when human bondage became a thing of the past no trace ot its existence even much less suspicion of it connivance shrnrld leave its slain upon that instrument i think it wrong to admit in the constitution the idea that there can he property in mani so said mr madison in the convention and in so saying he echoed the sentiments of a large majority of the members from all sections of the coun try throughout the debates on the slavery clauses of the constitution it j is very clear that the advocates of slavery actede ntirelv on the defensive it could not well be otherwise since nl most every statesman eminent in those early days of the republic has left on record his unqualified condemnation of the system some of the heartiest dei nouncers of slavery were from maryland and virginia butin the thirtythree years which j lad elapsed between the adoption of ihe federal constitution and the admission of missouri the posture of affairs had entirely changed slavery now for the first time became aggressive and the protection of liberty which was intended to he the rule of our government had grown to be the rare exception by the stopping of the foreign slavetrade and the stimulus which the domestic traffideceived from the increase of territory maryland and irginta had been seduced from their allegiance to higher and humane sentiments and had already become the guinea coast of america the admission of missouri by what was falsely termed a compromise lor there can he no compromise with what is absolutely wrong no iruce bytween god and satanthrew at the prestige of victory and a control of balance of power upon the side of the

inode of servitude which have existed among other nations and in other ages of the world we find that although agreeing with some of them iu many particulars it differs in one important point from them all slavery where ever aud whenever it has elsewhere existed has been as impartial as death there was no one whom the chances of fortune or war might not one day or other reduce to bondage but

premises i have much more apprehension from an agitation of this and kindred quesj tions in congress at this session than from any question relating to foreign nations that may arise in a century i fear that mr calhoun is about to make a final effort under some fatal impulse to throw a portion of the southern states out of the union whether he will succeed or not this will probably bej  his last

fruits of a proslavery religion a washington correspondent of the cleveland true democrat describing an interview withthos c mcdonald esq u s consul at st catharines for some months past and bearer of despatches from the american legation at rio de janeiro to our government atwashington says y r hat interested us most deeply was his description of the extent and horrors of slavery and the slave trade on that coast not less than thirty or forty thousand are brought there annually and the mass of them in american vessels under the american flag on the african coast disguised elsewhere and what is worse these vessels arc ned and controlled by americans citizens of jvew england ayrwlrtmvhat is rtlore than all by professing christians oj yew england y es i write it with shame and sorrow one vessel which he saw and named to us was owned and controlled by the rev mr baptist minister in the village of in massachusetts well said mr mcdonald slavery is a shame and disgrace to our nation we are the derision of other na tionsthe english taunt us for it surely the great doctors of new england theology who have been teaching for years that slavery is no violation of the christian faith or church and that christianity not only permits but sometimes requires its believers to become slaveholders maynow congratulate themselves that their seed is bringing forth fruit after its kind how the tender and endnring human love shown in the following incident related by mr mcdonald contrasts with the trateful and hollow selfishness of those pretended christians and christian ministers of new england one sabbath while a group of colored people were assembled in tront ofa church cathobc an old negro of shabby appearance carrying a bundle approached and made some inquiry a middleaged man

that position mr cobb is named as an available man and his refusal to sign the southern address is referred to as an indicative of liberal views on the slavery question which should commend him to northern suffrages l but if he will not answer there is ex governor mcdowell whose antislavery speeches during the agitation of the j slavery question in y irginia in and whose strong opposition to

condition than any efforts now making are likely to do but here must close as in a few minutes it will be too late to reach in time lor the paper f  a californiaanother compromise the very unexpected intelligence received a loitnight ago from california that the convention assembled at monterey had agreed upon a constitution by which slavery and involuntary servitude flicept for dime should be for ever excluded from the state of california lias been on all hands looked upon with distrust it was thought too good news to be true the more one leflects upon the circumstances in which that form of constitution was agreed to the more suspicious does the case appear ist the section of the constitution excluding slavery was agreed toat once unanimously and without discussion i bis to say the least was very singular the convention was composed of fortyeight memberstwentyfive from the southern statessome of them known slaveholders ami twenty three from the northern states all ot whom it cannot be supposed were very fine nends of freedom nd the opinion ol the smth with respect to slavery in california has not been kept secret reverdy johnson we conceive expressed it when he aid that the climate and soil are well adapted in slaveiy and that it must and would i tn aiilornia at all political meetings in the southern states the rightnot only the unfit but tbe determination ot slavehol dels in can v tlo ir property to california has for the last twelve months been one of the mo i productive topics of declamation mj slaves have lieen carried into california under the impression that they would he assate to their owners there as in any of the slave stales and they are there now and doubtless slaves still lastly the place i where tbe convention was heldnamely monterey is fai distant troin the centre of pop nai tun and peculiarly accessible to government officials patronage and influence how under all these circumstances so peculiarly encouraging to opposition the antitlavety section refeired to could he allowed to pass without discussion and unanimously remains a mystery still further the doings of the administration icspecting california with scarcely an attempt at dissimulation have all pointed toa different icault the head of the administration is currently reported and there has been nothing in his course before ot aince hia election to the presidential chair which a fords any contradiction to the report when at the beginning of march laat a bill tot the establishment of a government in california tn which there was no provision against slavery was before the house to have uaed his influence hi favor ot the measure the nu melons officers and agents sent by the government iu california have been without a known exception if not strongly biased in favor ot slavery at heat negative on the subject and of course ready to fall in with any scheme however iniquitous which was thought to have the sanction of their principals at home but especially by the appointment ef mi king of georgia a doubledyed slaveholder and au unblushing advocate of slavery to what was named a mioeralogtcal survey but what seems now to have been a secret political mission has the administration given evidence of its intentions on the subject of slavery in california have the intentions of government been fiu strafed if slavery by the action of the i onvenijon is forever excluded from caltfor nia they undoubtedly have dm that such will nut be the case is now abundantly appa tent the slaveiy members of the convention probably knew ibis and therefore did net manifest any anxiety on the subject but the late news from california requires confirmation it is possible that the action of the committee may be tsverged by the final action ot the t onveqtioc it is also possible that california with us present boundary will be admitted into the union as a free stale we v this s possible but we are not saa guiie enough to think that tl is likely sla veiy baa never yet tailed citherby open or cancelled measures to get all that it has ask i ed and it will not tail now what it casual accomplish by chicanery sad conning it will accomplish by bravado and bluster

chacaeaeostic at the accomplished puktimnn they have sees fit to j change their optmoe upon stale law their position is not now the cemparauvelt modes me that etch state must decide for itd whether or not it will admit slavery but ths the people of california and of course of every othea territory of the uehed states hav oe more rifht to exclude slavery than con gross has and that not until california ha become a state has she any right to regular her domestic policy immediately on lb heels of this southern manifesto appear pat agraphs in tap official papers from the ash iegton letter writers proposing a compru mice it is discovered that california willits praaant boundary is too large for on stale that it must be divided into three au that a bill will be inttoduced into the senate

nothing more than the usu gossip with which w ashing ton correspondent amuse their readers but in the circumstance they carry only a too sorrowful air of probi bility mpnwhile the papers are full of thi rumored compromise and what is rather remarkable the whigs are unusually busy gi ing currency to the explosions of souther bluster and in magnifying their importance and the danger likely to accrue if the demand of the south are resisted coupled alway with the expression of a hope that no cans will supervene to endanger the harmony othe union the fears and suspicions expressed above may be unfounded we fervently pray tha they may be but in judging of the acts n slaveholders and calculating the probability of slavery extension experience has showi that it is impossible to be ovei cautious am fearful compromise is the american hobby the chance in favor of a whole measure where a compromise can be effected is a ver small one the excuse for ibis new compto mise if one should be made will be the danger of dismemberment we are sorry to bi compelled to confess that we do not imagim this danger to be nearly so great as mam doughface northerners would have it believed fbr our part we should be happy to bi delivered from the burden curse and innder able shame of every slave state in the union the not them states would jose nothing and gain much by such a result ttu this

man we dared not run the risk as t the proviso mentioned by the eagle we an fully aware of its impoi lance we shouli have imagined however that uhenthpedi tot was on the subject of provisoes he might with gieal propriety have added one or tvvi more he might for example have require an assurance from us previous to granting th great fawn of an exchange with his lilliputian sheet that we were over

or norman blood in our veins all these conditions the editor of the eagl might have required they are all to ou thinking quite as germane to the case of ou ability to make a good newspaper as the very

the countenances of our fellow travelers how their brows knitted with astonishment when then eyes fell on the happy face of the child and they made the discovery that hia skin was dark reproach and scorn were next depicted on those unhappy haggard anxious faces and they looked at us with an expression that said who on earth are you one person daring the day having more christian charity than his neighbors thinking that we did not look quite out of out minds suggested the query was the little boy lor sale the boy was happily unconscious of his color being anything to be mar vclef at and looked all his enemies in the face with the puie trust and confidence ol childhood we reached albanv in due time and the steamboat oregon was awaiting the train we started down the hudson river about past oclock and the general saloon becamtttl once the scene of excitement there were two white ladies and a little colored child in company of course the lad could not joinus at the suppet table we weie not disposed to fight the battle on this occasion so we went down without him we had the privilege of sendingour little friend some supper and he we suppose on accounl of his tender age had the privilege of eating it in the saloon where have they picked him up w s the question whispered by all ye however were much fatigued with out long days journey and soon put an end to the scene by retiring to our sleeping apartment we have met since our arrival in this city with an instance of colorphobla in a quartei where we least expected it we accompanied a friend to visit the asylum for the blind and there wc most certainly encountered blindness of a twofold nature a death had occurred in the establishment on the day wt visited it and we were consequently informed that we could not then go over the institution but feeling tired with our walk we seated ourselves in the pailor where there were six or eight young ladies inmates of the institution at work we were introduced as fneods from england and chatted with these blind ladies during our stay we asked several questions about the establishment its rules and regulations who were numbered among its distinguished visitors the names el henry clay and lewis cass were mentioned just as we were preparing to leave one ol our party asked are blind colored children admitted here some say that the eyes are the seat of expression but could you have beheld the malevolence and animosity evidenced in those sightless faces on this question being put you would not be of that opinion we never used to have colored people was the rejoinder now we have five or six but ihey are not allowed to board in this establishment and we never associate with them they are kept by themselves and are taught separately then followed on the part uf these young ladies a simultaneous hurst of indignation against the colored people in general suppressed murmurs that they had ever been brought from africa the trouble they cause in this country and vehement declarations that they would never sit at table with colored people and on no account would they consentjto marry one of them one of out party endeavored to impress upon the minds of these doubly blind ladies the extreme folly and sin of their present cruel prejudice against their colored brethren aud sisters and we trust that our visit to the blind asylum has not

states to central america giving a brief account of some antiquarian researches in which he has heen engaged although i have been much occupied with otficial business says mr squier i have in the intervals whicli ottered during the progress of my negotiations and since their termination been able to pay some attention to the antiquities of the country i have succeeded to an eminent degree in obtaining the coniidence of the indians and have secured some of their vocabularies in fact the indian pueblo ol subtiava has presented me a formal address written in tho aboriginal tongue and would rise in arms tomorrow at mjr call in presenting it the spokesman exclaimed with startling emphasis the spaniards have had their feet on our necks very long we hope the sons of washington will overwhelm them as they have us we hate then it sounded strange to hear the indian talk of washington but his name familiar in every rancho and haiti sons ol washington is a common salutation from barefooted inotut on the toed tbs indians or subtiava have dug up for me a number of their idols and are now exhuming more they impose but one condition that i shall have no spaniard with me when i go to see them and shall keep the ocalities secret these idols though much emalter cloeely resemble those of copan in workmanship and were no doubt dedicated to the same or avery similar purpose have eight in my possession ranging from five and a half to eight feet in height and from four to five in circumference the laces of most are mutilatedan evidence of the fanatical zeal of the early spaniard who waged a war of extermination upon the superstitions of the aborigines they did not however aueceed in eradicating them for they are blended in a singular manner and no ineonsiderabie proportion with the calboiis rites imposed by the con qeeroas uetty an indian within the sound of the bells af the cathedral offers his libation of title ground parched corn and sugar mixed with water to the gods of the fields for the success of his crops end secretly burns gums from the forest before an earthen idol or a caned atone carefully hidden from the scrutiny of the priest in some obscure corner of his hut upon these matters they however maintain all the reserve of the indians of the north strengthened by fear of exposure to the rigors of the priesthood some of the statues to which i have referred have the same elaborate headdresses with others ot copan one bears a shield upon his arm and still another has risen above its head the sculptured head of an alligator all are very ancient and the places of their deposits have been handed down from one gene tion to another the fragments oi many are to ho found within a few miles ol leon and there must originally have been a great number scattered over the country perhaps the most remarkable locality with the exception of the island ol ometpe in lake nicaragua is the island of momotnmbita in the lake ol monagua i paid a visit to this island early in july it is a beautiful volcanic dome rising with all the symmetry ola sugar loaf from the midst of the lake before it towers the great volcano ol motnotombo from the bare and blackened summit of which still rises the smoke of internal fires momotombita is indeed a remarkable island and the traveliar who gazes upon it from the shore of the lake is not surprised to learn that under the shadows and amidst the gloom of its dense forests fringed by the stems of ages stand the rude and frownfng statues of the gods of aboriginal superstition many of these have been removed and are scattered over the country and some i believe have been sent abroad a number still remains but the largest of all i brought away with me at the cost of a days bard labor and at great risk in passing miles upon the lake and in a gusty night and a boat scarce able to sustain tiie great weight this bad resisted the exertions of imen on one occasion after moving it a few rods they bad abandoned it in despair the boatmen thought me mad and crossed themselves devoutly when proposed to carry it away they offered prayers on the lake and made vows after breaking down one or two carts finally got it to this city in safely and shipped it with ten or a dozen more via kialejo and cape hope for washington but to return it seems that there were originally some thirty or forty of these statues of various sizes and more or less elaborately carved arranged in one place in the form of asquare all looking inwards the dimensions of the square cannot now be ascertained hut the few remaining figures and fragments show that the statement is correct it is a singular fact and another evidence of the prevalence in america of the doctrine ol the two reciprocal principles of nature the active and passive male and female that these figures were represented some as male and some as female the indians of i honduras says herrara wprshidken two images male and female vvich they call the great father and the great mother and of which he says a little further on the sun and the moon were also representatives i have heard ol other localities similar to this which propose to visit and shall therefore not repeat what was told me concerning them must not however forget to mention that there has lately been discovered in the province ot vera paz miles northeast of guatemala buried in a dense forest and far from any settlements a ruined city surpassing copan or palenque in extent and mag nificenceand displaying a degree of art to which none of the structures of yucatan can lay claim the government of guatemala sent a commission to examine it hut their investigations were soon interrupted by the civil commotions of the country and they were only able to bring away some rude plans and imperfect drawings shall go there as soon as my duties will pea mit learn also of other interesting monuments near by in honduras and san salvador of which no public mention has has yet been made i shall pay all the attention i can to these although there is too much for manto hope to do well but here goes notwithstanding victor hugo the celebrated poet dramatist and j novelist is a short man of apparently i thirtyfive although he must be considerably older than lie appears inform he is full in stature low his bead seems vastly disproportioned toi bis body the forehead is immense and w hite as snow although he is not bald his hair is black complexion blonde mouth nose and chin small aswell as his eyes which are dark and overhung by the brow expression thoughtful and rather sad his neck is so short and his shoulders so broad j that he seems to wear his monstrous head like the patagonians between his shoulders nverthelcss hugo has by no raetun an ugly or uninteresting person fits dressand one may aswell attempt to sketch the outline of ahorse without his hide as to convey the least idea of a man without his dresswas a dark blue pants and white vest with cotytir a la byron this matter of the collar is peculiarity in paris everybody wears a standing collar except hugo and montalem hert and almost every one but these wears short hair hugo seemed always extremely busy when i was in the chamber reading pamphlets or opening and reading letters and answering them and at the same time laughing and chatting with great animation and humor to the numerous members who called at his desk as a man of genius and letters victor hugo stands in the very first rank in france as a legis latoros a popular speaker however he seems not to have been se entirely successful how much of this ill success has been owing to that absence of practical ability which men of genius often exhibit in tbe management or discussion of public attain and how much has been owing to tbst feeling of jealousy so eften exhibited by proctieal men st any infringement of men of letters upon what they deem thpir prerogatives is not easily determined it however very certain that the grtti poet was by no means toeceanl to his first appearance in the tribune and that itc has not been there since a caricature of hugo has recently caused some little merriment as it baa collected a crowd at the windows of the firint shops it presents a short fat ittle man with a huge head sattiog ina contemplative attitude pen in hand upon a pile of boohs lettered poetry romance drama re these booki rest upon a cheat filled with bags am labelled rentes hugo is wealthy upon this pile of books sits the little man with a big head hia elbow reposing against the towers of notre dank one heel resting on the dome of the french academy and the other upon the theatre frauaais while on bin right is porte st mart me in the background are caught glimpaea of the most unearthly objects that one would suppose even the imagination of the prince of horrors could evoke there are various amusing pendptus to the piece for instance a swum of little are striving to climb the great poets legs and to kiss the soles of his boots the application of the caricature to hugo is easy at paris e stuffing and smoking e dr culverwell says that medically speaking snuffing and smoking ared both abominably unwholsome they are delightful relaxations personally e speaking for i have been a snuffer and a smoker can bear witness to the great comfort and satisfaction i have derived from thema cigar during an evening stroll is highly agreeable and companionable but it is habit only which renders it necessary it is pleasant admit and indies do likewise to catch the whiffs of a fine havana on a frosty night of an outdoor walk nor do i object ene tering a bachelors crib where only real tobacco is going onbut a five minutes stay therein is enough to those hom smoking causes to spit it is productive of great depression and considerable nervous irritability to those who say they swallow their saliva it is equally pernicious to those who are insensible to secretion it acts locally and its influence is conveyed by the nervous extremities to the brain it would appear illnatured and cynical to forbid a solitary cigar but as in i this page i have only to do with its salutariness i cannot speak in its favor i have never suffered from it may say someone welland good i do not forbid you taking one but it surely cannot be wholesome for those who do besides what is agreeable itis very difficult to believe can be hurtful nevertheless it may be so and smoking in the majority ofinstances i am convinced is so what is the property of tobacco sedative stupefying creative of vomiting and if swallowed in the form of an infusion poisonous let any man ask himself after spitting and puffing if he feel better for it the reply generally is oh it is so soothingit gives rise to such agreeable thoughtsit carries the mind back to the pastit makes a man comfortable even in bis troubles how happy r every one appears with a cigar or a pipe in his mouth from the lord to the basketwomana geat deal of this may be true but on the other hand the great smoker is generally shaky and nervous and like the drinker never happy hut when engaged in his favorite propensity of what use is he then to anybody or even to himself none the little smoker the occasional smoke breather before he gets through his first or give him credit for two or three is left with a drymouth and a nasty taste a desire to drink and although some will deny that smoking provokes drinking ex copt coffee or water few can dispense with grog ale or wine other people it muddles makes them swimmy and very disagreeable to talk to many men smoke twenty or thirty cigars or pipes in a day and a youngtown buck thinks it derogatary to his buckhood unless he can whiff away two or three to say nothing of the nuisance of smoking the habit captivating and socializing as it may beheld to be is decidedly bad very bad for delicate persons as to chewing it is an expensive habit it is so beastly a one that there is little fear of an invalid resorting to it it is equally pernicious nay more so then smok ing snuffing is sometimes used medicinally and with much success light i stimulative snuffs are useful in the affections of the head and eyes and asa gentle refresher i have no objection to it but real snuffing where a mani consumes half an ounce daily and soils half a dozen pockethandkerchiefs in the twentyfour hours for those sort of snuffers awake purposely at night to take a pinch is i contend very enerl yating very depressing except at the intermediate moment and extremely hurtful even to digestion for despite all the precaution the snuff or its juice bah will get down the gullet halt a dozen pinches after dinner are allowable young men should particularly avoid becoming snuffers avery short indulgence makes them look ten years older these habits are very easy to acquire and very difficult to leave off but it is not as some people say dangerous to abandon them at the eleventh hour of your life mayhap such may not be necessary but i have known people give up amoving and snuffing which they bad indulged in for years af a moments notice and those people have been my patients and they have sooo found mason to thank mo for the advice op a ciaiy a deputy of his statnic majesty cal limg on i catholic rsikst the reverend father geiburg acatholic priestsays a late german paperwas lately awoke early in the morning by his servant who said that a visitor was iu the room below and wanted to see him immediately the good priect not feeling very well or being reluctant to leave his downy couch at so early an hour sent down to know the business of the caller but was told that as it was a matter of the most vital importance it would only be cotnmunicatud to mr geiburg himself the servant described bin as a well dressed gentlemanly person and this induced the priest to bare him sent ap to his bedroom so that after the business was settled be might consign himself for a few more boors to the arms of somnus it was however otherwise fated sleep did that morning no more refresh the energies of the fat priest the visitor was ushered in and took a seat near the bed side m whom bare i the honor of addressing said mr geiberg you see before you the most miserable man waa the answer whilst the visitor went to the door and locked it inside so as to prevent intrusion explain sir explaio begged the priest probably having visions of comfort of religion absolution and a well lined purse my errand is a most painful one returned the stranger painful both tome and to yourself but my mind is made up and it must be done he goes for a confession thought the priest know then sir continued the stranger that last night i was asis my custom busily engaged iu reading the word of god i was not only reading it but also interpreted it tomy self and derived much consolation from it it was near midnight when i read of the evil spirit how it in former times appeared to men i could not believe itl could not conceive how the almighty ruler in his wisdom could create a power to tempt and mislead weak mankind the priest by this time must have got much interested presently resumed the stranger i heard a noise in my room and looking round j observed that i was no longer alone the evil spirit was with mehe stood immediately behind my chair unhappy man said he in a deep voice to disbelieve the word of god i knelt down but he commanded me to rise rise continued he no peace no rest shalt thou have no comfort no happiness shalt thou know until by thy hands one of those who preach and sin against me lias suffered death with these words the spirit disappeared and to save my soul from perdition have come to obey himyou must die the reverend gentleman must have been awfully confounded by this disclosure he preserved bis presence of mind and at once proposed to sacrifice another priest instead of him to which his visitor demurred the mani acfor such he wasand mr gei berg had of course discovered it then beckoned to him to get up at the same time taking from his pocket a good sized knite the priest then coolly asked him to he allowed to dress speaking of his death as a matter of course and talking very loudly that his servant who was in tho habit of listening might hear him the servant did hear him too hut was too frightened to move the maniac begged him to hasten and the awful moment seemed to be drawing near when the priest hit upon the lucky idea of suggesting the propriety of taking down a summary of the proceedings on paper to which the visitor agreed and putting own his knife on the dressing table set about writing down the commands of satan and how he was going to obey them mr geiberg coolly examined the knife and tellingthe maniac that it was scarcely sharp enough asked if he had not another the answer was that he had nothing else hut that the priest would perhaps oblige him with a razor which foolish request was scarcely made when the good father threw the knife out of the window and shouted for help a rough and tumble fight then commenced between the two the maniac looking about for some destructive weapon hut finding none he had nearly strangled the father with his hands before assistance came the maniac was secured and taken j back to an asylum from which lie had only escaped the day before the servant who had listened all the while was so overpowered that she had fainted and the loud shouts of the priest were heart by people in the street who thus opportunely saved him from death the shark charmers no sum of money however large no
