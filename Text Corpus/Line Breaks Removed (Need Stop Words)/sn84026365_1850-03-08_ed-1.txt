speech of mr t stevens of pennsylvania in the house of representatives wednesday february in committee of the whole on the state of the union on the reference of the presidents annual message mr stevens of pennsylvania said mr chairman i do not know that i should have troubled the committee at this time eow i ee nnv reasonable prospect that the house would devote its time to practical legislation but for a considerable time after our meeting the organization of the house was obstructed and siuce organized a large portion of its time has been occupied by speeches on the subject of slavery mostly by southern gentlemen i when no practical question to which i they could apply was before the committee there was no doubt a well defined object in this partly to intimidate congress and partly to occupy its time so that no legislation couid be matured obnoxious to southern gentlemen indeed we are not left to conjecture on this point the learned gentlemen from north carolina mr j cungman who was selected to open the debate in behalfof human bondage distinctly notified us that unless congress as a condition precedent submitted to settle the slavery question according to southern demands there should be no legislation even to the passage of the ordinary appropriation bills necessary to sustain the government and that such measures would not he obstructed by meeting them in manly debate and voting on their merits but by incessantly calling the yeas and nays on repeated and frivolous motions to adjourn until the end of the session sir i doubt not that before he ventured on so high a threat he had full assurances from a sufficient number of southern gentlemen to carry it into effect for if he had made it upon his own hare authority it would degenerate into contemptible gasconade which i am sure the disereet gentlemen would not indulge in the scene of last monday in this house fully sustained him and showed that they had the will and the power to execute it here then we have a welidefined and palpable conspiracy of southern members combined to stop the supplies necessary to the existence of the government disorganize and dissolve it until the bands that bind the union together are severed and as a gentlemen early in the session desired discord well might the gentlemen anticipate that the country and posterity would pronounce this treason rank treason against the nation sir i doubt if there is another legislative body in the world where such sedition would not be followed by prosecution and punishment france has lately exiled members of her assembly for a similar offence but in this glorious country where nearly twothirds of the people are free we can say anything within these walls or beyond them with impunity unless it be to agitate in favor of human libertythat is aggression let us inquire what is the grave offence the mighty wrong which can justify a threat big with such portentous consequences the refusal of congress to propagate or to establish a doubtful or even an admitted good in the territories would surely be no cause for rebellion and revolution much less would the refusal to extend an evil an admitted evil as unmitigated wrong will an intelligent and and free posterity believe it when impartial history records that the only cause for this high threat was the ap right is of no sextruth is of no color prehension that the congress of this free republic would not propagate nor permit to be propogated the institution ol human slavery into her vast territories now free yet such is the simple fact it is proper then to inquire whether the thing sought to be forced upon the territories at the risk of treason and rebellion be a good oran evil i think it is a great evil which ought to be interdicted that we should oppose it as statesmen as philanthropists and as rnaralistsn√ütwith standing the extraordinary position taken by the gentleman from alabama mr hilliard to the contrary while i thus announce my unchangeable hostility to slavery in every form and in every place i also avow my determination to stand by all the compromises of the constitution and carry them into faithful effect some of those compromises i greatly dislike and were they now open for consideration they should never recieve my assent but i find them in a constitution formed in difficult times and i would not disturb them by those compromises congress has no power over slavery in the states i greatly regret that it is so for if it j were our legitimate control i would go regardless of all threats for some just safe and certain mean for its final extinction but i know of no one who claims the right or desires to touch it within the states but when we come to form governments for territories acquired long since the formation of the constitution and to admit new stales whose only claim for admission depends on the will of congress we are bound so to discharge that duty as shall best contribute to the prosperity the power the permanency and the glory of this nation does slavery contribute to either of these is it not rather subversive of them all let us first view it in the j low light of political economy that nation i suppose is always the most prosperous all other things being i equalthat has the most industriousand the larger number of the producing classes those who merely consume the fruits of the earth add nothing to the strength or the wealth of a nation slave countries never can have a large j number of industrious freemen slave j holders form an untitled aristocracy with numerous dependents individu i als appropriate large tracts of territory i to themselves and thus prevent it jroiii i being thickly settled by freemen i their laborers having no ambition to gratify no love of gain to stimulate them no parental feelings to impel them to action are idle and wasteful when the lash is the only stimulant the spirit of man revolts from labor that republic must be feeble both in peace and war that has not an intelligent and industrious yeomanry equally removed from luxury and from poverty the middling classes who own the soil and work it with their own hands are the main support of every free government despotism maybe powerful and long sustained by a mixed population of serfs and nobles but free representative republics that rely upon the voluntary action of the people never can under such governments those who defend and support the country must have a stake in the soil must have interest to protect and rights to defend slave countries never can have such a yeomanry never can have a body of small proprietors who own the soil and till it with their own hands and sitdown in conscious independence under their own vine and figtree there is no sound connecting link between the aristocrat and tho slave true there is a class of human beings between them but they are the most worthless and miserable of mankind the poor white laborer is the scorn of the slave himself for slavery always degrades labor the white people who work with their hands are ranked with the other laborersthe slaves they are excluded from the society of the rich their associations if anywhere are with the colored population they feel that they are degraded and despised and their minds and conduct generally conform to their condition the soil occupied by slavery is much less productive than a similar soil occupied by freemen men who are to receive none of the wages of their lai bor do not care to multiply its fruits ji sloth negligence improvidence are the consequence the land being neglected becomes poor and barren as it becomes exhausted it is thrown out as waste for slave labor never renovates its strength this applies particularly to agricultural states take j virginia the favorite example for the south which has been so triumphantly referred to by the gentleman from j north carolina mr clingman whence he drew his facts that she was more prosperous more populous and more rich than the free states know not lam sure it was not from personal observation he would not certainly draw on his imagination in matters of fact i suppose he must have been misled by the most miserable of sophists and most false of chroniclers ellwood fisher i admit that by nature virginia has capabilities equal if not superior to any state in the union she has a delightful climate a soil naturally fertile she is intersected as was well said by the gentleman from virginia mr bayly by the noblest rivers her hills and mountains are filled with rich minerals and covered with valuable timber she has the finest water l believe in the nation in the very heart of her state and her harbors are among the best in ths worldr at the time of the adoption of the constitution she was the most powerful state her population was double that of new york it was the boast of her statesmen that she was pinma inter puren what is she now the population of new york is more than dou blel think the next census will show nearly treble hers her land cultivated by unwilling handsis unproductive travel through the adjouirhkyg states of ohio and pennsylvania and yon will see that the land produces more than double as much as the same kind of land in virginia in the free states new towns are everywhere springing up and thriving the land is becoming more productive smiling habitations are within hail of each other the whole country is dotted with schoolhouses and churches almost within sight of j each other and except under peculiar circumstances their manufactures and mechanic arts furnishing lucrative employment to all their people and their population steadily and rapidly increasing turn again to virginia there is scarcely a new town except at one or two pointswithin her whole borders her ancient villages wear the appearance of mournful decay her minerals and timber are unwrought her noble waterpower is but partially occupied her fine harbors are without ships except from other ports and her seaport towns are without commerce and failing to decay ask yourself the cause sir and i will abide the answer it is essential to the existence of republics that education should be generally diffused among the people slavery prevents this rich men employ private tutors or send their children abroad but the children of the people generally cannot be educated without the instrumentality of district schools in slave states where the plantations are large the population is too sparse even to maintain them besides there is another fatal obstacle to them in the aversion of the rich to associatewith the poor the poor white laborers children could never be permitted to mingle in the same schools and sit upon the same benches wfith the rich mens sons that would be offensive slavery enfeebles a nation in war aswell as in peace it is impossible that a nation of masters and slaves can be pjtttjlnl txild fo situ j lit cnfici ll offensive or defensive war a a nation of freemen a large portion of her population must remain at home to prevent the rebellien of those who are constantly in a state of latent warfare with their oppressors i know sir we have had a most alarming description of the prowess of the south we have heard their eftnnon roar seen their bayonets bristle heard the war cry of the charging chivalry and seen their bowieknives gleam within this hall in the vivid picture of the terrible gentleman from north carolina mr clingmax we have often been modestly reminded of the blood and treasure and gallantry of the south this ido not dispute lam proud to admit that she has furnished many gallant sons whose names will adorn the brightest pages of our history both for the war of the revolution the war of and the war which we lately assumed as the ally of texas and of slavery i give her full credit for her patriotism in furnishing most of the men who have borne the official burdens of the government both in the civil and the military list i know too that she has furnished the kind of men for our armies who are apt to be distinguished when great deeds are done for it is only the officers and commanders of armies who live in stoay the stout hearts and strong arms of the common soldiers that fight the battles and win the victories are unknown to fame their birthplace is not sought for their graves are undistinguished and the south has always furnished officers for our armies presidents for our republic most of our foreign ambassadors heads of departments chiefs of bureaus and sometimes in her proud humility has consented that the younger sons of her dilapidated houses should monopolize the places of clerks and messengers to the government but whence are drawn the common soldiery the men who peril their lives and win victories for your glory almost entirely from i the free states except in cases of sudden emergency when volunteers are i called nearest the scene of danger the present secretary of war a southern gentleman of great ability j and strenuous for southern rights says in his report according to the practice which has long prevailed the great majority i of enlistments is made in the northern atlantic cities and the adjacent interior towns whence the recruits are sent to the general depot for instruction and finally distributed to the southern and western posts according to the wants of the service yes sir our northern freemen have always filled the ranks of the regular army the south has lent us the gentlemen to wear the epaulettes and the sword to take command of the troops and lead them to southern and southwestern climates to fight the frontier battles and whiten your fields with their bones i am opposed to the diffusion of slavery because confining it to its present limits will bring the states themselves to its gradual abolition let this disease spread and although it will render rochester n y friday march the whole body leprous and loathsome yet it will long survive confine it and like the cancer that is tending to the heart it must be eradicated or it will eat out the vitals the sooner the patient is convinced of this the sooner ha will procure the healing operation the learned aad able gentleman from virginia mr meade ina pamphlet which he laid upon the table takes the same view of it he says virginia has adrye population of near half a million wfift aue is chieriy dependent on s irn demand let us pause a moment over this humiliating confession in plain english whatdoes it mean that virginia is now fit only to be the breeder not the employer of slaves that she is reduced to the condition that her proud chivalry are compelled to turn slavetraders lor a livelihood instead of attempting to renovate the soil and by their own honest labor compelling the earth to yield her abundance instead of seeking for the best breed of cattle and horses to feed on her hills and valleys and fertilize the land the sons of that great state must devote their time to selecting and grooming the most lusty sires and the most fruitful wenches to supply the j slave barracoons of the south and the learned gentleman pathetically laments that the profits of this genteel traffic will be greatly lessened by the circumscription of slavery this is his picture not mine the same gentleman says in the same speech if we intend to submit to the policy of confining the slaves within their present limits we should commence torthwith the work of gradual emancipation it is an easier task for us than for our children the eloquent gentleman from alabama mr hilliard is of the same opinion he said we must make up our minds either to resist the interdiction of the progress of slavery or to submit to an organic change in our institutions yes sir this admitted result is to my mind one of the most agreeable consequences of the legitimate restriction of slavery confine this malady within its present limits surround it by a cordon of freemen that it cannot spread and in less than twentyfive years every slaveholding state in this union will have on its statutebooks a law for the gradual and i final extinction of slavery then will nave oevii jue wishes of every patriots heart then wil our fair country be glorious indeed and be to posterity a bright example of the true principles of government of universal freedom i am opposed to the extension of slavery into territories now free for still graver reasonsbecause i am opposed to despotism throughout the world i admit that this government cannot preach a crusade of liberty into other states and nations much as she abhors tyrants and tyranny there she can only mourn over its existence but when the question of government is within her own control and she permits despotism to exist and aids its diffusion she is responsible for it in the face of the civilized world and before tho god ofliberty in my judgment not only the slave states but the general government recognizing and aiding as it does slavery is a despotism ido not use the word in a declamatory but strictly legal signification that government is despotic where the rulers govern subjects by their own mere will by decrees and laws emanating from their uncontrolled will in the enactment and extension of which the ruled have no voice and under which they have no rights except at the will of the rulers despotism does not depend upon the number of the rulers or the number of the subjects it may have one ruler or many rome was a despotism under nero so she was under the triumvirate athens was a despotism under her thirty tyrants under her four hundred tyrants under her three thousand tyrants it has been generally observed that despotism increases in severity with the number of despots the responsibility is more divided and the claims mflre numerous the triumvirs each demanded his victims the smaller the number oi strb jects in proportion to thetyrants the more cruel the oppression because the less danger from rebellion in this government the free white citizens are the rulersthe sovereigns as we delight to be called all others are subjects there are perhaps some sixteen or seventeen millions of sovereigns and some four millions of subjects the rulers and the ruled are of all colors from the clear white of the caucasian tribes to the swarthy ethiopian the former by courtesy are all called white the latter black in this government the subject has no rights politic or personal he has no voice in the laws which govern him he can hold no property his very wife and children are not his his labor is anothers he and all that appertains to him are the absolute property of his rulers he is governed bought sold executed by laws to which he never gave his assent and by rulers whom he never chose heis not a serf merely with half the rights of men like the the subjects of despotic russia but a naked slave stripped of every right which god and nature gave himand which the high spirit of our revolution declared inalienablewhich he himself could not surrendrr and which man could not take from him is he not then the subject of despotic sway the slaves of athens and of rome god is the father of us all and all men are brethren j were free in comparison they had some rightscould acquire some property could choose their own masters and purchase their own freedom and when ree could rise in social and political life the slaves of america then lie under the most absolute and grinding despotism that the world ever saw but who are the despots the rulers of the countrythe sovereign people not merely the slaveholder who cracks the lash he is but the instrument of despotism that despotism is the government ofthe slave states and the united states consisting of all its rulersall the free citizens do not look upon this as a paradox because you and i and the sixteen millions of rulers are free nicholas of russia is free the grand sultan of turkey is free the butcher of austria is free augustus antony and lepidus were free while they drenched rome in blood the thirty tyrants the four hundred the three thousand were free while they bound their countrymen in chanis you and i and the sixteen millions are free while we fasten iron chains and rivet manacles on four millions of our fellow men tear their wives and children from them separate them sell them anddoom them to perpetual eternal bondage are we not then despotsdespots such as history will brand and god abhors but we are told that that is none of our business that southern slavery is a matter between the slavelolders and their own consiences i trust it may be so decided by impartial history and the unerring judge that we may not be branded with that great stigma and that grievous burden may not weigh upon our souls but could we hope for that justification if now when we have the power to prevent it we should permit this evil to spread over thousands of square leagues now free and settle upon unborn millions sir for myself i should look upon any northern man enlightened by a northern education who would directly or indirectly by omission or commission by basely voting or cowardly skulking permit it to spread over one rood of gods free earth as a traitor to liberty and recreant to his god slavery tends to render the people among whom it is planted arrogant insolent intolerant and tyrannical towards the freemen of other parts of the union the honorable member from virgin whom i have ahud quoted mr meade says speaking of slavery our past history testifies to the fact that it elevates the character of the white man though we have been in a numerical minority in the union for fifty years vet during the greatei part of that period we have managed to control the destinies of the union whether on the battlefield or in the council the sons of the south have taken the lead and the records of the nation afford ample testimony of their superior energy and genius sir i do not complain of this statement the former part of it is both candid and true but i cannot listen to the recital without feeling the burning blush on my countenance that the north with her overshadowing millions of freemen has for half a century been tame and servile enough to submit to this arrogant rule the south imprison northern freemen when found within her borders if they happen to be guilty of a darkskin and carry it between the wind and their nobility and when a sovereign state sends a learned and venerable agent to test the legality of such imprisonment before their own tribunals he is driven with violence and indignity from tneir shores massachusetts has sufferod and i trust remembers the insult how often have these walls been profaned and the north insulted by the insolent threat that if cotigress legislate against southern will it should be disregarded resisted to extremity and theunion destroyed during the present session we have been more than once told amidst raving excitement that if we dared to legislate n a certain way the south would teach the north a lesson that their minds were made up to extreme resistance is this the pkre to use threats instead of arguments are the representatives of freemen to be thus treated true you are not wholly without justification in the belief that it will be effectual you have too often intimidated congress you have more than once frightened the tame north from its propriety and found doughfaces enough to be your tools and when you lacked a given number i take no ride in saying you to find them m old pennsylvania who in former years has ranked a portion of her delegation among your most submissive slaves but i hope with some fears that the race of doughfaces is extinct i do not see how it could well be otherwise thoy were an unmanly an unvirile race incapable according to the laws of nature of reproduction i hope they have let no descendants the old ones are deep in political graves for them i am sure there is no resurrection for they were soulless now when the whole civilized world unites in denouncing slavery as a curse a shame and a crime i trust that when the great battle between liberty and slavery comes to be fought on this floor there will none be found hiding among the stuff no fraudulent concealments not one aceursed achan in this whole camp of the representatives of free men the eloquent gentleman from virginia mr seddoi the other day in his beautiful peroration personated the great states of virginia kentucky and louisiana and in their name apostrophized the good and i will add the great man who now occupies the executive chair and in their name besought him as he loved the place of his birth the place of his nature and the place of his residence not to forsake his northern brethren in this emergency but to stand by them in the defence of human bondage how much more effective enduring and hallowed would that eloquence have been had the orators lips been touched with a coal from the altar of freedom then could he have gone with friendly anxiety to that noble benevolent and heroic man and admonished him that although he had gathered all the earthly laurels that can be reaped by the sickle of death yet if he would have his name descend to posterity with increasing lustre he must by one great just and patriotic example wipe out the only spot that obscures the sun of his glory he might with propriety have taken with him the learned gentleman from alabama mr hilliard and together have pointed him to that solemn tiour which to him and to all of us who are treading the downhill of life must soon arrive when the visions of ambition and of earthly wealth shall have passed from before his eyes and left him nothing but a gaping grave and an eternal judge ment the accomplished gentleman from alabama rev mr hilliard might with peculiar propriety do what with profane lips i dare not go to his illustrious friend and with fervid piety and eloquence more thrilling than that which made felix tremble implore him by a love deeper than that of birthplace of nature and of residence by the love of his own immortal soul tobe warned in time by the awful the inexorable doom accursed is the manstealer he might perhaps have pointed him to the gloomy journey that leads through the dark shadow and shown him how ineffably brighter are the glories of that kingdom where all are tree perchance too he would i have noticed the thronging thousands traveling to that same dread tribunal summoned to give evidence of deeds done in the body some of them were bondsmen and slaves on earth but whose disembodied spirits were then failed erect tali the proudest of earths oppressors and asked him to inquire of his own conscience who j was most likely to meet a hearty wel i come therehe whose cause was advocated by the supplicating voices of thousands with whom he had dealt justly on earth and made free indeed or he whose admission should be withstood by myriads of crushed and lacerated souls showing their chains their stripes and their wounds to their father and to his father to their god and to his judge when mr stevens concluded his speech several southern members endeavored to get the floor and among them messrs seddon and millson but the chairman awarded it to mr buel of michigan from the christian citizen senator douglass this gentleman in relation to whose future political course upon the slavery question some of our cotemporaries had begun to entertain a favorable opinion has shown his hand in the development of a scheme the substance of which we presented in our last weeks no adapted to give the whole of the remaining territory acquired from mexico to slavery while the former course of mr douglass has certainly given no just j ground to expect that he would do anything favorable to the interests of freedom we had yet in common with others hoped that a better acquaintance with the feelings and sentiments of northern men his constituents which his past years residence in chicago has enabled him to acquire might induce him to take that stand in the pending struggle between freedom and slavery which his position as the sena toiial re preae native of a free state i distinctly points out as his duty but it seems that he regards his notorious pledge to the people of new orleans as more binding than his obligations to his own state or rather that there is more to be made politically by proving treacherous to the interests of his own constituents than by obeying their direct and positive mstruc tions no allowance can be made for honesty of purpose in a case like theone before us where the will of the people of a state has been clearly expressed though their legislative assembly and is thus deliberately violated douglass must henceforth be classed with dickinson and cass as utterly traitorous and untrustworthy the time when such a compromise as the one proposed by mr douglass can be looked upon by northern men with anything but the deepest abhorrence has long since passed by the precedent for a series of years acted upon of coupling a free and slave state upon their admission into the confederacy will no longer be respected slavery is a doomed institution and doomed will be the man or class of men who attempt by bolstering it up andi obstructing liberal legislation to perpetuate the loathsome curse the in j effaceable brand of infamy will be burned into the character of such men and they will be remembered by posterity if remembered at all only in john dick p bi nter whole no connection with beneejct arnold the traitor as those w ho would sell all that is promising and glorious in our free institutions for sordid and ephemaral popularity oliver johnson of the antislavery bugle holds the following language on that part ot mr clays speech and compromise resolutions which relates to the return of fugitive slaves there is one part of mr gys speech which has excited in our breast emotions of deepest indignation and horror it is diabolically cool infernally atrocious it proves conclusively that mr clay in spite of his smooth exterior and pious professions has a rotten heart we allude to what he says about the capture of fugitive slaves on this point he goes with him who goes farthest witness his precise words it is our duty to make the lair more effective and i shall go with the senator from the south who goes farthest in making penal laws andfim posing the heaviest sanctions for the recovery of fugitive slaves and the restoration of them to their owners if a man who could utter a sentiment like that at this meridian of the nineteenth centnry and in a land boasting of liberty is not a villain at heart then let the word be banished from the language and haynau the austrian manhunter and butcher be baptised as a christian suppose mr clay for the sake of certain pecuniary and commercial advantages proffered to us by austria had deliberately proposed a treaty with that government stipulating among other things that an austrian agent haynau for example might come here and by the help of our courtsjails and sheriffs drag from our shores the hungarian refugees who have been the recipients of so much american sympathy would not the whole people have cried out with horror against a proposal so inhuman and monstrous would they not have said perish commerce perish property perish every earthly interest sooner than consent to perpetrate such a crime free colored people of louisi anathe laws of louisiana respecting the free people of color are more liberal than in any other slaveholding stat or some free states they constitute a class of citizens whom law recognises and protects and whose social position is better than that of free people of color in other sections the new orleans picayune of the th ultimo contains the report of a case decided by the supreme court of the state which held that they were competent witnesses in trials of white persons and also assigned the reason therefor as followsjudge king delivering the opinion our legislation and jurisprudence upon this subject differs materially from those of the slave states generally in which the rule contended for prevails this difference of public policy has no doubt arisen from the different condition of that class of persons in this state at the date of our earliest legislation as a territory a well as at the present day free persons of color constituted a numerous class in some districts they are respectable from their intelligence industry and habits of good order many of them are highly educated and the instances are by no means rare in which they are large property holders so far from being in that degraded state which renders them unworthy of belief they are such persons as courts and juries would not hesitate to believe under oath moreover this numerous class is entitled to the protection of our laws but that protection would in many cases be illusory and the greatest offences againats their persons and property might be committed with impunity by white persons if the rule of exclusion contended for were recognised they are also included in article of our civil code as competent persons to testify in civil matters sickness ln sickness the soul begins to dress herself for immortality first she unties the strings of vanity that made her upper garment cleave to the world and sit uneasy she puts off the light and fantastic robe of lust and wanton appetite next to this the soul by the help of sickness knocks off the fetters of pride and vainer complacencies then she draws the curtains and stops the light from coming in and takes the picture down those fantastic images of selflove and gay remembrances of vain opinion and popular noises then the spirit stoops into sobrieties of humble thoughts and feels corruption chiding the frowardness of factious opinions next to these as the soul is still undressing she takes off the roughness of her great and little angers and animosities and receives the oil of mercies she receives the oil of mercies and smooth forgiveness fair interpretations

edition ofhigdenb po lyerironicon printed in black letter by wyn ken de v orde the work consists of folios the first folios and all after in this copy are supplied by manuscript ihe colophon leads as follows thus ended the thirteenth daye of apryll the tenth year of the reign of king henry vii and the incarnation of our lorde mcccclxxxxv emprynted ot westmestyre by wynken de worde the slave trade our readers will recollect that we lately a correspondence of william harmed of new aork with bruin hill dealers in men women and babies in relation too beautiful white girl named family russel jfor whom the said soul traders demanded eighteen hundred dollars efforts have been made to purchase her but without success reader remember that this young woman was imprisoned in alexandria for nearly fifty years a portion of the district ofcolumbia where slavery and the slave trade existed by the permission of the people of the free states the following account of the matter is from the washington correspondent of the true democrat washington feb on wednesday last a friend of mine received a letter from new york soliciting his assistance in the purchase of a slave girl who has recently fallen into the hands of the soul traders in alexandria my friend being pressed with business was anxious that i should take the matter in hajid and i accordingly assented the letter strongly urged the purchase of the girl at a reasonable sum which sum kind triends in new york who kindly esteemed the mother of the unfortunate slave agreed to raise before starting for alexandria yesterday morning i was informed by joshua leavitt who had just arrived from new york that the friends there had abandoned the idea ol giving siboo and if they would not take jess the mother and her friends must endure the calamity as we would any calamity by pirates they were willing to give one thousand or twelve hundred tosatisfy the capidity of these inhuman fleshdealers and prevent a separation of the girl from those whom she joved above all others on earth but they were not disposed to yield further to the imercenary demands of these monsters with these instructions i proceeded upon my mission anived at alexandria i went in search of the pen and found it in the rear of the city in a place dreary and deserted which seemed marked by the frowns of omnipotence a fit theatre for piratical operation a suitable dwelling place for penitentiary and gallows deserving ruffians the main building is of brick joined to this are small wood buildings and the large pen which contained some hundred colored peopleor in southern parlance a drove ready for the southern market the keeper of the establishment a whiskybloated biped admitted me and upon making known my business i was informed that bruin had gone to alexandria i then asked if mr hill was in no said the fellow he has gone south with a drove upon my informing him that i came to purchase emily he told me that mr bruin was waiting to hear from her mother who jie expectfcd would give siboo for her i set his itlitfd at rest on that point end desired to see her and was flatly refused i have strict oiders said he not to admit any one he then directed a smartlooking colored outh to go with me to the city and find bruin as i left the door i ca√üt my eye through she gratingand beheld an indiscriminate mass of men women and children whose countenances betokened the deep emotions of the heart all destined for the cotton and rice fields of the south families broken up the strongest ties of humanity sundered weeping and lamentationbrokenhearted and desolate with no eye to pity and no hand to save god of the oppressed how long will thine arm be stayed on my way to the city i inquired of my young sable companion about emily said i do you see her often o yea master i secs her very often and carries her meals to her is site a smart gut yes sa shes right smart and shes right good lookin too is she black no sa shes almost as white as any white girl does she want to go south no sa she cries a heap about and wants to live uid her mother do you belong to mr bruin yes sa i belongs to him and has got togo south ivid de res i expect do you want to gono sa none of us wants to goat this answer the words came to my lips then ivhy in the name of all that is sacred to liberty and dear to mans freedom dont you and your companions in bondage tear doum the infernal pen set it on fire and run away by the light of it but to give utterance to such words would be treason in this quarter though glorious advice all over the world to the white man held in durance vile we found bruin and i was received by him with a suavity of manner which would eclipse even lord chesterfield himself his appearance wofully belies his profession heis a middleaged man all smiles and politeness and very intelligent but we all know that satan can transform himself into an angel of light and a man may smile and mile and be a villain still i made known the object of my visit and informed him that our new york friends had abandoned the idea of purchasing emily at siboo said he i am glad of it sir i dont want to send her northl prefer that she should go south i have a large lot that lam going to take of the most respectable class she is one of the best of the lot besides it will do us no good to let her go north after attempting a negotiation in everyway that i could mustei to no effect i endeavored to appeal to bis sympathy thete is her mother she loves her daughter can you not take less to prevent their separation no sir said he she cant go north fora cent short of what i have named but if some gentleman he laid much stress on the word gentleman here wishes to purchase her lor himself he can hav e her for fifteen hundred dollars in other words i was made to understand that the mother could have her daughter whom god had given her and who was endowed with no ordinary qualities of person and mind for eighteen hundred dollars and not a cent less but if some gentleman here wished to purchase her for himselffor puiposes too abhorrent to namehe could have her for fif teen hundred dollars great heaven to what a depth of infamy will not men descend setting a price upon female virtue beauty and innecence and for what and these abominations too within sight of the american capitol and by virtue of american laws oh if there is a sin more damning in its effects than the entire aggregate of others it is the buying and selling of virtuous females for purposes of prostitution to raise the siboo

united slates vests in congress no power to make laws for the people of the territories acquired by or annexed to the union but only to dispose of and make needful rules and regulations respecting territory or other property belonging to the united states resolved that the principle of the wilmot proviso is not a harmless political speculation or abstraction excused if erroneous by its alleged philanthropic intent but is the same ancient aristocratic pernicious and pestilent political heresy ever repudiated and denounced by the democratic party of the union which seeks by means of an implication ot power of congress gradually to undermine state sovereignty destroy legislation in the respective states consolidate the union and establish on the ruins of stale rights a central sovereignty easily contiolled or managed by the few at the expense of the many resolved that it is contrary to the spirit in which the constitution of the union was framed and by which alone it can be perpetuated to abolish by act of congress the institution of slavery in the district of columbia without the consent of the people thereof and the consent of the slates which ceded the district for the use of the government of the united ssates resolved that we cal upon our state legislature to repeal all laws conflicting with that section of the constitution of the united states in regard to the restitution of runaway slaves so that the fundamental obligation binding upon every citizen of the union and the law t of congress passed to carry it into effect may no longer be set at defiance and the rights of our southern brethren trampled under foot resolved that we rejoice at the votes in the national house of representatives laying the wilmot proviso upon the table as an appropriate disposition of a measure which did so much to procrastinate the war with mexico and to embarrass the late illustrious administration and which events have sufficiently proved to be without any practical importance except for purposes of irritation and insult and we rejoice also that messrs gilmore mann robbins mclanahan ross and dimmick six ot the eight democrats from this state in congress

spirit of violent persecution against all who say aught against the constitution or who utter a syllable of condemnation upon the vile system of slavery meetings have been recently held in new york philadelphia and elsewhere the na j tural tendency of whose proceedings is to arouse and to inflame the most malignant pas j sions of the populace and to beget a blind j and bagaless enthusiasm in favor of the existing slaveholding uniptj fn character with i the proceedings of these meetings are the tone and bearing of the northern press journals of all descriptionswhig and demi ocritic religious and politicalteem from week to week with appeals ir favor pf the union and with highwrought eulogies on he constitution angry invectives and n vengeful threats towards all who have lie manliness to ayow sentiments hostile to this idol are seen along the columns of rpany of our influential newspapers while the lowest grades of the press are openly and directly attempting under the vile pietence that the union is in danger to raise a storm of murderous violence and to afford a pretext to mobocrats for the commission of cruel and wanton outrages upon the few who shall dare to cali in question our unhallowed national compact in this view of passing events it becomes the men and women of our land whose high motto is no union with slaveholders and who mean to stand firmly by the cause of liberty at every hazard to examine well the foundation of their faith and to be prepared for any danger or hardship which they may be called to meet in the free utterance of their conscientious convictions of duty the iniquitous and mischievous character and tendency of this union and the duty and necessity of its dissolution were nevermore solemnly impressed upon our mind thanat the present moment scarcoly a speech from congress or an editorial from the press but comes laden with instruction on this point in the name and at the demand of the union the north is urgently required to sacrifice freedom of speech the liberty of the press the right of assembling and the right of petition we are called upon in the name of this unholy confederacy to be deaf to the voice of human woe to extinguish in our hearts the holiest sympathies of our nature to abandon the very basis of all morality to repudiate the religion of jesus christ which is full of mercy and good fruits virtually to deny god and to fall down before the constitution as the highest object of veneration and regard in its name we must be ready to extend the foul cyatqm of slavery over a soil of almost incalculable dimensions to hunt down our fellow men in the northern states like beasts of prey and in the event of a struggle for freedom on the part of the slaves against their goddefyjng oppressors northern men are required to shoulder arpis to march to the scene of conflict and to pout the deadly contents of their weapons not into the breast of the infernal oppressor but into the bosom of the rebellious slave intq such an union we say in the name of the living god we can never enter perish the bond it should be ground to powder and the whirlwinds of offended heaven should sweep away its dust forever yes we say the union ought to be dissolved how dare any citizen of the state of new ork solemnly bind himself to shoot down ot hunt down his fellow man no man needs to be told that such a pledge is wrong it is self evideeitly so and it only needs to be honestly a hurried to deepen conviction in the heart of every honest man we shall go on therefore to oppose this wrongto preach hostility towards this guilty compact trusting to the righteousness of our capse and relying for support and protection upon the favor of heaven in every trial and hardship that may await us f d the

the legislature speechmaking has been the order ot the day and in this department the south seems to have everything its own way w hat northern representatives will do when the time for words has passed and the time for action comps it may be unwise to predict though we must say that the past history of the men as well as the present complexion of political events leaves us little ground to hope for a bold stand on their pait against the slavepower the little resolution displayed at the commencement of the session is now sicklied oer by the pale cast of thought treachery to thejwilmot proviso and to free soil principles has shown itself unmistakably throughout the whig ranks and the spirit of compromise is rapidly doing its work upon the northern press and people judging from these indications we seem tobe shut up to the sad conclusion that in the present conflict as in former ones where liberty and slavery have been arrayed against each other m congress the slave power will k victorious and the north l humbled nddefeated but to the proceedings on the thof februaty in committee of the whole house on the state of the union mr w v n bay of missouri made along speech mainly n the subject of slavery he denied that the south was responsible for the agitation affirmed that the north had maje war on southern institutions spoke of slavery as a purely domestic institution said that it existed prior to fhe adoption of the constitution contended that slaves were property and subject fo the laws which govern and control property referred to the ordinance of and especially to that part relating to fugitive slaves he then proceeded to read the north a lecture on its failure io comply with the d section of the th article of the constitution he admitted that the article in question had been held sometimes to refer to apprentices or to persons bound to labor for a limited period but he read a portion of the decision of the supreme court delivered by judge story in the case of prigg vs pennsylvania and he held the interpretation tlrere given to be the only one which the clause can properly receive he paraded this decision before the house tyith the horrid law of both of which he contended had been grossly violated by the north after a long display of griefs and regrets at the alleged perfidy of the north he addressed himself to the territorial question his objection to the wilmot proviso was that it proposed to legislate for a people who are competent to legislate for themselves we have referred to this speech and presented some of its leading features not because of its intrinsic vajue but simply to allow all to be heard in the house on the st mr w h bissell of illinois administered a most blistering rebuke to the hotheads of the south who were to bully the north into an abandonment of the wilmot proviso by threats of disunion he quoted largely from the speeches of brown clingman and inge and laid bare their falsehood violence and disunion designs mr bissell is not an abolitionist and scarcely a free soil man but we cannot but thank him for the keen and powerful manner in which he has disposed of southern braggadpcia and southern grievances boll however as he is he could not we are sorry to say allow the opportunity to pass while making this otherwise creditable speech without consoling the slaveholders by speaking of the garrisons tappans and smiths in the same category with the southern advocates of pisunion and by assuring the human fleshmongeis that the north will stand by the south i assure you sir said he that wc the representatives of the north icill aid you to preserve your constitutional rights as we have ever done this of course means that the wilmot proviso will not be insisted on that slavery in the district of columbia and in the navy yards will not be abolished and that the horrid traffic in human souls will be continued undisturbed by the action of northern representatives this pledge coming from mr bissell at such a lime shows that even a man with sufficient courage to fight a duel may lack the necessary moral courage to declare in lhe face of slaveholders a righteous course of action and further proves that even a duellist may be a doughface the speech of mr t stevens which will be found on the first page of this weeks paper has most thoroughly stirred up the wrath of mr millson of virginia the unenviable pictuie drawn by the former of the character and condition of the old dominion caused the chivalrous blood of the latter to boil with rage we give a specimen of iliis gentlemans tsaquisiie taste refined setittbfthy and manly indignation in the following i endeavored mr chairman to get jhe floor immediately upon the close of the remarks submitted by one of the representatives from pennsylvania mr stevens wished to give instant expression to the irritation occasioned by the gross and offensive allusions to the state from which i come that irritation however was ljut momentary and has since subsided into a quiet feciing of loathing and indignation a leeling more fitting the accusation and the accuser inspeaking of the slave population of my state and of the employment of her citizens that member had the boldness to declare that virginia was now so degraded that but i will not i cannot repeat the gross language uttered by him i could pof do so without violating the decorum of this body without outraging those proprieties which should at all tmes be respected and obser vedwithout shocking the delicacy of that portion of our auditors who attend our deliberations in ihe confidence that they will hear nothing to offend their modesty or wound their sensibility if the truth were known this same mill son whose delicate sensibility has been so terribly shocked by the bare mention of the occupation is himself like many other honorable gentlemen of his state in vulgar parlance a slavebreeder and perhaps the money in his purse is the price of some girl sold from her mother for no other cause than to replenish that purse such abominable hypocrisy and affectation as he evinces in the above remarks mav be met with in all the circles of the south henry clay treated us to a dish of the same sort in his late speech when he inveighed against the slavetrade in the district of columbia and would at the j same time have the horrible system of slavery perpetuated in that district ihe attempt to disguise the gross and foul enormij ties of slavery with the gauze of a mockj refinement is a trick which has been too often and too successfully played in this land bf shams but we leave mr millson in the hands of mr stevens who is abundantly able and judging from his speech which we hope no one will fail to read is equally willing to do the chivalrous virginig every possible justice f a on the th february mr giddings of ohio with his characteristic promptitude and bodness presented a petition various individuals in pennsylvania and delaware asking for a peaceful dissolution of the union and accompanying the preservation with the motion to refer them to a select committee with instructions to inquire firstly whether dissatisfaction with our federal union exists among the people of these states d if soto what extent and d from what has such dissatisfaction arisen as is usual in the case of such petitions it created considerable stir among honorable members and they rushed upon it from all quarters guish its light of course it was rejected only voting for and against it thus anpther stab has been given to the right of petition on wednesday th mr ashman oi massachusetts oftned leave to introduce his bill for reducing the rate of postage and for abolishing the franking privilege the bill was read twice and referred to the committee on the postoffice and post roads that this bill may become a law should bethe desire of every man who wishes well to his country we give here the first section of the bill as containing the important features of the whole section be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled that from and after the first day of july next the rates of postage upon letters when prepaid fhal be uniform and all such letters passing through the mail shall be charged by weight as follows letters weighing not more than half an ounce two cents more than halt an ounce and nut more than an ounce and a half six cents more than an ounce and a half and not more than two ounces eight cents and four cents additional for every ounce of greater weight all letters jsooyeyed by mailsteamers between oregon or california and ports of otner parts of the united states five times the above rates and on all letters which are not prepaid the postage shall remain as now established by law hr doty on the same day submitted k proposition to the committee of the house to admit california yith her present boundaries into the union on an equal footing with the original states the subject of slavery again became the theme and the house was addressed by mr toombs mr baker and mr mclane the first and last are southerners and of the ultra southern stamp we copy here a portion of the defense set up by mr mclane for slavery in maryland he lived in a border state that could do i very well without slavery but which did not for that reason say that slavery was a moral i wrong a national disgrace they did not think so sickly spirits migtt so clothe j their philanthrophy the people of his state thought it an institution which was a moral necessity where it now existed advantageous jn soqie states but necessary in all the states where it now had an existence a single view of this question he did not care one particle whether northern men on either side of the house gave him their acquiescence or not it was a question which came nearer home to him than to them we could not live in the midst of a large black population the law of slavery jt was a law as necessary to the discipline of the free black man as of the slavea law which the free states adopted every one of them they had every one of them got their slavery they had every one of them found it tobe necessary to enact their laws establishing negro slavery cultivated men of the north did not deny it beyond the political distinction which they made against the blacks there was the social municipal distinction it was the social distinction of which he spoke it was bondage bondage in degree it was necessary to themhe was not reproaching them for it they could not live without it it was thus limited in degree with them on account of their free sparse black population and their overwhelming proportion of whites now in maryland the whites were not so overwhelming in numbers as in pennsylvania and the other free states and therefore they wanted a more complete system of bondage than the people of the free statesthey wanted more than a prohibition against blacks and whites entering together into the sacred bonds of matrimony and the other like municipal restraints imposed upon the black population they required the law of slavery did not every man know that in the revolutionary war the black slave messed with the white soldier and no white soldier objected to it this was the case upon the battle fields of north carolina m the gallant corps of south carolina in greenes army in the corps of washington at yorktownblack slaves messed with the white soldiers and the whites made no objection why because thpre was a consciousness of moral and legal superiority or the part of the white but the slave though inferior was called there to defend his the slaves fireside his wife his children as the white men were defending theirs and if there had been no law recognizing slaveryif the blacks had been free blacks the white soldier would not have messed with them well upon our humble word if we cculd not pick out a dozen of these inferior colored men of our own good city of rochester that would put this incoherent and weakminded legislator to the blush we would yield readily to the imputation of moral arid intellectual inferiority what bungling jargon what ridiculous nonsense and yet nonsensical and ridiculous as is is the foregoing it is about as rational and as worthy of respect as any defence which can be made for slavery in the senate clays compromise resolutions have been the main topic mr foote of mississippi renewed and insisted on his motion for the appointment ef a committee of thirteen with instructions for ihe purpose of maturing a scheme of compromise for the adjustment of all pending questions growing out of the subject of slavery he accompanied his proposal with the declaration that unless something of the kind he proposed was done speedily it would be impossible to preserve the union a long debate ensued upon the proposition of mr foote in which badger foote clemens dayton butler berrien walker davis of mississippi and others took part and the senate adjourned before the motion tor a committee was voted on on ihe same day feb mr chase of ohio presented a resolution of the legislature of ohio in favor of the acknowledgment of the independence of liberia which was referred to the committee on foreign i relations and ordered to be printed mr seward requested to present a memorial ol the citizens and residents of the valley of the rio grande in which they represent that itis their desire that all the section east of the rio grande and south of the line of new mexico distinct from the province of texas be erected into a new territory to be called the territory of the rio grande the petition was referred mr benton pending the consideration of clays compromise took occasion to deal an annihilating blow on the heads of the small babblers fiom the south who have from time to time exerted themselves in their little way to establish the conviction that slavery has never been legally abolished in mexico this mischievous pretence set afloat by the propaga dists of slavery we think will scarcely dare to make its appearance again in the senate mr benton has literally overwhelmed that body with evidence demonstrating that slavery ha not only been legally universally and for ever i abolished hut that even when it existed it was a system that whitened into purity compared to the foul abomination which now seeks admission into the new territories mr benton as every one expected denounced the wilmot proviso as useless and look essentially the ground of cass clay taylor and coto wit nonintervention the great speech of the present week is that of john c calhoun of which yye have but a telegraphic account and that is but very meagief d new york feb dear sir the ladies of new york anxious for the emancipation of their oppressed race and being well assured that an organ through which to make known their grievances and plead for their redress is necessary feeling convinced that the north star from the very able manner in which it is conducted and its wide circulation is one of the most efficient instrunientalities for the accomplishment of that end purpose emulating the noble example of their sisters in philadelphia by holding a fair for the benefit of said paper during the anniversary week in may next and have formed an association for the furtherance of tfiat object you would confer a favor on the ladies by making known their intentiop through the cpluiqns o yoqr valuable paper by soliciting for them the aid of all who are friendly to their object and by receiving for and forwarding to them all contributions which maybe obtained from your section of country very respectfully yours fanny tompkins secy remarks we have readily and gratefully given place in our columns to the above announcement the intended effort to sustain the north is evidence of an interest in the cause of the slave w hich we heartily appreciate and is worthy of the enlightened ladies who propose to make it we are happy to learn that the pioposition is taken up with much earnestness and that a large committee consisting of twentyfive ladies has already been organised mrs emmeline bastien has been appointed first directress miss fanny tompkins a lady well fitted for the office appointed secretary mrs j m forten treasurer we also see among the committee the names of mrs e benian mrs s downing and mrs rosetta cowes committees have also been appointed to purchase goods select rooms and solicit donations in aid of the fair judging from these preparations the ladies are resolved to do something which shall be worthy of the intelligence activity and generosity of new york a box has already been received from england containing many valuable articles which will be displayed for sale at the contemplated fair we are authorised to observe in connection with this announcement that the contemplated fair like the paper w hich it designs to support will be conducted on the broad principle of a common humanity it is to be open to the cooperation of all without distinction of cdlor we make this declaration with a view to remove all ground for alleging that this is to be a colored fair as some were wont to that held in philadelphia during christmas week we see no earthly reason why a fair conducted mainly by colored ladies but which is open to the cooperation of all should be termed a colored fair it seems that we are never to lead in anything however good it be and however general its character without attaching to that good the odium which a bitter and relentless prejudice has attached to our effior abolitionists at any rate should judge differently and determine the worthiness of our actions by the motives and objects in view rather than by the complexion we bear there uno more reason for calling a fair conducted mainly by colored ladies a colored fair than for calling a fair conducted by white ladies a white fair contributions for this fair will be gratefully ieceived by f douglass at the north star office rochester n y f pour friends ward and thomas are taxing their ingenuity to ascertain who is a genuine abolitionist friend thomas with more liberality than w t ard admits that w l garr isonand f douglass are genuine abolitionists we cannot say that we think the controversy on this point between these two expert editors is of very great consequence in the antislavery field as in other fields of labor the genuine workman will be known by his fruits and we think that the labors of wm l garrison if measured by their results will be found to be not inferior to the labors of s r ward f d liberated slaves fourteen slaves liberated by dr john casson of mississippi were brought to this city two or three days ago by their late master to have their freedom papers made out j jolliff esq who takes great pleasure in acting as master of ceremonies on occasions of this kind untied the knot of slavery

to the senate and house of representatives in congress ussembltd the undersigned inhabitants ot philadelphia on behalf of themselves and of a large and rapidly incieasing portion of the people of pennsylvania and other northern states respectfully represent that the union at present subsisting between the slaveholding and nonslaveholding portions of this confederacy is a source of grievances so numerous and oppressive as to call for immediate measures on the part of those who have the power for their redress among these grievances they would respectfully enumerate the following as the most pressing in their demand lor correction  despite the article of the federal constitution which declares that the citizens of each state shal enjoy all the privileges and immunities of citizens of the sevral states a portion of the citizens of the north solely on account of their complexions on visiting southern states are seized thrust into prison fined condemned to work with felons in the chain gang and frequently sold on the auction block as slaves perfectly legal measures to bring those eutrages to the notice of the federal courts are forbidden by severe penal enactments asin the case of the hon samuel hoar and hon henry hubbard who were appointed for this especial purpose by the legislature of massachusetts but who were driven back with insult and violence from the states to which they were sent the most sacred of all rights that of freedom of speech and of the press withoul which there can be no true liberty under any form of government has been practically denied in a large portion of this country and to thousands of its most respectable as well as some of its most distinguished inhabitants it is a notorious fact that there are but few places south of mason and dixons line where the doctrine of the declaration of independence that all men are created equal and endowed with an inalienable right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness can be publicly avowed and appropriately applied without imminent personal hazard iv the union between the slaveholding and nonslaveholding states and the alleged necessity of its perpetuation is made the pretext for l exorbitant and nnjust demands on the part of the former and the most degrading concessions and humiliating self abasement on the part of the latter begetting a spirit on the one hand of overbearing tyranny and on the other of slavish and grovelling submis sionboth alike inconsistent with our theory of republican equality at vaiiance with the best interests of a majority of the people and injurious to the cause ot freedom and free institutions throughout the world v the comproses of the federal constitution are felt to be especially burdensome because by them the people of the north are obliged ist to fcid slaveholder directly or indirectly in recapturing his fugitive slaves d to assist if in the judgment ot the executive it should ever become necessary to repress by force any uprising on the part of the slaves for their liberty and d to concede to the slaveholder extraordinary political power in the privilege of representing threefifths of his slaves in the electoral college and in congressthus famishing him at the same moment the motive and ability to perpetuate his system by these compromises the people of the north are involved as partners in the support of slavery and made to share with the suoth in all the evils and responsibilities of its continuance to these facts as constituting grievances no longer tolerable the undersigned invite the attention of your honorable body and respectfully ask that if in your judgment there be no other speedy means for their redress you will take immediate measures for the peaceful dissolution of the union increased excitement at washington washington feb senator footes statements have created alarm the events expected are a renewal of the struggle between north and south next mouday and the consequence the breaking up of the house by the southern men who are coming armed for a contest that is the design and expectation mr foote made his general assertion without particulars he therefore urged the senate to do something by saturday foote was unquestionably authorized to state what he did the affair between the illinois and mississippi members is unsettled attempts will bt made to arrange the matter it is simply a dispute as to historical facts the president stated in conversation this mot ping that the parties referred to different periods of the action calhouns epeech will be read by mr butler on thursday corr n y jour of com icpthe most sensible duellist we ever heard of was one who chose pistols and a mile as his wepons and distance southern caucus washington feb the southern men have held a secret caucus and are acting in concert extraordinary developments are expected there is a great excitement here cols bissell and davis are still corresponding upon the subject of the buena vista battle and the debate upon the slavery question a duel at this time is much deprecated the present excitement in the senate is regarded as a desperate effort to force the north to a compromise corr n v ex press the crisis apparently approaching washington feb tha coupdemain was attempted in the senate today by senator foote or ratliei it was led off by him the senate seemed more deeply excited than i had imagined could be possible during the enactment of this scene foote proposed that a committee of twelve should be elected by ballot equally from free and slave states who should choose the thirteenth and to them should bejsubmitted all of the matters in defence between the north and south and upon which they should report he remarked to the apparent astonishment of the senate that unless there was some movement towards an adjustment of this kind events would occur within a week or ten days which must render any compromise impossible this was said with startling solemnity butler of s c opposed such a movement now as calculated to place them in an awkward position if the proposition agieed upon in committee should fail in the senate he took occasion to say in the course of remark that if we were to part he hoped to do so without leaving behind him any personal ill feeling with any senator from the north this heightened the excitment walker of wisconsin deprecated the movement davis badger and berrien in favor dayton of new jersey in a cool sensible onslaught upon the movement made sad havoc with the deep and solemn impression of impending danger which had been created so it was postponed until tomorrow it is almost impossible to judge of this movement in the excitement of the moment w ithdrawalfrom congress ishowever i doubt not contemplated as a majority constitutes a quorum however it will be seen that enough will remain to do business the ulimate result must be that those who withdraw will lose their seats and their pay and the people of the south will send others to their places i have within a day or two past chanced to see some unmistakable evidences of southern attachment to the union the compromise too some southern states cousidered ultra this desperate move of footes is regarded as in consequence of the reaction juvenal the chances of disunion washington feb j t j s understood here that thirtyfour members from the slave states have signed an agreement to persevere in staving off all transaction of business in the house until the slavery question shall be settled to their liking by ealling the yeas and naves moving adjournment calls of the house oc whenever there shall be an effort to do anything the northern members are cogitating plans to baffle such man oeuvres and one proposition considered is that of adjourning and having a special session called at the beginning of which such new rules may be adopted as are adapted to the state of things h is alarmed and confident that blood will be spilt on thefloor of the house before the session closes he says he knows many members who go to the house armed every day in anticipation of a general fight w is confident that disunion is now inevitable he knows intimately

mesmerism to the great satisfaction of his numerous hearers oneof them an english gentleman apparently after the doctor had experimented upon him made a speech in which he expressed the great pleasure it gava him to find so many persons so well employed and complimented them upon the effectual manner in which they were refuting the slanderous accusations of their enemies it is rarely that any of our city friends i e les blancs honor us with their presence or encourage us in our efforts for improvement they believe they perform their duty in contributing towards the abolition of slavery and the slave trade and in encouraging the sale of free labor produce they care but little for the moral and intellectual elevation of the free people of color and believe them sufficiently happy if they have become good cooks and scullions hewers of wood and drawers of water unlike the quaint powerful but mean hero worshipper they would rather we were not under the rule of beneficent whips at the same time they believe that if we whip in hand drive their horsestve are fulfilling our destiny and that there is no necessity for us to progress and to develope our faculties to aspire to the learned professions the fine arts or mercantile persuits last week mr robert purvis lectured upon human rights before the p l c his discourse was brief but to the point full of poetic fire and delivered with fiis characteristic energy and enthusiam he was quite severe upon secret institutions existing among the colored population and set forth in glowing colors the great good that might be accomplished if instead of applying such large sums of money to gewgaws processions lc they were expended for the attainment of equal rights proving his position by incontrovertible facts one of which was that while the whites smiled approvingly upon extravagant displays of costly regalia c and encouraged processions which diverted the oppressed from the object which should command all their talents they mobhed them when in procession they displayed banners significant of liberty and equal right at the close of the lecturea warm discussion took place with regard to secret institutions a white gentleman mr w defended oddfellowship c very ingeniously but i thought erred in net taking a vie w of it from tfie proper point he should place himself amid the same circumstances which surround the colored man when debating this question mr purviss great argument in opposition appealed to he that those institutions absorbed too much of the means and talents which would be rqore usefully employed in rescuing as from the anomalous position we occupy and obtaining for us the rights of freemen mr w s difference of opinion served to elicit all mi purviss eloquence which afforded the assembly a fine intellectual repast in the course of the debate mrpurvis administered a cutting rebuke to the venerable arch compromiser who ignorant of that magnanimity of soul which should be one of the principal characteristics of agreat mind has so frequently slandered a weak and persecuted portion ot the american people would the hon gentleman could have heard it it would have enabled him for the future to view us in a different light and caused perhaps a fresh spring of thought to meander thiough his gigantic intellect before the phcenixonian dr bryan lectured upon the anatomy of the age he is one of the ablest lecturers whom i have ever had the pleasure of listening to he complimented the audience upon their attention and congratulated them upon the instruction they were receiving from different persons of eminence dr patterson also lectured before this institution upon the circulation of the blood illustrated by many beautiful engravings and preparations a paper read betore this institution

lecture and cts for the course the phil lib co give their lectures free gratis and take up a collection there has been a barbers ball since my last writing which i have been told w r a fully and fashionably attended a fancy ball is in preparation and the gay spirits are all on the qui vive a number of concerts have also taken place lately one was given by the odd fellows in franklin hall great preparations were made for this entertainment many who had purchased tickets were unable to gain admittance on account of the large attendance it is thought there were between eight and nine hundred persons in the hall the performance went off in a pleasing manner splendid wreaths were presented to miss g and to mrs b whose vocal abilities afforded the large audience so much pleasure the concert is to be repeated r d we have not been able to publish the letters to which friend mabbitt refers we think however that the present one contains the gist of his former ones women rights in my last article on this subject i insisted that there was no good reason why women might not take at least an equal part with our sex in the professions of la w medicine and the christian ministry in previous articles i have endeavoured to show the inadequacy and futility of existing laws and customs to render equal justice to widows and unmarried women i wish to say something more on this point a few years since the people of this state were called upon to vote in reference to the license systemwhelher we should or should not have licensed dram houseswhether men could have the sanction and authority of their respective towns to deal out the imoxicating fluid to their fellow men sin meii ced this series of articles our legislature have passed an act prohibiting the sale of intoxicating drinks as a beverage but which will not become a law unless by the legal voters of their state at our general election next fall now is there a reasonable doubt if all our tax paying citizens without reference to color or sex could have the use of the elective franchise that the shameless monster intemperance could have a legal existence i think not too many of our female citizens have felt the effects not t avail themselves of the opportunity for the removal of the cause take the case of war suppose some nation should insult our countiys flag and there should be a public expression through the ballot box calledj forwomen being allowed to vote is there a doubt as to the result of such an expression the reasoning of our mother wives sisters daughters would be something like this pretty idea truly to think of going to war and hazard the loss of life property and public virtue just to punish an entire nation because a few inconsiderate men had insulted our flag and how have they insulted our flag why they have reminded us of the great propriety of such a flagthat it represents by its stars an exalted profession of liberty and by its atiipesthe lash upon the backs of slavesgreat reason this for going to war no our men shall not by our consent go to war with their neighbors because they have had sufficient courage to tell them the truth acting in accordance with sentiments of this kind qur women wmuld save our country from the ruinous consequences of war and without reproach to us as a people since it is no repioach to avoid the calamities of yar again take the subject pf slavery could our citizens of the other sexof adult age be allowed an expression upon this subject through the ballot box there would no chance for a slaveholder as such to occupy any other position than one of the lowest infamy a nuisance to anything like republicanism there are yet some men to be found in our land who hesitate not to sell their own children shame on the creatures they are not men and such creatures are allowed to vote and tobe voted for but thank god no american woman has yet been guilty of that dark deed indeed it doe not now occur to my mind that the page of history is stained with a record of any such crime i am aware that the records of antiquityjafford precedents of parents selling their children but i have yet to learn that a woman has beep found or heprd from thqt voluntarily without fear or compulsion ever sold her own child i think my opinion is well founded when say give the women of our country the use of the elective franchise and slavery would no longer be tolerated l mabbett collins center n y mo th california there are six steamers running between new york aud chagres as follows howard cos line empire city and crescent cityj george

previous to the publication of the deserted village the bookseller gave him a note for the price agreed uponone hundred guineas as he was on his way home he met an acquaintance to whom he related the circumstance the gentleman thought this a very large sum for so small a poem in truth said goldsmith i think so too it is much more than the honest man can afford or the piece is worth i have not been easy since i received it the idiot actually returned the note to the bookseller and left him to graduate the payment according to the success of the work such idiocy is not very common in the world and men were astounded at such displays of it as there is not much danger of o great an increase in the number of such idiots as to render thema public burden we should be glad to have a few more of them goldsmith was called an inspired idiotwe wish his acquaintances had the grace to consider such idiocy the gift of in spiration we now come to the other charge against goldsmith the charge of vanity this charge was made particularly by that vainest of the vain james boswell whose jaundiced eye saw everything in a yellow light he seems to have been an ardent believer in the doctrine to which carlyle refers that neediness and greediness and vainglory are the chief qualities of mankind and that whatever cannot be referred to the categories of need and greed is without scruple ranged under that of vainylory goldsmith had need enough it is true but as he was totally destitute of greed boswell thought an extraordinary number of his actions was to be attributed to vainglory the peacock who was so vain in regard to dress that after having been at court he went to the printing office with his trappings and summoned all the printers devils to admire him accuses goldsmith of displaying vanity in dress mr irving with kindhearted good sense attributes his apparent vanity to another feeling this proneness to finery in dress savs he which boswell and others of goldsmiths contemporaries who did not understand the secret plies of his character attributed to vanity arose we are convinced from a widely different motive it was from a painful idea of his own personal defects which had been cruel jly stamped upon his mind in his boyhood by the sneers and jeers of his playmates and had been ground deeper into it by rude speeches made to him in every step of his struggling career until it had become a constant cause of awkwardness and he had experienced more sensibly since his reputation had elevated him into polite society and he was constantly endeavoring by the aid of dress to acquire that personal acceptability if we may use the phrase which nature had denied him if ever he betrayed a little selfcomplacency on first turning out in a new suit it may perhaps have been because he felt he had achieved a triumph over his ugliness he goes on to speak of circumstances existing xt the time of which he is treating which may have rendered goldsmith more than usually attentive to his personal appearance he had become acquainted with the beautiful intelligent sprightly and agreeable miss hornecks and was inspired with tender feelings towards the younger who went by the name of the jessamy bridt alas poor goldsmith exclaims mr laying how rauchofthis silken finery was dictated not by vanity but by humble consciousness of thy defects how much of it was to atone for the uncouthness of thy person and to win favor in theeyes of the jessamy bride a slight personal defect caused byron to hate his fellowmen in goldsmith the cofisciousnese of personal defect led to a vpfell meant effort to remove its effects yel byron is admired and goldsmith is laughed at but boswell represents goldsmith as strutting about and bragging of his dress it is easy to see that on the occasion to which boswell alludes goldsmith was indulging his humor ol which he possessed a sreat share such a fool as boswell was incapable of understanding goldsmith we will give two other instances of what the incorrigible dunce considers displays of vanity he went with the miss hornecks jto france while stopping at a hotel in lisle they were drawn to the windows by a military parade in front the extreme beauty of the miss horrecks immediately attracted the attention of the officers who broke forth with enthusiastic speeches and compliments intended for their ears goldsmith was amused fora while but at length affected impatience at this exclusive admiration of his beautiful companions and exclaimed with mock severity elsewhere i also would have my admirers it required a boswell to construe this into an evidence of mortified vanity on another occasion he went with burke to witness the performances of some puppets when burke praised the dexterity wiih which one of them tossed a pike pshaw said goldsmith with some warmth according to boswell i cando it better myself the same evening adds this prince of fools he broke his shin by attempting to exhibit to the company how much better he could jump over a stick than ihe puppets well did johnson describe boswell as a fellow who had missed his only chance of immortality by not having been alive when the dunciad was written it is true he gained immortaii ty in a way not expected by johnson but his work is like freason we are pleased with the thing itself but despise the author he was so anxious to be down an ass that in the absence of the sexton ije wrote it down himself croker in his notes to boswell relates an occurrence which has been considered a ludicrous display of goldsmiths vanity it was related to croker by col omoore of cloghan castle in ireland who was a party concerned the colonel and burke walking one day through leicester square on their way to sir joshua reynoldss wtih whom they were to dine observed goldsmith who was likewise to be a guest standing and regarding a crowd which was staring and shouting at some foreign ladies in the window of a hotel observe goldsmith said bupke to omoore and mark what passes between us at sir joshuas they passed on and arrived there before him burke received qoldsnith with affected reserve ard coldness being pressed ip explain the reason said he i am ashamed to keep company with a person who could act as you have just done in the square goldsmith protested he was ignorant of what was meant why said burke did you not exclaim as you were looking up at those women what a stupid beast the crowd must be for staring with such admiration at those painted jezebels while aman of your talents passed py unnoticed surely surely my dear friend cried goldsmith with alarm surely i did not say so nay rrpjied kurke if you had not said so how should i have known it thats true answered goldsmith i am very sorryit was very foolish ido recollect that something of the kind passed through my mind but i did not think that i had uttered it now this proves nothing in the world but goldsmiths childlike simplicity of character he was unsuspicious of a trick and could be made to believe almost anything we do believe the thoughts no more passed the mind than the words passed from his lips but his mind having no suspicion of deception was seeking a cause for the effect before him and could find no other explanation than that he must have spoken the words and thought the thoughts when a man in a very earnest manner insists that you certainly do know some particular individual you will begin to think you do know him though you have never seen him in your life if water is thrown in the face of a sleeping man his mind goes
