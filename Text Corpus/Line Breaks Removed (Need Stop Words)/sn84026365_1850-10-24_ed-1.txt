meetings of colored citizens of new york below we give reports of two meetings held by the colored people of this city within the past few days the report of each was made in part for the standard and in part corrected from that of the herald as we do not profess to give much more than a sketch of the meetings of course the drift merely of the speeches can be given they are full enough however to indicate the spirit which animates the new york colored people it would be exceedingly difficult to take a fugitive publicly from this city but unfortunately the work is done secretly and in the dark the reception meeting given to hamlet who had been purchased by contributions made through the journal of commerce office and who was brought back on saturday was the first public meeting ever held by colored people in the park it numbered several thousands and went off with the greatest enthusiasm we are glad tobe able to state that the death of mrs hamlet which was reported two or three days before was incorrect and that the joy of the reclaimed slave was made complete by the welcome of his wife and children the story of her death we are told arose from the fact that she was at one time thrown into convulsions and was supposed by the bystanders to have ceased to live meeting of the colored population their denunciations of the fugitive slave billa meeting of colored people with a slight and visible sprinkling of white abolitionists was held yesterday evening at the zion chapel church street the building which is capable of holding persons was crowded to excess two thirds of

unable to find his honor we addressed the following communication september to his honor c s woodhull sir the undersigned take this method to address this communication to you as the chief magistrate of the city of new i ork to ascertain whal protection we the free colored people may expect under the operation of the fugitive slave law the peculiar position we occupy in this statede pending upon the magistery of the people of new york to defend her citizens against the operation of unjust law we solicit in the name of our families that information from you which the nature of the case demands respectfully fitc william p powell lewis h putnam n bplease answer and address william p powell pearl street up to this hour seven and one half o clock oct that functionary had not thought it worth whi to give an answer the several sections of the fugitive slave bill were then read amid interruptions execrations and cries of shame at the conclusion a voice in the gallery asked was there no more of it an interrogatory which excited the risbilities of some which were however checked by the president who told them it was too solemn a question for merriment the following letters were then read to the meeting letter from ai an son nah new york october ist  gentlemen i received your communication of the th of september last requesting my opinion as to the constitutionality of the recent law of congress relative to fugitive slaves in reply i state that the law g passed by congress has many objectionable features in it indeed it obviously infringes upon the constitution of the united states in several particulars h irst it suspends the writ of habeas corpus contrary to the second subdivision of the ninth section of the national constitution second it is in violation of a portion of the fifth article of the amendments which declares that no person shall be deprived ol life liberty or property without due process of law third it is m violation of the seventh article of the amendments which declares that in suits at common law where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars the right of trial by jury shall be preserved fourth it is in violation of the spirit and force of the constitution of tile united states which declares that the judicia power of the united states shall be vested in one supreme court and in such inferior court as the congress may from time to time ordain and establish according to art ec of said constitution in as much m yd bmumib yd im asaw fhb right is of no sex truth is of no color god is thsvriir of us all and all men are brethren the fugitive slave law confers judieia powers of the very highest nature upoi commissioners who are not judges o any court nor can they have judicia powers conferred upon them withou constituting them in direct terms t court a u s commissioner is an inferioi officer he is no judge he has no clerk he holds no court and his proceedings are not subject to review ik owtjgurss or he united states possesses no power to pass a law that a citizen of the state of new york shall be taken and carried to south carolina and in the latter state to be tried whether he is a free man or a slave in new york the doctrine that a man may be seized in england and carried to france and there tried whether he is a freeman or a slave in england is contrary to all known laws and so far as the rights of citizens of the state of new york are concerned the arrest of such persons here and the sending of them to other slates for trial of their rights under the laws of the state of new york is as much a violation of law as though the man had been seized in england and carried to france to try by the judicial tribunals of ihe latter country the rights of the manso seized in england the whole spirit of this act called die fugitive slave law takes away the rights and personal liberties of the citizens of each state the ninth article of the amendments to the constitution of the united states are in these words the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people so article tenth of the amen dments jays that the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the s ates are re lerved to the states respectfully or to he people nor the powers reserved to the states and the rights retained by the people onsist among other things of those fa trial by jury where life liberty orf property are concerned and also the right of each state ho letermine whether its own citizens aie ugitives from service or not congress has not power to pass laws hat shall deprive a citizen of this state af his life liberty or property or of areventing each citizen of calling to iis aid a trial by jury wljen either his life liherty or property is involved the writ of habeas corpus and the right of trial by jury for each citizen are amply provided for by the constitution and the laws of the state of new fork and whenever a person is arrested under the provision of the fugitive slave law such person has the righto a writ of habeas corpus and trial by ury under our own state laws there is one feature in the late law f congress relative to slaves which seems to be a full recognition of the principle that all slaves brought into he state by their masters are thereby made free and also that all children born in a ree state of a fugitive slave mother tre also free the fugitive slave law no where orovides that a person making oath un ler this law and swearing corruptly ind falsely shall be guilty of perjury or iable to any pains yid penalties for ommitting perjury nor does the aw make it obligatory on the claimant f a fugitive slave to take him back vhen reclaimed to the place whence he iscaped but a man from charleston south carolina may arrest a free mann new york and carry him direct to the slave pens at baltimore and sell tim to a negro trader and then land him directly into the awamps of louisiana whenever he can obtain a certificate from a commissioner rightfully or wrongfully the constitution of the united states evidently contemplates that the people of the several states shall be deprived of no rights which are guaranteed to themby the state laws and constitution the constitution of new york declares that the trial by jury in all cases in which it has been heretofore used shall remain inviolate forever and further that no member of this state shall be disfranchised or deprived of any rights or privileges secured to any citizen thereof unless by the law of the land and judgment of his peers in this latter section tne word member is used in contradiction to the word citizen the people ol this state have intended that every person in this state shall have the benefit of our laws the stranger who sojourns here be his color black white or redis equally entitled to the protection of our laws the great bill of rights called the magna chart a declares that no man shall be seized or imprisoned or exiled or in any manner destroyed or condemned or passed upon unless by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land it is the birth right of every manand the people of the states and of the united states have never given up this right to congress to pass laws to take it away suppose a man arrested is a slave who knows most about it his family and friends or his claimant suppose he is a freeman who is to determine this question is a commissioner ex parte in a secret session and without a hearing of the allegations from the accused or a jury who rochester n y thursday october r letter from thaddeus stevens washington september o dear sir i can give but little hope that the infamous slave law will bes declared unconstitutional can advise nothing better than that the sub f jects of it put themselves beyond its reach j with great respect your obedient servant j thaddeus stevens w p powell pearl st n y mr george t downing then read the following resolutions which were received with cheers and expressions ot approbation i whereas the congress of the united stales has passed a law for the avowed purpose of reclaiming persons owing service in one state apd escaping into another and approved by milliard fillmore the president of the uuited states on the th day of september and whereas the operation of said law allows any person in the southern states to go into any court or before any justice of the peace or any other person authorized to take depositions in any state or organized territory of the united states and swear that any colored person owes him or her service or labor and has escaped therefrom and may take out a warrant for the arrest of such person in any united states court in any state or territory and seize sueh person withor without a warrant and command the assistance of bystanders to make the arrest and whereris any person so arrested may be taken before any united states court io any state or territory of the united states and deprived of his or her liberty in as ummary manner by any judge justice or commissioner of the united states and whereas any person so arrested and tried is stripped of the right of trial by jury deprived of the writ of habeas corpvs contrary to the provisions of the constitution of the united states and wheritas any white person may seize and arrest any colored person and drag him or her by violence before any unit ed states judge justice or commissioner and swear away the liberty of any person so arrested and whereas any person assisting another to escape either before or aftertrial or is known to conceal a person claimed as a slave is subject to a fine of one thousand dollars and thus in every way placing the liberty of colored persons in every slate or territory of this union completely at the mercy of slaveholders or their agents with every safeguard of liberty stricken downtherefore  resolved that we utterly repudiate the law and its provisions that it is so repugnant to every principle of justice that it can have no binding force whatever upon us and that we do herein the sight of god and before all men declare that should any one attempt to execute its provisions on any one of us either by invading our home or arresting us in the street we will treat such an one as assaulting our persons with intent to kill and god being our helper will use such means as will repel the agg lessor and defend our lives and liberty resolved that we are worthy neither of our homes nor of the confidence of our wives and children unless we are prepared to sacrifice ourselves freely if necessary on the altar of freedom and in their defence k resolved that the teachings aad examples of oar countrymen the promptings of our nature as men aswell as our duty towards god leii us that whenever tbs unjust provisions of this law against god and huinmty hall be attempted to be enforced against either of us it were far better that a thousand fives wrish in the rei friday oct mkrh honor the mayor has me f that in case of arrest of he has forbidden the policetshpan t other officer of the corpjffhfrnni assisting the slaveholder ttvhping slaves uuder the late act ofrflhks but as to what course the iflhbrecj people ought to pursue hvlfss wmt ol seizure not bavin re fugitive law he was unablato ssla his honor that in the event of my friend robert hamilton who was present being arrested under the fugitive act with intent to reduce him to slavery that we would not allow him to be taken out of the city to which the mayor made no reply w p powell once send a man into slaveryunder a commissioners certificate and how is he to obtain his freedom when wrongfully wrested from hima person once condemned by an united states commissioner to slavery is forever deprived of his freedom heis a slave for life and all his fraternity he might as well expect to get an audience of the monarch of great britain as to obtain relief through any judicial tribunal in the slave states orin those of the united states the door is forever shut to him after he has once passed into a slave state i have no doubt that in all cases where a person may be arrested in this state under the late act of congress that he is entitled to and he and his agent or friends can sue out a writ oi habeas corpus in our state courts and there try the question whether hehe is fugitive slave or not here he will at least have a fair trial i am very respectfully your obedient servant alanson nash to messrs powell smith and others committee c terns z per ann lifarlamj l araace cue than that a single human being being permitted io be dragged from our midst htto hopeless bondage and that we desire no grave prouder than that over which shall stand the monument and no page of history prouder than that which shall record the deed of such rescue  resolved that it has ever been our aim and earn to be gotd l ftbl citizens and that strive such to be neverthelesswe cannot for one moment entertain the idea of compliance with the terms of that bim its force being lost in the fact that it is at variance with the laws of our nature and of god and further because we believe it to be at variance with the spirit and letter of our declaration of independence and of the constitution established under that declaration resolved that the provisions of the fugitive slave bill of leaving us no other alternative we must adopt he motto of our sister state virginia resistance to tyrants is obedience to god resolved that we declare to mason and the aiders and abettors of this arbitrary and despotic law in the language of daniel webster that there is something on earth greater than arbitrary and despotic power and the lightning has its powor and the earthquake has its powerbut there is something among men more capable of shaking despotic power than lightning whirlwind or earthquakethat is the threatened indignation of the civilized world  resolved that god willed us freemenman willed us slaveswe will as god wills gods will be done resolved that inasmuch as desperate efforts are being made to reclaim fugitives who have fled for liberty to reclaim them at all costs we sympathizing with such fugitives and believing that they would be justified therein by the promptings of natureby the precepts of patrick henry and of washington by the glorious example of madison washington do council them to do as we wouldto arm themselves with the surest and most deadly weapons to resist unto death for which if they be not prepared we advise them to repair with all possible despatch to where the law as well as nature proclaims them free resolved that in giving ten mil ions of dollars to the south for land which the south never owned in promising to pay one thousand dollars u the south for every bondsman who mat escape therefromin converting hir once free soil into a hunting ground for the panting fugitive and in offering to own citizens a bribe on the one hand lo join in the chase and fine and imprisonment on the other hand for refusing to do so the once free north has sold herself body and soul to the dark spirit of slavery and has through her chosen president and subservient members of congress declared in tones that will pierce the ears of half the human race that the last great experiment of representative government has failed and has caused millions of eyes of those who fed their inherent love of liberty upon the success and prosperity of the america example to turn away from our deep disgrace with dissatisfaction and disgust and has caused the doctrine of the divine right of kings to feeleven in its grave a returning sensation of vitality and resuscitation resolved that we call upon all american citizens who have any regard for constitutional law or any reverence for the history of our glorious past or any pride in our national reputation abroad to join in the cry of repeal repeal the infamous hill which barters the life and liberty of a freeman for the oath cf any wretch who may swear that he is a slave resolved that ww will circulate petitions to the legislature of this state calling for a law to protect its free colored citizens from slavery and for resolutions instructing the members of conf ross to urge the repeal of the fugitive slave bill resolved that we will send petitions to congress praying for the repeal of the fugitive slave bill of  resolved that abated by nothing other than pure humanity in attempting to curry out these resolutions whenever necessity requires them we will for further endeavor to infuse their healthful spirit into the minds and hearts of our fellowcitizens  resolved that the president of this meeting be appointed to receive the names ot ail persons who may be willing to act on the secret committee and all persons who are fugitive to report themselves to the chairman of the meetingwho must have their real name and the name of their master in order that the secret committee may know what to do in the premises mr ijowning then said that he had nothing to remark but that these resolutions thoug strongh were the senti uvents of his heart and he declared that whenever he saw the panting slave be would assist him by every means in his power a voiceand se will th e white men too mr d continuedwe have to come to this determinationto die or to teach the individual who undertakes lo carry out the proviaiine of this bill that his mfe is in danger i am a father andjbound by every lie to protect my wife and children and here declare that if any manany fien in human shape dare to erase the threshhold of my caetle ill send him tohfl before he ferous cheese i have u used that hh word fceoausf do bewra that

am not how mahyjarr there er not held aa prominent a position as i do and ho may be made i liable to the bill with them i feel i hear hear i call on you not to battle but to arm yourset ves for liberty mt io wrung uurnw by reading a letter which tho committee had sent to horace greeley asking him to explain some matters with respect to the course of president fillmore on the question but which mr greeley for reasons best known to himself had not answered dr smith rose and said in the year of grace and ih of our independence which we had reason tobe thankful to divene providence it has pleased the american congress to suspend the habeas corpus act the papers today if queen victoria had a blister on her toe or some freeman were shot down in a petty german principality would be out in full cry about the melancholy etent and the horrible butchers we would have extra heralds and extra tribunes houting it through the city but when the charter of human liberty is suspended there is not a single whisper about it but thank god we stand here tonizht not as slaves cowering under the lash of our tyrantsno wei stand here as free american citizens and with the blessing of god wewill not desist until this odious bill is repealed i wish to know if in a few months when daniel webster is sitting at his fireside in marshfield and an officer comes with his papers describes him as a large dark man with alarge head and big as that of henry clay what would mr webster say il he were carried before a magistrate and after that hurried away as fast as steam can oarry him to alabama or somewhere else where he never would afterwards be heard of he advised that one of their first duties was to have a committee of two appointed who would be always on hand to give evidence and aid in favor of the poor fugitive he further advised that subscriptions should be immediately entered into by all the colored people to assist their colored brethren who would seek their liberty in the eastern states and described the death of hamlets wife and said that a corners inquest should be held on her bodythat millard fillmore daniel webster and honacgreeley should be summoned as witnesses and that on her tomb should be written the first victim to the act of cpngress of dr smith then sat down il was then announced that a collection would be taken up to defray the expenses of a number of fugitive slaves who are now in this city on their way to canada john s jacobs a fugitive then came forward and spoke nearly as fol lowshe said he came here tonight to give some advice and to extend the hand of fellowship to his colored brethren he said my colored brethren if you have not swords i say te you sell vour garments and buy one he regretted that he was not here intime to hear the resolutiens rcsd to know if they were strong enough if there be any man here tonight who wants to know my name tell him it is john s jacobs of south carolina and that lam an american citizen that never denied that name neither did ever disgrace it they said that they cannot take us back to the south but i say under the present law they can and now i say unto you let them only take your dead bodies tremendous cheers this is no time my friends to laugh let us go to the bouse of mourning and see the dead body of the wife of hamlet and her surviving infants vell i would rather see her body dragged to the stake than see her dragged back again into slaver i would my friends advise you to show a front to our tyrants and arm yourselves aye and would advise the women to have their knives too but i dont adviseyou to trample on the laws of this state but advise you to trample on the aws of this state but advise you to trample on this bill and further advise you to let us go on immediately and act like men he then advised the colored race to lay aside their religious and political feelings or anything that may tend to separate them and suggested that a registry should be commenced with the name of every slave his owner and all other particulars that they might tend to give him every assistance and concluded by advising the fugitives not to suffer themselves tobe taken rev charles gardiner said he did not rise to make a speech but he could not help telling the meeting that god was with them he saw the ministering angels hovering around them he said that he had been travelling through the east for the last ten weeks and that there is but one sentiment in regard to this billthat it is a flat denial of the republican principle he told them in pittsfield and other places that they the colored race should goto war with the united states or acknowledge themselves slaves they were sold he said by daniel webster the veriest bloodhound to the united states and by both houses of con gresss to the south and i call this an infamous union a union cemented in blood and robbery yes i sty robbery because slavery was began by the robbery of the sons and danghters of africa ho said that eyerr editor in the united state skulked this bill by hiding it from the public and i tar that thoy are all a ant of vllians it was a secret combination at which daniel webster and the editors were at the bottom of to dries the colored people to africa the appropriation of three millions of dollars was proposed for that pourpose he said ha was almost disposed to cut loose altogether from the presbyterian church he was disgusted with the ministers of that and the other churchesthey were all combined sgsinst them he advised his brethren and sisters to be on their guard and take the life of every man that attempted to deprive them of their liberty he considered that liberty was the greatest and only blessing they enjoyed he said that evary colored church should be opened on the first monday every month and a concert of prayer held for the panting slave he could hear them pray for everything but the poor slave and he assured them that slavery progressed upon them in proportion as they separated themselves from the lord y jacob it ghbbs colored then addressed the meeting he said tfce resolutions had met his approbation entirely hissing order order if be only got men to give him their names and stand with him they would wnihn infamomajlw in maryland the law was equally splebe but he risked bis life and put it down if ye submit to this law ye are not the men i take you to be let us tell them at once we will not submit to it let us tell them we will not submit to the yoke and theu we shall have peace had he been in time to rescue hamlet he would make new york tella tale but the next time he would take care to be up to time and if he gets six men to go with him the officers will have another story to tell he will give assistance and shelter to every fugitive that wants it and the bloodhounds of the law are welcome to take his life he was ready to lay it downa man in the gallery cried out that they had wandered from the object of the meeting they had heard some fine speeches but while we are speaking hero the fugitive slaves are fleeing from the city from their families and their firesides and if liberty is worth fighting for anywhere it is worth fighting for here he concluded by calliug on them to appoint a committee to advise the slaves to remain and the first that is taken to rescue him and that would have more effect than all the resolutions you would pass tonight junius c morrel next spoke to the resolutionshe said that in commotions in a great community the first inquiry always was what occasioned such commotion just so it wa with us i would ask you then what i brought us here tonight it was their famous fugitive slave bill i would i not tell you what to do but i will tell i you what i w ill do lam a freeman and i care not for the constitution or the laws made by man the is a law above them and tell you that before they drag me into slavery they will have to take my life the mau that would cross the threshold of my door to drag me into slavery although i am not a fighting man but when i am putto the wall i will use this right armand deal death and destruction around me but my friends be not the aggressors keep the peace but always be prepared i dont agree with my fellowtownsman who spoke here tonight that we have no sympathy but i say we have and if we deserve it we will have more of it he then gave an account of a fee colored man named charles frisbee who was kidnapped in philadelphia and sent into virginia and a man named stansbury a member of the methodist church who was also arrested and if it had not been for the testimony of mr titus a member of the society of friends who was produced as a witness and swore that he knew stansbury for several years before the time it was said he escaped and who also swore that stans bury was at the battle of bladensburg under commodore barney he would heve been condemned and sent into slavery he said they would have plenty of such cases here a voice in the gallery said he would have been claimed in as a fugitive slave only that he was in the naval service mr morrell said that in viewing the church he other day he found the church of rome had its headthe greek church had its headthe english church had its head and so has the american church but the head of the american church was the demon of slavery cheering the orator then went on to tell a story that happened in one of the down east churches wttch nearly led him into infidelity he said that after the performance of some splendid ceremonies in which all the white brethren and sisters joined and old aged gentleman with hoary locks and with one foot in the grave and the other on the brink came forward and said now iny colored brethren and sisters it is your turn we are all the same in jesus come and partake of the communion this my brethren is the sort of religion that had nearly led me into infidelity but if we act like men now we will soon have no negro pews and no sending us around about he concluded by advising them to be prepared but not to be the aggressors jerimiah powers next addressed the meetinghe said that the black men fought side by side with their american brethren and had a share in tho most glorious battles that were fought in this country from the first revolution to the late war with mexico the only argument he would use against this hell hatched code the fugitive slave billwas the bowieknife and the revolver they want to drag the black men and black women out of this country but i tell you we have as good a right here as any white man or woman he then said the locofocos went to syracuse to eat up john van buren and all the free soil niggers it was the negroes elected mr fillmore and now he pays us off with big bills and that i the reason they kept dark about it and only the election is near at hand horace greeley would publish it r mr st remmy from canada next ddressed the meetiog he related several old anecdotes in n ferencs to rochester north star fair the ladies of rochester desirous of emulating the noble example set them by their sisters of new york snd philadelphia in then efforts to sustain the shore named paper htre formed an association for the purpose of holding s fair daring christmas week in aid ofmhe north star to those acquainted with the character of this paper it is needless to spepk of its merits or of the untiring zeal and sincere devotion of its editor eminently qualified as frederick douglass is to promote the elevation of hi oppressed and despised people at the north he is also equally qualified to sympathize with our brothers and sisters who are still in chains and slavery at the southto tell of their wrongs to vindicate their rights and by the blessing of god to hasten the day of freedom to the three millions of our enslaved fellow countrymen we therefore regard the north star as one of the most effective antislavery in etrumentalities now in the field and in this night of darkness and gloom we look to itas the beacon to guide us until the daydawn and unclouded sunshine bursts upon us we call upon all true friends of the slave to give us their zealous cooperation on the present occasion friends of humanity shall we call upon you in vain a cruel and inhuman law is banishing hundreds of our people into a distant land and bringing ruin and desolation upon many once happy families christian friends of rochester we call upon you in the name of all you hold dear and sacred to extend your kind aid and sympathy to the daughters of an outraged and suffering people we earnestly invite the cooperation of benevolent friends throughout the country we appeal with confidence to our english friends for aid on the present occasion donations and contributions will be gratefully received by mrs titus division st mrs panl exchange st mrs boyd i main st or by any member of the association and at the north star office rochester brewers panorama of the mammoth cavewe have no hesitation in saying that this is one of the best if not the best exhibition of this kind ever presented to the people of bosron we would recommend our readers to visit this splendid panorama it opens with a fine view of boston common the views of fairmount water works the niagara river and falls especially the winter scene of the jailer and the prairies are beautiful that portion of the painting devoted to the mammoth cave says the atlas closes the exhibition a visitor to this painting has a belter opportunity to behold its wonders than can be obtained by an actual visit two or three torches serves as the artist observes but to make darkness visible but at the time of mr brewers visit to the cave he had by the permission of the proprietor three or four hundred lights to illuminate the chanbets when he made his sketches few persons have any idea of the extent of the mammoth cave it has avenues varying from half a mile to sixteen miles in length and altogether forming an extent of over four hundred miles explored there is probably as much of the cave unexplored as there is explored and daily discoveries verify the truth of this assertion the most noted and beautiful of the chambers and hls of the cave are faithfully portrayed in the painting bv mr brewer and the panorama closes witha view of the beautiful fairy grotto not a painted but an intimation grotto this exhibition affords an excellent and highly instructive entertainment for a couple of hours books descriptive of the panorama containing a full acconnt of the cave may be obtained at the door for a slight increase of charge mr brewer himself explains the painting to the spectators his voice is clear and distinct and can be heard ia all parts of the hall this is quite a consideration he is the mode l of panorama explainersemanci pator id the new york evangelical congregational association passed the following resolutions at a meeting at poughkeepsie on the bth inst resolved that we cannot recognize this law

master unto thee he shall dwell with thee even among you in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates where it liketh him best thou shall not oppress him dit is in opposition to the great law of christian benevolence which requires us in all things to do unto others as we would that others should do unto us d it conflicts with the provisions of our national constitution th it prostrates those two great safeguards of human liberty habeas corpus and trial by jury sth it is revolting to the spontaneous promptings of humanity th it brings upon our nation the reproach of injustice and inconsistency and impairs our influence upon the world for good th in short this law outrages every principle of human feeling of humanity and religion and thus so far as the principle is concerned it endangers the iibeity of every maf w resolved that while we recognize the obligation to obey the laws of the land we make ai exception in the case of all such provisions as contravene

unanimously resolved that we denounce the late fugitive slave law as being unjust unconstitutional and at variance with the laws w god and humanity d j the friends of humanity in detroit ere determined that the colored man recently arrested there as s fugitive from slavery shall not be returned to bondage and have resolved to buy his freedom if he fails to establish his right to it otherwise the man says he has purchased his freedom and was allowed one weeks delay in order that he might send to cincinnati for hit papers the washington union has the following from its baltimore correspondent a great excitement has sprung ap among the blacks st the north relative to the operation of the fugitive slave bill especially aa itis well known that hundreds of owners of fugitives are now scouring the north in search of their property many owners know of the whereabouts of their slaves having met them in their travels and are now perfecting their arrangements for securing them id referring to the indignant reeeption meeted out to the infamous fugitive slave law and to the determination of some of our people not to join in the chase for fugitives the richmond whig says we cannot believe but that any resistance on the part of the madmen of the abolition party to the legal authorities will be met promptly and with the moat decisive measures the bullet and bayonet if it must needs be so will effectually suppress the mutinous manifestations of these fools and should resistance indeed come we do not doubt that such arguments in this case the ultima ra tiswill be addressed to them the recreancy ol the pressmen who can twist therßible to suit their own extreme opinions disregarding all previous interpretations by the most learned and pious commentators men who have the hardihood to pretend that slaves are not once spoken of in the new testament and that philemon was not a slave men who are governed by a higher law than the constitution viz their own private judgment of what the law should have been are not to be trusted in a case where their feelings sym rathiea and prejudices are so deeplyenlisted t was for precisely such men that the severities of this law were introduced the foregoing words are quoted from a recent editorial article in the n y journal of commerce and have reference to bat portion of the fugitive slavs law which strips its victims of the right of trial by jury in the state where the arrests may be made thereby annulling the most sacred feature of english law the spirit embodied in this editors production alluded to is in perfect keeping with the eourse of that venal print during a long period of years the journal of commerce ever since we fust knew anything of it has been the fast friend of its southern taskmasters ever paying a willing service to the demonise spirit of its proslavery age it has not regenerated one whit since the reverend david hale passed from his post to receive his deserts for deeds done in the body he was a faithful servant of wrong no ray of hope no word of kindneas for the oppressed of hit country was ever observed in the productions of his pen to lend them an unwonted glow and give their readers an evidence that they were not ute outbirth of a spirit of darkness we dislike exceedingly to speak in terms other than commendatory of such as have passed from our immediate sphere but it isa miserable charity which refrains from condemning the perpetrator of wrong merely because he has by one of natures sternest laws been placed where he can no longer do violence to those whose humanity made christ their brother and him their enemy we refer to this journal for the purpose of instancing it as a fau specimen of the proslavery press of our country it is sui generis evil and timeserving snd those who rule its columns are ever ready to bend the pliant hinges of the knee that thrill may follow fawning it is cheering to turn from such odious examples to the fresh and generous pages of those journals whose columns evince a better purpose a loftier morality and a truer piety than that which swells its cant in the leaders of a hireling press there are men in our country who had rather suffer wrong than do wrong they honor their profession let it be what it may whether it leadathem to the editors table the legal tribunal or the christian pulpit they are those who will not bow themselves to falsehood nor sell themselves to the bid of mammon let sa instance the new york evening post and its able poeteditor william cullen bryant that paper is outspoken and

the meeting held last night in faoeuii hall to oonatder the ooodition of the colored citizens of boston end its vicinity consequent upon tbs enactment of that hellblack scheme by our free american congress for the recapture of fugitive sieves was a powerful demonstration the vast hall was crowded toits utmost limits many were compelled to leave unable to gain admission there could not havo been fewer piesent then five thousand the spirit of the occasion equalled the numbers i have never seen a meeting more unanimous end strong it wss easy to see that the vast multitude had assembled under the influence of emotions of no ordinary character there was a manifest eagerness eveil before the appointed hour to have the speaking commence foot merely because they wanted to bear but because they wanted their own strong and impressible feelings expressed they felt a daep sympathy for their alarmed aod terrorstricken fellow cilixens upon whom the late congressional cloud wasabout to discharge its wrathful thunder and they desired that speech earnest and strong should erive thir quilrkiig hearts relief hence when that noble man francis jackson whose very countenance proclaimed him fnid to the oppressed came forward to call the meeting to order he was hailed with prolonged and deafening cheers his presence was regarded as an undication of what they might expect to follow for he ia known of all met in tbie region as the inflinehing friend of the slave and of the oppressed black man you will doubtless see the proceedings of this meeting as reported for the daily papers but i must be allowed to say a few words re speeting them for good as those reports are especially those of the chronolype and traveller they fall short of conveying to the reader the real feeling which pervaded that assemblage nor can i expect to do so it is beyond the sphere of pen ink and paper to doit to understand what that meeting was seeing and hearing were indispensable the congregated thousands must be visited the universal buzz and confused clamor common to auch masses and the sadden hush and fixed attention of such a multitude to one centra point must be seen to be appreciated the chairman of the meeting hon c francis adams made the first speech it was chaste lucid and earnest and was received with many tokens of applause the speech though excellent was not the only reason of the applause which followed it the audience saw before them an adams a son of john quincy adams and a grandson of john adams illustrious names in the history of the nation a bust of the grandfather and a portrait of the father were both seen just above the worthy chairman over the rostrum ot faneuil hall the people saw these and democratic as they doubtless are they could not free themselves from the influence of the aristocracy of noble deeds which they saw there represented the grandfather a leader in the american revolution a statesman and an orator who had sounded all the depths of honor and glorythe father equally illustrious these things talk aa we may about aristocracy do command respect but let them pass at the close of the chairmans address i was called upon for a speech and especially to state the condition of the colored people under this new act for their oppiession had rode all day was tired excited and unprepared to launch into suoh an undertaking still i did not feel at liberty to decline and therefore did the best could at the close of my speech came a letter from the hon josiab quincy it was and able snd important document mr dana who read the letter made a few very appropriate introductory remarks he called upon the audience to listen to the letter ss coming from a venerable souroe a man whose claims to be heard in faneuil hall were not surpassed bythose of any other man in the commonwealth my readers shall have the letter in the north star it is a valuable history of the legislation of our country in rsepect to fugitive slaves from the very commencement of the government until now when the reading of this letter wss finished a thousand voices shouted for phillips phillips wendell phillips he came upon the platform his countenence glowed like sparkling iron newly drawn from the flaming coals the shouts which greatedhim bespoke the speaker known without saying more it is enough to say that his wss the great speech of the evening it was brief concise and power tul mr phillips was followed by mr james a briggs of cleveland ohie atalentedtfree toiler his remaiks were wel received speeches wete also made by rev theodore parker charles l remond w b spooner snd rev nathaniel colver the latter closed his speech by offering the following as the last resolution in the seriesthat law or no law constitution or no constitution union or no union the slavemaster shall never drag any man from our midst under the provisians of the late fugitive stave bill this was carried by aflslaimation six deafening cheers were given and the meeting adjourned it was said after the passing of the fugitive slave bill that the union is saved and quite is restored the arch compromiser henry clay exclaimed exultingly that peace and harmony now reign throughout our borders daniel webster in the very eestacy of patriotic enthusiasm broke forth in the language put in the mouth of the perfidious sid murderous gloster by the immortal poet now is tbe winter of our discontent made glorious summer but is it so have tbe landstorms and cold blasts of winter subsided snd have the bright sunshine and flowers of summer come no there is no peace yet nor can there be thia aide of repentance never waa there a time when the eternal father more signally vindicated his authority in the affairs of men he bae confounded the wisdom of tbe crafty and brought tbe counsels of the ungodly to nought our wise men have attempted to get respect for their laws by trampling upon the law of god and to heal the wounds of the confederacy by infiicffng wounds on the negros back their efforts are vain the whole north presents a scene of agitation such as has never before existed every paper i take up herein boston is loaded with tbe subject of the injustice cruelty and

this new monstrosity the whole country frem dan to beersbeba ia in a state of excitement and agitation a just indignation pervades the minds of all honesthearted people as yet there are no signs of the glorious summer anticipated by webster while the winter oj our discontent becomes daily more apparent i envy not the feelings of the inventors of the diabolical scheme i believe it will recoil destructively on their own heads the gallows so carefully and surreptitiously erected fot the lowly and despised mordecai may yet serve for the execution of the haughty and tyrannical haman it seems to me that these most worthy grave diplomatic compiomising and treacherous politicians have in some respects signally failed in their object as the schoolboy whistles to keep up his courage when in nightly terror he runs through the churchyard so have they uttered a feeble cry of peace peace but in response comes an eaithquake and lo ihe land rocks from centre to circumference the learned statesman henry clay with his keen sagacity and wonderful presence failed to foresee the coming convulsion the modem mirabeau daniel webster with hts giant intellect and colossal mind believed that all the clouds were id the deep bosom of the oceaa buried and was fully prepared to bask in the sunshine and take his siesta in a summer of his own creation and all went merry as a marriage bell but hush hark a deepsound strikes liks a rising knell these humane and worthy coadjutors though deaf to the voice of lamentation weeping and great mourning which ia ascending to heaven from hundreds of terror stricken and outraged fugitiveswhose parted bosom clings to wonted home as they pursue tbeir weary way into exile are nevertheless constrained to listen to the unexpected and simultaneous burst of indignation which goes out from the people of these not them cities as yet they know not of what it ia the precursor but if it be true that conscience makes eowards of us all they may well tremble one drop will sometimes make the cup overflow how often when perusing the history of bygone ages have we seen that mighty revolutions appeared to hang upon trivial incidents there has been a rapid augmentation to the ranks of the abolitionists let these friends of the slave watchstand fast in faith tpat them like menbe strong and as in days past the counsel of ahitophel was turned into foolishnessby him who dooth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth so note may he cause the cruel machinations of perfidious politicians to prepare the way lot the opening of the southern prisonhouse and the more speedy delivery of the captive there needed something to awaken the dormant energies of many nominal friends of the slave in our midst as some who say long prayers never pray in heart so i believe may we repeat an antislavery cteed until it becomes a dead letter now however the time for words has passed the time foi action has come the curse of slavery with all its accompanying horrors ia at our very doors incurred the penalty threatened to him that hideth the outcast last week andi will incut it again on the first occasion that presents itself that noble man henry ward beecher pronounces the new fugitive slave bill the most powerful antislavery ieaaoner that ever shook our northern forum i trust that the fresh impetus given by it to

arriving here i find no little excitement about the fugitive slave bill since president fillmore has unchained the tiger by the use oft poo on the i sill or sept exerting his power for the glory of god and the liberty of man i have felt an irdent desire to have some religiouspolitical watchman tell us what the signs of promise arefor the world ia expressing its opinion freely respecting that enlightened and christian enactment called the fugitive slave bill the sentiment of which is doubtless the result of the inspiring influence of his satanic majesty the climax of his infernal wickedness it seems to me that the world has misunderstood till the sitting of the last united states congress what the real and true mission of that government is is it not a mission of bonds and death our race have been i taught to think that it was to be the example of all coming human governments it being itself the model of heaven as soon as it should act upon the principle that there isa higher power than the constitution but all must confess that were all legislative governments to follow the example it has set of late that earth woud be anything else than human it may properly be asked would not the devil do well to rent out hell and move to the united slates and rival if possible president fillmore and his political followers if he can beat them at the game of sin the change will be well would not fallen angels make wise and humane senators compared with cass clay and webster the fugitive slave might have rejoiced had these men have had the experience of a lost being or fillmore the soul of satan the woiid must be convinced that damned spirits would do better and honor more the representative hall than such men as bissell brower buel ellott fuller gilbert hibbard mann miller and walden god grant that tlwir names may rot op the scroll of time we are proud to say that even fugitive slaves pity the nation that makes colored men slaves and white men kidnappers but i pity the man who willingly becomes such a slave and beast of burden for god has a bolt usburled for such in store i have often been struck with tbe great contrast between king james of england and president fillmore of america one withstood the corrupting influences of irreligion resisting demagogues priests and tbe pope writing for god and in behalf of mangiving the the poor and sustaining its

good will of his subjects to hitn with ligaments of etetnal lovefixing the foundation of his throne not in the pleasure of any despot but in the confidence and affection of his loyal people but fillmores heartless position indecision of chsiseter and the want ofa virtuous soul have rendered him despicable in the eyea of tbe good and contemptible in the just opinion of the bad in seeking to please tyrants he has lost the favor of all and alas the true church of christ can no longer pray for the success of his truckling administration it has given their souls to the oppressor and their bodies to the prison if they dare do their duty in obedience to christ in view of such fads it is my candid eonvictiun that the tecoid of the infernal regions can exhibit no blacker deeds than the american archives and the accursed fugitive slave bill upright humanity cannot uphold the hand that signed that bill of abominations unless it first does violence to its own nature god is against the man who owns the hand ha is weighed in the balance and found wanting such men as do him honor the devil fear and slaves hate this truth will be exemplified i believe incertain parts of the country in

fot the more effectual security of that species of property under the laws thereof but back of this a measure to bring the general government an acknowledged party to their right to hold man as

enlightened freemen resolved tjiat we do not consider ourselves bound under no law that violates the constitutional obligations by which we are governed therefore we consider the fugitive slave law no

yesterday at the boston square baptist church in a moat impressive manner denounced thi bill anulling the trial by jury and habeas corpus as follows nothing can be moreinnocent than the interest we take in our political relations in a government constituted like ours a solemn duty is imposed upon us to interest ourselves in elections and the course of legislation its permanency and its success depend not upon the power of the government but upon the feelinga of the people it lives in the sunshine of the popular favor we have tou ranch at stake not to be interested our protection in person and property the obligation we are under to show mercy and justice to ail require that we should do everything we oan to insure the wisest and best laws imperative however as may be our political duties do they no expose us to the danger of sinning elections involve party contests which tareiy leave those enaged in them free from guilt we seem to dismiss sll the ordinary considerations of

tbe iniquitous measures of government though i never wish to appear in active political life must be allowed to express nf opinion because my deepest feelings prompt me to it on a question which is justly agitating the community will not dwell upon the constitutional aspects of the subject but i cannot fail to pereeive that the elementary principles of english law which we havu adopted in our government have been aeii ousfy violated ido not believe there ia a highminded court in the universe that would not so decree i allude to the fugitive slave bill a moie cruel act of legislation can hardiy be found enacted by any government ip modern times a great outcry was raised against austria tor her treatment of the hungarians and yet has austria passed laws coercing a portion of that illfated people in perpetual slavery has she sent her officers over hungary to drag a portion of the citizens into captivity in another part of the country there to chain them and lash them to service she has done no such thing thank god it was reserved for the home of the brave and the land of the free to convert its national police into mancatchers and slave dealers it was left to us republicans to compel peaceful citizens and honest taxpayers who helped to defray he expenses of the government to compel them and their children to be forced forever into a condition of hopeless bondage one hour of which as one of our former presidents said is worse than centuries of that oppression our fathers engaged in a seven years conflict to overthrow how can such an act as this go unavenged i tremble

said that he appeared in behalf of a suffering and horrorstricken people he was not aware until a few moments previous that he should be called upon to state the condition and wants of his colored brethren he came not here for the purpose of denouncing slavery generally nor to promulgate to appeticulai theory for its suppression but men ialtothe audience as men humane peoplen behalf ot a buffering aud terrified people they were aware he said that by the law lately enacted by congress and signed by the president of the united states any man in any part of our country who shall make oath that he has lost a slave may pursue that slave any othei answering that description and that slave or alleged slave may be seized anywhere ironed and carried back to bondage back to bondage this law he said has carried consternation and despair to many families in the north and in this city that there is this alarm he had abundant evidence within two days he said he had travelled five hundred miles and in this route he met with many ut his brethren on the way from this land of boasted freedom to canada in many towns in the west nearly the entire colored population freemen and fugitives are so alarmed that they are disposing cf their property and making their way to the british shores many even in this city are anxiously inquiring what they many who have lately arrived here are in the utmost terror and alarm tney are airam that the hunters of men will appear here in the city of boston under the shade of bunker hill and seize themthey dread a return to slavery worse than death itself the crime of escaping from slavery is considered by the slaveholder as the highest crime il he returns therefore he return to gratify adeep seated revenge this is the active tto live in pursuing a slave it is generally understood by slaveholders that one who has once tasted of the sweets of liberty can never again make a profitable slave they therefore pursue the slave in order to make evam pies of them and the slave knows that if returned he will have to submit to excru tiaiing torture hence these tears and this train going out from the land as if fleeing from death many of them are without the means to live and are going to a severer climate and to face colder winters than they ever dreamed of those who remain he said ask you whal you will do to protect them from this bond ol bloodhounds many of them have escaped from slavery with great sufferings and have endhred tortures and if such acisof heroism give any claims to freedom they can claim il the speaker then proceeded to desciibe instances of suffering in escaping from slavery in one instance mentioned the fugitive tied himself to a tree during the day and fled at night he asked if they would consent that these fugitives should be taken back he was greeted with a universal no he instanced also the case of a female fugitive now in new bedford who hid herself in the hold of a vessel they smoked the vessel as was the custom aud the woman lay there in the hold almost suffocated hut she resolved to die rather than to come ibrth she had been be said a fugitive several times before and had been recaptured atone time to punish her her master took her out tied her up and stripping her to the waist laid on the lash until the warm blood dropped at her feet he then washed het back in brine and nailed her by the right ear to a fence rail and in her agony she tore off the outer rim of her ear he asked the audience if they would let the slavehunters carry that woman back a universal no was the re ply the speaker staled that his own family had been thrown into the greatest alarm by a telegraphic despatch that the alavehuniers were after him and although he said lie stood there a freeman in consequence of the payment of ssoin british gold a democratic slaveholder in st michaels maryland although this was known although he had a bill of sale of himself he felt he confessed some fear that there might be a flaw in the document and learning some of these southern gentry were about to make him a visit he resolved to meet them at home and as his house was rather small and the party probably rather large he went up to a trapdoor in the attic in order to receive one at a lime and tf they had made their appearance he should he said have endeavored to greet them with a hospitality befitting the klace and occasion and many of his neigh jrs had adopted the opinion that when men act as bloodhounds they should be received as such in conclusion he said that if the people ot the united states weie determined to carry this law into execution the colored people could not it they were at their mercy how can half a million poor and oppressed people a law backed up if it be backed up by of whites we therefore he said proclaim no united resistance to this law alter the fullest deliberation we one and all without the slightest hope ot making successful resist anceresolved rather to die than to goback if you are he said prepared to seethe streets of boston strewed with innocent blood if you are prepared to see sufferings such as no country ever witnessed just give in your adhesion to the fugitive slave hill you who live on the street where the blood first spouted forth in defence of freedom and the slaveholder will he here to bear the chained slave back or he will he murdered in our streets wendell phillips was loudly called for and appeared upon the platform he began by stating that the action of our city representative has thrown half a million of our people two thousand of whom inhabit boston completely atour mercy he wished lie said he could trust them to the public opinion of massachusetts letters had been received in this city by fugitive slaves slating that men are on liter way even to boston to pul thia law into effect lie could not talk of violence the colored men were at the mercy of the whites he expressed wish that public opinion was as powerful here to nullify ja law opposed to the general sentiment of the people as it was in south carolina hoped that some future historian whould have it to record that the panting fugitive when he set his toot in massachusetts could feel himself at rest we say he said that this law is utterly unconstitutional we are not hereor other issues we beg on our knees for the poor boon of the constitution this law allows a matt io arrest any one whom he may claim as his slave without appeal but aman thank god is primafacia a man north of mason and dixons line until proved otherwise he spoke of the impossibility of his proving his freedom before a southern jury where according to their laws his fnrndr and relatives cannot testify he spoke of a scene in cincinnati where six men armed with revolvers seized an alleged fugitive in the open street and asked who knew that he was a fugitive slave as was alleged in this law he said the bulwarks of liberty arc all broken and it is a base libel to call it a comutuiionai law we have he remarked one eliot in boston and he wished he could doubt that we had eleven more to make up a jury the path to the jury box lies through defiance of a law if he concealetfa slave he was liable to a fine of but a jury must try him the remedy therefore lies in defiance end a jury met least reached ina defiance of the law we must look to it said he therefor to place sufficient living men in the way of the slaveholder to make it ro the language of daniel webster extreme y inconvenient for him to reclaim his slave we trust he said trample the law under our feel there is no treason in that the law expects die obedience provides for disobedience and god ferbid that it should b disappointed he did not knew how it might be in button bat in the country the jew coaid be sustained by peaceful remittance he said we must interrupt the slaveholder and make it not worth bis while to attempt reelsiraaiions we must say that the man who has once touched the soil of massachusetts and breathed its air shall never goback this at least we can say the con stitulion we claim with its jury trials there are many fugitives who have been here fiom twelve to twenty years who have children and we are not he said going to people southern plantations with men born in massachusetts if we do bow down to the constitution he said dont let us bow a jot lowe than otis and adams did of old he dared not he said advise the coloied man but be knew what he should do if the nation should expel him from its laws and he advised them to do the same he advised them to disobey this law and if like the unjust judge they rule it constitutional contiuue to disobey it until you weary them out and they rule it unconstitutional mr jatms a briggs editor of a freesoil papenln cleveland ohio next addressee the meeting he said that we owed obedience to the law but not the law which assai is right if the fugitive were not safe here he said jet them dee to giddings district in detroit they now had a fugitive slave safe in jail and they may take him through michigan towards the south but they cant take him through ohio it cantbe done he gave an account of the escape of a female slave with her babe in her arms from the kentucky to the ohio shore across the dotting cakes of ice a crowd had assembled be said on liie cincinnati shorn hrouoht to gether by the sight and as the weman leaped from cake to cake and death seemed to stare hei in the face the shout went up courage woman courage when she reached the shore in safety she was grasped in the arms of a kentucky slaveholder who had witnessed the scene and who cried out in aloud voice she has won her liberty and she shall have it she was thea placed by him in a carriage and conveyed to a place of safety that slaveholder he said is now editor of a free soil paper in ohio theodore parker was the next speaker he gave some facts relative to the arrival and depaiture of fugitive slaves to and from boston within the last ten days ten or twenty liave gone from here to foreign lands and ivithin a few days fifty or sixty fugitive slaves have arrived here from other places jn the th of this month a person from the south writes that several police officers are jetting affidavits intending to come here and laim fugitives and the fugitive was advised n the letter to buy in his liberty of his maser instead of that he went to dock square md boughtsomething else this very norning a wife whose husband has fled to janada received a telegraphic despatch from ter husband asking if it was safe to come lack and the question he wanted to ask was will you let him come back and how many il defend him to the worst here a hand ote was taken at first a few appeared but rradually about two thirds of those in the lall hed up their hands mr parker gave his tribute ofpraise to he course of mr winthrqp in the senate in egard to this matter he also spoke in ermb of condemnation of the course of mr sliot he advised a recourse to peaceful iolence to protect the fugitive let not langerous weapons be resorted to but use hose which nature has provided to impede he progress of the slaveholder mr charles l remond colored the next peaker seemed to think that the resolutions lid net go far enough he would have resolu ions go out so far as the colored people are oncerned of a definite character to the  laveholder the fact he said that their tghts are taken away is sufficient to make hem rebel and if to avow this was treason le gloried in it they had resolved never o go from this state by any process conjured ip at the south but as a last resort would ell their lives as dearlo as possible mr wm b spooner a merchant of road street said that he wished he could inswer the question that had brought them lere can the fugitive remain here in safe y he would reply after mature delibera ton that he thought as a a body they could erhaps one or two might be carried off but iven for them like the slave hamlet their trice would be quickly raised and they vould again return to feedom for such an tbject he belive that even mr eliot would reely contribute in conclusion he advised hem to remain here quietly and they would rot ec ted mr douglass again addressed the meeting md related an anecdote of the president of he syracuse and utica railroad who upon teing applied to said that no fugitive slave hould be carried ironed over his road to the south and gave orders that if any ironed lave was put intp the cars to stop the train ake off his non and set him at liberty the rev mr colver was the last speaker ie thought the resolutions hardly went far mough he thought that an amendment night be added of something like the follow ng tenorresolved that constitution or io constitution law or no law we will not tllow a fugitive slave to betaken from massa husettts mr colver interspersed his speech tfith sundry humorous anecdotes he said hat an athletic traveller heard on his journey ries of distress proceeding from a cabin he mtered and found a man beating his wife irawing the man away from the woman lie infolded him in his strong embrace until histones cracked crying out how i love you rntil the poor husband was obliged to call tut for mercy now said the speaker if he slave hunter comes here and nobody else will love him in this manner will at the lose of his speech the meeting which was low reduced to about one half called out for he putting of the resolution and it having teen slated by word of mouth by mr colver o substance as stated above

the hall was filled at an early hour and organized by the appointment of hon a m collins as chairman and messrs hawley and bourne as secretaries prayer was offered by the rev dr robbins after which john hooker esq offered a series of resoiu tton setting forth the reason why the law is unconstitutional and odious and asserting that our citizens will not assist in the arrest of fugitives from

adversity is always most oppressive just before it haa reached the turning pout toward prosperity the fugitive slave law at a public meeting held on tuesday evening october h which filled minerva hall almuat to overflowing and which waa as spirited aa it waa large the following resolu tiona were passed unanimously and wiih the moat emphatic acclamation resolved that the circumstances which have made this convention necessary are such aa require in ua the solemnity and earaeatness becoming to a moat momentous occasion anda spirit of wisdom and prudence which god alone can give and that we apply ourselves to the business before us with the feeling that we have fallen on times in which principles must show themselves in practice and philanthropy in manful and perhaps selfdenying action resolved that we coasider the fugitive slavq law recently passed by congress unconstitutional in that it abrogates the rights of habeas corpus and trial by jury and prescribes a form of pincedure against the fugitive which overturns the moet essential principles of common and constitutional law and resolved that we consider this law immoral in that it forbids the exercise of hospitality to the innocent way fater and requires men to become hounds upon the track of the wronged and hunted fugitives therefore resolved that we regard this law as not binding and void and hold ourselves bound nor only not to obey but positively to disobey it resolved thai we are bound to disobey this iniquitous law lai by aiding the fugitive slave whenever opportunity offers d bv withholding the assistance which united states officers will oliim in summooinu tim posse cmnmuiuus tor me purpose or atrest ing the fugitive and d by impending by any means not inconsistent with morality the civil process by which the slavehunter will endeavor to secure his prey resolved that we warmly commiserate the condition of the thousands of fugitive slaves at the north and elsewhere to whose homes and hearts the recent law has carried terror and woe and that we promise that they shall receive from us until fines consume our means and prisons confine our bodies such shelter and aid as we would ask for ourselves were their circumstances ours resolved that we deeply sympathize with our truehearted friend and brother william l chaplin and pledge ourselves stand by him to the last by a devotion of our time energies and money to bail him from prison ind defend him before the tribunals of the land sixty dollars were raised for the benefit of chaplin and at a late hour the meeting ad ourned sine henry wright chairman henry e peck secretary we insert the above proceedings at the tpecial request of the respectable clergyman whose name is appended aa secretary but nasmuch as it ia not out custom to lend our tolumns for the purposes of those who eom ine to violate the jaws and to urge upon heir fellow citizens as a duty bloody resistance to the legal authority we deem it prop r to accompany their

farewell to government and civil societywhat is that rinciple simply this that any citizen las a right to disobey and resist the execution f any law which he may deem immoral or ontrary to the law of god now we run little risk in assuming that he rev henry e peck considers the law equiring the mails to be carried on sunday f that character is he therefore to get a re j olver and ahoot ail the post

we ail upon our brethren in other quarters of he confederacy to observe the constitution vhile we ourselves tread it under foot it may be that we shall incur odium by the itterance of such sentiments

adapted te secure to them and to their children their inherent and inalienable right to liberty resolved that that the man of the woman who under any pretext whatever shall refuse lo help slaves to escape from slavery as opportunity offers by secieting harboring and feeding them and by furnishing means to elude tbe slavehunter he or he should be regarded and treated as a kidnapper and as a traitor to god and humanity resolved that any man who aa judge commissioner marshal deputy marshal or assistant or who in uny way officially or unofficially shall aid in or abet the execution of tbe

tworfdimaia uii ai ihai any edict of rome in her worst days n n i mr adams was followed by frederick douglass who spoke nearly an hour he stated that his own family had been thrown into great consternation by two telegraphic dispatches received in one hour giving information that slsvehunters were in pursuit of him he was absent but hastened home not feeling quite safe though his freedom had been purchased with british gold and he had in his pocket a bill of sale of himself he related some cases of great suffering on the part of slaves escaping from bondage named their residence and condition and asked whether tho people ef massachusetts would suffer such persons to be taken from them and returned into slavery to every such question the immense congregation answered no no in almost deafening tones a letter from hon josiah quincy who was not able to be present was read by richard h dana esq it was a calm and thorough exposition of the new law and unqualified condemnation of it as unconstitutional md wicked and a decided expression of belief that it could not and would not be en orced in massachusetts after the reading of this letter resolutions vere read by mrr dana and followed by ad iresses from wendell phillips esq theo lore parker mr harris of ohio remond spooner c these speakers i wish dis incily to say exhibited great moderation and oolness considering the

law and the con j regationalitsat a meeting of the new fork evangelical association held at poughkeepsie october the following resolutions vere passed with reference to the recent furtive slave law resolved that we cannot recognize this i aw as of any binding force upon the citizens if our country ist because it is contrary to he express command of god deut  tthou shalt not deliver unto his master he servant which is escaped from his master into thee he shall dwell with thee even imong you in that which he shall choose in me of thy gates where it liketh him best hou shalt not oppress him d it is in op msition to the great law of christian benev ilence which requires us in all things to do into others as we would that others should lo unto us d it conflicts with the provis ons of our national constitution th it irostrates those two great safeguards of hunan liberty habeas corpus and trial by jury ith it is revolting to the spontaneous prompt ngs of humanity th it brings upon our na ion the reproach of injustice and inconsistency and impairs our influence upon the world or good th in short this law outrages very principle of human feeling of humanity ind religion and thus so far as the princi leis concerned it endangers the liberty of ivery man resolved that w hile we recognize the ob igation to obey the law of the hind we make in exception in the case of all such provisions is contravene the higher laws of god resolved that we advise all persons to ender every needful aid and comfort to fu jittve slaves just the same as it there were to law in the land forbidding it n y ivi nine fugitive slaves and hubeas corpus we understand mr jy to say at the neeting on friday that he had tried all the fudges of this city and had been unable to ob ain a writ of habeas corpus it is hoped that ie and other legal gentlemen will examine urther into the subjectthat no legal effort nay remain untried and if they cannot suc ieed that they will give the ground of objec ion on the part of the judges det trib we hope this matter will not be surred iver but put to the extremes test it has een alleged here by sound thinkers that the habeas corpus cannot be suspended in any instance and that a judge who refuses to grant t w rit of habeas corpus in such a case would render himself liable to impeachment the sooner this question is settled the better agitation will not cease while it is admitted the recourse to this great popular right cannot be had in the case of a fugitive arrested under the late law the detroit advertiser says that five hundred dollars have been raised and paid to the claimant of rose if so the chance of testing an important question ia probably lost a correspondent of the buffalo courier slates that the negro belonged to a brother of the hon r l rose of ootdlio county in this stalethe owner pocketed the money and departedwe have no doubt that slaveholders and their agents will be vere ready to take advantage of this

colored people do not know how to read but they knowhow to fight after the noise had subsided a little the speaker continued the white gentlemen uphold their respect by fighting duels and my friends if you want to carry your points and command respect you must fight overwhelming applause and exclamations of we will that we will mr downing then announced that he waa informed the wife of the fugitive slave had died that day of t broken heart at williamsburgh and proposed to raise a subscription for the purpose paying the funeral expenses he said it would be a shame to allow any other persons to do that honor than this meeting accordingly the hats and plates were handed around and was soon collected after the money was counted a person rose and wished to know if the sister of mrs hamlet was present if so let her comejforward as the fact was necessary to know if she was dead he said that a number of persons were present from williams burgh up to a late hour from that place and none had learned the fact of her death after many calls for the sister to come forward no one appeared and it was finally concluded that the statement was falsethat she was not dead but whether dead or alive said one of the speakers the money collected shall be appropriated for her benefit but we do not wish to collect money to bury a woman who is not dead laugh ter benjamin stanley a very dark com plexiooed man from north carolina said to be by several colored men present a distant relation of mr stanley the menber of congress addressed the meeting with a good deal of spirit said he go to your homes good wives and prepare them to receive your husbands and friends wuh bruised arms and broken heads tor his part he recommended them to arm the slaves with bowie knives and revolvers and arm yourselves like men and rescue yes that is the word you must do the work the poor fugitive slave you must recollect has not the courage of you men north nor of the men who have escaped from slavery for several years no gentlemen they are fearful and know not what to dothey are trembling in their boots in fear of their master conveying them back to bondage yet gentlemen shame to relate you suffer a man to be taken from your midstyes in a population of colored people to be seized at nosnday the manacles put upon him and he carried off by force back to chains and slavery i say again the fugitive slave is not safe here but if they do remain here you must protect them they have not the courage necessary to protect themselves you must do it and show that a population of twentyfive thousand colored people will not allow the fugitive to be conveyed back to bondage great cheer new york must be the battle ground we cannot battle at the south and therefore it must be done here applause if it

resolutions were fully discussed and earnestly adopted resolved that we regard the late fuffitive tv uatk age and a tyrannical government and that we acknowledge with mortification and shame this evidence that barbarism and oppression in our country have triumphed over the spirit of liberty and of progress that the provisions of this bill are in plain and flagrant violation of the constitution of the united states in the following particulars it suspends the action of the writ of habeas corpus ina case not warranted by the constitution it deprives a citizen of the right of trial by jury in a case transcending in importance every pecuniary consideration and it deprives persons of liberty in entire disregard of the course of proceedings which a due process of law would demand that a union which brings us under the law of slavery and enjoins upon us the loathsome work of slavecatch ing shall not be numbered among our precious things and that if our submission to such disgrace is to be the condition of its existence we cannot pay the price that we contemplate with mingled emotions of humiliation and disgust the action of a congress that could pass and of the president who could signa bill containing these iniquitous provisions and that we find in this disgraceful event a melancholy proof of the oftrepeated assertion that the slave power not only rules in the south but has poisoned our national legislation and made the national executive a catchpoll for the recovery of its victims that while we regard the command to hide the outcast and not to bewray the wanderer and not to deliver unto his master the servant that is escaped from his master as embodying principles sanctioned by the highest lawgiver and while we regard this law as forbidding what god commands and as commanding what god forbidswe will study to obey the law which transcends all human enactments appealing id the language of the apostle even to those who have decreed this unrighteous decree whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken to you more than unto god judge ye that we tender our thanks to the congress and president of the united states for having advertised the people of file north of the meanness of the work demanded of them and the miserable venality of the men who are to figure as the tools in this abhorrent business by offering the pitiful bribe of five dollars to the commissioner who will decide to consign a fellowbeing to slavery on the testimony of robbers and menstealers that the northern man who as judge commissoner or marshal orin any capacity shall consent to aid in the execution of this law has too little of the man about him to claim our pity or move our contempt that while by the provisions of this law the area of slavery is virtually extended over the whole country and the entire power of the general government arrayed on the ride of the claimant of slaves yet we hereby solemnly affirm that while our fugitive brother remains in our midst we will stand by him to the last to protect him by all justifiable means in our power that those northern men who voted for the socalied fugitive bill knowing as they must the feelings of their con itituents deserve the condemnation and execration of all good men and we believe their names will go down to posterity a hissing and a byword that j m root our fearless representative in congress and those who labored with him are worthy of our hearty thanks for the noble stand they have taken in the cause of liberty that we recommend the holding of mass xvleetings throughout the noith to express and embody the feeling of the people against this bill of abominations and that various measures be prosecuted immediately to secure its repeal and that we call on the conductors of the press the members of the bar and the ministers of the gospel to unite their efforts to annul this statute so at war with liberty law and religion that we see in this act fresh and convincing proof that the constitution of the united states must either be given up to the slaveholders or be interpreted as all laws should be interpreted and thus be rescued from slavery and made to subserve the great ends for which it declares itself to be framed that the above resolutions be published io the cleveland true democrat elyria c urier elyria argus oberlin evangelist ohio standard north star

resolved that we are whigs and that politically we are nothing else and that we ardently desire and will earnestly labor for the success of the whig nomination of our state and country resolved that we recognize in millard fillmore a whig ol approved fidelity that is truly national policy and wise moderation in a period of unexampled difficulty and perplexity have produced the happiest results and entitle him to the gr atitude of his country and that his administration is eminently deserving of support from the entire whig party of the union resolved that we deeply lament the apparent and as we trust temporary division of the whig party of this state caused by the extraordinary action of the majority in the syracuse convention in rejecting the excellenf and conciliatory resolutions reported by the regular committee on resolutions and the adoptions of others which censure by necessary implication alarge number of whig representatives who thought it their duty to vote for the settlement of the bundary controversy with texas as recommended by president fillmore in his message of the th of august last resolved that the inexorable requirement of the majority in the syracuse convention that the majority should render especial thanks to gov seward for acts in which he separated himself from all his whig associates in the senate which our judgment cannot approve and form no part of the whig creed or platform was tyrannical and directly calculated to destroy the harmony unity and efficiency of the party resolved that in our opinion it is the chief duty of the utica convention to counteract the mischievous consequences flowing from this conduct othe majority at syracuse by declaring to our brethren of this state and of other states the true whig ground on which we stand and have always stood and by taking measures to secure the election of the sate ticket without making ourselves or our candidates justly liable to the imputation of sectionalism abolitionism or any other destructive heresy sought to be fastened upon the party resolved that while we are disposed in good faith to carry out all the requirements of the constitution ns well when they do not accord with our interests and sympathies as when they do we nevertheless approve of the vote given by our immediate representative hon a m schermerhorn and the other whig members from this state in congress against the fugitive slave bill in asmuch as we deem its provisions harsh oppressive and at variance with the usual course of legal pioceedings in the free states gems of truth duty is not only pleasant but cheap every mans actions from a centre of influence upon others and every deed however trivial has some weight in determining the future destiny of the world the good fruits of human life are the produce of mingled smiles and tears asth fruits of the field require sunshine and rain as without clouds there can be no rain and without rain no fertility so without sorrow there can by no tears and without tears the heart jvould soon be barren a cloud upon the soul shrouds and darkens the earth more than a cloud in the armament the spectacle is in the spectator every deceased friend is a magnet that draws us into another world they who are independent in love are gen rerally so in everything else if weak in this respect they are generally weak in other respects how rarely do we accurately weigh what we have to sacrifice against what we have to gain one act of beneficence one act of real usefulness is worth all the abstract sentiment in the world it is happy enough that the same vices wich impair oness fortune frequently rum the constitution that the one may not survive the other british banner fugitives is canada the toronto globe of the isth says great numbers of escaped slaves still coutinue to pour into canada from all parts of the united states most of these refugees go towards the elgin colored association in the western district and are here we understand purchasing land from the rev mr king the president of the association asfast as he can sell it to them families are separating leaving their homes and dying in all directions to seek in canada under the british flag the protection denied them in tne free republic we would not feel called upon to remark upon the bill were it not likely to prove injurious to ourselves by driving immense numbers of slaves to settle among us but in flying from dancer it is quite natural that they should direct their course to the nearest place of safety and that place is canada
