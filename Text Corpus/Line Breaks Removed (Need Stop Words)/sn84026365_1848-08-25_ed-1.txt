flattering though my greatest fear arises from a knowledge of thy power delegated to ne so incompetent as myself to respond in behalf of said division to yur very kind and talented address delivered pn the occasion of the presentation of your splendid banner to the fraternity the scene indeed is an imposing one and such is the etnoj tion rilling each bosom at this time that i believe me if i tell you that our hearts with feelings of gratitude are so much overcome that language fails to dcj scribe the myriads of thanks that hound from the heart of each member of the association amid many discouraging suggestions that would naturally spring up in the mind on engaging in an eni terprise also great a cost as the one in which you have been engaged in compels us under the present circumstances in ecstacy to pronounce you in labor indefatigable in zeal untiring in not suffering the present work to remain in embryo indeed we believe this praiseworthy gift to be but a germ added to the fond anticipation of our future elevation it certainly will take ages to efface from memorys page this glowing glittering scene ave ask your indulgence a few moments whilst we disci se to you a few thoughts embodied together with other sentiments in reference to the worth and character of woman we love to muse on the bearing the impression and the influence your present effort will have not only on the present audience on whose elysian countenance we now gazenot only on the present fraternity on which you have been pleased to bestow your gift but on the community ai large working as an impetus in our onward march toj union and elevation a certain writer jin his rhapsody exclaims let cynics prattle as they may our existence here j without the presence of the other sex would be only a dark and cheerless void the light the smiles of woman are the b w of beauty and promise which spans th life of man from his cradle t toe grave another distinguished v f riter in the rich nnagi nation of his mind when reflecting on the character of woman in limpid strains of eloquence pouring from the golden vase formed by his rich irnagi tion sentiments thus written ilonorel be woman she beam on the graceful anj fair an a bitg of light scatter around her wherever he tray roses of bliss oer our h jrncovered ways in this rare production we see at once a desire evinced on the part of the writer to awaken man from his stupor of soulto arouse his languid spirit to action that man might be better qualified to appreciate the worth of woman there is no enterprise in which man engages but wh it the ladies when called on cheerfully assent to assist ifj it be of a benevolent or charitable nature hence we find the features of benevolence virtue and constancy prominently developed in the character of woman when poverty wraps her murky mani tie around uswhen sorrow with all its horror confronts uswhen friends shall have forsaken us and despair overtaken us hope having fled chaos with its sombre clouds surrounding us then see woman in all the shining loveliness of her character stretching forth her hand alleviating our wants and ndmiuisiering to our necessities ofo j woman s noble aud virtuous character tame has long since blown her trumpet yea the names of many illustrious females have for ages gilded with goljen ghtter the pages of history in conclusion ladies let me assure you tha your names shall ever be held dear and sacred in the memory of the fraternity hoping that we may in the future as apparent to all we have in the past merit by our action the present giftmay we

therefore exists for these fraternal organizations wherein the law of love and brotherly sympathy might be reviewed in all its practical importance l am aware that the reformist contends the christian system is in itself complete and sufficient for all effrts of benevolence i admit that the theory of the christian is complete but his practice tarries s far behind that humanity bleeds amid his theology the christians theory tells to do good and to communicate remember not in this state of religious contradiction no wonder that so many benevolent societies have been called into being the existence of which would have been entirely unnecessary had the practice of the religionist kept tone with his theory in view of this then i caqnot withhold my commendation from this and similar eff rts having for their benevolent object theameliorating the ills of suffering humanity for awe with the religionist who with the zeal of a paul coupled with the eloquence of an apollos lacks the practical sympathy of a good samaritan the col red american association commends itself further in the ultimate design of its being which is the con centiating its mjral intellectual and active powers

lawful just and righteous means and that the members thereof are not merely in iralists they humbly rely on the great author of nature for assistance it is often charged to the various benevolent societies which exist that they are the abodes of infidelity this charge as dishonest as it is uncharitable cannot be laid to the account of the united colored american association for it has a theologyand better it is practical its theology is a belief in the great author of nature to whom holding itself alike subordinate as accountable it avows the use of no other means but such as are lawful just and righteous its practice mutually assisting aiding and relieving each other having for its ultimatum elevation for such an association ladies and gentlemen i feel free to express my

we have fallen on thoughts general thoughts political thoughts social master and oppress individual thought vainly we wish to lay them aside they are around us in us everywhere the air we breathe brings them to us the echo of the entire world brings them back to us in vain we take refuge in the silence of the valleysin the most unfrequented paths of our woods in vain in our beautiful september nights we contemplate with envious looks that peaceful and starry heaven which attracts us and the harmonious and enduring order of that celestial army the remembrance of that moral world trembling under our feet the cares ol the present foresight of the future draw us to these heights we return from those dwellings of peace with a spirit charged with trouble a voice powerful and importunate a voice that descends from heaven as it rises irom earth tells us that this is not a time for repose for contemplation for platonic leizure but that ii we will not be less than man we must ascend into the arena of human nature to fight to suffer and if need be to die with it and for it you know i did not decline this combat i presented myself to france with the conviction of a duty to fulfil with the devotion of a son she did not wish for tne i did not abandon the struggle the struggle abandoned tne almost alone among the men who have not de nivd or resisted the restoration i have to accomplish this citizens and frenchmans duty braved the smile of pity from our monarchical machiavels the insult and menaces of a party whose polities pro naught but hatred and that style fibert derision of its public despotism of place one man saw in me only a weak spirit which did not understand neutrality in times of rivalry or the tact of idleness another only a too eager placemanwhq was playing off a skilful trick to share some shameful plunder with the victors others again only an absolutist in disguise coming to spread a net for liberty to trip it up in its road and to laugh afterwards with his accomplices at this great cataclysm of modern civilization ending in a coup d etat for the profit of some powerless ordontiance thus are men judged while they live aud breathe and have their being in that atmosphere of corruption and lies which is called the days of party i remained alone and silent but alone with an approving conscience with a justification in the present with a future that at least will not accuse me butal ne with you with so many young and sincere men with so many elevated and ratimal friends who have made their political thoughts a sanctuary where intrigue and passion may not penetrate who are seeking social truth in the light of divine truth who place the morals the duty the health andi progress of humanity above their schoj lastic theories and their family aifeci tions who have in their hearts something beyond their own names who comprehend humanity in all its epochs uuder all its forms even in all its transformations spirits marching apart from but before their generati ms like the column of fire before the army ol moses veritable thinking majority of this age who will leave perchance merely a luminous trace when all this desert

moral historical and philosophical considerations which would trace it out before me had i the power and talent to cooperate with you in your social labors cßarrta n when a man wishes to embrace in his views a wider horixon he mounts an eminence proportioned to the discovery be wishes to make thence he looks down and beholds so should a philosopher do let us mount these intellectual eminences whence the eye can contemplate the past command the present and catch a glimpse of the future let us strip ourselves in thought of our qualifications of age country epoch of our prejudices of our habits of nation and party let us leave at the foot of the mountain those vestments and those sandals of the day let us reduce ourselves to the nature ol pure intellect and then look forth that summit from which man may contemplate the route pnst and future of humanity is history that light which should illumine this double horizon for his eyes is moralitythat divine day which emanates from god himself and which can neither fail nor mislead so posted so lighted the heart righteous and the eye pure the philosopher may have the most complex social problem presented ttf him he will solve it he wifi solve it with a metaphysical precision all to some accidents to some ages of error in the duration of social phases of which providence reserves to itself the secret sublime prophet of reason he will indite the history of the future that problem avents have placed before us every heart sounds it in secret every understanding scrutinises it every mouth repeatswhere are we whither go we and wlhat to do chapter where are tee not quite at the end of time not quite at the supreme oata clism of human societies not even atone of those disgraceful epochs without hope without issue where humanity crouches in a long and vile corruption and is rotting in its own filth no history and the gospel in hand seeing the little way man has made and the immense route opened by human reason and the divine word to his perfection here below we feel that mankind scarce touch their age of reason on another side placing our hand on the heart of social man feeling that indefinable hope beat withinthat virile ardor and boldness that pith of force and desire which decays less than ever in our epoch listening to his hardy words his ventursome promisealarmed even at the superabundance of energy which makes him revolt at all rein which dashes him against every obsta clewe feel that the vital principle inhuman nature is far from being weakened man is young his social formis old and is falling into ruius immortal chrysalis he is laboriously issuing from his primitive covering to assume the manly gown the form of his maturity behold the truth we are atone of the strongest epochs the human race has to cross to advance towards the end of their divine destinyat an epoch of renovation and social transformation similar perhaps to the gospel era shall we get over it without per ihing without some geaerati ms being buried under the rubbish of a pass which breaks diwn without an age or two being lost in an atrocious and ster il contest thats the question before the th of july ldo it was solved the bndge was thrown across the abyss which separates the past from the future the restoration had received froui on high the loveliest and holiest mission that providence could assign to a

eye ol the patriot statesman nr lover of mankind than to see a people assembled in mighty convention for the maintenance of their own unalienable rights and when my reverttcd friend here made such beautiful allusion to that venerable statesman who has lately taken his departure from this to a brighter world lay heart involuntarily resp nded amen to the sentiment ba ezpressed i firmly believe that could that old man eloquent that mighty and irresistible champion ofhaman rights from early youth to extreme age have lived to see this day he would have said like him of old now lord let thy servant depart in peace since mine eyes have seen thy salvation fellow cit zens that venerable statesman and patriot first called my attention to the usurpations of that power which now threatens to engulf your liberties he hss tskea his departure from the scenes of political discord and strife and it has been left to another generation to maintain the rights which he labored during his whole life to establish in perpetuity for the enjoyment of yourselves and your offspring that beautiful allusion made in the prayer to which you listened this morning to the pilgrim fathers who were tempest tossed upon a wintry and storm ridden sea as they fled from political oppression at home and sought to establish this ever living principle of maos unalienable rights upon the shores of massachusetts reminded me that in that same yearyes fellow citizens in that same year that our pilgrim sires landed upon those inclement shores a dutch ship freighted with humanity made merchantable by the superior fraud and powers of piratical dealers in human flesh and blood landed upon our coast at jamestown in virginia yes the element of slavery and degradation was established in the same year that our pilgrim fathers established human liberty upon the wild new england shores and these antagonistic principles have been spreading and widening and pushing out and bearing fruit from that day to the present and while new eugland ha been with devotion to her country her god and to mankind endeavoring to extend hen principles of liberty southern states have beeneagcrly and tnctgs ically engaged in extending and perpetuating human degradation and slavery and that institution existed when it was first brought upon the southern shores of these states precisely as it is now sought to be established in california and new mexico it was established there by force of the physical and intellectual auperiority of the whites over the colored race in violation of heavens high decree the whiteman seized his fellow colored man and compelled him to submit to his will that state of degraded africans existed for years with no other law to sustain it than now exists in new mexico and california he who reads the history of our country ad especially that portion of it which relates to the introduction establishment and extension of the heav endefying institution of slavery will understand the deeplaid schemes of southern statesmen to establish slavery in new mexico by the entire absence of legislation upon the subject leave the slaveholder to convey his slaves there let him but once gain a foothold there and by force of superior intellii gence and power by the bowieknife the scourge the whip and the dread instruments of torture he will establish slavery there unless prevented by the law john c calhoun is too deep read a man he is too well vern d in all the infernal measures of fraud force and duj plicity by wnich slavery encircles its victims in its deadly folds and enlarges its borders and strengthens its powers to lie induced by any means whatever to give his support to any movement j that would in the least militate against his dirltng institution and tell you that the

ard men are everywhere anxiously inquiring what is truth and duty respecting it to throw light on this subject by public addresses seems now to bethe most urgent antislavery work and w ere our organs of speech what they once were we should not hesitate for a moment to throw our whole soul into this department of labor but the past weeks exienence admonishes us to be careful we feel sensibly the ill effects of our five addresses the past week and must not repeat the experiment again until our health is more fully restored we set out tosy a word about the meetings ard to pen a few w rds of ch

to observe the antislavery tone of the various northern political hresses at this time each seems determined tp make out a case of antislavery for its party pnd to prove its hostility to northern doughfsfreism the antislavery press was not more revere on the course of mr van buren towards the antislavery question than the casa anp taylor papers are now the only differed between hia present assailants and his rery reprovers relates to the motiveifie oue is dishonest and the other honest tlsa one stone him for a good deed and the otlr for an evil deed the reproaches heaped upon mr v an buren by the cass and taylor presses are like those which are lavished by a set of old profligate drunkards upon one of their number when he resolves to leave them and sign the washingtonian pledge these presses remind ns strongly of i greedy set of buzzards passing by all that is sound pure and good they prefer to feast themselves oo putrid meat even though they are compelled to disgorge it there is a commonsense mode of meeting such oppositionit is by adhering to what mr van buren is now understood to le if he ever was a northern man with southern principles he is evidently not so now and has not been during the last four yeais lie should not therefore be reproached for the past but commended for the present monthly illustrations of blarery w this valuable antislavery sheet published at newcasteupontyne england comes to us freighted with the enormities of the american slave system its evervigilant editor allows no fact illustrating the brutal character of american slavery to go unnoticed so far as space will permit and these facts are sent broadcast over the british empire and are published in ninetenths of all the british newspapers we observe among others in this months number an account of the brvital outrage committed some months since on the person of henry highland garnet whil on the buffalo and niagara railroad another refers to the conviction of stephen redden for having in his possession certain pictures of an antislavery character in the slate of maryland another refers to the infamous threat of assassination by senator foote against john p hale these with mm other facts of the same atrocious description have been going the rounds of the british press establishing just ideas of american civilixation freedom and christianity we commend to the british press the case of drayton sayres and english the noble sufferers now in the prison of the capital of the country fur no other crime alleged against them than tfiat they aided slaves to escape from a cruel bondage if a sense of shame has not departed witha sense of justice and humanity from the american people they cannot remain indifferent to these exposures england is too near to america and the intercourse is too rapid and frequent for americans to be wholly indifferent to british public opinion there h no american citizen not wholly j ost to all sense of decency and honor that does not blush for his country when he converses with intelligent englishmen on subject of slavery while there is ehanie there is hope we say therefore to tiur friend of the monthly illustrations continue to hoid up to public view in england ute grots dark and haggard crimes of american slavery for in this way though it may seeu severe you may be instrumental in greatiy aiding the of freedom

north star office ac since which as we were informed by dr sabin he has had a second edition printed in new york retaining date place ac these cirj culars printed in the form of a monthly periodical are well calculated to deceive giving a seeming permanency to the matter backed by the appareut countenance of the editors nd name of the nrth star this is another trick of mr foster we are satisfied

the last version below we give gen taylors last or letter of acceptance this letter bears date later than any other extant the contemplation ofa convention of independent freemen has extorted from him notwithstanding his oft repeated declaration to the contrary an acceptance of the whig nomination what will now become of the dear people upou whom gen taylor depended for the ratification of his nomination now the old soldier alone capable of standing at the helm of their national ship has left them we rather think he will find the people capable of rowing their own boat and thereby taking care of themselves freemen will not entrust their destiny in the hands of a tyrant slavemonger baton rouge july j  sirl had the honor to receive your communication of june announcing that j the whig

avers that he intends to support gen taylor but only ou the ground tost he will veto a bill passed by congress excluding slavery from free territory lie will doubtless see in the progress of the canvass how frail that support is and how unlikely gen taylor will be to court the viulance which senator foote of mississippi has threatened to those who laie resist the southern interest yat tonal era we much fesr that the hon senator like most politicians is grasping after political lavor if indeed he is opposed not only to the further extension of slave territory but to tlavcry as he has frequently openly avowed how can he conscientiously support general taylor a stubborn uncompromising slave bolder the secret lies in s contemplated cabinet or ministerial appointment wo recently found the following d eclat all on of seoator corwin prelanding to be the han upon which be rests his support of general taylor and i declare if anybody is concerned to know what is my opinion on the

engendered from habits and customs of domestic or social life and there is none more destructive in its nature than that of lacing its effects upon the constitution are in the highest degree alarming

exposed and shown to be utter inefficient to the end desired is one of those frauds which has especially received the countenance of the clergy and has been b them constantly thrust upon the public as a meant of at oneand the same time liberating the african in this country from the hands of the enslaver and the african in africa from the bondage of ignorance and idolatry an address upon this subject was delivered on friday last by the rev dr pinney before hie presbyterian synod then assembled in j this city this rev gentleman has been known to the public as a prominent colonizationist for many years he was sent out to liberia as a missionary at an early period of the enterprise and continued in that capacity for some timeprohablv till he was tired of it for on returning to this country he travelled about defaming the colony the climate everything connected with it showing very satisfactorily that the colonization scheme was a failure but presently a change came over him he was appointed governor w ith f course a rather satisfactory salary whether in consequence of his excellent management or from what other cause does not now appear but from thenceforth he sounded a different note and from that time to the present the reverend exgovernor has not ceased to crack up the coloiy as a verj j paradisethe peculiar care of heaven on whose behalf many extraordinary interpositions of providence have from time to time been enacted these few words of explanation will enable the reader if he should ever havo an opportunity of hearing dr pinney lumssll or hear him quoted as an authority to give his statements their due weightand no more the address delivered before the presbyterian synod was just such an one as was suited to the scheme and from the expressed j sentiments of the presbyterian clergy might very reasonably be expected to be sailed to the audience in the place of high toned humanity and those fearl ss enunciations ol right which the subject of slavery demands there was an ample amount of cant and sophistryif sophistry that might be called which had not even a shadow of plausibility glowing accounts of the various battles statements of zeal for the conversion of the heathen manifested by the colonists all i finked together by pious exclamations of wonder at the singular and glorious interpositions of providenee for the preservation of ahe colony formed the staple of the address wonderful providence truly that a body omen armed to the teeth and supplied with all the incans of civilized warfare should putto flight inohs of ignorant and undisciplined savagesl the reverend gentleman appears to be at present engaged in a tour on behalf of the colonization society possibly he holds some office in that society he spoke in the tone of an official and urged the claims of the society on the ground that their funds fad been all exhausted in the purchase of slaves whom they had sent ot were about to end to liberia the society he stated had sent over this year persons ot whom were slaves this he wuuld have the public believe is very benevolent and praiseworthy but is it so noit is ths very reverse nothing indeed eoidd furnish more conclusive evidence of the mischievous character of the scheme than this purchase of laves to transport free colored men from this lands land to a share of which they are entitled by all the claims of birth and settlement and cultivationio transport them without proving or attempting to prove against them the commission of any crime is suffi i cicntly atrociousfor it is idle to say that they go of their own free willevery one know what that means but when the society become slavetraders and go into th market with the avowed purpose of purchasing slave and sending them to their miserable colony the wickedness of their pro eeding i made abundantly apparent they are notthey cannot be ignorant of the fact that long xs haves are legal articles ol commerce in this country the only effect ol sueh purchase must be either the enhancement of ihe pnee of slaves or the increased upply of the market by the slavebreeder it is ss will be sufficiently plain to every ooe who gives tho subject a moment s

situated so distant from the active theatre of the antislavery movements i have felt that the effusions ot my pen would scarcely be felt among a list of contributors who are perhaps unequalled in any enterprise for the advancement of the great interests of the human family but as theie are circumstances and occasions that call into active being those thoughts and feelings w hich have become a corporate part of our moral nature and ought to regard any argument that apologizes for their introduction as being at war with the true spirit of liberty the dictates of conscience and the voice of god the circumstance that calls me into the field at this lime is as follows on friday evening last on our return from norristown after the close of the annual meeting of the eastern penn a s society our friends v w brow n and c l remond were by a previous invitation to address our people in the philadelphia institute lombard st the committee appointed to obtain a suitable building where a larger portion of our jreople could be accommodated have applied for some of the larger churches but they were refused the meeting in the institute was very eloquently addressed by the abovenamed speakers in connection with robert purvis esq and as the report of the committees and the position of the colored churches in relation to j the antislavery movements formed mure than an incidental portion of their remarks it would be useless for me to attempt to portray the effect on the audience the challenge to defend their position was accepted by the rev daniel scott of the baptist church who in my opinion only needed the weapons and a cause worthy his zeal to have given a vigorous resistance even if he had been slain in the encounter the revs gloucester already distinguished for his zealoufc opposition to the antislavery movement having loudly responded to a sentiment uttered by his friend scott was called to the speakers stand by c l remond and challenged to vindicate his position before the same tribunal which he had been arraigned this he refused to do but offered to meet messrs remond and brown on monday evening the ti inst in company with another tneud and pledged himself to prove that there is not a colored proslavery church in philadelphia the challenge was immediately accepted but to mr remond inquiry whe j ther they should have his church for the dis cushion he quickly responded no thus j duaed a scene of thrilling interest laying the foundation of a meeting for monday night which i trust will be rendered immortal i deeply regret that i cannot be present as a spectator as a matter of personal gratitica lion submit to the deprivation but if my poor personal services were required nothing should deter me i know that the cause of freedom can at all times be safely entrusted to the parental care of messrs remond and brown therefore i fed no concern for that side of the question my greatest solicitude is that mr gloucester and friend may come up to the work manfully that they may make at least a buena vista resistance so that if they should fall iu defence of the church by the keenedged swords of their invaders they may at least be awe to manifest their spirit of martyrdom by exhibiting in their sacred altars the blood scars and wounds they have received in defence of the myriads of devotees who worship at them the battle now having begun it ought tobe continued on until its termination uutii the ehutch shall be able to vindicate the purity of her motive iu regard to her position with ihe antislavery movement her freedom from the venom of

that it is a case proper toi he considered by the enlightened part of mankind let us consider how the matter in truths ands what is the consequence gentlemen who advocate the case which my honorable friend from georgia with so muen l ability sustains declare that we invade their j rightstiiat we deprive them of a partieipa i lion in the enjoyment of territories acquired i by the common exertions of all is tins true how deprived of what do we deprive j them why they sav that we dep ive them jof the privilege of carrying their slaves as slaves into the new territories well sir what is the amount of th it they say that in this wav we deprive them of the opportunity of going into this acquired territory with their property their propertywhat do they mean by that we certainly do not deprive them of the privilege of going into these newly acquired terriories with all that in the general estimate of human society in the geneialand common and universal understanding of mankind is esteem d pioperty not at all the truth is just this they baye in their own slates peculiar laws which create property in persons they have a system of local legislation on which sl tvery rests while everybody agrees that it is against natural law or at least against the common understanding which prevails as to what is natural law am not going into metaphysics for therein should encounter the hon member from south carolina and we should wander in the endl ss mazes lost until after the time for the adjournment of copgress the southern i states have peculiar laws ans by those laws there is property in slaves this is purely local the real meaning then of southern gentlemen in making the complaint is that they cannot go into the territories of the united states carrying with theiq their

aour or froat grape groin in the woods on his farm it com rnences near the root of a chestnut w iich is about fifteen feet in circumfer cnce runs twentyfive feet on thi ground to within about two feet of i cucumber something less in size than it neighbor chestnut thence it ascends preserving its distance about two feel i from the body of the cucumber aboui eighty feet and fastens upon a lirnb from which it spreads its branches ovei the top of the tree the vine measured twentyseven inches in circumference tweutyfivc feet from the root and pre i serves its size without apparent diminution up the st feet to where it is attachec to the limba question that very naturally suggests itself to the mind of the curious is how came this vine to elevate itsel at a perpendicular height of eighty feet before it attached itself to anything foi support bv what means was it sustained during that growth i venture one suggestionthat the ago of the vine is equal to that of the tree vhich cannot be less than a century or more mr fish the owner of the farm says that when he came there about thirty years ago it was nearly or quite its present size this fact seems to sustain the opinion that its age must be about the same as that of the tree il this is so it could have attached itself to the limb when near the earth and then grown with the growth and strengthened with the strength of the tree any

applying bibletruth in plain bible language before you are aware he will have you in a train ol tli night in referenceto the grow th and strength of slavery that will truly astonish you that vine and

asserting that it was to better the condition of poor benighted africa but when at length this wicked and heaven daring hypocritical mask was removed she rears her head imploringly and asks or rather demands that the north take her under its protection this the north has fui hfi lly done and southern slavery and northern servility have grown and fattened together so that it is difficult to ascertain sometimes which ha the ascendancy southern arrogance or northern bowdownism i am inclined to think however that there is little to choose in point of antiquity between them for the north is just as ready to render help to sustain slavery as the south is to demand it i will only add if you believe slavery to he a sin and at the same time entertain the notion that the best way to prevent sinning is to elevate the sinner to a position in which he can spread the contagion to a greater extent just call on friend stephen fish he and his excellent lady will entertain thee courteously and render efficient aid in opening thy eyes and unstopping thine ears and if thou hast rne drop ofthe milk of human kindness in thy bosom he w ill show thee that the way to abolish slavery is not to vote

hae since lain on the ground one of these bells is feet high feet in diameter and feet in circumference thickness of the metal at the edges inches its weight is computed at lbs this enormous bell is however small compared with the cast in the reign of the empress anne of russia which according to mr cox weighs ouo lbs its height is feet its circumference at the bottom yards inches and thickness inches the beam on which it was hung being burnt it fell and a large piece was broken out of it the weight of this enormous mass of metal is estimated to be worth a sum upwards of which lays

according to thomas reid a bell of  pounds was found in one of the vallies of the jura mountains in switzerland but how it came there seems to be unknown a bad room for hearing mr scott ruel has thus lucidly explained one of the causes of bad qualities in the construction of a room he shows that in a large square room of the usual form the reflection of the same sound is carried to the speakers ear by different paths and in different periods of time the result of which is the confusion ot successive sounds and syllables with each other and so a prolific cause of indistinct hearing it requires another principle to afford the remedy for these evils which mr russell believes to be quite new he calls it the principle of nonreflectiun and lateral accumulation of the sound wave it was originally suggested to him by the observation of a similar phe j nomenon in the wae of t e first order in waters this wave he considers tobe the type of the soundwave and on examination he finds experimental evidence of the same phenomenon in the latter wave he has observed that at angles below degrees the sound wave is no longer completely reflected from the surface on which it impinges and when the obliquity of the wave to j the surface is degrees a phenomenon of nonreflection and the wave continues merely to roll along the surface in a parallel direction to it this fact furnishes a ready means to remedy the evils so often produced by the reflections and echo and interference of i sound in public buildings wherever it is possible to place flat or curved surfaces at such angles that the direction of the sound shall be very oblique to the surface it may be harmlessly disposed of and prevented from injurious reflection this is exactly what the stalls ofa choir the side chapels of a cathedral and the partition of boxes in an opera house do so successfully for buildings of a large class the same principle enables mr russell to explain the whispering gallery of st pauls which is circular and another equally celebrated mentioned by saunders which is perfectly straight the same principle also explains the conveyance of sound along the smooth surface of alake and over the flat surface of a sandy desert aa well as extraordinary reverberation or accumulation of sound in some portions of a budding london magazine presidential statistics the following statistics will be
