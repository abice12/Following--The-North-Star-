more blackguardism the washington correspondent of the boston atlas has the following under date of dec i have been an eyewitness to much of the antislavery agitation here and what has been the result of it all agreat deal of excitement has prevailed many hard words have been exchanged and animosities engendered yet slavery exists this question as i said in one of my former letters is the most important with which public men have to do it is the one which should command the largest share of prudence judgment patriotism and common sense and it is about the only one nowadays which neither of these qualities are brought to bear upon the question has become a political party hobby north and south the leaders in it are fanatical narrowminded demagogues who care more tor their own places in congress than they do for all the slaves in the union prudent men hold back from communion with these men and hence although the subject forms a part almost daily of the doings in congress yet nothing is done in reality which looks to the good of the country and the gradual redemption othe land from slavery there is in my judgment a stupendous selfishness in ninetenths of the antislavery and proslavery movements which are made by the gid dingses the palfreys the calhouns the rhetts and others in congress the bill presented the other day by mr giddings to permit the slaves of this district to vote is a striking instance oi the fact now if he was really in earnest if he wished to carry a bill through congress to give the citizens of the district the privilege of expressing their views upon the subject a wise and honest man would have so framed it as to obtain at least the good will ol the house he would not have taken the most effectual means in his power to defeat his own measure but giddings object was clearly agitation he must exasperate the membersand make himself a friend of humanity again the proposition made by mr gott to instruct the committee on the district of columbia to report a bill to abolish the slave traffic in the district is another instance of follyto call it by no other name the resolution itself was a very proper one and one which every northern membei ought to have voted for but the resolution is not enough it must be prefaced with a preamble and half a dozen whereases speaking of slavery as an institution contrary to the principles ol natural justice c all of which was abstractly true and in a country debating society would have been very much in place but to thrust it in the faces ol men who are to vote upon it who are slaveholders themselves and who represent slaveholding constituencies is what no prudent or welldisposed person would have done well whal he ctrecl why it u conid ered by many of the members as personally insulting who had no objection to the resolution itself the preamble was of no more use than a fifth wheel to a coach yet in u was thrust and what for ido honestly believe that party end and private ambition lie at the bottom of a large share of these movements in washington and it is time that th lions skin should be torn from the assi body and let the long ears be seen believe that mr calhoun and his immediate worshippers art at heart in favoi the north star of a dissolution of the union i believe the seme of giddings and his followers when the union is dissolved we shall have king giddings ruling the northern dominions and king calhoun those of the south take both of these men out of congress and those who sympathize with their treasonable fanaticism and let the people north and south send men of plain sense of intelligence and of honest purpose to represent them in their place and l do really believe that more would be accomplished for the cause of freedom and emancipation in two years than ever will be under thejpresent state of things one of theqe schemes is to have allsorts of ultra antislavery propositions intrqfluced call the yeas ami nays and make northern whigs vote for them to sweeten the dose such men as john wentworth mr smart of maine and david wilmot of the locofoco partyto vote with them thus do they waste the time of congress and succeed in dividing the whigs of the north from the whigs of the south mr giddings mr root and mr palfrey love locofocoism better than they do gen taylor during the late canvass they charged him with being the most dangerous man that could be elected and they are afraid of their own predictions the locofocos proper of course will oppose his administration this game is deep and thus far has been well played but it is discovered and think you will see a movement on the part of the northern whigs which will very plainly inform mr giddings and his colaborers that they may vote for their own propositions now the great question before the country is in regard to extending the principles of the wilmot proviso overnew mexico and california it can be passed and would be prosed without very serious opposition the late canvass settled the point and southern whigs were not disposed to seriously dispute a measure like this would have been enough for one session and would have satisfied all reasonable men yet the chances are not so favorable today as they were three weeks ago and because the fanatical demagogues have come nearly every day with a number of sixpenny propositionswhich have had the effect to exasperate and madden the southern members i do believe that giddings co would glory more over the defeat of the wilmot proviso in the house than at any other thing that could happen union op the south it seems to us that it is high time for both parties in the south to present a united front of resistance to unjust aggressions upon their rights unless they do this and speedily they maybe left without any rights to protect but almost as much depends upon the matter of defending ourselves as upon the thing itself a threatening hectoring attitude hot words and lofty talk would be unjust to the calm and fixed purpose which pervades every southern soul to stand firm and shield the institutions and rights of the south from wrongs which are contemplated by men who are enemies not only of the south but of the union and of liberty itself and while we say this we also say to southern democratic presses which are invoking all parties to unite and in the same breath insinuating that gen taylor is unsound on southern subjects and charging that fillmore is an abolitionist you are taking strange steps to bring about your professed purpose the whigs of the south they who are even more interested than the democrats in the preservation of southern property can patiently brook no such taunts as that they have supported abolitionists for the highest offices of the government is a union tobe effected by such a mode of courtship southern whigs will not silently submit to wrongs either from their geographical or political enemies they are ready to bury the hatchet with the last if necessary to check the aggressions of the first but so far as the president who succeeds mr polk is concerned if democrats can confide in the present incumbent after his signature of the oregon billsouthern whiga may well repose the most undoubting trust in zachary taylor a southron ol the southrons a louisiana planter with two hundred slaves a man who was never false to himself to hia friends or t his country a citizen who has never uttered a syllable or performed an act inconsistent with perfect fidelity to the souththe land of hit ancestors of his home of his interests of his gloryof all in a word that can be near and dear to the human heart richmond repub cjp the following paragraph is from the official organ of the present democratic administration the washington union see what terrible things will happen if congress shall dareto abolish the slavery it has established in the district of columbia oh oh we deeply regret mr palfreys motion of yesterday to abolish slavery in the district of columbia it is anew torch of discord cast into the minds of the people we still more deeply regret that members should have been found in the house of representatives to favor its introduction why disturb the happiness of a great people by such illadvised and intemperate movements it can come to no sood it will excite the country and estroy the harmony of the confederacy if pushed to its ultimate consequences it will shake the union itself what benefit can it render to compensate for these calamities right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren here is another rabid specimen from the same paper another blowblow follows blow in rapid succession we scarcely know what to expect the abolitionists appear to run on with an appetite as keen as death to the gratification oi their favorite object the proceedings of congress during this sessionwith respect to the question of slavery have been of the most alarming and portentous character it was not enough that the house of rei presentatives without precedent without necessity and in contempt tor the rights of a large and patriotic portion of the union should have instructed the committee on the territories to report a bill excluding slavery from new mexico and california without precedent for we recollect no case whereunder similar circumstances the same step has been taken before without necessity because it was known that the same committee at the last session had reported a similar bill in the at sence of specific instruction and in all probability would do it again in contempt for the rights of the slaveholding states for without taking the high constitutional ground it cannot be right as a mere question of equality to exclude their citizens from ail participation in the benefits of a country acquired in a war to which they contributed so largely in men and means this we say and we might say more because without meaning any invidious comparison it is notorious that the slaveholding states furnished more than their ratio of men to say nothing about the moneyfor the mexican war it was not enough that a proposition should be made to take the sense not only of the free negroes and mulattoes of the district of columbia upon the question whether slavery should be abolished within it or not but of the slaves themselves also such was the character of the proposition as mr giddmgs himself declared upon interrogatory and that it should have come from a member of a state ohio which does not permit free negroes even to vote and be voted for by members but thursday the house of representatives by a vote of to instructed the committee for the district of columbia to introduce a bill abolishing the slave trade within that dis trict do the gentlemen who have voted for these resolutions really see and fully comprehend to what their action is leading do they suppose that the south has become so tame that they will not even turn when trodden upon do they suppose that they have lost the instinct of the mere reptile we are aware that much has occurred of late to induce northern and western mento suppose that those of the south are indifferent about these questions but they may rely upon it that such is not the case it is true the whig states of the south and some of the doubtful ones have lately voted for gen taylor and mr fillmore the former of whom occupied an equivocal position upon the subject of the wilmot proviso and the latter as we were sure sympathized with the abolitionists but it must be recollected that their friends represented them to be particularly reliable upon the subject of slavery and that they were voted for by a large portion of the south upon that ground let not the country deceive itself by these manifestations they are de ceptive we speak not as a southern man not as a virginian but godkiiows as an american an american proud of his glorious countryas a friend of the unionas a friend of politicalreedom throughout the world the sttccess of which depends upon our example and we conjure those who would sap and undermine itwe would implore those who would sow tares between brethren those who would disturb the feelings of mutual kindnessthose who would discard those feelings of mutual concession and compromise in which our blessed union originated and in which alone it can continue to exist to discountenance it to frown upon proceedings calculated to endanger it they may rely upon it the late proceedings of congress are of that description let not any one of our countrymen deceive themselves we say this not in anger in no spirit of intimidation but from a deep sense of the excitement which the resolution of yesterday will produce and the consequences it will carry with it the appeal is made to the south and to the north without regard to party it is a question that overleaps all parties and all cliques itis our country that calls upon us it ii an appeal to the love for the union itself in behalf of that spirit of compromise on which this great confederacy is built and by which it must be pre served movements at the south on the slatebt question the agitation at the sooth goes on with unabated vigor the slaveholder an determined that no effort shall be spared to prevent the exclusion of slavery from california and new mexico and to prevent the abolition of the accursed traffic in the souls and bodies of men in the district of columbia the rich mood enquirer a the d inst puhbsbes the proceedings of a public meeting of the people of king william county va on thn th ult professedly for the purpose of concerting mftwrtt in oppowtinn to what is called the late and alarming proceedings in congress on the subject of slavery the following resolutions were adopted resolved that it i the imperative duty of thn southern state to note any farther intnuonnco on the aspect of slavsry either w the staten nr tar rochester n y friday january  ritorie by the congrtm of the united states at all hazards and to the last extremity resolved that we invite the aid and assistance of oar fellowcitizens of virginia and the southern states on one combined resistance by every means which freemen have the right to as to the late proceedings io the house of representatives of the united states on the subject of negro slavery resolved that the president of this meeting do appoint a committee of safety for this county and such other citizens as the president may select whose duty it shall be to take such action as may from time to time becalled for by the course of events the richmond republican urging the virginia legislature to have the arsenal in that city converted into a military academy says such a change is of importance not only to the diffusion of education through the state but of that military knowledge and discipline which may be so essential to the south in a certain contingency we would recommend a similar policy to all odr sister states of the south south carolina has two prosperous military academies one at charleston and one at columbia let the south be prepared to defend her rights and they will never be as sailed virginia the following resolutions have been introduced into the virginia house of delegates bymr scott whig as a substitute for the ultra southern series presented by mr floyd resolved that the institution of slavery was fully discussed by the convention which formed the constitution of the united states and that the rights of the slaveholder were fully recognize by its provisions that without the compromises then solemnly entered into the union of the states could never have been formed resolved that whether congress possesses the constitutional power to prohibit or abridge the free immigration of a slaveholder with his slaves to a territory of the united states is a question on which men may and do honestly differ in opinion resolved that if congress does possess that power any exercise of it which would abridge the right of a slaveholder to immigrate with his slaves to a territory acquired by the common blood and treasure of the whole nation would be contrary to the spirit of conciliation and compromise under which the federal government was formed unjust to the slaveholding states and an abuse of the power which would interrupt if not destroy that harmony between the states so necessary to the healthful action of the federal government and the preservation of our glorious union resolved that the fundamental principles of our own and all free governments are that the people are capable of selfgovernment that all legitimate power resides in and emanates from the people that governments are instituted for the benefit of the governed and are their trustees and agents and consequently it would be unjust legislation and a tyrannical abuse of power to force domestic slavery upon an unwilling people in the case of california and new mexico it would aggravate the wounds inflicted by war and conquest and sow the seeds of disaffection and revolt resolved that the question of slavery in california and new mexico is merely transient in its nature and no matter how decided in congress can never produce any practical effect that those territories were free when acquired and so according to every reasonable probability must remain congness cannot legislate slavery into practical existence within their limits and it is matter of indifference so far as its existence there is concerned whether congress engraft into their forms of government what is known as the wilmot proviso the missouri compromise or the senates resolution resolved that the unity of government which constitutes us one people is now as dear to us as it ever has been it is justly so for it is a main pillar in the edifice of our real independence the support of our tranquility at home our peace abroad of our safety of our prosperity of that very liberty we so highly prize resolved that we prize the union of these states too highly to fly to arms and dissolve it upon a difference ef opinion on an abstract question of constitutional law resolved that the passage of a law by congress prohibiting the introduction of slaves into california and new mexico contrary to the wishes of the people in those territories would be a tyrannical abuse of power the passage of such a law under existing circumstances being wholly unnecessary even to accompli so far as those temto ries are concerned the wishes of the most ardent abolition would be a gratuitous outrage on southern feelings lid manifest a spir of hostility to the rithts of the sooth secured by the constitution but too well calculated to keep alive and increase the apprehension for the safety of those ngfits aheady unhappily excited and ufiunately alienate the attachment of the southern states to the federal government resolved that while we deprecate anna lor a mere abstract n we stand ready to resist all invamoa of our rights whether by the assumption ef power tyraaaoos use of graatoa powers resolved that w consider any m tetfbrenee of coagrsss withia tha die trid of coiaiobu of iu iolubitanu with ihe nkt of tbe slaveholder among which in thn right to hay and sell at variance with thn fundamental principle of free govern menu end a direct attack upon the institutions of the southern states the first net of meditated war upon the rights secured by the constitution which ought to be met at the threshold and restated at every hazard resolved that the governor of the commonwealth be requested to send a copy of these resolutions to each of the states of this union and also to our senators in congress and each of the members of the house of represent atives selections the pacheco case the following interesting history of the pacheco case and the recent close vote upon it in congress is from the new york tribune washington jan the debate on the claim of one antonio pacheco of florida or rather of his heirs since pacheco himself has died during the pendency of his claim was today closed by mr giddings of ohio in a speech of remarka force and which in spite of mr gs unpolished delivery rose at times to the region of eloquence the claim is based on a state of facts substantially as follows early in the progress of the florida war upon the seminoles major dade hired of pacheco at per month his slave lewis to guide through the country of the hostile savages the expedition which major d commanded lewis was a negro of remarkable abilities spoke four languages fluently and it would seem was a secret confederate and spy of the indians at the time when about half way to his destination the expedition was suddenly attacked by the indians and almost entirely demolished hardly a man escaping the negro was no more heard of until near the close of this war when he came in among a band of seminoles who surrendered finding longer resistance impossible he was now claimed by his old master but whether in accordance with the terms of capitulation or otherwise does not appear general jessup resisted the claim and decided that lewis must go west with the discomfited savages and so be did whereupon pacheco ctnsnmi payment for him by the government mr giddings opposition was based on the general grounds that the federal constitution does not recognize human beings as property that no slave was ever paid for by this government save in a single case through inadvertence that successive congresses on the reports of committees composed in part of slaveholders have rejected like claimsand that to pass this would besetting up a most mischievous and dangerous precedent he spoke with great fervor and plainness and his speech excited much sensasion i apprehend however that by placing this case on the broad ground of no property inman instead of the special facts intrinsically involved inlt his speech helped the bill when he bad concluded mr hilliard of ala obtained the floor andafter a few general remarks moved the previous question which was seconded the main question ordered the yeas and nays called and the house brought to a direct vote on the final passage of the bill the call proceeded in silence and it soon became apparent that the vote would be close every member present from the slave states voted aye with a number from the free states among whom i remarked mr rose of n yand mr ch butler of pa when the list had been called through and some time spent in figuring up the assistant clerk paused and figgeted and there was evidently a botheration of some sort a member rose who had not voted and asked to have his name called he voted aye whereupon another made the same demand and voted noso that it was as broad as it was long the clerk handed his tallylist to the speaker who announced the vote yeas nays presenting a case in which the speaker is expected to vote he commenced some remarks preliminary to voting manifesting considerable reluctance and trepidation but he was just beginning to intimate that he should vote no and defeat the bill by a tie when the clerk again called his attention and announced that the vote stood yeas nays so that the bill was passed and no occasion for the speakers vote whereupon ensued a motion for reconsideration by mr burt of s c and to that motion on the table and another for a call of the house hot the latter was voted down and the former on reflection withdrawn mr cocke of tenn renewed the motion to reconsider but thought again ane withdrew it end mr palfrey moved a call of the hooae which the speaker rgled oat of order nothing having been done since the last move for a call was rejected now cooes the best part of the story it seems on a careful foenitiay that the vote on the passage of ths pacheco bill actually stoodyeas nays a fir so that the speaker vote in the negative would hgre defeated the btfl this will cosw ap on a motion to correct the journal on monday tho speaker rahfl ths hih providing for a board oi c psuaiesioatrs to invletigete and settle private claims was father debated today and to be taken out of committee at i on monday i think a will pus bet that is not certain extract from i k giddihg reply to trvxiff smith in the month of april an outrage upon humanity of a more enormoui character transpired there than any which had ever taken place in the city of washington that head in human shape hope h slatter a notorious slavedealer in open davlight marched fiftytwo mothers and daughters hue bands wives sisters and brothers from the jail built with the money of our people to the railroad depot from wheooa they were taken to baltimore and there shipped to the new orleans slave market mothers were torn from their children husbands separated from wives children were seen taking the last agonizing look towards their parents while despair and unutterable horror marked each countenance in that mournful procession as they were driven from home and friends and all they held dear in life to premature deaths amid the sugar and cotton plantations of the south this was done under the laws of congress there was the speaker elected by the whig party there were the committees arranged and constituted by him for the purpose of upholding and continuing these heaveudaring crimes a majority of them were whigs they at that moment held in their possession the petitions of thousands of our people from the free states praying to be relieved from the guilt of sustaining this traffic in human beings yet scenes like this nor all the influence that philanthropy could bring to bear upon them could ieduce those whig committees to take one step towards relieving their constituents and mine from the damning stain of such infamy and yon now taunt me for refusing to vote for a speaker who has exerted his official power to uphold crimes like these you claim him to ba a whig and those committees to he whigs carrying out whig doctrines and whig practices by thus maintaining a commerce in men created in the image of our god if this be whig doctrines and whig practices then i say distinctly before heaven i am no whig i believe it would be no more offensive to god for our nation to make merchandize of you and me or of that whig speaker and those whig committees than it is to sustain a commerce in the bodies of those people who bylaws of congress are now daily sold in washington city my constituents would be as willing to see your children sold in market as those of other men they would be as willing to see your wife torn from your embrace and sold into degrading servitude and doomed tq premature death as they are to seethe wives of other men subjected to such lingering murder now sir can the name whig sanction such crimes with them they are a moral and religious people they lo not indulge the belief that they can justify such crimes before an omniscient judge by saying that they did it in order to uphold the whig party sir you mistake the character of my constituents entirely they are an enlightened people they understand the distinction between principle and party between measures and men they have ever been foremost in the support of whig doctrinesthe strongest whig district in the united states they have been such upon principle and they despise the power of party when it comes in conflict with the great moral and political truths on which our government is based no party candrive them acting upon the dictates of enlightened consciences guided by accurate knowledge of political matters they look with contempt upon the miserable artifices put forth by demagogues and designing politicians to mislead them they stand pledged to god and man to exert their utmost to separate the federal government and themselves from crimes like those which are now upheld by the whig committees of the house of representatives they well understand that no effectual movement in that body can be made in that body except through those committees unless two thirds of the house consent the slaveholders will not willingly cease their traffic and they vote against all efforts to stop the slave trade these committees therefore stand between humanity and the slave dealers sustaining and protecting them in carrying on a commerce in our fellowmen these committees were appointed for that purpose by a speaker elected by the whig party and you now attempt to anathematize me for not voting for aman who i was conscious was pledged to this very policy the bearing which your letter was designed to exert upon me or my poli ticalinfluence is of small importance hut so far as it is an attempt to establish and carry into exorcise tbs tyranny of party by proclaiming your bill of excommunication against me for daring to obey my conoeicnce and gods lawin preference to the biddings ot political party tf m worthy of serious reply indeed except for this consideration i should not have answered you sir think the day for wielding the lash of party has gone by forever it can effect little among intelligent and honest men they feel that each ie morally responsible for bis own political conduct mfn have leaned to think for theelves they know that gad has given them powers of thought end redaction for the purpose of being exercised they fod that by voting for men who uphold and sustain crimso they make themeelvaa partners in gain ton may regard the abvetrade now carried on in the district of ceiuadno a a matter of no importance hut th people of ohio look upon hdin no fcnw sf boinf wjmnjwm entod from the wlpg party could drive john dick pvsusasa whole no to lumiin for office any man who would exert his official power to uphold that disgrace of our net km and human nor could they knowingly be led to support the man who by the ties of interest of education and of association was pledged to establish slave markets upon soil now consecrated to freedom fear and believe that some have been beguiled into the support of such a man for president if so a just retribution awaits those who have misled and deceived them it is morally certain that southern whiffs who supported general taylor under the belief that he was favorable to the extension of slavery or northern whigs who sustained him under the cooviction that he was opposed to that national crime and disgrace have been deceived the president elect is in favor of that heav endefying iniquity or he is opposed toi it god himself cannot be on both sides of that question a few short months will determine whether the north or the south have been duped sir as a friend i would advise the supporters of general taylor who reside in the free states to be a little cautious in their manifestations of confidence in their political power if they shall exclude slavery from our newlyac quired territoryif they refuse admission to any more slave statesif they shall relieve the people of the free states and the federal government from the deep and damning guilt of maintaining a commerce in the bodies of men now carried on upon our southern coast and in the district of columbia and shall fully separate and purify the people of the free states from the contagion of slavery then sir our children will rise up and call them blessed but if they extend slavery if they admit more slave states to this unionif they continue the slave trade upon our southern coast and in the district of columbiaif they continue to legislate in favor of slavery in the states then retributive justice awaits them they will doubtless secure to themselves the loaves and fishes of office for the time being but the deep stain of their crime will be rendered more distinct by the increasing light now brought to bear upon the act of public men think not that the supporters of slavery can hide their public doings amid the obscurity of past years a new era has dawned upon our country the people of the free states are beginning to awake to the protection of their rights their concentrated scrutiny is directed to the votes and acts of our public men and those who now serve nder northern rights at the bidding of the slave power cannot escape merited retribution from the ohio bugle g the young abolitionists marlboro nor to the readers of the bugle dear friends before me is a work entitled the young abolitionists or conversations on slavery by j elizabeth jones it is just from the antislavery press of boston have read this little book with great profit and satisfaction the principles practices and spirit of american slavery are brought out in it clearly and distinctly and to the comprehension of the class of readers for whose benefit it was designed it was written for children and the child who begins to read it will not be likely to lay it aside till it is read through it is in the form of dialogue and the conversation in carried on with spirit and animation the author has contrived to impart instruction to children on the most radical and only true principles of antislavery i see not how any child can read that book or hear it read and not receive lasting benefit the writer has done a good work for antislavery she has struck a blow for freedom in the right place if the children of ohio could get at that book and read it and imbibe its spirit it would matter but little what constitutions or laws were made to uphold the system of fraud and violence slavery would be dead in the state and nothing could keep it alive one effort made with children tells more powerfully against slavery than ten made with adults children are bora abolitionists this work is designed to keep them so and to prevent them from imbibing the spirit of violence and op pressien that is so rife arouod them in this land of boasted liberty the facts and illustrations embodied in the young abolitionists are pertinent end forcible and peculiarly fitted to make adeep aod abiding impression on the hearts of children in favor of human liberty it would greatly benefit the righteous cause of antislavery and help to hasten the day of the slaves redemption if the abolitionists of this state and of

considered whereas it is the duty of the congress of the united slates to enact all laws necessary to enforce such provisions of the constitution as were intended to protect the citizens of the several slates in their rights of property and past experience has proved that laws should be passed by congress to enforce the d sec j of the th art of the constitution which requires that persons held to labor in one state escaping into another shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such labor may be due therefore resolved that the committee on the judiciary is hereby instructed

adverse report mr masou of va said that tlie great importance of this subject to the people and indeed to the whole country required that the report should be widely circulated he therefore moved that extra copies of the same be printed mr douglass spoke at lengih in reply to the arguments ot the report he contended that recent events would speedily supply sufficient population to justify the application of california for admission as a state and concluded by defending the bill against the objections of the committee the committee report makes three objections to the bill first that it is unprecedented second that it is uncotiiilituuoaa third that it is inexpedient to admit a territory as a stale before some previously organized government existed beside it would be unconstitutional to divide a stale after it had been once admitted when it became astate its division would be beyond the control of congress mr s downs said that lie was in a minority of one ou the commuter w ho

with the report that it was not constitutional nor expedient to admit california at the present time as a state hereupon the usual number of copies of the report for the one of the seam were ordered to be printed for tbe present tbe farther consideration of tbe subject was then poepooed newyork legislature naff slavery the legislature of newyoik says the evanglist among its first business passed a series of joint resolutions on the subject of slavery which defines the posit mm of the em pin state in this momentous issue in tbe nast satisfactory manner the resolutions met with some feeble opposition but scarcely enough to detract from their chaaacter unanimity it baa now become as unpopular to appear as tbe advocate or apologist ot bfavery as it wasa few years ago to express hostility to it times are changed indeed and now that the hateful institution in favor of which not one word of apology ever could be urged is on a downhill progress it will soon not hare a friend left tbe resolutions are as follow g whereas the people of mewxexico have petitioned congress for the establishment ofa territorial government which shall protect them against the institution of domestic slavery while they remain a territory of the united slates and have also petitioned cougress for protection against tho unfounded claims of the state of texas to a large portion of their territory lying east of the rio grande and whereas it would be unjust to the people of newmexieo ami revolting to the spirit ol the age to permit domestic slavery an institution from which they are now free to be introduced among them and whereas since the acquisition of newmexico and california by the united slates the people thereof have a right to the prelection of the general government and should lie secured in the full possession and enjoyment of the new territory therefore resolved if the assembly concur that our senators in congress be instructed and our representatives be requested to use their best efforts to procure the passage of laws for the establishment of governments for the territories acquired by the late treaty of peace with mexico and that hy such laws involuntary servitude except for crime be excluded front such territory resolved if the assembly concur that the territory lying between the nueces and the rio grande and that portion of new mexico lying east of the rio grande are the common property of the united states and that our senators and representatives in congress lie requested to use their bent efforts to preserve the same as such common property and protect it from the unfounded claims ot the state of texas and prohibit the extension over it of the laws of texas or the institution of domestic slavery resolved if the assembly concur that the existence of prisons for the confinement and marts for the tale of slaves at the seal of the national government is viewed by this legislature w ith deep regret and mortification that such prisons and marts ought forthwith to be abolished resolved if the assembly concur that our senators and representatives in congress be requested to use their strenuous efforts to procure the passage of a law that shall protect slaves from unjust imprisonment andi shall effectually put an end to the slavetrade in the district of colombia the north star rochester january a few words to our own people all people are ours and we are theirs members of a common family with a common destiny in the sight of the most high and bis immutable attributes we stand upon a common and equal footing with him there is neither jew nor gentile barbarian nor scythian he is no respecter of persons j and hatli made of one blood all nations for to j dwell upon all the face of the earth in what then some may ask consists the propriety of using a caption which implies upon the face of it a denial of this doctrine the question is a fair one and deserves an answer j without admitting that the caption in question necessarily carries upon its face the alleged implication we answer that by the i force of potent circumstances now in existence and which for ages have existed the colored people of this country are compelled to occupy a distinct and peculiar condition and that it is therefore right and proper to address them especially and specifically with respect to that condition and the rights duties and responsibilities which of necessity attach to that condition though in the broad sight of a righteous god we stand upon a common level of brotherhood with the rest of mankind and are naturally and aelfevidently entitled to all the rights privileges and immunities common to every member of that family we are nevertheless regarded and treated not only as distinct from but as inferior to all others in oar case vice and virtue are often treated with equal disfavor by our oppieasors and in some cases a premium is paid to vice and virtue is placed under the ban of malignant i proscription in many of the northern states jof the union a low idle vicious white stands higher in the social and political scale of society than the moat refined and virtuous i colored man can do in the states of ohio indiana and the whole south the word of any white villain will be taken to evidence against us a hile that of the most respectable and upright colored man would be rejected if in onr oura favor

out from the face of this nation this argument has been adduced by a distinguished free soil man as s reason for opposing tbe extension of slavery regarding ou extension as a desirable end and believing the extension of slavery to be unfavorable to this result inasmuch as by the inevitable laws of population it must increase in proportion to the augmentation sod decrease according to tbe decrease of tbe means of living yes we say that our enemies are gravely and boldly speculating upon the final extinction of the colored people of this country they say that both the indian and the african must perish beneath the car of the advancing civilization of america to this end we relieve the hon mr hannegan of indiana presented petitions the othet day in the senate of the united slates asking for grants of lands in new mexico to be colonized and settled by free colored people this we take tole another cunning scheme of our oppressors once get the free colored man confined in anyone territory or locality let us once be separated from ihe white people of this country and we shall become the mere game of american trappers and other adventurers and there is no recson to believe that our fate will be in any respect better than the noble seminole and other indians who have perished by the perfidy and rapacity of the proud anglo saxon race it is certain that there can beno good accomplished by emigration unless we go beyond the musket shot of white american adventurers there is nothing tq be gained by such emigration but almost certain extinction in a land like this and in the circumstances by which we are surrounded we have no better advice to give than this stick hy the shipstand to your post we can live where other men live and must die if we place ourselves where other men have died nothing seems more evident to us than that our destiny is sealed up with that of the white people ol this country and we believe that we must fall our flourish with them we must banish all thoughts of emigration from our minds and resolve to stay just where we arenot in towns and cities merely but among white people and avail ourselves of the civilization of america in the very centre of its existence and never think of trusting ourselves on its outer borders where it ceases to be civilization and becomes savage barbarism it is said that we cannot prosper in a cold climate there is no truth in the proposition we can become acclimated just where any other members ol the human family can be acclimated and can live as well and long as any others the idea that we cannot is a miserable pretence got up to afford a pretext for getting us oul ol this country we can live on the hanks ol the penobscot as on the sabine and do live there let us not therefore be gulled into the notion that this climate is unfavorable to our development and progress there are other modes of improving our condition at hand we need not look beyond the limits ol the northern stales for every facility which we need for our improvement and elevation education that grand lever for improvement is to a large degree within our reach trades are not entirely closed against us public opinion has at last granted to us the right ol speech we can now speak of our wrongs boldly and fearlessly we have had numerous concessions from high sources that weare capable of tbe very highest attainments we have three newspapers in the hands of our own people as well as a large number of churches and societies for moral and benevolent purposes are we to turn our backs upon these and wander away to become the game of american sportsmen we hope not and feel assured that we slrxll not notwithstanding all the effbite that may be made in high places to induce us to do so cdme friends and brethren

country by colored ladies to sustain a press under the sole management of persons of their own complexion we take it as an evidence that whatever others may think of the expediency of establishing such a paper as we have tried to make the north star the oppresaed themselves feel the value of it we have not yet received an official account of the receipts of this effort but have learned from one of its active members that it amounted to two hundred dollars over all expenses this considering the shortness of time during which the ladies had to prepare is a large sum aud reflects well upon the industry and perseverance of the ladies engaged in it we hope soon to have the usual appeal for assistance to the next fair with the names of the ladies attached to it to be published in the north

the motives of those with whom i originated it has been used by slaveholder for the most hateful purposes and has prove a formidable hindrance to the cause of abolition in the united states it is based on thi supposition that black and colored men ough not to be admitted to citizenship in the unite states that their proper home is africa am that it is patriotic in american citizens to sem them there it adopts however the languagi of philanthropy and religion in the prosecutioi of its objects and by that means manages t impose on many goodnatured people the estimation in which the beneficiaria of the society are held may be gathered fron the manner in which they are described bj some of its oldest and most distinguished supporters one of these says free black are a greater nuisance than even slaves themselves another describes them as a horde of miserable peoplethe objects of universal suspicion another declares them to be of all classes of our populatibn the most viciouscontaminated themselves they extend their vices to all around them another ah a large mass of human beings who hang as a vile excrescence upon society another says they are a curse and a contagion wherever they reside otheie say they are an anomalous race of beings the most depraved upon earth a mildew upon our fields a scourge to our backs anda stain upon our escutcheon notoriously ignorant degraded and miserable mentally diseased brokenspirited acted upon by no motives to honourable exertions scarcely reached in their debasement by the heavenly light to draw off this black blood as one expresses it is an object of this society but j the great motive for doing so becomes con spicuous in the course of its proceedings namely adeeprooted and unchristian prejudice against a people many of whom were living evidences of the wickedness of the white population and all of whom had been the victims of the most cruel oppression one proof of this prejudice or rather hatred we shall give from the fifteenth report of the society it says the managers consider it clear lint causes exist and are now operating to prevent their improvement and elevation to any considerable extent as s class in this country which are fixed not only beyond the control of the friends of humanity but of any human power christianity cannot do for them here what it will do for them in africa this is not the fault of the colored mao but an ordinance of providence and no more to be changed than the laws cf nature this lying blasphemy ever good man will repudiate with indignation we must not however permit our indignation to interfere with oar duty to the victims of a cruel and beanie prejudice and therefore whilst we continue to abhor the american colonization society and its doings we feel no indisposition to aid oar colored brethren in liberia on the contrary we would expre the hope that they may prosper and become the means of introducing the blewings of freedom civilisation and religion among many nations in africa we have no means of ascertaining the exact number of colored and black peiaoos who have been transported from the united slates u africa it has not however been large but we have great reason to fear that the monthly connected with their removal has been dreadful the privatum of the people immense and their ptogit slow we sincerely trust that the provisions mj scried in their laws against slavery and the slavetrade will be rigorously enforced and that their reblioos with the oaiive population will he honourable to themselves should that happily be the case they will not want friends to this country to sympathize with and help them but without expressing want of confidence in those who at present manage the afihtis of liberia we warn the that a sharp lookoat

base been much excited by a letter of mine published in tho liberator and oopied from that into your paper bate ro compunctions of conscience about the md letter and am prepared to reaffirm every word of it mr newman begins with sawing it reminds him of certain resolutions published in the oberlin evangelist of oct th over the signature of hamilton hill untruer and blacker than which no resolutions were ever cooeocted out of hades why my unoffending letter which certainly infringed upon no one should have reminded him of certain resolutions published in oberlin more than s year before am unable to see as there ia no apparent affinity between them my letter said nothing about mr newman it made no allusion to any resolutions concerning him either good or had andi cannot understand his straining and far fetching to introduce irrelcvai t matters unless it was to show his skill in making a magiam dash at one against whom he had some private antipathy hamilton hill is able to defend himself and will doubtlessly do so when an attack upon him has any claims to manliness he is a nobleminded englishman of sterling worth in whose honesty integrity and pli lanlhropy the people of oberlin and all true friends of oberlin have the fullest confidence as indicated by the responsible office of treasurer which he has held there for eight or nine years a truer friend of the oppressed is not to be found as in all fairness mr newman should have introduced the resolutions to which he alluded or said nothing about them it becomes my duty to make them known and also their source tbe emanated from the wesleyan methodist conference of canada in july sent them to hamilton hill and he made use of them as he thought proper here they are with a preamble just as they were passed by the conference and signed by the chairman and secretary at a contention of the third annual conference of the true wesleyan connexion of candda in the township of davn canada west on the th th th and st of july a letter was presented giving an account of some statements that had been made in a meeting at oberlin by william p newman respecting the rev hiram wilson at which meeting the said wm p neu man stated that the rev hiram wilson could not preach in any colored church in canada tliere being delegates from five diflerent circuits numbering seventeen a question was asked after the reading of the letter w hether any of these seventeen delegates knew of a disposition existing in any of the churches where they had travelled to close their doors against the rev hiram wilson or prohibition from preaching in any of their places of worship time being given for an answer every delegate stated without hesitation that no such feeling or spirit existed in their neighborhood ihe following resolutions were then offered and adopted withont a dissenting voice ist resolved that whereas wm p newman has reported in a meeting at oberlin in the united states that the rev hiram wilson is not allowed to preach in any of the colored churches in canada this conference deems it their duty to say that said report ii founded in falsehood d that this conference highly appreciate the labors of love of the rev hiram wilson both among and for the colored people of this province and earnestly hopes that his life may be spared that he may see the eon summation of his indefatigable efforts d resolved that the foregoing resolutions be entered among the proceedings of this conference and a copy of the same be signed by the chairman aud secretary and presented to our brother the rev hiram wilson josiah henson ch n isaac j henson secy these are the resolutions alluded to in mr newmans letter and notwithstanding his attempt to spurn them as falsehoods they arc the naked truth my own experience and consciousness bearing testimony and concurring with the statement of the conference then if truthful he stated publicly at obetlin that which was absolutely false if utrutfaful then the colored wesleyan conference in canada fabricated and voted a lie sol have no coo trove ray with mr newman on tbai point neither has hamilton hill it lies between him and the conference that mr newman stated publiely at oberlin what alleged against him and contradicted in the first resolution of the conference tbee can be no manner of doubt it came to me through two authentic channels one was hanoi

redemption of the enslaved people of america those who are even ordinary observers cannot fail to see rhem arising one after another like the first gliuunenugs of day on the eastern horizon ihe brightest the most glorious and the most hopeful ot them all is an incieasing love lor itat dear old principle of selfhelp this principle m invincible regard it either in a moral phical or intellectual light it is to an oppressed people what moses was to the hebrewswhat virgmius wa to rome and what toussamt loverture was to hu golden island of the ocean my heart leap with joy a i behold my longsuffering and imble people laying amde their old garments of dependence and enmr ing upon lheir own work god lielps those who help themselves and hence if true to this principle we shall have the uet help that the universe can afford if hod i t with us who of all the sons of men need we tear lt us trust in him and work manfully acting in loifoiimty with fhit prmu pte there ire some things tint must be dooe by the people of color and their friend throughout the country it is my purpose however merely to speak of the western portions of new york at this tone one important instrumentality we have now in operation and its existence should be an occasion for national rejoicing i allude to ani efficient and a wellsustained press through it we can speak to the nationthrough it i am now speaking i the gospel of christ is the only sure foundation of hope and elevation offered to any enslaved people there is nothing which tyrants fear so much as the spread of the gospel from beginning to end it is opposition to their ways when a tongue or an aqp is raised watched and strengthened by jehovah and his truth which is brought to light by his son there is no mortal power that can cause it to fall short of its destiny the saviour has said if ye continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free any people destitute of the preserving influences of practical christianity are wretched but what language could use fully to describe the forlorn hope of the colored race in america when in addition to our indescribable evils and political afflictions we turn away from the consolations of re ligion there are in the state of new york some sixty or seventy thousand people of color of this number theie are perhaps thirty thousand west of albany what are their religious principles there are not more than six thousand that meet together to worship god scattered in small numbers over the entire state they find it impossible to meet together and such is the cruelty of the whites in enforcing the laws of caste that itis neither desirable nor profitable for them to assemble in their churches thus we have some twentyfour thousands of people in western new vork without the full enjoyment of the christian privileges even in those places where the greatest numbers of the colored people are foundeven there their reious institutions are very limited and the consequences are that we behold our young people rushing on to ruin as if impelled by a phrensy too many buffer their ambition to lead them no where else than to the ballroom the tipplers retreat and the gamblers table for proof look to utica syracuse auburn geneva buffalo and especially rochester in all of these places there are many triumphant exceptions who stand up amid the wide ruin like evergeen trees in afire slash much of the blame attached to this state of things lies at the door of w hat is called the church and much rests upon our own heads this church that has torn us must help to heal she who has scattered must help to gather and both of these things we must do ourselves totally despair of my peoples redemption until we trust more in god and labor more in our own cause shall we make the attempt brethren one and all to raise the standard of the lord in the western parts of this great state i will propose my plan and hope that you friend douglass and others will give your opinions let a christian convention of the colored people and their friends be called at some central place let there be no caste or sectarianism encouraged in that meeting but let us come together in good earnest to do something forourafflicted fellowmen i further propose that a permanent state society shall be formed and agents or missionaries be employed to go forth into the hedges and highways and entreat these neglected ones to turn into the paths of rectitude and virtue i shall be glad lu correspond with any person to whom the subject is interesting h h garnet geneva jan pittsburg jan i redrick douglass lt gives me pleasure to acknow ledge that i have been a steady reader of the north star for one year and i look upon it as the guardian of our dearest rightsone of the great engines to effect the freedom of the slave and to break in pieces that unrighteous marblehearted and ironhanded prejudice of the north that is grinding us into the dust it is our incumbent duty to support the north star as a means of elevating our race allow me to say that its editorials are strong cogent and in very many instances eloquent your appeal to the friends of humanity and the public calling them to the support of your most laudable undertaking hope will not be lost upon them surely there is energy spirit patriotism and promptitude enough among the colored people to cause a loud response to the call with an unanimity of purpose not to be gainsaid or misunderstood let lnion be our motto our watchwordyes our rallying point our standard our lever and fulcrum for liberty equality and fraternity our friend and brother j b vashon albany jan frederick douglass things look somewhat encouraging the peaceable abolition of slavery is something svhich now may be sooner realized than was thought probable two years gone the indications throughout the free states warrant the belief lhat change in favor of antislavery has j laken plce within one year and while this state of feeling exists let us in this state doi all we can to gain our political rights you are aware of the fact that there is ani association funned for the pupoee of establishing a settlement of colored persons near the village of florence oneida county this association applied for the use of the assembly chamber for next monday eveuing to have mr ward lecture upon agriculture and other subjects connected with the interests of the colored people well the application caused qoite a discussion some were opposed to granting the use of the chamber to any class of citizens others thought the colored people were in this lnsunee merely urged on to see bow far they could push matters coming up as it did right in the wake of ilie antislavery

cause of the bloody scene which followed whatever may have been their intention the words were interpreted under the circumstances as an insult or taunt and the reply may almost be anticipated it was what do you mean by speaking to me sir in a stern tone of voice mr jenkins made some rejoinder which was not distinctly heard at the same time putting jiis hand under his vest as if with the intention of drawing a weapon mr crabb dropped a canc and seized the hands of mr jenkinsa struggle ensuedthe hands became partilly disengageda knife was drawnboth parties fell to the pavement mr crabb being uppermost while in this position mr jenkins stabbed mr crabb several limes in the back and neck all this was the work of a moment two gentlemen drs emanuel and bioadnax immdiately took hold of the parties and separated them mr jenkins stepped into a door within a few paces and mr crabb bleeding very profusely was solicited to enter the drug store one door above where mr jenkins had entered this lie positively refused and turning immediately walked withinsight of mr jenkins and deliberately presented a pistol which he had drawn from his pocket after he was stabbed and as the parties were pulled apart he lowered the weapon however without filing and turned away with the remark do not wish to kill himand will not kill him even now or words very nearly to tha effect after w alking a few paces he turned again and mr jenkins stepped out of the door where he was standing and came towards mr crabb with his knife in a striking position then mr crabb raised his pistol and firedmr jenkins still advanced more rapidly than before and inflicted another wound upon mr crabbs neck when dr broadnax not believing that the shot had taken effect caught mr jenkinss arm and besought him to strike no more at that moment he commenced sinking and the doctor caught him in his arms and in a few moments afterwards he expired these are the facts as related to us by the eyewitnesses of an occurrence which has shrouded our community in gloom murder in texas a few days since john a paxton killed john cronkrite at lagrange the circumstances says the victoria advocate are these cronkrite kept a hotel last winter ia lagrange and paxton who is a merchant and was one of his boarders became as it is said excessively fond of cronkrites wife in consequence of which cronkrite parted from her short time ago and went off his recent appearance at lagrange was to obtain revenge making threats against paxtons life it was under these circumstances paxton sought a private opportunity and shot him paxton gave himself up was taken into custody and discharged by the examining court a texan murder we take the following from the brownsville texas flsg of the th instant a murder was recently committed near

indefatigable walker his ordinary pace was such that those who were admitted to the honor of his society found it difficult to keep up witb him he rose early and generally passed three or four hours a day in the open air he might be seen before the dew was off the grass in st jamess park striding among the trees playing with his favorite spaniels and flinging corn to his ducks and these exhibitions endeared him to the common people who always love to see the great unbend at length towards the close of the year he was prevented by a slight attack of what was supposed tobe the gout from rambling as usual he now spent his mornings in his laboratory where he amused himself with experiments on the properties of mercury his temper seemed to have suffered from confinement he had no apparent cause for disquiet his kingdom was tranquil he was not in pres ing want o money his power was greater than it had ever been the party which had so long thwarted him had been beaten down but the cheerfulness which had supported him against adverse fortune had vanished in this season of prosperity  his palace had seldom presented a gayer or a more scandalous appearance than on the evening of feb ist some grave persons who had gone thither after the fashion of that ageto pay their duty to their sovereign and who had expected that on such aday his court would wear a decent aspect were struck with astonishment and horror the great gallery of whitehall an admirable relic of the magnificence of the tudors was crowded with revellers and gamblers the king sat there chatting and toying with three women whose charms were the boast and whose vices were the disgraces of three nations barbara palmer duchess of cleveland was there no longer young but still retaining some traces of that superb and voluptuous beauty which twenty years before overcame the hearts of all men there too was the duchess of portsmouth whose soft and infantine features were lighted up with the vivacity of france hortensia mancini duchess of mazarin and niece of the great cardinal completed the group she had been early removed from her native italy to the court where her uncle was supreme his power and her own attractions had drawn a crowd of illustrious suitors around her charles himself during his exile had sought her hand in vain no gift of nature o fortune seemed wanting to her her face was beautiful with the rich beauty of the south her understanding quick her manners graceful her rank exalted her possessions immense but her ungovernable passions had turned all these blessings into curses she had found the misery of an ill assorted marriage intolerable had fled from her husband had abandoned her vast wealth and after having astonished rome and piedmont by her adventures had fixed her abode in england her house was the favorite resort of men of wit and pleasure who for the sake of her smiles and her table endured her frequent fits of insolence and ill humor rochester and godolphin sometimes forgot the cares of state in her company barillon and saint ev remond found in her drawingroom consolation for their long banishment from paris the learning ofvossius the wit of waller were daily employed to flatter and amuse her but her diseased mind required stronger stimulants and sought them in gallantry in basset and in usquebaugh while charles flirted with his three sultanas hortensias french page a handsome boy whose vocal performaces were the delight of whitehall and were rewarded by numerous presents of rich clothes ponies and guineas warbled some amorous verses a party ol twenty courtiers were seated at cards round a large table on which gold was heaped in mountains even then the king had complained that he did not feel quite well he had no appetite for his supper his rest that night was broken but on the following morning he rose as usual early  scarcely had charles risen from his bed when his attendants perceived that his utterance was indistinct and that his thoughts seemed to be wandering several men of rank had as usual assembled to see their sovereign shaved and dressed he made an effort to converse with them in his usual gay stile but his ghastly looks surprised and alarmed them soon his face grew black his eyes turned in his j head he uttered a cry staggered and fell into the arms of thomas lord bruce eldest son of the earl of ailcs bury a physician who bad charge of the royal retorts and crucibles happened to be present he had no lancet but he opened a vein with a penknife the blood flowed freely but the king was still insensible he was laid on his bed where during a short time the duchess of portsmouth hung over him with the familiarity of a wife but the alarm had been given the queen and the duchess of vark were hastening to the room the favorite concubine was forced to retire to her own apartments those apartments had been thrice pulled down and thrice rebuilt by her lover to gratify her caprice tlie very furniture of the chimney was massy silver several fine paintings which properly belonged to the queen bad been transferred to the dwelling of the mistress the side bauds were piled with richly wrought plete id the niches stood cabinets the masterpieces of japanese art the queen was for a time assiduous in ber attendance the duke of york scarcely left his brothers bedside the primate and four other bishops were then in london they remained at whitehall all day and took it by turns to sit up all night in the kings room the news of his illness filled the capital with sorrow and dismay for his easy temper and affable manners had won the affection of a large part of the nation and those who most disliked him preferred his unprincipled levity to the stern and earnest bigotry of his brother on the morning of thursday the fifth of february the london gazette announced that his majesty was going on well and was thought by the physicians to be out of danger the bells of all the churches rang merrily and preparations for bonfires were made in the streets but in the evening it was known that a relapse had taken place and that the medical attendants had given up all hope the public mind was greatly disturbed but there was no disposition to tumultthe duke of york who had already taken on himself to give orders ascertained that the city was perfectly quiet and that he might without difficulty be proclaimed as soon ss his brother should expire the king was in great pain and complained that he felt as if a fire was burning within himyet he bore tip against his sufferings with a fortitude which did not seem to belong to his soft and luxurious nature the sight of his misery affected his wife so much that she fainted and was carried senseless to her chamber the prelates who were in waiting had from the first exhorted him to prepare for his end they now thought it their duty to address him in a still more urgent manner william sancroft archbishoy of canterbury an honest and pious though narrowminded man used great freedom it is time he said to speakout for sir you are about to appear before a judge who is no respecter of personsthe king answered not a word thomas kent bishop of bath and wells then tried his powers of persuasion he was a man of parts and learning of quick sensibility and stainless virtue his elaborate works have long been forgotten but his morning and evening hymns are still repeated daily in thousands of dwellings though like most of his order zealous for monarchy he was nosycophant before he became a bishop he had maintained the honor of his gown by refusing when the court was at winchester to let eleanor gwyn lodge in the house which he occupied there as a prebendary the king had sense enough to respect so manly a spirit of all the prelates he liked kent the best it lyas to no purpose however that the good bishop now put forth all his eloquence his solemn and pathetic exhortation awed and melted the bystanders to such a degree that some among them believed him to be filled with the same spirit which in the old time had by the mouths of nathan and elias called sinful princes to repentance charles however was unmoved he made no objection indeed when the service for the visitation of the sick was read in reply to the pressing questions of the divines he said that he was sorry for what he had done amiss and he suffered the absolution to be pronounced over him according to the forms of the church of england but when he was urged to declare that he died in the communion of that church he seemed not to hear wliat was said and nothing couhj induce him to take the eucharist from the hands of the bishops a table with bread and wine was brought to his bedside but in vain sometimes he said that there was no hurry and sometimes that he was too weak many attributed this apathy to contempt for divine things and many to the stupor which often precedes death but there were in the palace a few persons who knew better charles had never been a sincere member of the established church his mind had long oscillated between hobbism and popery when his health was good and his spirits high he was a scoffer in his few serious moments he was a roman catholic the duke of york was aware of this but was entirely occupied with the care of his own interests he had ordered the outports to be closed he had posted detachments of the guards in different parts of the city he had also procured the feeble signature of the dying king to an instrument by which some duties granted only till the demise of the crown were let to farm for a term of three years these things occupied the attention o james to such a degree that though on ordinary occasions he was indiscreetly and unseasonably eager to bring over proselytes to his church he never reflected that his brother was in danger of dying without the last sacraments this neglect was the more extraordinary because the duchess of york had at the request of the queen suggested on the morning on which the king was taken ill the propriety of procuring spiritual assistance for such assistance charles was at last indebted to an agency very different from that of his pious wife and sisterinlaw a lifeof frivolity and vice had not extinguished in the duchess of portsmouth all sentiments of religion or all that kindness which is the glory of her sex the french ambassador baril lon who had come to the palace to inquire after the king paid her a visit he found her in an agony of sorrow she took him into a secret room poured out her whole heart to him have ahe said a thing of great moment to tell you if it were known my bead would be in danger the kmc kreaiiy and truly a catholic but he will die without being reconciled to the church his bedchamber is full of protest ant clergymen i enter without giving scandal the duke is thinking only of himself speak to him remind him that there is a soul at rtake he is master now he can clear tbs room gothis instant or k will be too late berilkm hastened to the bedchamber took the dake amde and delivered the message of the mistress the conscience of junes smote kj h started u if roused from deep and declared that imhtif should prevent him from discharging the sacred which had been too lotf delayed several schemes were discussed and rejected at last the duke commanded the crowd to stand aloof went to the bed stooped down and wispered something which none of the spectators could hear hut which they supposed tobe some question about affairs of state charles answered in an audible voice yes yes with all my heart none of the bystanders except the french ambassador guessed that the king was declaring tif wish to be admitted into the bosom of the church of rome f shall i bring a priest said the
