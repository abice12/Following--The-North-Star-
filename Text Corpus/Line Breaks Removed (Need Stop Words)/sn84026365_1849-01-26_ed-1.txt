mr manning from the senate committee on federal relations reported the following preamble and resolutions as the legislative action of south carolina on the question oi the extension of slavery j whereas it appears to he the deibj erate purpose of a large portion of the people of the northern states of this union to attempt through congress the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia and to exclude the introduction of slaves into new mexico and california in the organization ol their territorial governments be it there fore resolved that we solemnly deny the power of congress under the federal compact to interfere directly or indirect v with the existence of slavery in the district of columbia or to prohibit its introduction into any territory acquired by treaty or by the joint arms of the separate sovereign and independent states of this confederacy or into any portion of this continent resolved that this general assembly cordially approves and adopts as its own the resolutions passed by the legislature of virginia in the year wherein it is asserted that under no circumstances will that body recognize any enactment of the federal government which has for its object the prohi fion of slavery in any territory acquired either by conquest or treaty ami that the passage of the vvilrnot proviso by congress makes it the duty of every slaveholding state and all citizens thereof as they value their dearest privileges their sovereigntiestheir independence their rights of property to take firm united and concerted action in this emergency resolved that upon the question of the wilmot proviso this general assembly entertains a determined feeling of opposition and resistance and that regarding it as a paramount issue in their federal relations they are disposed to forego all minor differences of opinion with other slaveholdmg slates in older to form a perfect union with them in opposition and resistance to legislation by congress at once intolerable and unconstitutional resolved that the governor of this state is hereby requested to forward a copy of these resolutions to the several lxeciitivcs of the slaveholding states to be laid before their respective legislatures and that they be invited to cooperate in such measures as may be deemed necessary to protect southern rights property and honor resolved that the governor ol this state be further requested to forward a copy of these resolutions to our senators and representatives at washington to be laid before both houses of ongress during the present session here is a rich thing from the chris twin index published at penfield ga only think of christ au h av excommunicating their fdbw christians for running away a symptom or reform n ahoii tiowwts the abolitionists ofhe city of new york recently had a great gathering for the purpose of geuinir up an excitement in favor of two colored girlswho had attempted to escape from their owner and had been retaken and sold to negrotraders they succeeded admirably and soon raised to purchase their freedom we hope this is a symptom of their iufen tiou to reform and abstain from stealing negroes ft futuie it is certainly much the north star more honest i m than to kteai them amt there is a much better prospect ol succeeding in eradicating slavery by buying slaves tree than by resort tc theft or violence we do not know a slaveholderin all our region who would not he verv willing to sell ont his slaves fr si per head or indeed for much les but there is one thing about this matter we do not fully understand itis tiat they will not buv any one who does not a disregard to the divine injunction given to servants to be subject to their own masters to the froward as well as to the gentle the two girls whose freedom they purchased we are told are members of the methodist episcopal church there is nota christian slave in any of our colored baptist churches of the swi who would not vote to excommunicate a member who should attempt to runaway from his or her master so much purer are the christian morals ol southern siavis than are the morals of fanatical freemen at the north however as abolitionists st emtohave commenced the reform we hope they will go on and yet evince that they esteem the obedient more than they do the disobedient and turbulent by giving a still higher price for the former class they may thus perhaps elevate themselves finally to the high moral stand at present occupied by christian slaves hi the south elections from tlie cleveland ilniinloaler slaverv in the district of columbia jt is time that the people of the northwest without distinction of party were aroused to the importance of abolishing slavery in the district of columbia itis a disgrace to the nation that the representatives from our free states should he sent year alter year as they have for more than half a century to legislate on slave soil is it not enough that the south should have the executive control of the government fiftytwo out of sixtyfour years a majority of the cabinet ministers and fourfifths of the government patronage during that time without asking the additional advantage of compelling our nations capital to remain on slavery soil and surrourgling i our representatives from the free states with slavery influences yej freemen of the north go to washington as we have done and spend but a single winter yea hut a single month and you will see the policy and the absolute necessity of abolishing slavery there or removing the capital into free soil first consider that two distinct races of men constitute the voters and politicians of this republic made distinct j not by birth but by a still stronger influence habit in the southern pori tion of this republic voters do notwork slaves do the work their masters the voting the brains of the whole southern population is in the heads of some slaveholders who do all the thinking writing reading and voting of the whole population they are the natural horn gentlemen of the land know nothing about manual labor having been reared among the slaves and taught trotn their infancy to treat it as the legitimate employment ofa degraded race their children are educated in the same way and thus southern society is formed here is an aristocracy of wealth bound together by tiic strongest ties of pride and selfishness and which when anything political touches hut a bristle of their interests the whole stye is in an uproar from their numbers are selected the most wealthy talented and intelligent to represent them in congress they go to washington not as our northern men here do taken from the plow the anvil and the workshops where they jiave been accustomed to earn their bread by the sweat of their brows and who to carry out the economy forced upon them by a life of toil and industry take cheap conveyance a change oi linen and put up at some cheap board iug house but they go with their whole family equipage wives daughters and sons horses carriages and servants ini livery grooms drivers waitingmaids and body servants u whole retinue of slaves they throng washington tliey engage the best houses pay the highest prices make the largest parties and of course are the bon lon of society in the district they not only command the service of the menials but the attention of all the tradesmen boardinghouse widows hotelkeepers and in fact dictate public opinion throughout the citys precincts at parties halls and public tables they make no reserve in the expression of their opinions on that subject which is uppermost because most important with them we mean slavery ave how they do ridicule and abominate abolitionists and that ou all occasions without caring to know who are present to sufler from their scoffs and ribaldry we were astonished to find this slavery sentiment pervading every nook and corner of w ashington the very air seemed impregnated with its pestiferous breath no one dared resist it the lucquey about the house the cockney in the streets the soup hi the oyster cellar the gambler at bis billiards the boardingschool miss the clerks in all the departments the stranger within the gales all seemed to fall in with the prevailing current now place a northern representative from the backwoods of maine or some wild region of the w cst for the fir lime in such society he has got to mess visit and drink with these same gentry to the manor boro for he is among the list of honorable and right is of no sextruth is of no color god is the father of us all and all we are brethren pritmu fuiit all congressmen are genl tlemen he will find perhaps as sooi as his residence is known some halfa dozen billetdoux upon his table invit i ing him to as many private balls ot social parties to all of which hi must go or send his regrets he ii astonished at the attention paid him and by the very ones he is pledged t hatethe southern aristocrats none can calculate who has not been it j washington not even the victim themselves the extent of this southerr influence upon our northern members it is true that outside the capital am throughout the district ol columbia the south have it all their own way lt is their own soil they feel a home public opinion is af their nod man u social being he cannoi disconnect himself with the local feelings around him he is inclined fron his very nature more or less to the wishes ol those with whom he associates especially if such wishes art accompanied with acts of civility anc kindness now imagine such a representative as we have described living from three to six months in such society and breathing such an atmosphere trying to discharge his duties satisfactorily to his constituents and to his new associates he is called upon for instance to vote to abolish slavery in the district of columbia this is bearding the lion in his very den such a question could not rise in congress and come to a vote without all those social appliances which southern members and citizens of the district know sowell how to use being first brought to hear upon every approachable northern member the man who resists them all braves the public opinion oi the metropolis and votes himself an outcast from washington society as he surely does who votes against slavery and is a man of no ordinary nerve we have seen this influence work we have w itnessed its power the country has felt its degradation as matters are now controlled at washington with the president principal heads of the departments with their retinue of clerks dependants and official patronage the official organ of the administration all in the slavery interest it is safe to estimate that all these combined with the personal influence of southern members citizens of the district and more than all the slave soil under their feet produce an effect upon the legislation of this country equal to seventyfive congressional votes so much power do the south derive from the location of the capital upon their own slave lt is a consideration well worthy freemen of the north whether after allowing the south twentyfive members as a slave property representation which they are entitled to under the constitution five slaves counted as three white men they shall be allowed this additional power derived not from property nor population hut simply from compelling the north to go into a slave country to make laws for a free people the power of congress to abolish slavery in the district is not a question for dispute it is not left like other territory of the government but the express power is given in the constitution in these words congress shall exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over said district c it is only a matter of expediency thena question of duty now with the lawmaking power whether slavery shall he abolished in the district or not so long as our southern friends were willing to let our frbe representatives discharge their duties unbiased by the local slavery influences ol the district so long has the north been willing to allow them the national capital within their borders we have even allowed this spot which more than any other on earth ought to he sacred to freedom to he desecrated by the buying and selling of human beings and the ears of northern freemen made familiar with the clank and chains of those in bonds iie same stars and stripes that wave over the capital as indications of our national liberty also wave over the slav pens in the district on any extraordinary occasion under one the white man glories in his freedom under the other the black man groans in his fetters foreigners foreign ministers and ambassadors visit the capital of this boasted land of freedom and see men women and children of all ages and hues bound hand and hand driven two and two through the open streets and in broad daylight down to a southern mart and into a hopeless servitude before the eyes of all the world whata deep disgrace is this and what a damning commentary upon the professions of the model republic now for writing this article for uttering such rientimeuts as these we know the hotspurs of the south will not thank us fhey owe us uo good will for bringing the attention of the people to these matters tar and feathers no doubt await us should we dare visit those regions which are said to be in ten decrees of more indulgent climes but we must tell them frankly what we want whqf the workies the laboring millions of the free states demand and what is due to our national character and to freedom it is this no extension of slavery beyond its present limits no compromise with slavery within its present limits any further than is guarantied by the constitution slavery in the district of columbia tobe abolished or the capital removed now gentlemen of the south makeup your minds to this and submit to it with the best grace you can it is fixed rosolved npou and by a power capable of effecting it the people have willed it and it must be dot rochester n y friday january hui we claim no right to interfere legis i latively with slavery within any ol the states and have never arrogated any we claim no right morally tc stir the question in such a way as to expose the lives of our felloweitizena i travelling south to the tortures ol lynch law we deeply deplore any i intemperate movement on this moment ious subject in view of the dreadful i wrecks so much threatened by our southern neighbors which the meeting tides of northern and southern fanaticism may spread around their borders but while we entertain these senti mejnts we know ho reason that renders it incumbent on us to conceal how fare it views are opposed to fojfering slavery under our glorious constitution at the expense of freedom the impression made upon m boyhood by that profound exclamation of cato that a day ai litnii ol virtuous lilirity i worth a whole eternity of bondage lias been worn deeper and deeper in i the progress of years arid we yearn more now than ever with strong dpsire for the day when freedom shall no longer wave her fustian flag in mockery over slaves crreoiiileiice of the tribune moke pacheco washington friday jan nearly the whole day was spent oni mr sawyers motion to reconsider the vote by which the house had rejected the bill for the relief of the heirs of antonia pacheco owner of the slave lewis the debate was opened by i mr sawyer in a speech from which i only gathered that he still meant to vote against the claim mr turner fill who had not voted till now next madea dubious speech whence l also gathered that he too would vote against the claim he made some good points mr palfrey of mass next obtained the floor and amid frequent interruptions made a very strong speech against the bill he argued that apart from the position that the federal constitution regarded slaves as persons and not as property it was not fully proved that gen jessup sent this negro out ol florida with the seminoles and even if he did lewis was still the rightful slave of pacheco it was an act done without due authority of law and for which the united states was not responsible a military commander has no authority under our constitution to banish men from the country on the ground that they are dangerous seditious persons and if any one has done so he is personally responsible to whoever has suffered fiy the wmrrg let the pachecos sue gen jessup and recover the value of their lost slave if they have any right of recoveryand let gen jessup petition us for indemnity pleading that the public good required him to act as he did and the claim will be rightfully before us mr palfrey was continually interrupted by questions from opponents but they did not make their expenses mr morse of la got the floorand spoke warmly in support of the claim i did not think he made much headway but that may be the result of prejudice on my part saturday jan all day longthe dreary fourth day of this discussionlias been spent on the pacheco slave case two days it took us to reach a decisive vote on the questionpart of another day to determine w hether we had passed or rejected the billand now we have spent two more days on mr sawyers motion to reconsider and this is not a northern but a southern agitation of the slave question in congress the debate today was opened by judge collamer of vt in a speech of great clearness and cogency he fairly demolished any remaining vestige of pretence that the united states as hirer or bailee of the slave lewis w r ere legally hound to restore him to his former owner he was hired at the legal risk of the ownerthe united states were only hound louse proper care and caution with the person or thing hired and there is no pretence opany failure in such case the slave was therefore lost or escaped when employed at the risk of his owner who must catch him if he wants him but the same negro came in under a capitulation and gen jessup ordered him to be sent west with the indians now he either was entitled to go west with the indians under the terms of the surrender or if he were still the property of pacheco his exile was an arbitrary act for which jessup and not the united states was responsible he said the books were full of cases where claims for damage to or forcible conversior of the property ot individuals to public use by military oflicers had been legally enforced against such officers notwithstanding the plea of public necessity mr r k meade of va next got the floor and made a most inflammatory speech in favor ol southern wrongs and all that full of vague threats that the union would not last long unless the north stayed its hand and cottoned more to the peculiar institution ho was proceeding to denounce mr gotta resolution and the vote adopting it in the most unsparing terras when mr toombs of georgia called to order he could not consent to this disorderly discussion ot a question not before the house ine question now was about pacheco aud his negro the speaker decided the objection well taken bat in rather a lower key he said if the rights of slaveholders to their slaves as property were not respected and maintained by this government then he would not give t snp f r too mr toombs of georgia obtain the floor after mr hat and the bou being quite latei yielded to a motioi for adjournment which was strongl resisted but just carried so closer i another day of pacheco a motion t adjourn before mr halls speech wa defeated largely by a vote of the yea and nays and this last would have beei also had the previous question beet ordered so as to bring the house to direct vote but there were thirty jumping for the floor and it could no ibe made certain that one of thos wanting to move the previous questioi would get it afler mr toombs h concluded so the adjournment wa carried this waste of time would be less deplorable if a great principle would b settled by the vote such is not tini tact the late arguments have si qualified and whittled it down tha whenever we shall reach the question nothing will be settled but whether pa i checo shall get pay for his negroper haps not even that the question iiom goes over to next friday first privai bill day jotts resolution what further is to become of the resolution may be learned by the fol j lowing letter which we ropy from then y evening post washington jan jl the tactics of the slaveholders have again most signally prevailed the southern caucus has done its work even though its formal proceedings have just begun the whig leaders amit their followers have equally bowed their necks and an early example has been made of the manner in which congress and the legislation of the conntry can he controlled without the use of the veto i described to you yesterday very briefly how the majority of the house retreated from the position it assumed of continuing the slavetrade in this district the full extent of their retrograde march was not apparent until this morning when mr wentworth expressed his curiosity as to what was to be done with ail the amendments and substitutes pending to and for mr gotts resolution for the abolition of the most infamous form of the slavetrade existing in the united states the speaker civilly informed mr wentworth that the resolution and all its belongings had gone into that abyss which knows no bottom the budget of unfinished business he said that the resolution and the previous question upon it having been reconsidered it uailjeefc it of a privileged question and could only be taken up again in its order as it stood upon the calendar of course mr c b smith of indiana and their colaborers were well aware of this result when they pressed with such zeal and energy the motion to reconsider as to both these gentlemen but particularly the former they have well earned a place in gen taylors cabinet or a foreign mission or any other snug and comfortable office which they may demand each for himself or for his relations or friends mr caleb b smith misrepresents a constituency as decidedly in favor of free soil sentiments as any in the union among them are a very large body of quakers who hold their yearly meetings at richmond the principal town in his district gen taylor was held out to them as the free soil candidate taylor and free soil was the watchword of the party in that part of the state and indeed throughout the state ill these good friends take calebs case underdealing at their next ineetiug probably but what will caleb care he will ere then have been called to his reward and perhaps his only answer to their sentence of condemnation will bethe removal of tfce local postmaster from whose office it shall he sent to him in imitation of the illustrious example of polk and cave johnson the berth of postmaster general must be considered appropriated from yesterday fols that were gulled by the cry that taylor could do no harm so long as we had a good whig congress will perhaps now begin to open their eyes the boston republican says the contemptible tricksters who at first voted for gotts resolution and then refused to clinch it by voting against the motion to lay mr stuarts motion on the table and who finally shuffled dodged or actually backed out of the position they had takenthese contemptible doughfaces have done their work their first votes have gone hometo be crowed over by the partizan newspapers in their own districts while the process by which they ignobly betrayed the north at the bidding of the southern friends of taylor will not be heard of the springfield republican the plymouth memorial and the new bedford mercury will shed a few natural tears for the comfort of a bamboozled constituency but they will never let the people know that three taylor representatives from massachusetts have actually voted against the confirmation of gotts resolution while others have dodged the responsibility ofa vote and done heir share of the ser vilework but the people of massachusetts will by and by find out where taylorism has placed them patience vermont ml a very resolu tion the following resolves wept adopted unanimously in both brandies of the vermont legislature previous to their adjournment resolved by the senate and house of repress at aiives that we seek m vain to discover any foundation for bu man slavery in the divine or natural i law or the lew of nations that it on gin in all cases may he traced to irau i or physical force and that all local law for its continuance or protection hav l been afterwards introduced by th slaveholders themselves to justify ani perpetuate their usurpations t resolved that congress possesses i and ought immediately to exercise th i power to prohibit slavery in the territc i rics of new mexico and california and that without such prohibition au the strong arm of the general govern j ment to enforce its observance there ii great danger that it will obtain a foot ii hold there not only without the aol ci local laws but against them thus adding a hull father stain upon our nu tional honor and subjecting tlie fre states to the injustice of a still greate inequality in their representation it i congress i resolved that our senators rn congress be instructed and our representatives requested to exert their el forts for a passage of a law abolishing j slavery in the district of columbiaan prohibiting the traffic in slaves betweei the states j resolved that it is unbecoming tin representatives of freemen muintainiiq the declaration that liberty is inaliena j hie to legislate for the general welfare i while their eyes are insulted with tin frequent sjfbctacle of men chained shackled and driven to market or con tined in pens awaiting buyers aud whereas slavery in the pistric j of columbia exerts a balelul influence upon the action of congress checking the freedom of debate threatening tin freedom of the press and controlling j the executive department at washington therefore resolved that unless slavery in th district he speedily abolished by tin j action of congress with the assent othe inhabitants it is the duty of congress to pass a law removing the sea jof government into the territory o some free state more central and mort convenient for the nation where the representatives of the people may he more free to legislate for the general welfare tiie vote of indiana for freedom there has never been a more servile tool of the slave power in the congress of the united states than senator hannegan of indiana during the period he has misrepresented the noble state which sent him to washington his whole dhfeer has been distiuguishei by a most unscrupulous disregard t the rights of th north and thermos cringing servility to fhe manstealers the south but his constituents liav marked him and driven him from the post which he has so long dishonored and disgraced the free people of indiana have supplied his place in the senate with a better manone who hasa heart as well as a head and who is too honest to legalize in free territories the horrible crimes aud iniquities of our slave system gov whitcomb is tobe the successor of hannegan and the following extract from his late inaugural message will show what the friends of freedom may expect from him decided as the opinion of the people of indiana is against the institution of human slavery yet they have ever manifested a determination never to interfere with the constitutional rights of any of our sister states on this subject they love that glorious union which was framed by the conscript fathers of the earlier days of the republicand to which under providence w are indebted for our present eminence among the nations of the earth but the present question does not regard slavery in the states or in any state it refers exclusively to the propriety ol its existence hereafter in a territory now free this territory has now come to us free is now free and in my opinion it should remain free and that every constitutional and legal means should he adopted to continue it free nor do i think our southern brethren would in that case have any just cause of coraj plaint florida was ceded to the united states as a slave territory and so it was suffered to remain and the same remarks will apply to the acquisition of texas when the governor of a state talks like that the people are not long in catching the tuneand in the second day of the session the following joint resolution was presented if straws show which way the wind is blowing j surely indications like these must convince tjje most doubting that a political tornado is coming which will sweep the last vestige of slavery from the land whereas the people of indiana regard the institution of human slavery as a great moral and political evil and whereas the people of the united states have recently acquired from the republic of mexico a large amount e territory which is now free and which in the opinion of this general aaaem bly ought forever to remain free and whereas it is the opinion of this gen j eral assembly that congress possesses the power under the constitution to pro lubit the extension of slavery into such territory and that it b right and proper that such power be exercised by congress therefore be it resolved by the general assembly of tbe state of indiana that our senators in congress be and they are hereby instructed and our represeat tives requested to me tbeir influence and vote in fetor of tbe passage of a law providing that there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of said territory otherwise than in the punishment ol crime whereof the shall have boon duly christian cdtssn john

petitioner asks for one remark more sir and then i am done it is this there seems to be a sensitiveness upon the subject of slavery which mysel never have felt there is a southern sens liveness and a northern sensitiveness likewise which i have never experienced and disjkjsition to agitate in some quarters whic  have alike and always disregatded upon it mr president as utterly hopeless a utterly

to be mv duty to get from tliosi northern gentlemen at all times and upon al occasions just exactly what they intend to do therefore sir have leii always in favor o unshackling them on e cry opportunity i was for this purpose that moved a rceonsid nation of the votes by which the motion oi the gentlemen behind me mr hah and mr corwin were laid upon the table mr president do you ever exject or doe any sensible rational man ever expect tha we are to allay this excitement which hai been progressing from year to year until i ha reached the point of almost severing this nationexcept you can get men rationally t think amt rationally to talk with each othei upon tins subject northern man or a northern woman ds a petition here asking you to legislate upon the subject ol slavery as in the ease to which i have alluded asking you not to ex iml slavery mm the country over which you ran legislate du you exjeoi to conciliate the feelings ol that man or that woman by turning around and saying von had uu light to speak or if you do speak we will not hear youwe will treat yon with con tempt mr president it is utterly hopeless to expect to do any good by the course which we lake in reference to petitions sent here what has been tlie lesult of llns course in the othei branch of the national legislature when i irt came into uongrees all these peiihuns were referred it went on that way year after year until at last we passed the st rule iejecting them without question without ac non without doing anything has the pas aage of the st rule done any good lias in my judgment only aggravated th matter aod so the course which we take here sir can do no good excepting to aggra ate the question what is the remedy refer their petitions sod then give the projwi answer now sir upon the right ol pennon let me say that i entertain the opimor th it is not unlimited that there ur a r stn non upon it and that that restriction consist m two things if the body petitioned has nc power to grant the prnyer of that peniion then the jietitioiier has no right to prefer the petition if fie prefers lie petition to s body ilist cannot comply with the wishes of the petitionerthat lias no constitutional power to do soth presentation of tlie petition is to abody sir wluch in respect to the aetum wlch the petitioner desires has no possible i power toart and therefore there i no right in the care of that aon of petition the other limitation is sir that where the petitioner ask the body that ha the power to act to pare a law to modify a law to repeal a law which law doe not operate upon the petitioner but upon somebody els then th individual who is not affected hy the taw and cannot he affected by it has no right to interpose and introduce a jtitin to have a law passed which shall affect the rights and interests of others from whose action he is altogether exempt in a casr of that sort sir itis direct despotism it i tyranny in the worst nensc f r a man win does not feel the pcration of a law ami who from his aitua lion can never feel it to apply to a legislative bndv to put manacle upon other which he is not to feel himself now mir with these restrictum the right of ietition has been violated in innumerable instances i want the north to understand that they are calling upon the national legislature to do things the effect of which they arc not to leel themselves and i want sir hi my view of the subject the committees of this house and of the other to answer these jieopleto answer them in a calm dignified manner and say to them n hen your petitions coin here you are begging for a ihing which you are not to feel by legislative action and which you arc to make others feci most sensibly sir there are differences of opinion upon this subject i know these northern gentlemen and their constituents may think as conscientiously as i do that they have the right to ask the legislation of fongress upon a question the eflecie of which they are not to feel i think they have no such right the only way is to allow these petitions to come to the committee and then let northern gentlemen w ho are disposed to agitate this question do it at their peril sir we shall hive all these things up this is inevitable these territorial bills in reference to new mexico and california bring the yyhole ques lion before us and why umii this question sny more than upon that shall we ot the south he allowed to speak and whv should we not allow northern gentlemen to argue j these points sir i experience no such alarm as others appear to feel led as though i stand upon impregnable ground with reference to this institution think understand it better than they do and have no objection to then discussing anything they choose to discuss i have nothing l fearlrom the discussion i therefore hope sir not only that the inquiry whether congress has the power to aidin liis matter may is made doling the present session but am erfeetly willing to have a reconsideration of those petitions which were presented day before yesterday and to let them go to a committee that they may is reported upon as well as the paper which had the honor to present mr metcalfe followed in remarks of a similar naiurc mr halel rise sir for the purpose of expressing my grateful acknowledgments to the senator from kentucky who first addressed the hair mr underwood fir the magnanimous course which lie has pursued with reference to the petition w filch ha the honor of presenting the other day and indeed it was no more than had a right to expect from his whole course upon this floor but w hile do this i beg to dissent in the most unqualified manner from the limitations which that honorable senator lias laid down to the exercise of the right of petition which right that gentleman so freely concedes because sir wttli the limitations and restrictions which the honorable senator puts upon this right and which am sure he would not have put upon it if he had examined it with his usual keenness the right of petition is utterly destroyed and the right is not worth the natno nor the petition the paper upon which it is written f the position of the honorable senator ii understand to be thisthat the petition must lie presented to a liody having the power to grant it and it must not be for any measure whirl n ill uflfeci others ifsu those who pre i sent the petition now sir w hat is the right of petition thus limited hampered and fettered the question is whether congress have the power petitioners come here and ask you to pursue certain measures and if you decide in advance that you have not the power to pursue those measures you just as i effectually deny the right of jictitiou as if you refused to receive the petition for any other reason whatsoever this jusi as effectually j debars the citizen from the right of petition as f any mode which human ingenuity ean devise if you say we have not the power to grant and therefore we will not hear your petition it is equivalent to saying you have no right to come here and we will not hear your ti prayers but the gentleman says that we must not f pray for measures affecting others than the petitioners i was reading the other day the r correspondence between the minister of the i united states and lord palmerston in great britain relative to american citizens unjustly detained in the prisons of great britain and saw with high satisfaction that the american secretary of state very much to his credit urged upon our minister at the court of st that he should ask not only for the lieration of citizens of the united slates unjustly thrown into prison but should intercede in lielialf of the whole class of those who had fallen under the censure of the british gov eminent on account of the movements they had made in their attempts mistaken though they might lieto reform and perhaps to revolutionize ireland where sir would have een an intciference in that case if the american secretary of state had been governed by the consideration wbich has been urged i upon the senate hy the gentleman from kentucky that the right to pray the right tc leg was confined to the simple poor and narrow pri ilege of asking blessings for our selves what is the whole scope and tenor of the religion w hich we profess and which i know the honorable senator not only professes bui practices is it not to make prayer and intercession tor all men and sir is it tc lie announced tiere today as the deliberate conviction of the american senate that the circle of human sympathies and human affections is to u so circumscribed to a rigid selfishness that we have not the right even to j pray and to beg for the subjects of our sympathy and regard has the right of petition got io be as limited and restricted as that j yet sir if i understood the gentleman from kentucky this is the limit and the restriction which lie would impose upon the right of pe ntion io be enjoyed by the citizens of the u stales when addressing the senate of the i united states will trespass upon the attention of the senate but a moment longer must say that i have beenl might sayamused but i have been astonished at the tone of remark which i hear every day m this senate iu the house of heprescmatives and elswhere upon this subject of american slavery as if northern gentlemen were aggressive upon this subject aggressive howt when when why sir the course of northern kepietenutives and northern senatorsl say it to our shame and i take my portion of itlias been so pusillanimous so cowardly so craven so submissive upon this subject that the women and the children reproach us for t yes sir the very women call ua craven received a letter from a female friend today who inquired why in the name of heaven it was that northern spirit baa so ooaetf out aud that we had become so submissive and so tame upon thu subject why sir slavery has ruled the government from the very first adoption of the constitution up to tbe present time and it hat got re now that if we cse rciae the poor righ of the beggar and cry and petitioo we are denounced as insolent es sir if we lookup to our masters and say god help us weare called insolent and aggressive and trespassing upon the right ot the south now piotest one and forever aftiut the injtmtice of any such term we he been mibroissivc and we arc mill we have bent our faces to the earth and our bock hr the lash and we ought to he reproached for that we hare been submissive long enough and we have beta tatne enough heaven pod earth know i am much at alose to know what is meant bv this northern aggteasion m our mono and our wood have beiua wn upon us as profusely as our i tienoa we have yielded anything atd everything in our individual and mrr notional action in behalf cff in support of the institution of southern slavery i do not wish u interfere with it i do not wish to he aggressive i only w ish that we may lie let alone nay sir i am willing arnl i tk also in i hall of those who sent me herel am willing that we should beheld responsible to the limit of the constitutional obligation for everything that may he required for the support ami sustenance l american slavery i am willing to go to the last letter in the bond if you find in it the pound id flesh take it ami if you find out hearts best mood written there take it i am ready to come up lo the work freely fairly and fully and to conform to the contract hut w hen we are called to go turthei than thatwhen we ask in the name ot common humanity from our clearest conviction of our obligations that we may not be com ielled lo go even beyond the line of coi slitu lional obligation i do pray that we may not for that reason c called aggressiver mr dough s i do not intend to enter inti any discussion it is only the last few remarks of the gentleman from new hampshire mr lfale whicn have brought me t the floor as a northern inan i ani no willing to have it said here without deuying it that the north have degraded themselves to thedsoiith i am not willing to have that libel pronounced upon the north on this floor and to sit in silent acquiescence to its correctness the north have always maintained their rights they are the last people to yield to an infraction of those riglus northern men have shown their willingness to meet the issue at all times in the halls ol legislation whenever the issue has been brought before them and sir if there has been any submission upon the part ot the noitli in former times if there has ipeen any humble submission it has fieen an humble submission to the principles of the fonslitu lion ami not to dictation from the south i have only regretted in these latter days that this liurnhle submission to the principles of the constitution on the part of my northern friends had not lieen continued sir have voted to keep the abolition agitation out of those halls have voted to keep down i that spirit of fanaticism which was agitating and exciting the country to no good and which could have no other effect than to rally the north against the smith and the smith against the northto weaken the bond ol union between the different portions of the country and to create factions w hich are willing to rule upon the ruins of the l onstitution and of the union and sir is this submission to the spirit and jthe principles of the onstitution to e de itounoed as a base submission to a southern faction no sir i wish to execute the lowers of this government in that spirit of harmony and conciliation which brought the constitution into existence if the southland the north had come forward vitb theii defiance each taunting the other and adding insult to insult every time that one of the opposite section rose upon the floor do you think that we should have had a consti union and shall we be degenerate sons ol troie jires who framed the constitution i he constitution w as good as it came fron their hands how shall it lie said that we whe live under it and its provisions are dc generate for our fidelity to it we would have no cause sir of complain j upon the subject of slavery if each mar would mind his own business and not endeavor to introduce the subject into thest halls the constituents of our new hamp i shire friend would neyer know how in gel these poor negroes suffer if it was not fob them by those who never saw their sufferings and know nothing of what they are talking about and the south would not know how badly they are treated by the north if th subject was not brought before them for flu purpose of exciting the people in a popula election i wish sir to banish the whoh agitation from these halls let us rival end other in our devotion to the principles of tin constitution to the spirit of harmony an conciliation and to binding the different portions of the union together more firmly rather than in abusive attacks upon diffemn portions of the union calculated to exciti j angry feeling and discontent if we wish sir to settle this question o slavery and banish the agitation iioin tliesi halls let us remove the cause which produce it let us settle the question in that territory which we have acquired in a manner lhai saves the honor and respects the feelings o every portion of the union do not insult ione section of the union by bringing fonyart your prohibiton of slavery nor defy the pfher by threats of disunion bring it into this union upon an equal footing with the fstates the people in each state settle the question of slavery as they would settle the questior of banking or any othet domestic institution themselvesfor themselves according to theii own wishes whatever that settlement maybe shall be contented with it if we of the north would mind our owr business upon that subject and if you of the south would be quiet and mind yours and let california act for herself i think then we should have very little trouble neither the noith nor south either f them has any right to interfere there i do not speak of constitutional right do not choose to go into abstractions or metaphysical reasoning i speak of those moral rights which go higher than the constitution and which we are liound to observe when we assume to dictate forms of government to a people wlto are about to form an independent state and sir let us settle the question iir this district in the same way let us retrocede it to maryland when you have done these two things there is nothing left for agitation upon the subject of slavery then parties can be formed upon principles upon which they can stand the whigs can stand upon their own whig measures the democrats can stand upon their own firm and eternal principles i jet us leave the one to combat i the other believe the country is safe in the bauds of either but may god prevem this country from ever being ruled by a faction which comes into power by appealing andi pandering to prejudices which combines men of all parties and all factions with no one principle in common god prevent that we may ever be ruled by such a party in this country if we would quiet the agitation let us remove the causes and thus may we avert such a calamity mr underwood followed in reply to the argument of the senator from new hampshire mr hale while maintaining the position thflj citizen has no right to petition for that whfc the body petitioned has not the power to grant or which does not affect the i petitioner individually mr u a id but air let ine tell the gentleman and let me tell the country that my view of the right of petition is thst it is a practical question that right is not infringed by the action o either branch of congress when we reject any paper which may be presented here that merely utters the religious sentiments or the philanthropic sentiments of the petitioner we do not interfere with that right when we say that the paper shall not be considered but my view of the right of petition is that t it is a practical thing it becomes practical when you are salted to pass a law and to repeal or modify a law this congress is s legislative body and all the action of con gross in my estimation is in iu legislative or executive character now air whatever it can do in it legisla live ot executive chancier boo a bearing upon the orisons of the united state generally m upon particularclasses sij pt or apart from the gw hate its effect upon the people of las i nits states in one uiv or the other wwtsnyi then relates to the general interest ol tha country operate alld him upon the iw either in the executive or in legislative character of t mgn i bow to bean orcaama for the people of the united stale to petition upon but whatever action of ongrese in its legislative character affects a partiealai lutnet then i hold sir that it is the business nf that particular district which feels the action of the government and that dtnn ahmc to iciition to t iingress for its action now sir to illustrate what are tliese northern permute constantly doing they are petitioning with reference to the institution of slavery in this district do the law w hich operate upon the institution of slavery in this district operate upon the noithern men not at all does it affect their rights or property t not at all ft may affect tbeii moral and religious sentiments mr hale will the senator allow rnc f j w ish to ask him if the citizens of the whole l nion are not at an expense in this districi for the support of fugitive slaves and others whether we do not thereby pay our monet for the support of this institution in this district l mr underwood well sir i suppose yoi do to some extent if there is any expense j iu maintaining the seat of government it falh upon the general treasury of the country that i admit but sir in the view of tht  constitution of the united states are you t lie relieved from ihe expense of maintaining the seal of government in the tenmiles square ceded to the nation for the purpose of a seal of government does the mere fact tha  vou are subjected to a small pecuniary contribution anthorize you to make that a basi luoii which to ask the passage of laws whicl do not affect you but which only affect this particular district mr dayton my simple purpose sit ir calling the attention of the senate to this reference was that the judiciary committer might he left free to the exercise of a certair discretion common in such casesto report oi not ujwin the questions involved in the memorial wish this memorial to stand a other memorials ordinarily stand when rc feired to our committee and i think sir ihat the remarks which have been made b my friend touching the memorial that he ha presented serve to show the propriety ol the course which suggested mr mason submitted a few remarks the purport of which was that the slate of virginia would submit to no inquiry upon the question of slavery either for or against tin institution mr davis of mississippimr president j it is exceedingly to be regretted that from day to day those assembled here to discharge their constitutional legislative duties should find themselves balked by irritating question lorced upon them by those whose piety is st great that they must always he repenting o others sins when did the south ask for this vicarious repentance and when did slit ask of you lessons in morals let thest pious intcrmeddlers answer these questions orhereaft er stop ibis perfidious interference with the rightsof other men but sir of all the claptraps that have evei i gouged forth from the mouths of demagogue to catch popular favor this question of the right of petition is the greatest what die the constitution guaranty and under whai i terms and for what purpose was it adopted i when these states were colonies whoevei denied those colonies the right of petition it was the right peaceably to assemble foi specific purposes which was tested and tha was the right which was guarantiedthe right peaceably to assemble to petition foi grievances that was the only right whicl i was ever interfered with and the right t petition carried with it tlte supposition tha there was a grievance what grievance is there to any nonslaveholding state tha where communities think proper to keej i slaves they should interfere with their lights does this right to beg imply the obligator to grant there is the question and tin whole question before congress shall wt i receive and entertain and discuss petition ij upon a subject when every one concedes tha we have no right to grant anything jt ian idle waste of time to pass upon such petitions and thus to squander the time whicl i ought to lie devoted to some useful purpose i mir it has been stated that in the course o this debate that the course of the southerr men in objecting to these petitions has createi all the excitement let those who entertair this opinion reler lo the action of the hous of kepreseutativos and there find the decisiot against them in that bodywhere tliest petitions have lieen received referred anc discussedabolitionism has gone on increasing step by step w hile in tlie senatethe more rational rule having been adopted of lay j ing such petitions on the table without discussion it has scarcely been a tiling considered until some very zealous overpious latterday saints have come into the senate tc force this question upon us sir we have been told about the enlarging of the circle of human sympathy and affection and those who warn us of thus enlarging this circle are such as can never reason in any other circle than that tf affection for the negro race it begins and ends there it can heai of nothing else that is progressive in any human reformnothing which does not centre j in the single question of abolitionism what now is the proposition it is to take money from the treasury and bestow it upon a certain class of passengers l what right have you to distinguish between one j class of passengers and another i am sorry i that when my friend from kentucky was speaking he did not say to the north you are the men who imported these slaves from africawho have enjoyed the benefit of the carrying and selling ot these slaveswho have reaped the largest proportion of the profit i and you are the men who should contribute the largest proportion ol the money to carry them back i as to any influence to be exerted upon the convention in kentucky have only to say that i agree with my inend from irgiuia mr mason i am unwilling to attempt any interference with the convention they aje able to take cate of themselves and they i have a light to do as they please if they wish to emancipate their slavesalthough should regret it i would interpose uo obi stacie by showing them that we would not transport their slaves and most certainly no inducement by showing them that we would and it would be well sir for those who cry out good god and i think there is more propriety in crying out good devil wlien their whole purpose is to scatter seeds of dissension in this union it might be well for them duriug alt their lamentations about slavery to look upon the other side of the picture and ask if it has brought evils what evils has it prevented l lias it made one more a slave than would have been a slave without that institution has it reduced one man from liberty to slavery this is the question answer not one under laws older than the records of history men were taken in bondage and made slaves as captives of war those were purchased of chieftains warring with contending elans who held them in slavery and that purchase saved them frwn a more ignominious slavery than that which exists on this side of the atlantic that purchase bought them too from the dreadful darkness w hich bung over the savage interior of africa and it brought with it enlarged productsenlarged commerce the palm of civihxation and of inlet national amity and all those blessings which now hind the people of the remote quarters of the world together these are some of the fruits which sre to be considered before you condemn so freely this institution it is only to answer the libellous slanders of this msutuui n about which i know soane j thing ottered by tboss whs are entirely ignorant of k that i have entered into the dis cassias thank the senator from lllams r duogbasj for the manly manner m which he hea this question sad ii all those of equal mtelhgeaoe representing alike constituency would thus speak to those they represent appealing to their pntnotum and good sense it woold present this agitation which can be productive of nothin but evil this n the question the agitation ol which ts drstroving our institetioi if indeed they arc to fall now is the tune for than men who love the union better than tbej lore the negro rare to speak plainly to those whom they represent to tell them they mistook the issue that when they argued ahoul the existence of slavery it was an issue ol their own there was another which they were bound to consider and it was the question of noninterference with the rights of th slates or the question of the disunion of thu noble confederacy and of all the bright hopei of human liberty w hich have been built upor it with this issue let our northern friendt appeal to their constituency and if they an nut so far degenerated from such sires at hancock and adams they will return to then allegiance to the constitution and forbear t interfere with the rights of the southerr states mr butler shall not undertake to din cuss the question of slavery with gentlemer who present petitions of this kind but mri president i am a member of the judicary committee and if petitions and resolutions o this sort are to be given to it i must beg ti be discharged form the painful duty of entertaining them for while i am willing from ij sincere respect to this body to obey all its instructions i trust in god that you will no make me the instrument of my own degradation and that of my country mr dayum remarked that that part of thi resolution which proposed instruction to th committee had been stricken out mr butlerl do not want any reference a j all mr berrien expressed himself entirely opposed to the object of the petitioner and eon sequently to its reference mr siles concurred in the view taken hj the senator from georgia mr berrien hi further held that the petitioner asked an appropriation such as congress had no constitutional power to grant he believed this to lie a matter which belonged to the states and not to the federal government mr dickinson concurred in the views expressed by the senator from connecticut am moved the indefinite postponement of tin whole subject the question being stated upon the motion the yeas arid nays were demanded and ordered and being taken the yeas were nays as follows yeas mesrss atherton bell berrien borland breese butler calhoun davis o mississippi dickinson douglass downs fitzgerald fitzpatrick foote

dodge of wisconsin dodge of low a felch hale hamlin jones metcalfe miller niles phelps spruance underwood upham and walker j so the further consideration of of the sub i the north star rochester january  colonization in order to divert the hounds from the pursuit of the fox a red herring is sometime drawn across the trail and the hounds mistaking it for the real scent the game is oftei lost we look upon the recent debate in th senate of the united states over thii wrinkled old red herring of colonizatior as a ruse to divert the attention of the peoplt from that foul abomination which is sought t be forced upon the free soil of california ant new mexico and which is now struggling foi existence in kentucky virginia and the district of columbia the slaveholders are evi dentlyat a stand to know whaf trick they shall try next to turn the scorching rays o antislavery light and truth from the bloodshot eyes of the monster slavery the discussion of it is most painful and agonizing and if it continues the very life of this foul unnatural and adulterous beast will be put ir imminent peril so the slaveholding charmeri have conjured up their old famliar spirits o colonization making the old essence of abomination to flounder about in its grave clothes before the eyes of northern men to theii utter confusion and bewilderment a drowning man will catch at a straw slavery is sinking in public estimation it is going down it wants help and asks through mr underwood of kentucky how much of the public money made by the honest toil of northern men will be at its service in the event ol emancipation as some are in favor of emancipation provided that the negroes can be sent to liberia or beyond the limits of the i united states  here we have the old colonization spirii revived and the impudent proposition entertained by the senate of the united states ol expelling the free colored people from the united states their native land to liberia in view of this proposition we would rei spectfully suggest to the assembled wisdom ol the nation that it might be well to ascertain i the number of free colored people who will belikely to need the assistance of govern i ment to help them out of this country to liberia or elsewhere beyond the limits of these united states since this course might save any embarrassment winch would result fiom an appropriation more than commensurate to the numbers who might lie disposed to leave this our own country for one we know not of we are of opinion that the free colored people generally mean to live in america and not in africa ami to appropriate a urge sum for our removal would i merely be a waste of the public money we do not mean to go to liberia our minds are oiade up to live here if we can or die here if we must so every attempt to remove uswill be as it ought to be labor lost here we are and here we shall remain while our brethren are iri bondage oo these shores it idle to think of inducing any considerable number of the free colored people to quit this for a foreign land iot two hundred and twentyeight yean has the colored man toiled over the soil of america under a burning sun and a laab plowing planting reaping that white men might roll in ease their hands unhard eced by laftor and their blows unmoistened by the waters of genial toil and now that the moral sense of mankind is beginning to revolt at this system of foiil freaehery and erod wrong and is demanding its overthrow the mean and cowardly oppressor it meditating i plans to expel the colored man entirely from the country shame upon the gnilty wretches that dare propose and all that countenance aoeb a proposition wt live lure hf lived herehave a right to live here redrew to live heref iatfapmßm and flinii ti the navy a great antiflogging and temperance meeting a convened in concert hall rtch filer on tseadav evening for the purpose of hearing the system of intemperance and the moody and inhuman practice of flogging in the navy exposed by a mr w s haynes a sailor who is devoting hts energies to the improvement of seamen having another ant meeting to attendee failed to reach the hall i in lime to hear thus child of the norm anti wttrf nprrate his own bittei experience the chair was occupied by his honor ihe mayor and the platform adorned by a large number of professional gentlemen embracing lawyers pnests and politicians several speeches were made after we got there all condemnatory of the practice of flogging in the navy denouncing it as derogatory to the character and genius of american institutions to the dignity of american citizenshipto the enlightened spirit of the age and as being utterly barbarous it was alleged that whipping was not only useless as a means of securing obedience and order but was also destructive to those qualities of mind and spirit in the sailor necessary to a warm and generous devotion to the cause and character of his country a series of resolutions were read but which we believe was not heard by any considerable part of the audience in character with the speeches now all this is well and shows that there are some links of brotherhood remaining unsevered and that there is yet some heart in man to feel for the wrongs of man the practice of tearing the flesh of man by the terrible thongs of the caor of bruising it w ith the deathdealing co is at once revolting to the better feelings of human nature and ought to call forth one united and universal cry of shame and disapprobation from the whole brotherhood of man the exposure to which this horrible practice in the american navy is now undergoing at the hands of mr haynes will we trust be of great service in awakening a deeper interest in the cause of the poor sailor and suffering humanity everywhere we have no difficulty in giving our hearty cooperation in such a movement as that to which mr haynes is himself and which seems to have the encouragement of the piety and respectability of rochester a long experience of the lash in our own person leaves us without the need of philosophy to teach us its stupifying deadening and hatredinspiring qualities resides our experience on the plantation we have the testimony of intelligent witnesses on unit sides of the atlantic as to the barbarity and inutility of flogging in the navy we had the privilege to attend and speak at a meeting ill exeter hall london more than two years ago to discourage this infernal practice and heard on that occasion narrations of cruelty that chilled the blood and made one to hang his head and blush to think himself a man when quite a boy we remember to hav sat and listened to a sea captain nariate witli fiendish glee his own inhuman treatment tc sailors and from that moment until nowthe sajjor has had our warmest sympathy on one occasion he had whipped aman till his back was raw and bloody and sent him aloft to reef or furl some sail we misremember which but the outraged man instead of performing the work leaped from the yardarm into the sea the jollyboat was at once dropped and the captain with two men made for the drowning man and on reaching him the captain seized him by the arm and essayed to drag him in but instead of allowing himself to be saved froma watery grave he caught the hand of the captain in his teeth lacerating it in a shocking manner this done he looked up at the captain with a smile of revengeful satisfaction placing his hands against the sides of the boat he gave himself a sudden push and darted down the briny deep feet foremost looking up the while at the object of his hate with all the fury of a demon he rose no more with life he preferred to die and be food for the hungry shark than to live and be food for the bloody ca vve have ieason to believe that cases of this kind are numerous but be this as it may there are facts enough to harrow up the soul of any in whom the pulsations of humanity are not extinct down with the infernal practice arid let the image of god be no longer the subject of the cat cowskin or colt mr haynes is circulating petitions asking congress to pass a law abolishing the rations and flogging which everybody ought to sign of course we hate the whole naval system and would aigu a petition to have it utterly blotted out of existence it is a system of blood from beginning to endnot merely a bloodshedder but a bloodsucker we would have the whole head of lazy lounging officers set at wotk and not strutting the deck or the street in epauletted idleness at the expense of the people but use people love to have it otherwise arid while this is the case we may do all we can to mitigate the sufferings of the poor and helpless under it and if we cannot abolish the navy let us do what we ii can to abolish the barbarous inhumanity

and to make bare the inconsistency ami hypocrisy of the people at large his address was listened to with fixed attention after he had concluded we addressed the the meeting at some length on the moral si at of the nation and illustrated our subject by the result of the late political whirlwind which placed that murderous wretch zachary taylor in the presidential chair we were told afterwards that some of the pious voters for this inanstealer and human butcher thought we displayed an unchiistian spirit m our assaults upon the character of general laylor this shows how christians so called may strain at a knat and swallow ai camt l they can give the whole sanction of their intelligence morals and religion to confer honor upon a slaveholder slavetrader a bloodhound importer and a human butcher and then assume to be discerners of spirit and very much shocked at anything that looks like an unchristian spirit out upon the hypocrites they act like devils at the ballot box and talk like saints in the church they would vole for the murderer of jesus for president and denounce those who abhor the crime as having an unchristian spirit iho time has gone by when such miserable twaddle can have much influence on the minds ol men there is another and better test than mere words by which to try the spirits of men and that is thkik works and when these are ol a wicked character mankind

objectionable it is entirely too long and irrelevant for publication in the north star we are perfectly willing that mr rush or any one els upon whose conduct we take the liberty to comment should be heard in their ow n defence but we are not willing that under the plea of selfdefence they should wander all over creation to gathet up matter which ha no neeessaiy bearing upon the point at issue and

to the extent of our ability ihe admission ol other matter with which his letter is cumbered is optional with us and we decide against it w e therefore present at once all that we have said with

express their opinions on the proceedings hut that members of the sreiely alone should vote it is however to he regretted that one v of lie society mr henry hush should not acquiesce in this sensible

by the audience and that the society almost unanimously stood for the complete integrity of our antislavery oiganization mr rush says in his letter before us that this accusation is not true and further says appeal to the chairman of the meeting and the executive committee who would he as likely to know as frederick douglass if that statement is true my crime if anv is that j talked and voted in opposition to frederick douglass and i now assert that my views were and are in harmony with the majority of the antislavery men and women of rochester and western new york and all previous meetings of the society here then is the question in very small compass wc have assumed in the remarks respecting the course of mr rush at the annual meeting that lie did not acquiesce in the arrangement restricting the voting to the mem hers and friends of the western new york antislavery society if mr rush says he did acquiesce we have perhaps done him wlong and are mistaken and will readily retract our statement though we should still be unable to explain much of his conduct on the occasion referred to for whether intentionally or otherwise his conduct did serve to embarrass and

in public capacities to define their positions and to erect their platforms my position is defined by christ and by him was my platform laid hr came not to call the righteous ones hut sinners to repentance on this principle i would have a general meeting called and in i ite men and women to come to the rescue yes let sinner come as well as saints such a meeting at first i presume would be small hut that would not be discouraging there are not many majestic streams that spring from large sources l hev are usually small at first but as they how onward they receive additions from various tributaries so it maybe with an enterprise like ours at the first we must start in an apparently insignificant and trail vessel but when we are about to approach the great ocean of a nations improvement we can launch a ship which shall be freighted with the best interests of our race from her masts shall stream the standard of the cross the captain of our salvation shall guide the helm and the breath of heaven will swell her sails am thoroughly convinced that the colored race in america must m their ascent avoid the old beaten and narrow path we must organize anew on the broad platform of the gospel in such an organization the church the pi ess science literature the arts and agriculture will lie promoted the stars of our people on this continent will arise in the west and south many will doubt this but whoever shall w rite our history a hundred years hence will record as a fact what may now be regarded asa mere chimera those who dwell in the eastern and middle states will be crushed to death by old aristocractic anangements and by the ponderous wheels of wealth and the various forms of monopoly the more sensible will seek the shores of the creat lakes or fix their homes on the greeu prairies the unwise w ill stand still and die in the south the chains will fall off and freedom will daw n and on the ground where my people shall he emancipated they will become the i artisans and laborers and as is the case in the west indies many of them will become the owners of the fields which they once cultivated without requital these being my views find myself conflicting with a doctrine which you advanced last week wherein you say that we must banish all thoughts of emigration from our minds and resolve to slay just where weare wherever other men immigrate there should we be found emigration is often the source of wealth prosperity and independence indeed we do colonize where other people go but we generally wait until they j have had the first choice

convention the correspondent of the new york courier under date of washington jan saysafter an exciting session of five hours the general committee of the southern states has just adjourned tne policy of reporting mr cal houns address to the caucus on monday was the principal subject under consideration every member in the committee participated in the debate but the speech of mr rusk of texas was on all hands conceded to have made the profoundest impression he resisted any action on behalf of the south but such as asserted her rights under the constitution and moil for these he would contend atat all hazards and bequeath resistance as a legacy to his children dissolution was nota remedy it was the worst of calamities that could befall any portion of the confederacy mr calhoun endeavored to impair his purpose by intimidation and persuasion but both equally failed mr rusk admitted his personal obligations to that distinguished senator and his friendship towards texas but his oath to the constitution and his sense of duty required at a time like the present that he should forget all such considerations in higher demands of fidelity the union mr foote mr baily mr king mr venable and others endeavored to shake his determination but without effect they urged the regard that had been evinced to texas and claimed that in a moment such as this gratitude demanded a requital and the south expected her cooperation mr gentry it is understood resisted the address with considerable eloquence and ability he opposed the conclusion recommending union and concert as inconsistent with the declarations of its author who had declared that the legislatures and people of the south were already united if this was so what was the need of such a recommendation if there were covert designs masked under the manifesto looking to means of redress which were not disclosed he could sanction a proceeding so disingenuous he was for exhausting the constitutional remedies before adopting any forcible alternative mr stephens concluded the dehate and the address was finally ordered to be reported to the caucus by a majority of one ayesmessrs atchiuson borland bayley calhoun dowjis foote

give anything buta birds eye view of the proceedings and to stale results in which the country is now so deeply interested it may be necessary tor enlarge moie in a subsequent letter at this moment it is doubtful whether the opposing portion of the south will attend the caucus on monday night or satisfied with i what has occurred will conclude to absent r i themselves from any farther participation

give to that document a private character that those only should be accountable for it who might choose to give it the sanction of their signatures this motion was ruled to be out of order and the

when it vraa presented and anoenab to a die tatiun which they were willing bnt afraid to resist thus although mr clayton who opened the debate on the address and dosed with a motion to lay it on the

the question home it hey refused to sustain bun there being but ayes sad nays after this failure to get a direct expression of disapprobation the test was made upon mr beniens proposition to recommit

irom a continuencc ot tbej  movements which had been recently witnessed to congtpss mr mckay insisted upon a division of the motion so that the would occur upon the recommitment without the instruction this step was in flagrant hostility to the wishes of mr calhoun and all his influence was employed to defeat i it and keep the address before the meeting a vote was taken the result of which was ayes to nays it may be read ly discovered from this vote that mr calhouns defeat was overw helming i for he had the advantage of support which upon a final test of accepting or rejecting the address would have recorded themselves in the negative or escaped from the hall v mr stephens then proposed to adjourn sine du but the regular troops rallied the doubtful to their aid and it failed by ayes to nays it is worthy of remark in this con neciion that mr mclane of md and gentle men of his stamp opposed the motion of mr clayton and mr stephens while they sua taiyed that of mr berrien amended by mr mckay which in effect produced the same result i rite the fact to show ihat they were indisposed to meet the responsibility of their whole duty and yet willing to strike ani equally effective blow by indirect means i they were faithless to themselves as well as to mr clhoun whom they had not the nerve loencountei in an open and manly engage ment the recommitment was an effectual

that the journals of the doings would have been published and furthermore that had the public been admitted there would have been danger of excitement and uproar in the galleries as discussion might progress mr venable of n c read the address which was drawn up by mr calhoun with mr bayleys assistance speeches were made against the address by mr clayton of delaware mr stephens and mr toombs ot geo mr morehead and mr underwood of ky and mr gentry of tenn and the address was advocated by mr calhoun mr bayley mr gayle of ala mr mason of va mr westcott of fla jefferson davis of miss speeches in favor of action hut for modifying the address were made by mr berrien and mr mckay the address was opposed on several grounds one that it asserts that organized bodies of men existed through ihe states reaching into canada to aid slaves in escaping from service the proof of this position was wanting another reason was the address declared that the north had raised a false issue by charging the south with legislating in congress with the view of extending slavery while the south openly denied the charge and proclaimed thru there was nc authority to restrict or expand slavery mr toombs could not sanction this as he had taken opposite grounds in congress the last session another reason for opposing the address was that it proposed no definite chart foraction but left all to risk as to the future the address was finally recommitted to the same committee without instruction mr berrien moved instructions but they were rejected the committee is to report next monday evening till w hen the meeting stands adjourned several membeis of the committee got excused from farther serving among them were mr stephens mr clayton mr rusk mrchapman and mr morelitad the address gives an

sub try midsummer afternoon oppressed to desperation with thirst in search oi water while the caravan was dragging slowly along the dreary and heated prairie making his way to a cluster ol timber that appeared at no very great distance he was fortunate enough to find a small cool spring gushing and rippling at the bottom of a rocky hollow the fresh water the cool shade of the steep rock and the trees above together with the knowledge that the wagons were still moving along in sight induced the poor fellow to yield to hi weariness and suffer his eyes to close when he awoke the grey of the evening w as deepening around the prairie and rushing up from the hollow his eye wandered about in vain search ol his companions he was a raw adventurer upon his first travel knowing nothing of how to direct his steps in the wilderness trusting entirely to the guidance and experience of those with whom he travelled hasty impulsive and careless and without possessing a quality of character to assist him in such an emergency confused terror at once took possession of him and starting as he thought in the direction where he had last seen the wagons he ran with headlong speed shouting wildly at every step in hopes of being heard and answered by his companions the terrified man bereft of all thought by the fearful nature of his predicament could not even remember to fire the rifle he held hut continued to tear his lungs with wild and desolate cries for assistance w bile rushing blindly forward in this manner the night still deepening around him the man met with a violent lull and was stunned into insensibility for some hours we are giving now the substance ofthefpoor fellows own relation he came hack to consciousness sometime during tlie night in the midst ol a pack of howling wolves and found himself lying by the sile of a buffalos skeleton not yet entirely stripped uy the prowling dogs of the desert a situation more appalling to heart and j nerve may not be imagined the man doubted not but that he was i aroused prematurely from his state of torpor by the hungry creatures assaulting his own body for his clothes were mauled and torn and the scratch of a claw was on his leg though a tooth it seems had not yet touched him he had tripped upon the skeleton and struck his forehead on a horn or some other part as he discovered a huge lump upon his head which also ached distressingly when he came to his senses the poor fellow in the heat of his terror made out to scare away thf wolves from himself and escape front the spot leaving the famished animah to return again to the buffalo v bones and give them a cleaner polishing just escaping from one frightful danger perhaps took something from the j keen horrors of his desolate ant wretched condition but the unhapp mans sensations were harrowing anc fearful in the extreme he still pressed onward his strength failing at ever step calling in harsh and broken shriek to his friends and changing his course again and again in utter and miserable uncertainly of which way to turn daylight came the sun rose noon approached and passed and the losl man was alone in the desert famished and faint and without a solitary hope of regaining his companions or finding the track they were pursuing that night the unhappy wretch sank exhausted upon the grass and tlept tc awaken in a state of fear and dangei  more appalling

trodden tc death by the huge monarchs of the plain as these dense masses of buffaloes move they emit sounds that rise in the air like a sea surge and as the vast black herd came towards him in deep midnight the poor trader declared that a rolling ocean seemed about tc overwhelm him utterly paralyzed with bis danger the unfortunate man could but start on bis feet and stand confounded fearing either to fire ot use other means to alarm the buffaloes lest by exciting their terror he should but increase bis own peril from this critical position he likewise escaped unhurt for the animals separated as is their custom when a strange scent is detected and passed on in two divisions keeping some two hundred yards clear of the mysterious intruder in the middle daylight was again appearing as the last of the innumerable herd of creatures passed him and the man was starving he took aim with his rifle at a retreating buffalo and missed fire for bis percussion cap was damp with the night dew still he was famishing and his only hope seemed in the slaughtering a buffalo he followed crawling on bis hands and knees and afterhours of weary watching and labor wounded a cow at last with a successful i shot and the whole band disappeared while the poor trader fell prostrate too i exhausted and faint to make another ef i fort in the pursuit this unhappy wretch lay groaning aloud alone an the inidst of au inter min able waste abandoned to despera turn and despair when the thin bark of i a small prairie dog attracted his alten tion once more he charged his rifle for the little creature was in sight with its nose lifted just above the mound surrounding its hole the starving man lay prostrate upon the earth took slow and cautious aim at the dog and was fortunate enough to knock it out of its hole with a broken back but before he could reach the spot the dying creature had wiggled back into iu hiding place and tjsappeartd with bis tea fingers the desperate man raked up the earth and succeeded in dragging the dying dog out upon the grass where without waiting to finish his agony be tore its warm flesh with his teeth like a wolf while the expiring creature was still biting at bis fingers this unnatural sustenance restored the drooping man and he was enabled to resume his wanderings which be continued for three more nights alone desolate and miserable until he encountered a hunting party of cvrnan ches whom so far from avoiding he rushed to embrace as though they were kindred near and dear and the best friends he could meet on earth they were friends as it turned out for they set him on the right track to regain his comrades with instructions to dirrect him and buffalo meet to support him paying themselves by stripping him of his rifle and everything else of the slightest value he had about him after four days travel the poor trader reached his friends again and was welcomed as one from the grdve upon the evening of his loss search wa made in all directions and signal guns fired which he would have heard had he not been lying insensible by the buffalos skeleton search was also continued upon the succeeding days as the carravan moved along but his wandering had been irregular tending in a far and opposite direction that it was impossible to trace him the five dttys suffering of this unfortunate man may be but faintly imagined barton and whittier james russell lowell in noticing whittiers poeins in the antislavery j standard thus compares two quaker poets the quakers never had a poet who i wrote in rhythm before whittier poets enough who wrote in prose they have j had and men whose lives were poems but nothing better than bald vmkse inakers before bernard barton was drab to his hearts core his verses are precise strait breasted and thee one most tediously yet there is no true quakerism in them neither dry husks they would have been indeed to hungryhearted george fox the quakers have crystallized into the most angular formalism and they deserved just such a poet as barton he was sent to them for their sins and we hope they read him tlie men who disown hopper and dugdale and look askance at lucretia molt not that barton was not a very worthy fellow he was good enough beyond a doubt more truly pious than sbakspeare very likely but there is no tang in him he coincs as near to being a poet as a ripe cucumber conies to being a fruit whittier is quite another matter there is the soul of quakerism in him for quakerism is essentially aggressive his poeins would have been cordial to fox in nottingham jail nailer might have recited his ballad of cassandra southwick exultingly at the carttail woolman would have found a delicious but unwilling relish in them as in forbidden fruit if ever a man deserved the title of poet maker john greenleafwhittier does he has made more than verses he has not only written but done something he has made directly more public opinion on the right side than any poet we can think of this is making to some purpose nor has it been a sacrifice in whittier to become a partisan he was created for it and he has accomplished his destiny nobly we do not desire him to be anything other than he is any more than we should think of lamenting that an apple was not a pear he has perhaps fulfilled the truest vocation of the pet in this transition age by being in some sort the voice of one crying in the wilderness mr remington in the den in the first instance we invite the new york literary world to favour us w ith a notice of the following contradiction to a statement which would not have appeared in our colnmns had we not found it in those of our much respected contemporary we have since seen it in many other american papers of repute and invite their attention also to the matter last week we did not give all mr remingtons letter because it read to us like the bitter effusion of a disappointed and worried man an unreasonable bitterness it was therefor that we omitted much faultfinding of mr bancroft the american ambassador of mr tyler the proprietor of the surrey gardens mr remington on the whole spoke without disrespect but from the entire letter an inference might he drawn that mr tyler had not behaved very generously from a belief that mr bancroft was not a man to behave as mr remington said and from a knowledge in which all who know mr tyler will bear us out that he was not we omitted the reflections upon those two gentlemen attributing them to the discolourment of gall and bitterness mr remington asserts that he was starving when he got admittance to mr tylers establishment that he was living at least an d a daythat he was in rags clothes had i none that he slept in a lions den whilst the model of his most ibgenious bridge was being prepared and took charitable crusts from the carpenters dinners we should have disbelieved all about the lions den had we not thought that his lodging therein was unknown to mr tyler ami was a sort of carpenters bed made up in the summer too for an impoverished man of great engineering ability the circumstantial account allowing for prejudice and bitterness seemed unquestionable as toits facts facts and all the united states now admire remington for bis fenius and pity him for bu d a dayle raid that he never received a farthing from mr tyler admitting at the same timethat he was not entitled toone and that the bridge cost b now mark the following statements in a letter written by mr tyler which that gentleman has shewn us by written documents unnecessarily for his word was sufficient to be perfectly cor rect my first introduction to mr remington was to inspect a new light for the table which be said he had m vented upon his telling hm that be had no fends to complete the apparatus iin concert with mr jones gss fitter of covenigardenguaranteed to mr madd the payment of xko if successful all expenses of patent and bringing it before the public were to be eid by mr jones and myself mr sreington receiving onehalf this experiment turned out a complete failure mr remington also had to redeem a onewheel velocipede which after weeks gratutious aid of my carpenters and blacksmith also proved a failure the bridge he said having been repeatedly erected in america be attached no importance to all he wanted was an opportunity oj bringing his name before the public for he had other invention be relied onto remunerate himself during the trhole time he teas superintending the construction oj ths bndge he boarded and lodged at mr ladds mathematical instrument maker ameliastreet penion place to tr horn i paid for such board and lodging and other expenses w hich sum i never asked mr remington for in addition to which i hold a note of hand for l for money advanced he never slept in the gar denshe never partook of the carpenters mealshe dined frequently at my table he had free access to the gardens when he chose and i should mnch i ke to possess the instrument by which a yankee bound himself to pay dollars for the advance of is previous to lodging at mr ladds i understand he hoarded and lodged at an hotel in leicestersquare for four months he told me also that he had been residing at morleys hotel strand we have italicised the lines in mr tylers letter as an instructive commentary on the d a day story mr remingtons letter was not addressed we believe to any american paper it purports to be a private letter to a friend in alabama let us hope it is a forgery or a hoax if it be neither one nor the other then why then we say our readers on both sides the atlantic may draw conclusions for themselves douglas jerrolds netcspaper id we published the letter referred to above as our readers will probably remember and think it no more than justice that we should also publish the correction this makes sonic deduction from the privations of mr remington jack bunsby on califonia gold vs potatoes the following sensible hit is from the new york sunday news being asked what he thought of the gold panic bunsby crossed his boots took a whiff and said if so be as how gold can he got in california for digging why good the only question would be to dig or not to dig and so but then do ye see a man must do something else besides digging he must eat drink sleep and be clothed withaland if all the people turn gold diggers who shall perform all the other kind of work now if so be a man should dig gold and fill his pockets why so and if so be another man should dig praties and fill a tinkettle and put it over a fire in unison with some wild kids and a few yarbs and the man who had been digging the gold should come and say give me some of thatere mess why so alsonow wat would the pratie digger say how much gold have you dug oh says the gold digger i have had great luck today but lam very hungry good says the pratie diggergive me two thirds of your gold and you shall dine with me why you inhospitable fel lowdo you want to rob no says the pratie digger but go and eat your gold ill eat my dinner alone and save what is left unlill tomorrow and then i can go and dig gold and you can dig praties for yourself now says bunsby the pratie digger would be the best off for the other could not wait until the morrow for a dinner and its therefore my opinion that digging praties may he under some circumstances more profitable than digging gold and my names jack bunsby chinese etiquette the chinese are so punctilious that their code of etiquette outvies the most ceremonious courts in europe as soon as a guest alights from his sedan chair he is met by the host who bows his head bends his body and his knees joins both hands iin front and with them knocks his j chest when he wishes to be very polite he takes his guests hand with his and knocks it upon his chest this is their inode of shaking hands now follows a polite contest as to precedence which after various knockings bowings and genuflections terminates jby the host and guest entering the house together at the sitting aart raent another ceremony takes place equally protracted and irksome the i poinfto be determined is where each i shall sit and who shall be seated first etiquette extends even to a decision on the size of a chair by which invariably the rank or importance of a guest determined the host now motions toa large chair and attempts to take a smaller one himself good breeding compels the guest in turn to refuse this compliment and after a wearying contest of politeness the point is amicably adjusted to the satisfaction of the belligerents either by both parties sitting down simultaneously on the same beuch or upon two chairs of equal dimensions the fatigue of this courtesy may be easily conceived as the same routine is performed on the arrival of each guest as soon as the guests are assembled tea is banded round in covered cups which are placed in silver stands in the torn of a boat these are fluted and beautifully chased the cups on the occasion to which i refer were of that antique porcelain so exceedingly valued which is as thin as ppe pure white perfectly transparent and is ornamented with obscure figures whose dark outlines are only perceptible when the vessel is filled with tea the mode of making tea in china is similar to that in which coffee is made in turkey the tea is pot into a cup boiling water poured over rt nod instantly covered to prevent the escape of the aroma with a lid which is used as a spoon in sip the tea they never ase sugar or milk with tea in chinadatfin umvernhf
