from the true wesleyan civil government most of the presidents of the united states who have held this office since the adoption of the constitution have been slaveholders can lie be a just man who deliberately puts his hand into his neighbors pocket and takes from him the avails ot his labor and thrusts his hand through the pocket to the man and makes the body goods and chattels and still like the horseleech crying give give lie forces his greedy hand through the body to the soul and claims its original powers and likewise the work of the spirit ot god upon that soul as wrought especially for his benefit in the market where he sells him is such a man just if found on the coast of africa doing such things he would be regarded as a pirate and dealt with accordingly tut let him ohange his location a few degrees of latitude and longitude and heis nominated for the office ot president if popular and the church v l auctioneer and vote tor such a man and endorse his injustice and trample on the authority of the word ot cod it ia as much the duty ot ihe hrislian to vote right as it is to pray right far lie that turneth away ins ear turn healing the law even his prayer shall he an abomination now every professor of religion who votes well undersfands this that the law by which a ruler is secured in this country is by the suffrages of the people and hence when he does not vote for what he prays in relation to the administration of the government he turneth away lii ear from heating the law and his prayer is an abomination before god it is not an uncommon thing to hear professors oi religion of a certain character pray that we may be favored with just ru lersmen w ho shall fear god and work righteousness men who shall exert their influence to break the yoke of the oppressed and let them go free and who will also oppose war and cultivate h spirit of peace with ali nations who will carry out also the great design of government in securing to all classes of men their inalienable lights cand then go directly to the ballot box and vote himself a very inconsistent member of the church of christ it this is not an abominable prayer what ia no man who robs his feilowuuio of his earnings cun be a iut man slaveholders do this very tiling and therefore are unjust men the timeserving not christservingj member ot the church exalts the unjust man to office and therefore shows ins want ol faith in the word of god and perhaps in the next conference meeting complains of the alarming increase of infidelity it js a fact so well established that the american church as a whole does not require as a condition on which her voles shall be given that the candidate should be a just man that to deny it would be to deny tlie fact that we have now a slaveholding president made so by the votes of the professing christians in common with ihe votes ol slaveholders jusi jj arid holy j um church which lend ai l to tlo spoiler thine every ruler who takes the oath of office under the general government of the united states appeals to god for help to carry mlo effect tho constitution and laws of the united states ho that ruleth over men must be just ruling in the fear of iod the constitution of the united states doe or docs not sustain this goddis honoring womanwhipping heatlien niaking system of slavery if it does then the luler swears to defeud this vile hoanuation and asks god to help him hat an insult to hun who i opposed all wrongwho is pledged to dor lkt and does right continually if constitution does not aim at the protection tf uiia ungodly system hut the north star aims at the protection of the rights of man and if hose rulers know that the rights of any man are unjustly unconstitutionally wrested from him and do not exert themselves to remove such wrong and defend the constitution they are guilty of perjury that man who does not regard his oath is not the man who fears god and is not the man he will approve of the government is not administered agreeably with the letter or the spirit of the constitution on the question of slavery and hence it is clear that the rulers do not rule in the fear of god both the letter and spirit of it is against oppression and yet there are millions of degraded downtrodden slaves in the land why is tins does the church consider it the design of government to take aw ay liberty from every sixth person in the land if not why does she not demand the overthrow of this system of oppression the people who adopted the constitutionsay in the preamble we the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defence promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america there is not even a hint that slavery is an object to be defended but it is emphatically asserted that liberty is to be secured to us and our posterity but leaving the slave states out of the question why does slavery exist in the district of columbia i answer because the presidents have not defended the constitution as they have sworn to do in their solemn appeal to the god of nations who says thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain in art sth ol the amendments it reads no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law the president of the united states knows that the only ground on w hich he claims the right to property in man and ground on which liberty is wrested from hundreds in the district of columbia is this their mothers were slaves and they are deprived ol liberty without due process of law which is defined in article th of amendments which says in suits at common law where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars the right of trial by jury shall be preserved and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the united states than according to the rules of common jaw what does a slaveholding president care about common law for the slave or what does he care for his oath on these articles he is in office and the church has helped him in and now says by its silence as the high priests did to judas see thou to that j ins is her present position m relation to the existing slaverydefending administration it is easily understood from the word oi god w hat position she should occupy as the representative of jesus christ repent of infidelity and treachery to his cause and to his sufieting poor who are crying for liberty she should be penitent she should rebuke that spirit which divorces morality from politics and help to elect such men only as will rule in the leur of god this she has not done and consequently is guilty of corrupting government by her influence she should rebuke ali iniquity she should unite her influence with the faithful in christ jesus who contend for the rights of man universally and demund a just administration of government by voting right and pray to the great head of the church to assist the few who are establishing the law of god and not making it void and thus make the church what she should be the light of the world as christ requires j m h dow slaveholding humanity tuitmng loose an instance of slaveholding humanity and honor has recently came to our knowledge winch is so characteristic of the slave system and the slaveholding spirit that we will narrate ita colored woman named sarah cromwell nearly ninety years old arrived in this city a few weeks since in the baltimore cars under the following circumstances she was raised and had always lived as a slave in baltimore and for many years had been owned by a master whom she had nursed in infancy and tended through sickness and health until driven by his own hand from his home a few months since she met with an accident which disabled her somewhat for active labor iand depreciated her value as a piece property finding she was likely to become an expense to him her master sent her to wilsons slave prison for sale ordering the trader to get rid of her to any body and at any juice out purchaser could he found to take her while she was there two intelligent gentlemen from chester county visited the prison gentlemen said the slave after a few moment upon his business heres a chance for your l philanthropy then stating the fact in the case and adding that the old woman w as unsaleable and worthleaa andi a disgrace to establishment be proposed that if the would take her to pciuisylvajii they might and he would pay her fare old womjl n lh lru slave driver tone come out here sho out withered and tottering with age an object to move the rtvtur cntiul pity of every feeling heart herc pealed i mb proposal to her and asked her if she would go to founsylvama i right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father alu and all we are brethren no was hernndignant reply and ker eves flashed fire as she spoke i told master that lie had worn all the flesh off my bones and he should not throw the worthless bones upon any other hands i was worn out ia taking care of him and he shall not turn me off to die with strangers but poor woman she was a slave and her will was powerless a few days later the heartless soultrader by order of the more inhuman master took sarah cruinwell to the cars paid her faro to philadelphia gave bonds to the railroad company to save them from liability put two dollars and fifty cents into her hand and sent her to philadelphia threatening vengeance on her if ever returnebind telling her that the damned quakers would take care of her p mfln and drcred she was turned omnowtless friendless and almost pennyless into a strange city here she fortunately found that the world was not all peopled by demons or monsters generous hearts and kind hands rich in benevolence though poor in the worlds wealth gave her a home wbere she now is these facts are fully confirmed by other testimony than her own from most reliable witnesses we have no words to speak the loathing and shame which such a deed perpetrated by a human being excites within us such is american slavery such is the spirit and feeling which it breeds pa freeman a slaves argument we copy from the august number o sartains magazine a passage from r tale of the revolution by a mr vvilej of north carolina which has been denounced from mason and dixons lint to the gulf of mexico as an abolitiot document of the worst sort oui readers will remember some allusion made trom southern papers in relatiot to it wild bill is a fugitive slave meets n young couple in the woods when the tale proceeds thus it i well worth reading to learn how palpa hie a pumpkin lantern will pass those fireeaters for the foul fiend himself breathing forth smoke and flames the wild man was at first sight ar ordinary looking negro whose face though not entirely black denoted unmixed blood and whose features hac on expression more intellectual thar ferocious an old hunter however would instantly have known him to be c man of the woods tor his skin had thai reddishbrown rusty hue which constant exposure to the weather produces and there was about his look and gait an undt finable air that showed an untamed and untameable nature he was rather low in stature but stoutly formed with greath depth and breadth ol chest and a naked arm ofimmense size and almost ns hard as ivory iou gaze hard at me continued he addressing himself to walter but its natural for ive no doubt youve heard a great deal about me whats the last news news about what asked walter about mewild bill have i done anything lately you ought to know better than i answered walter you know when and how ou committed a most brutal and barbarous murder lately i dont know to which one you allude said the negro ive done so much of that latelythat i hardly know the names of all the cases you seem to make yourself merry at the recollection of it replied walter setpping back and slightly raising his gun come young man dont disturb yourself remarked wild bill i understand you and you may as well put dow n your gun would you shoot me kill me in cold blood i will not kill you if youll surrender said walter and let me deliver you up to justice to justice exclaimed the negro his wild laugh startling his listeners you deliver me up to justice do you know what justice is dont you know it is the will of the strong the instrument by which the great folks oppress and rob and break down the poor and weak bah justice cried he with a scornful look and tone how i hate to hear a canting hypocrite use that word i know it is often misapplied said walter but that is no reason why a murderer and a robber should not be banged and who will hang him asked the negro the liars thieves and murderers who rob mankind of their rights and make laws to sanctify their crimes young man my hands are rough aqi hard but there is no smell of innocent blood upon them my skin is dark and ugly but rny soul is whiter than that of the whitest judge who sits upon the bench what have i done what is my crime that i must bean outcast and an outlaw hunted from swamp to swamp with a whole nation for my enemies and not a human soul to speak to me in the language of friendship what have you done exclaimed walter why

the guii of a single murder or robbery lie heavy on my soullcried bill then you are greatly belied sak walter and so is he they call the devil r replied wild bill mankind are fond of laying ail their sins on some hated scapegoat young man you know little of this world and wfien you come to know it your honest heart will sicken here am i an unoffending lonely creature jiving on wild fruits sad the beasts of the forest molesting no one taking no part in the affairs ol men and desiring to live only in the wildwoods a free inan and yet for that very reason my uame has become a bugbear to frighteu children and old ujyues and a thousand weapons aim erafrny heart and who are myen emies who are my judges where are the red men who once roamed these woods in freedom swept away root and branch by those who are after me with the vengeance of the law these woods and rivers and towns and swamps and fields belonged to another race a race that never visited foreign lands and never carried civilization and death to foreign nations but the pale faces and their red laws came here and where now are the poor savages whom the christians came to bless their bones are strewn with the dead logs of the forest and the swamp and their souls are all gone to the indians heaven and what did they get for their hunting grounds here the sword and the bayooct the justice of the while man there is some truth in that said walter coloring ive often thought of the injustice done the indian and sometimes fancy that from their blood wilt spring avengers to curse tbe land which has been so freely watered by it mand win not the wrongs of another colored race call for vengeance also asked the negro is the indian who died on his native hills to be pitied and no tear shed for the poor african who j is torn from his home his wife children and kindred and dragged in chains i like a condemned criminal beyond the sen to be beaten and driven like the brutes who is god where is hei continued the negro his nostrils dila i ting and his chest heaving does he not sit in heaven and mark the unexpressed wailings the inward prayfirs and the heart sickness of those thousands of thinking rational and immortal souls whom the white men drive and beut as they do their oxen and horses do you know that the negro aswell as the white man has an undying spirit that looks to heaven and that it will meet its masters as an equal at the bar of god master god only is my master our english ancestors did all this replied walter and my people and iare not responsible for it slavery is now a condition of society and it cant be helped in fact the negroes arc better off than they would be if they were all set free i am better off free and w oe be to the man that attempts to take me returned wild bill your master has a right to you and would be justified in killing you if you would not surrender answered walter my master cried the negro young man who is your master no man answered walter not even the king asked the ne gro yes that he is he is my sovereign and i owe him allegiance and aint there a talk of throwing off this allegiance the people complain of his ministers replied vv alter and do they not complain of opj pression and tyranny asked wild bill they do and they do it justly answered walter and if the people were to unite to throw off the royal yoke and have a government of their own wouldnt you join them that i would now sir can you blame my peo pie if they wish to throw off the yoke of their roasters i the case is altogether different said walter in the first place they couldnt do it and therefore it would be useless bloodshed in the second place we are two distinct nation living in the same country and one or the other must be masters of it the americans only wish to dissolve their connexion with a distant country youi wish to destroy a nation w e are fort your own good and ours obliged to keep vou in bondage for the present j and we are justified by ifie laws of god and man ive no doubt that some day j our people will do the best they an fertile negroes and try to set them free when they can do so consistently with the safety of the whites aad the welfare of the blacks but if you excite an insurrection you will be guilty of the horrible crimes by civil war and you will rivet the chains of your race for a century longer i believe all or nearly all the white people feel deeply the responsibility rwtmg on ihem and are truly sorry for the condi uon of the negroes they are bis best friends i mean the master those white scampe with week hearts wid j forked tongues who go about prating of the horrors of slavery and trying to cause rebellions are the worst cue miee of the human race they are eeekj ins their own tndividuai mtereeu andj care no more for the blacks them they j do for the whites and would sacrifice both to gain their ends ai have nothing to do wuh them ji mid the aeg re i was only talking of our right to rebel iyou have no right to rebel unless you have reasonable hopes of success replied walter and ifyou rebel where j there is no possible chance for you you are a wholesale assassin a pirate and as such will be judged both by god and man you argue your aide well said f wild bill smiling i did not think to find an unpractised youth so c xpert f with tha weapons of logic i can rrturn your compliment replied walter looking curiously at tbe negro ive been surprised to hear such language from from a negro exclaimed wild bill with an equivocal laugh i know very well what you mean and you need pot apologise my people were the i lowest barbarians in africa they have f been slaves here and are i know it well vastly inferior to the whites it j is the mode of life that has caused this we are ail one peoplechildren of a common father my mother was a pet slave and tolerably well educated i was thought to be smart when a boy and my mother and my young master took great pains in teaching me to read may god rest their souls in heaven your young master cried walter i thought you had no master i was living in the past just then the good old times that are past were before me but as i was going to say was carefully instructed until i was twenty i read when young all tbe books of my masters son and ive been for years past a reader of nature and a thinker i can read and write too and would you believe mei write verses and set them to music you smile my little friend continued the negro turning to utopia it seems strange to you that the bloody wild bill should be a musician folks when i am dead and gone will tell long and terrible stories about methey will tremble at the very mention of my name and yet as my master god can witness my heart yearns with the feelings the hopes the fears and the sentiments that burn in the bosom of this innocent girl im a great ugly looking monster aint i utopia i dont know sir said the girl blushing smiling and banging her head i know i look so continued wild bill but both of you shut your eyes and listen to my song and see if it sounds like that of a robber the negro insisted on walters obeying his wish just to see what opinion he would form of him from the mere sound of his voice and the lad amused at ttw request covered his ace with his hands as did also utopia while both listened with eager curi osity they were not long in suspense nor could they realize that they were in the presence of a wild man f the wqpds as with a voice full of feeling and pathos and to an air plaintive and tender he sang words which though simple and even rude embodied like all negro songs a wild and melancholy tradition and breathed on that account a sentiment homely but touching and sad what they think of u south from the fjirfielj yviuaaboro s c herau frederick douglass this notorious scoundrel who ran away from his master and sought retuge the abolitionists of the north on a recent occasion delivered an address at an abolition gathering in new york and took occasion to depict the wantonness and inhuman conduct of these fanatics toward bis belubbed bredren in the following style we are says douglass not only a proscribed peoplean insulted people but an outraged peopleweighed down under greater oppression than any other people everywhere we are treated as a degraded people if we goto church we are despised there and made to take an obscure place though the preacher talks of ail men being made of one blood in the state we are taxed equally with all other men we pay for the education of the whites but regarded so mean and degraded that by slate enactment we are not trusted even to carry a mail bag twenty yards across the street or even to lift it offfrom the top of a stage coach an ignorant irishman however but just come to this country and totally unacquainted with our institutions is the moment he lands on our shores thought fit to be entrusted with tbe mail bags we are never tried by our peers but by onr enemies on steamboats in hotels or in the streets weare alwaya reminded that we are a degraded people our children are driven away from tbe school which we pay to support we are compelled to be by potent circumstances hewers of wood and drawers of waterevery where outraged illtreated insulted thus southern bondmen who have been induced to forsake their masters and benefactors to seek freedom with penury and want and even starvation

free them that they uiav make their misery complete by driving them from every species ot employment and force them to seek the level of the brute the southern planter is the friend of the black and the true benefactor of his progeny antislavery peeling in vir ginia j the richmond southernerholds the following language in relation to public sentiment in virginia on the subject of slavery it is not generally known yet if is nevertheless true that twothirds of the people of virginia are open and undisguised advocates of ridding the state of slavery and after the year when the census is taken their views will be embodied in such a form as to startle the south we speak understanding we have within the lat two years conversed with more than slaveholders in the state and out of the expressed themselves ready to unite on any general plan to abolish slavery upon almost any terms abolition fanaticism at the north has not produced this but the annexation of texas and the acquisition of territory have done it virginia may be putdown as no longer reliable on this question when she goes the district of columbia is free territory then delaj ware and maryland will also go and north carolina and kentucky will follow suit this will surround the extreme south with free states and when that day comesand it will not be very longwe would just as soon ow n a parcel of wild turkeys as so many slaves i have conversed with several intelligent virginians upon the policy of slavery in their own state and they concur in the opinion that the system is an incubus upon its energies they all recognize the fact that in order to j secure prosperity labor must be made honorable and that while slavery exists it cannot become so to any considerable extent i most sincerely believe that could virginia awake tomorrow and find that every negro had left the state her hallelujah would drown the shout iof the slaves made free with her glorious climate her inexhaustible re j gions of coal her extensive water povvl er her productive soil and her size and position among her sister states virginia free from a system which if ever to her advantage is now worse than useless would spring

and become as great in name as she is innative resources and territorial extent south carolinathe curse of slavery the present condition of south carolina is the legitimate result of devotion to the slavery system carried out to its ultimate result such a devotiou it persisted in will craze any man or any set of men we would direct the attentioh of all other slave states to the condition of south carolina as presenting a spectacle which they insy present hereafter unless they are extremely careful mr i calhoun is one of the most gifted rnen of the day his mind is masterly and yet he has swindled himself out of his power to influence the nation by surrendering himself as an abject slave to the advocacy ol slavery so too ol his state she has lost her influence m the councils of the nation because she views everything through the distorting medium of slavery the peculiar institution is all that the people of that state exhibit any regard for no on of the sciences none of the arts nothing in philosophy or in manufactures no great discovery or important invention is suffered for a moment to distract tbeir attention from slavery it is the only thing they live forit is the only thing they would die forit is the only thing which would render paradise itself attractive to them such a monomania is fearful it is one of the most wretchedly humiltating spectacles recorded ini history no enemy of south carolina could wish her a more bitter punishment than that which the system of slavery has inflicted on her if men will ding to a atupenduous outrage and of wrong they cannot expect to escape the retribution which everlasting justice exacts let kentucky and the other stave states be warned by the condition of south carolina to escape the miserable kit she is now consigned

your note of yesterday u before me the nurftber of colored people new bedford ie ebout twelve hundred no distinction i made in rot of our schools on account of color the number of colored persons in new bedford in proportion to the whole popula non is supposed to be larger than in any other town or city in the free statea our colored children have alwaye attended our public schools they are to be found today in every school in the city several have passed through the whole course at the high school the colored children would not attend any school etabhsbed exclusively for them about years ago a proposition was made to establish in this town a school exclusively for the colored children the town was then divided into sehool dietnete an approbation was made by the own for the porpuaethe purpose was dir tmcily slated in the voice i was then a member of the school com miitee and was i think chairman of a subcommittee appointed to carry the vote mu effect before moving in the matter i requested and obtained leave to ask legal alvice upon this question can a colored tehild be ex eluded from a school kept in the district ir which it resides on the ground that there u established by the town a school for all the colored chidren to attend t thir question i submitted to the hen charles h warren them a resident in new bedford he gave me his opinion in writing and hit answer was a decided negative the opinion was an elaborate one and can no doubt now be found on the file of the ehkl committee nothing fuither was done by the echool committee no school for colored children was established the decision of judge warren was acquiesced in at tb next annual meeting without a disaentiig vote and the subject has never been named either in town meeting or citv council since thus have the colored children always enjoyed the advantages of our public school as fully as the white i waa fifteen years on the school committee and could never discover that any disadvantage resulted from the admission ol the colored children it waa never made a matter of complaint either by teachers parents or guardians ah are and ever have been satisfied and no schools in our commonwealth stand higher than ours thus it lias been determined by an experi rneut in a community having a very largt pot ion ot coloiod children that a course ol action with regard to their attendance ai school in accordance with the letter and spirit of our constitution and laws result in no disadvantage to the white children the same course i now pursued at nan tucket there after a long struggle the old prejudice gave way the rights of the colored children equality before ihe law were re cognutd and the distinction which had for iany years been made was done away my own opinions and feelings upon the whole subj ct are shown by the foregoing here it would make no difference whether the teacher was black or white not a colored clniii would attend a public school established exclusively for them i cannot uf course judge of the effect in your city of the plan you propose but it appears to me that the evils winch now trouble you and which are demanding the attention of your school board are of a character not o be remedied by changing the complexion of the teacher but you asked me tor ftfcta not opinions have given you such as seetn to have t bearing upon the question very truly yours james b

endeavor to make the whol affair a burlesque but a there was evtdantl some object to be gamed the report is fat enough to show in spite of the tnterjectior al ah yah of the reporter and the o cusionul introduction of sambo that th meetings were characterised by good orde and ability in very favorable cootraat wit the meetings of the heralds partteula friends th of tammany hall the following ujf resolution pa srd or friday evening resolved that in ihe opinion of thu meeting it is the solemn duty of the tn oi twelve hundred colored voters in the city and county of new york to exercise the right which they poaeese sod to vindicate the same at each aoff every elect on resolved thu it ia expedient for ua t at the present tune to identify ourselves with either of ib great political parties only no far as they will promote the interests of free dom resolved that it is the duty of every lovet of his country and well wisher of his race to support such men at the romiog election as are pledged to the principles of freesoil free labor free speech and free men this resolution led to lengthened discussion some maintaining that there were no such men to auppott while others held that theie were resolved that the doctrine set foith in the creed of democracyat tammany hall on the th of october is unworthy of the name of democracy and meet our universal disapprobation resolved that the candidates nominated by the coalition of the democrats and free solersare unworthy tha confidence of a free people and ought to be defeated at the com ng election and that we will use our utmost nflnence to effect the tame the tendency here ia evidently wbiggish but then we cant expect the colored people to be better and more intelligent than their neighbors however the resolutions were not passed without considerable oppasition on the second evening the following were adopted resolved that we reiterate the sentiments and endorse the doctrine set forth in the resolutions adopted at our last meeting on friday evening and wo wi do all ia our power to carrv them into effect resolved that the times call for the laying aside of our party predilection and for the colored voter to tell the political parties that we will favor such of them as will do most for our causethe cause of freedom of justice and of right resolved that the best front at present i presented by the two great political parties is that of the whigs which w hilst it is noti all that we wish yet we will assist and cause our political strength to be felthopm that othera may be induced to outstrip them in the race of freedom in acknowledging the oppieased americans rights antislavery standard the north star rochester november the destiny of colored americans it is impossible to settle by the light uf the present and by he experience of the past any thing definitely and absolutely as to the future condition of the colored people of this country but so far as present indications de j terinine it is clear that this land must continue to be the home of the colored man so longas it remains the abode of civilization and religion for more than two hundred years we have been identified with its soil its products and its institutions under the sternest and bttercst circumstances of slavery and op pressionunder the lash of slavery at the southunder the sling of prejudice and malice at the northand under hardships the most unfavorable to existence and population we have lived and continue to live and increase the persecuted red man of the forest the original owner of the soil has step by step retreated from the atlantic lakes and rivers escaping as it were before the footsteps of the white man and gradually disappearing from the face of the country he looks upon the steamboats the railroads and canals cutting and crossing hia former bunting grounds and upon the ploughshare throwing up the bones of his venerable ancestors and beholds his glory departingand his heart sickens at the desolation he spurns the civilization he hates the race w hich has despoiled him and unable to measure arms with his superior foe he dies not so with the black man more unlike the european in form feature and colorcal led to endure greater hardships injuries and insults than those to which the indians have been subjected lie yet lives and prospers under every disadvantage long have his enemies sought to expatriate him and to teach his children that this is not their home butin spite of all their cunning schemes and subtle contrivances hia foolprints yet mark the soil of his birth and he gives every indication that america will for ever remain the home ol his posterity we deem it a settled point that the destiny of the colored roan is bound up with that of the white people of this country be the destiny of the latter what it may it is idleworse than idle ever to think of our expatriation or removal the history of the colonization society must extinguish all such speculations we are rapidly filling up the number of four millions and ail the gold of california combined would be insufficient to defray the expenses attending our colonization we ate as laborers essential to the interests of our white fellowcountrymen to make a very grand effort to drive us fiora this country among probable events while labor is needed the laborer cannot fail to be valued and although passion and prejudice may sometimes vociferate against us and demand our expulsion such efforts will only be spasmodic and can never prevail against the sober second thought of selfinterest we are here and here we are likely to be to imagine that we shall ever be eradicated is absurd and ridiculous we can be remodified changed and assimilated but never extinguished we repeat therefore that wt are here and that ibis is our country and the question lor the philosophers and statesmen of the land ought to be what principles should dictate the policy of the action towards us we shall neither die out nor bo driven out but shall go with this people either as a testimony against themor as an evidenco in their favor through out their generations we are clearly on their hands and must remain there for ever i all thia we say for the benefit of those who lute the negro more than they love then t country in an article under the caption of government aod us subjects published i in our last weeks paper

beasts of harden whst a loss to industry skill intention to say nothing of ita foul and corrspting influence is slavery how it ties the hand ctamps the mind darkens the understanding and paralyses the whole man nothing is more evident to s man who reasons at all than that america is acting an irrational part in continuing the slave system at the south aid in oppressing its free colored citizens at the north regarding the nation as an individual the act of enslaving and oppressing thus is as wild and senseless as it would be for nicholas to order the amputation of the right arm of every russian soldier before engaging in a war withfrance we again repeat that slavery ia the peculiar weakness of america as well as ita peculiar crime and the day may yet come when this visionary and oft repeated declaration will be found to contain great truthr d the north star fair at philadelphia a letter from a lady connected with the committee of the fair informs us that the committee have experienced serious difficulty in securing a suitable room in which to hold ihe fair until the last few days they were relying on the promise of the proprietor of the assembly building but this gentleman on learning that the fair was to be conducted by colored ladies has refused to let his rooms for that purpose when he made the promise be supposed that the parties who were to occupy them were white personsand he now excuses his failure to fulfil his contract on that ground this is but another illustration of the persecuting spirit that every where prevails in this land against the colored people and is also anothei reason in favor of holding the contemplated fair the ladies were informed by thisgentleman of his word that if they could assure him that the fair wa to be under the management of white persons the rooms were at their service how unspeakably mean and disgraceful is this requirement colored persons it seems then are not even to be encouraged in laboring for their own elevation and for the freedom of their own brothers and sisters unless their efforts aie under the management of white persons this is a new feature in the numlestation of the prejudice and hatred with which we have been so long and painfully regarded but let not our listers be disheartened by this shameful and fraudulent treatment let them rather put forth greater exertion and evince a more determined spirit in the holy cause in which they are embarked the opposition with which they meet should only tend to quicken their energies and to double their diligence the greater the obstacles with which they have to contend the greater will be the victory when it is gained our transatlantic friends will see in this new form of cruelty and injustice a good reason for holding up the hands of that class

have held some antislavery meetings in the a m e church here bui we are reliably informed that we can bold no more because we attseked the proslavery character of tbe church and told them that they

delicacies the young ladies and gentlemen and those more advanced in years seemed as if striving w ho should be the most useful and although the slanderous tongue oi negro hateis was vociferous in the

on the subject of gold the plain truth is this there is a plenty of that precious metal in the bowels of the earth in this regionthis is beyond dispute but that it is found in such large quantities

that we consider he restriction of slavery toits present limits and ns abolition where congress has the power as the great paramount and vital question of the times to which all other considerations of state or national policy ail questions of commerce or finance must yield when they come in competition resolved that considering the novel manner in which the territory of california has been

its character to the jeffersonian ordinance of which shall underlie all state constitutions and state laws and which shall forever take it out of the power of the stales which may hereafter bo formed

giving to this state an organ she loudly calls tor one and one she can have if our people can be fully awakened to their best interests granting sir all you have said to be correct respecting our communities to ensure success to the ptess i ask in the name of him who sways the destinies of all men both noble and ignoble if the day has not arrived for us to rise en masse and acquaint the ohioans in power that we are a people in mild terms but in terms that cannot be mistaken that weare deprived of those godgiven rights that justly belong to the whole race of mankind jat this very time i may safely say the powers of the si ne are being convulsed ina civil revolution having voted this very fall for a convention to alter her constitution are not these without suggesting others sufficient reasons for us to establish a press which will give us better opportunities as a people oppressed and deprived of our rights to urge the necessity of being fully and honorably repiesented in that body or when and at what period shall we make the effort yet in contemplating the whole matter i deeply feel that there is a certain amount ofj inertness among our people that will continue to exis unless some w illinghearted men will come boldly up to the work and sacrifice some j thing in our just and laudable cause and the same feeling will continue to exist if we do i as we have done in former days wail until those who oppress us shake the burden from our shoulders but here i mjst say that it behoves thoe w ho are patriotic among africs j sons in ohio to will an organ into existence an organ of their own they can have it and why should they have it because asj you have truthfully said that a very large poition of our inhabitants have come from the south both ignorant superstitious c and the establishment of a well conducted organ for this state will in its very nature arouse the sleeping energies of our people to a higher sense ot duty you say sir that there are already two or more newspapers published in this country of this fact lam aware the christian herald of your city pittsburgh which is purely a church organ and will not deviate from that course

the mot glorious that of the i slaves et fully acknowledging the capacity of the editor of the star for his duty i do not wish here to be taking dictatorial grounds w hen i give it as my opinion that the star ia not effecting that amount of good in and among ohioans that we might derive fiom a sectional organ all and every organ that we have in this cause that is the cause of the slave and nominally free you will find east of the mountains which are conducted by colored men and admitting the faci that the star is now founded upon a basis more firm than ever was any other newspaper under the immediate control and supervision of colored menthe establishment of a paper west would not affect in the least as i think the interest of the star for give it as my opinion that every subscriber

fixed by their pursuits their family connection and local interests as permanent inhabitant of tht metropolis agreed one day when thej were drinking their wine at the stai and garter at richmond to insiitutt an annual dinner atnoog themselves under the following regulationstha they should dine alternately at eacl other houses on the first and last daj of the year that the first bottle o wine uncorked at tbe first dinaershouk be recorked and put away to be dranl by him who should be tbe last of theii number that they never should admi a new member that when one diet eleven were to meet and so on ant that when only one remained he should on these two days dine by himself anc sit the usual hours at his solitary table but the first time he so dined alone leal it should he the only one he should thr uncork the first bottle and in tbe firsi glass drink to the memory of all whe were gone there was something original and whimsical in the idea and it was eagerly embraced they were all iu their prime of life closely attached by reciprocal friendship fond of social enjoyments and looked forward to theii future meetings with unalloyed feeling of pleasure the only thought indeed that could have darkened those anticipations was one not likely to intrude itself at that moment viz that of the hapless wight who was destined to uncork the first bottle and drink the last glass at his lonely repast it was high summer when this frolic compact was entered into and as theii pleasure yacht skimmed along the dark bosom of the thames on their return to london they talked of nothing but their first and last fea f s of ensuing years their imagination ran riot witha thousand gay predictions of festive merriment they wantoned in conjectures of what changes time would create as for you george exclaimed one of the twelve addressing his bro therinlaw i expect i shall see you as dry withered and broken as an old eel skin the mere outside of a man and he accompanied the words with a heavy slap on the shoulder george fortesque was leaning carelessly over the side of the yacht laughing the loudest of any at the conversation which had been carried onthe sudden manual salutation of his bro therinlaw threw him off his balance and in a moment lie was overboard they heard the heavy splash of his fall before they coula be said to have seen him go the yacht was proceeding swiftly along but was instantly stopped tne utmost consternation now prevailed it was nearly dark but fortes que was known to be an excellent swimmer and startling as the accident wathey felt certain he would regain the vessel they could not see him they listened in fear an answer was returned but in a faint gurgling voice and the exclamation oil god struck upon their ears in an instant two or three who were expert swimmers plunged into the water and swam towards the sjot whence the exclamation had proceeded one of them was within an arms length of fortesque he saw him but before he could be reached he went down and his distracted friend beheld the eddying circles oi the wave just over tiie spot where henad sunk he dived after him and touched the bottom but the tide must have drifted the body onward for it could not be found they proceeded to one of the nearest stations where drags were kept and having procured the necessary apparatus repaired to the fatal spot after the lapse of above an hour they succeeded in raising the lifeless body of their lost friend ah the usual remedies were employed for restoring suspended animation but in vain they now pursued the remainder of their course towards london in mournful silence with the corpse ofhim liwo had commenced the day of pleasure with them in the fulness of health of spirits and of lile and in their severe grief they could not but reflect how soon one of the joyous twelve had slipped out of this little festive circle the months rolled on and cold december came withal its cheering round of kindly greetings and merry hospitalities and with it came a softened recollection of the fate of poor fortesque eleven of the twelve assembled on the last day of the year and it was impossible not to feel their loss as they sat down to dinner the very irregularity of the tablefive on the one side andi on the otherforced the melancholy event upon their rememberance a decorous sigh or two a low becoming ejaculation and an instructive observation upon the uncertainty of life made up tne sum of tender posthumous offerings to the name of poor george fortascue as they proceeded to discharge the more important duties for which they had met b the time the third glass of champaigne had gone round iu addition to the potation of fine old hock and capital madeira they had ceased to discover anything so very pathetic in the inequality of the two sides of the table or to very melancholy in their crippled number of eleven several years had elapsed our eleven friends kept up their double anniversaries as they might aptly enough be called with scarcely any perceptible change but alasthere came one dinner at last which was darkened by a calamity they never expected to witness for on that day their friend com panionbrother almostwas banged yes stephen rowland the wit the oracle the life of their circle had on the morning of that day forfeited his i life upon the public scaffold for having made a single stroke of his pen in awrong place in other words bill of exchange which passed into his hands for passed out of his bands for  it would be injustice to the ten to say that even wine fiiendsbip and a merry season could quit dispel tbe gloom which pervadad this dinner it was agreed beforehand that they should not allude to tht distressing and meiaa eleven choir theme and having thus interdicted the ottly thing which really occupied all their thought the natural consequence waa that silent contem fdation took the place of dismal discourse and they separated long before midnight some fifteen years had now glided away since the fate of rowland and the ten remained but the stealing hand of time had written sundry change inmost legible characters raven locki had begrtuied some of their heads had

conversation grew lest boisterous and it turned chiefly on politics and the state of the funds or the ealut of landed property apologies were made for coming in thick shoes and warm stockings the doors and windows were most carefully provided with lial sod sand bags the fire was more in request and a quiet game of whiat filled up the hours that were wont to be devoted to drinking singing and riotous merriment three rubbers a cup ol c ffee and at home by oclock was the uual cry when the fifth or sixth glass had gone round after the removal of the cloth at parting too there was a long ceremony in the hall buttoning great coats tying on woolen comforters fixing silk hankerchiefs over the mouth and up to the ears and grasping sturdy canes to support unsteady feet their fiftieth anniversary came and death had indeed been busy four little old men of withered appearance and decrepit walk with cracked voices and dim rayle eyes sat down by the mercy of heaven as they themselves tremulously declared to ciebrate foi the fiftieth time the first day of the year to observe the frolic compact which half a century ago they had entered into at the star and garter at richmond eight were in their graves the four that remained stood upon its confines yet they chirped cheerfully over their glass though they could scarcely carry it to their lips if more than half full and cracked their jokes though they articulated their word with difficulty and heard each othei with still greater difficulty they mumbled they chattered they laughed if a sort of strange wheezing might bt called a laugh and when the wine seni their icy blood in warmer pulses tbougl their veins they talked oi the past as il were but yesterday that had slipped b themand of the future as if it were busy century that lay before them they were just the number for c quiet rubber of whist and for three successive years they sat down to onethe fourth came and then their rubbei was played with an open dummy c fifth and whist wa no longer practicable two could play at ct ibbage ani cribbage was the game but it was little more than mockery of play theii palsied hands could hardly hold or theii faded sight distinguish the cards while their torpid faculties made them doze between each deal at length came the last dinner and the survivor of the twelve upon whose head four score and ten years had showed their snow ate his solitary meal it so chanced that it was in hia house and at his tabic they had celebrated their first in his cellar too had remained for fortyeight years the bottle they had uncorked recorked and which he was that day to uncork again it stood beside him with a feeble and reluctant grasp he took the frail memorial of a youthful vow and for a moment memory was faithful toher office she threw open her long vista of buried years and his heart travelled through them all their lusty and blithsome springtheir bright and fervid summerthe ripe and temperate autumn their chill but not too frozen winter he saw as in a mirror how one by one the laughing companions of the merry hour at richmond had dropped into eternity he felt as the loneliness of his condition lor he had eschewed marriage and a he drained a glass which he filhd to the memory of these who had gone the tears slowly trickled down the deep furrows of his aged face he had thus fulfilled one part of bis vow and he prepared himself to discharge the other by sitting the usual number of hours at his desolate table with heavy heart he resigned himself to the gloom of his own thoughts lethargic sleep stole over him his head fell upon his bosom confused images crowded into his mind he babbled by himselfw as silentand when his servant entered the room he found his master stretched upon the carpet at the foot of the easy chair out of which he had slipped in an apoplectic fit he never spoke again nor opened his eyes though the vital spark was not extinct till the following day and this was the last dinner the late thomas hood hood was a victim to the literary ailment for many years towards the close of his life he was laboring under disease habitually illdying slowly and yet he wrote on in one ol his lat publications to which he gave his name as editor hoods magazine he thus humorously pointed out the pains of the literary life in so imaginary letter from a subscriber sib by your not coming out on the furst i concluded you are lade up being notorus for enjoy in bad health pulhnary of course like my poor robert for i ve had a literary branch in my own family a periodical one like yourself only every sunday instead of once a month and a such well known what it was to be writ longwinded articles with weekly lungs poor fellow i as i often said so much beadwork and otbing bnt headwork will make a cherebbim of you au d so it did nothing but write write write and read read and as our locter says its as bsd to study till tu is bruua as to dnk till all is blew mix your cullers and werry good advice it is when it can be follered whitch is not always the case for if necessity has do lai it has a good deal of litteratnra aad authors must rite what they must as po r robert used te say about seddentory baboo ts very well says he to toll me about like mr woox i f worths single man as he grew double slicking to my chair but if theres no sitting says he therell be no hatching and if i do brood too much at my desk its because theres a brood expected from me once a week oh its very well says he to cry up with yon and fetch a walk and take s look at the daisies when youre sold your mind to jtfiffstofilia and theres a devil waiting for your last proofs as be did for tor forsters i know its killin me kays he but if i die of overwork us in shs way of my vocation poor boy i id all i could to nurridge him mock burkey soop and strong slogs and vormy jelly and island moss but he ouldnteat and no wonder for men iti labor as the docter said wears out be stummack aa well as the branes kd so hed been spinning out his in flde like a spider and a spider he pwd look at last sure enough one of ist sort with long spindle legs and only a dot of a body in the middle anauther bad thing ia sitting up all nite as my sun did but its all again nature not but what sum must and partickty the writers of politicks for the papers but they ruin the constitushun and besides even poetry is apt to get prosy after twelve or one and some late authors read very sleepy but as poor robert said what is one to do when no day is long enuff for ones work nor no mounth either and tobe sure april june and september are all short mounths ebbervery however one grate thing is relaxing if you can as the docter used to say what made jack a dull boy why being always in the workhouse and never at the playhouse so get out of your gownd and slippers says he and put on your best things and unbend yourself like a beau if youve been at your poetic flights go and look a the terns tunnel and if youre tired of being witty go and spend an hour with the wax work the mind requires a change as well as the merchants so take my advice sira mothers adviceand relax a little you want brassing a change of hair and more stummack and you ought to ware flannel and take tonicks do you ever drink basses pail its as good as cammotniie tea but above all theres one thing i recommend to you steal wine its been a saving to some in valids hoping you will excuse this liberty from a stranger but a wellmeaning one i am sir a subscriber thus could hood piay with a subject full of painful import and inculcate severe truths in quaint and humorous guise he made the eye to dance with laughter at the same time he touched the heart to its depths it was comus teaching sympathy and human kindness the laugh passed away but the stern truth remained etiza cooks journal something for farmers here is an extract of a letter written by horace of the n y tribune while attending the stale agricultural fair at syracuse i there cannot be less than two or three hundred different kinds of agricultural implements on exhibition here horse hakes cultivators straw cutters sub soil and all other plows new beehives waterwheels horsepower saws c c i consider this altogether the most important feature of the fair a great ox may be reared by a greater tool but no man whoever worked a year at farming can ever spend a day among these implements and inventions without being stimulated to think the great end of all such exhibitions is an improvement of the breed of farmersof men now the man who has been skimming over a hundred acres of land for the last twenty or thirty years plowing six inches deep manuring with his good wishes and growing fifteen or twenty bushels of corn to the acre cannot spend a day in one of these fair enclosures without being startled and shamed these subsoil plows one of which properly used would double his nsual product of corn and vegetables and in dry seasons treble it these straw cutters with one of which his scanty crop of hay might have been made with the aid of straw stalks c to winter his stock bonntilully these cultivators seed planters horse rakes and other laborsaving implements must set him thinking what sort of crops do those farmer obtain who use such implements who make the most by farmingthe fifteen or fifty bushel corngrowers wimt sort of farming leaves land in condition to sell advantageously these questions arise spontaneously in the simplest minds and they will be answered i dont believe a farmer can attend three successive fairs keeping his head unclouded by liquor and not resolve to farm better through all his jill after wards no other business could bear to be m ln f c d wretchedly as farming still is qoly think of civilized men killing their bees to get the honey in this nineteenth century after christ killing a cow to obtain her milk would be on the same principle yet to this day half the beemen smother their bees to get the honey although the landis full of simple and cheap hives on humanerand more economical principle how long shall the stupid barbarism of smothering bees continuer a horrible scene occurred at the
