conclusion an conjectures these are sir the general outlines othe political route in which i wish toj seo our friends nd enemies walk in which i wish that the press anti speech executive and chambers should guide france and europe it is the only road which has not an abyss at its termination or which conducts to a future you know it before the catastrophe which afflicted our hearts without surprising our foresight for wc did sue it prompt certain inevitable at the end of the false narrow retrograde path where blindness and error were urging on those we loved to have as guides whom we followed as the soldier should follow his chief to death but not to suicide these were our thoughts and our words alas barren thoughts and words which the breath of adulation or of intrigue never suffered to reach the cars of kings which the wind of popular passions may also carry away perchancetoday nevermind they will fall dry and cold upon the sand or upon the rock but they will not die there forever a true idea a social idea fallen from heaven on mankind never returns to the void once it has germinated in some true hearts in eome logical and healthy minds it bears in itself a something vital divine immortal which cannot entirely perish passions vile interests ignorance habit prejudices envy may crush it beneath their feet may mutilate it with the sabre or the axe its fruits are delayed for a day for a century perhaps or two providence has its hand full of centuriesand counts them not in its works but at the century marked at the fatal dayperhaps we are at it the living idea whose deeds havoa been shed abroad and multiplied by the very storm bursts forth at one moment in all minds all parties send it out again as their own all opinions own it as the bottom of their common thought foreseen or not an event happens may be an accident and the world is renewed the idea of liberty has all these characters if france would if powerg knew liote this great fact of social renovation might be worked out under our eyes nothing opposes it nothing resists it in things as in minds the hour has struck rut i till francel do powers knowhow yes franco wills hut she wills faintly her long convulsions her fifteen years repose her false position on a misunderstood and a contested fight her fear of novelties her weariness of hope her distrust of error nay of truth her industrialism enervating worship of gold her prompt infatuations and rapid disgusts her captivation with military glory her aocret favor or a despotism that flutters her with conquests that stuns her with drums her srirti of faction hatred mutual abuse wherewith she wears out her strength against herself and above all permit us to say her tittle ntwi in nigh morality the decline of faligious feeling feeling which vivifies nil others heroism of conscience without which human nature has not enough faith io itself does not sufficiently understand iu own dignity does uot puce its aims sufliciently high has not confidence and desire enough to attain them all has exhausted in us the beginning of great things that motive power of generous and hold resolution and moral basis of all free institution pvhucal virtue it is political the north starr virtue wre are deficient in and that it h which makes rnc doubt and tremble foi ourselves political virtue i knoa tiiat liberty produces it by exercising it but there must be some beforehand to sustain liberty when rome coulc i reckon but one cato cccsar was noi far distant but do the potccrt know hotel no ii they continue to seek their support in an element which is now beginning tc fail which will be found wanting still more in the future the aristocracy in the restriction and not in the expansion of political right and actionll they continue to keep their hands clenched instead of opening them wide if they will reign and not guide if they will pitch their tent for a day and force the social mind to a precarious hah in the defile at which the nineteenth cew tury has arrived and where it will be smothered unless it pass through with daring power at the head of its generations thus possibly two things are deficient at this epoch without which all theory falls to the ground all experience vanishes in aira country anda man for want of the man the political man the man complete in intelligence and virtuea man sublime and living impersonation of an age strong in the strength of his own and his epochs conviction bonaparte of speech having the instinct of social life and the lightning of the tribune as the hero has that of death and of the battlefield palpitating with faith in the future columbus of liberty capable of discovering another political world of convincing us of its existence and of leading us to it by the persuasion of his eloquence and the domination of his genius for want of such a man anarchy may be therevile hideous retrogressive dcmigoguic sanguinary yet impotent and shortlivedfor even anarchy supposes strength crime has also its party in france the scaffold has its apostles but crime can never he a political element crime is the most antisocial of human things because society is not and cannot be other than morality and virtue this party is beyond the law of the country and of civilization it is to politics what robbers arc to societythey kill but they d not reckon society has neither a necessity nor an appetite for blood it has not even to fightnothing to overturn b fore itall is made straight under its steps that imitative admiration for the men and the tvorks of terror is nothing hut the sophism which sometimes accompanies the hangman as it precedes him always itis aa after tasteof blood shed and drunk in our epoch of shame whimi some maniacs take for thirstand which is only the tigers dream for lack of political virtue in the country at the first earthquake of the powers at the first hurricane on the tempestuous sea of liberty a general clamor will arise put back give up all the way we have made take in sail the most precarious port will be good the most obscure the most ignorant soldier w ill don the cockethut and the grey coat and fancy himself a bonaparte will sabre liberty and civilization root and branch and w ill exclaim my people until they detect that the hero is only a strawstuffed effigy and until they seek another w ho wears tyranny more gracefully and dresses up slavery better this free people does not love liberty enough they always think they see the temple of glory with a hero in the doorway open to admit them and to avenge them for anew anarchy they are mistaken the hero is no more and liberty is their only asylum let us then seek after political virtue let us seek after it both for ourselves and others this period will take care to exercise it let us seek it where it is to be found in a strong conviction in a sincere faith of mankinds progressive destiny in a religious respect for our dignity as man in a severe contemplation of the divine issue that god has placed before society as before individual life this issue is himself it is the perfection of the individual and the perfection of the generic being human naturewhich ought to bring the virtuous man and society itself nearer to god the divine thought applied at length to policy is already fermenting in the young generation which presses on us that generation young strong moral religiousit is all the hope for the future saint simouisin itself is a happy symptom bold plagiarism which comes from the gospel and which ought to return there it has already rescued j some enthusiastic spirits from the vile doctrines of industrial and political materialism to open to them the indefinite horizon of moral perfection and of so  cial spirituality that is in reality the point to be gained but by the route christ has traced out which his progressive doctrine enlightens iu proportion as man advances and upon the real and solid grouud of humauity upon the respect for all rights upon the accomplishment of all duties upon the reform and not upon the destruction of the only basis which god has hitherto given to his tanuiy and to society property it may be humanity will discover one day another social principle nothing can be denied nothing affirmed of tiio unknown the horizon of humanity draws back and renews itself in proportion to tbe steps ii has made the divine word alone knows where it will lead us the gospel is full of social and yet obscure promises it unfolds itself with time but u discloses to each epoch only that part of tbr route it ought to attain saint kimonisw traces u parallel road but in the clouds it w a religion without a god it is christianity with right is of ho sexrtruth is of ho colmgod is this father of vs all and all we are brethren i out fisitb y which is the life oi it it i the gospel without the reason ant knowledge of man all that there ii in it sincere elevated or aspiring to i more perfect and more divine terrestria i order will soon perceive that it canno j walk without foundation that it nroa reach to the skies by its desires but tt i human reality by the facts end wil return to the principle which gives ai once speculative truth and practical force the indefinite hope of the perfection of civil societies and the rule the moral and the measure which alone can direct them there the principle from whence we all emanate believers or sceptics friends dr enemies is christianity its logical deduction is social perfection it is this which has made modem liberty more true than ancient liberty it m this which prepares for us again political and civil charity more true than the narrow exclusive and egotist patriotism of antiquity its reign w ill be no other than the rational epoch the reign of reason for reason is also divine a word here by this future and perfect reign of christianity do not mean that material reign of christianity that palpable and universal empire i of the catholic principle predominating in fact over all the political powers subjugating even the world to religious truth and giving also the lie to the sublime of its author my kingdom is not of this world this doctrine of religious policy realized in social forms a doctrine which some men of faith and talent are vainly rekindling today has never had the assent of my reason it is seeking in a crowned mys i ticism in a posthumous theocracy ina priestly aristocracy a principle and rule of human power which exists nowhere but in despotism or political aristocracy truth itself should not be manifested nor imposed by forms ol material domination for her agents will be always men men alter or corrupt all which they touch with the hands of man and make of the liberty of the children of god a degrading tyranny for us the only form ot manifestation and empire of religious truth is speechis liberty the only yoke of hearts and understandings is conviction that is the only empire of christian truth the only yoke we all bear with liberty and with love when the immortal trunk of christianity which renews its branches and its foliage according to necessities and periods shall have borne and multiplied its last fruits for us let us now revert to the present day and conclude you see hope and light in a distant horizon in the future of the generations which follow us uncertainty and darkness over our actual fate our immediate future meanwhile hope prevails and if each of us without regard for party opinions or desires places himself in the truth which is immediately before him seeks there his daily duty and employs his strength without calculating it the result leaves not a doubt the social world will have made an immense step and even its fall will have advanced it several ages i ain no prophet but reason prophecies an eternal law a moral law which the ancients called fatality which the christians name providence and which is nothing more than divine will enchaining consequences to principles effects to causes is working eternally for or against us according as we start from the false or the true in the private life of the individual asin the social life of empires this law shows itself incessantly by its happy or vengeful applications it requites even in this world every man according to his works according to his truth and virtue it is the shadow of divine justice that we perceive on the earth with this divine law before our eyes we can and do in reality predict everyday with a full and infallible assu rance we can then predict that if a right has been omitted or voluntarily violated in a political fact its absence or its violation will plunge the power and the country in a long and laborious ex piation that if thn power innocent itself of the political necessity from whence it springs comprehends this dictatorship of events this mission of a social destiny and entirely employs it without any selfseeking for the disinterested salvation of the country in the sincerei and broad foundation of a liberal andj rational order it will triumph over all obstacles it w ill create w hat is its evident missiou to create and will last so long as these necessary things ought to last time to finish their work itself a transition to another order of things more advanced and more perfect that if it docs not comprehend itself and if it does not profit to the benefit of liberty and humanity by the fugitive moments which are given to it if it does not ae that a long broad and straight road is open without obstacle before it and that it can carry thereby the spirits laws and facts to a point from whence they cau no more retrograde if it count itself us something if it stops or returns it will perish and several ages perhaps will perish with it that if the constitutional royalists the men of fidelity religion monarchy liberty and progress persist in setting their repugnance f niud their scruples of memory their auctions of pari ty above their rights ami duties as men and citizens that if thev ruin as they have just done from all modern political action election that if they look on without fighting at

political attitude accept let us not justify that title of conquered which skilful enemies would impose onus to give themselves the odious rights of victorythat title ttf conquered for which some of

therof even by n nundinal for twenty years without giving the slightest pledge that after the year hh the traffic should be suppressedthus it sanctioned and pledged national protection to unmitigated

institution which aggregates and involves all the wickedness which human beings can commit against oneanother or their creator all this is as clearly demonstrable as that two and two make four yet this constitution was framed and adopted by a people professing unbounded reverence for republican liberty and the natural rights of man and it continues to be suported on oath or affirmation by such a people thus far to the triumphant march extension and consolidation of slavery that it may be seen how jealously this constitution guards the irty ofi republicanism agatnst the tyranny off jdonarchy

fir the convention there were strong indication of a storm which made the friends apprehensive that the meeting would be a failure as it was to ba held in a grove there were meetinghouses and acbteu houses and a large academy all unoccupied ya the claims of humanity may not be urged in them however at the time appointed came fairweather and an audience of upwards of a hundred assembled in a beautiful grove just targe enough iost shady enough and altogether rightlast year when a similar meet tag was held only about half a dozen came together the general subjects of freedom and slavery were discussed during the day and remarks made calculated to produce a sense of individnal responsibility of selfre spect and of true independence friday morning met according to adjournment the meeting was organised zebina h small being appointed president and esekiel thatcher vice president charles steams and lucy stone secretaries a committee on finance was also appointed but the names were lost parker pillabury presented the following resolutions  resolved that our nations religion isa lie and our government a crimedeserving not the support but the execration of every friend of justice and humanity resolved that the mass of our ministers are monsters in human form boasting that they have power to abolish slavery inone single year and yet sanctifying and supporting it from year to year resolved that oui constitution is a covenant with death our union an agreement with hellbinding the people cf all the states to sustain and support the slave breeding slavetrading and slaveholding of the south resolved that such a government is treason to the majesty of heaven rebellion against the government of godand to vote under it or to hold office in it knowing its character is a crime scarcely less than blasphemy against the holy ghost resolved that the only recommendation of general taylor to the presidency is his bloodhou n d butchery of the seminole indians and his successful massacre of the mexicans at the command of slavery both of which atrocities were sternly opposed by the whig party from whence came his nomination to the highest office in the peoples gift

possessed to bethe candidate of the democratic party for the presidency of the united states resolved that james g birney was dropped by the liberty party on the ground that john p hale who was never an abo iitionst was the more available candidate and now j p hale is superseded by martin van buren an open enemy oj antislavery for the same reasonwhich shows that party as devoid of integrity and fixed principle as either of the others that the only true and righteous ground to which intelligent and honest men can come is that of entire separation from all voluntary support of the government

coveting towards the close of the meeting on saturday an effort was made to create disturbance by some young men who were trying to persuade a man said to be half crazed but who notwithstanding said many true things to interrupt and disturb the speakers and when allusion was made to the conduct of these disturbers they probably as others would not suppose themselves qd dreeaed came up around the

am address e the oils red people sf the united states fellow cocnttrnnt under a solemn sense of duty inspired by our relation to you as fellow sufferers under tbe multiplied and grievous wrongs to which we as a people are universally subjected we a portion of your brethren assembled in national convention at cleveland ohio take tbe liberty fo address you on the subject of our mutual improvement and social elevation the condition of our variety of the human family hat long been cheerless if not hopeless in this country the doctrine persever tafly proclaimed in high places is church and state that it is impossible for colored men to rise from ignorance and debasement to intelligence and respectability in ibis country has made a deep impression upon the public mind generally and is not without its effect upon us under this gloomy doctrine many of us have sunk under tbe pall of despondency and are making ao effort to relieve ourselves and have no heart to assist others it is from this despond that we would deliver you it is from this slumber we would rouse you the present is a period of activity sod hope the heavens above us are blight and much of the darkness that overshadowed os baa passed away we can deal in the language of brilliant encouragement and speak of success with certainty that our condition baa been gradually improving is evident to all and that we shall yet stand on a common platform with our fellow countrymen in respect to political and social rights is certain the spirit of the agethe voiee of inspirationthe deep longings pf the human soul the conflict of right with wrongthe upward tendency of the oppressed throughout the world abound with evidence complete and ample of the final triumph of right over wrong of freedom over slavery and equality over caste to doubt this is to forget the past and blind our eyes to the present as well as to deny and oppose the great law of progress written out by the hand of god on the human soul great changes for the better have taken place and are still taking place the last ten years have witnessed a mighty change in the estimate in which we as a people are regarded both in this and other lands england has given liberty to nearly one million and france has emancipated three hundred thousand of our brethren and our own country shakes with the agitation of our rights tenor twelve years ago an educated colored man was regarded as a curiosity and the thought of a colored man as an author editor lawyer or doctor had scarce been conceived such thank heaven is no longer the case there are now those among us whom we are not ashamed to regard as gentlemen and scholars and who are acknowledged to be such by many of the most learned and respectable in our land mountains of prejudice have been removed and truth and light are dispelling the error and darkness of ages the time was when we trembled in the presence of a white man and dared not assert or even ask for our rights but would be guided directed and governed in any way we were demanded without ever stopping to enquire whether we were right or wrong we were not only slaves but our ignoranoe made us willing slaves many of us uttered complaints against the faithful abolitionists for the broad assertion of our rights thought they went too far and were only making our condition worse this sentiment has nearly ceased to reign in the dark abodes of our hearts we begin to see our wrongs as clearly and comprehend our rights as fully and as well as our white countrymen this is a sign of progress and evidence which cannot be gainsayed it would be easy to present in this connection a glowing comparison of our past with our present condition showing that while the former was dark and dreary the present is full of light and hope it would be easy to draw a picture of our present achievements and erect upon it a glorious future but fellow countrymen it is not so much our purpose to cheer you by the progress we have already made as it is to stimulate you to still higher attainments we have done much but there is much more to be done j while wc have undoubtedly great cause to thank gud and take courage for the hopeful changes which have taken place in our condition we are not without cause to mourn over the sad condition which we yet occupy weare yet the most oppressed people in the world in the southern states of this union we are held as slaves all over that wide region our paths are marked with blood our backs are yet scarred by the lash and our souls are yet dark under the pall of slavery our sisters are sold for purposes of pollution and our brethren are sold in the market with beasts of burden shut up in the prisonhouse of bondagedenied all rights and deprived of all privileges we are blottod from the page of human existence and placed beyond the limits of human regard death moral death has palsied our souls in that quarter and we arc a murdered people in the northern stales we are not slaves to individuals aot personal slaves yet in many respects we are the slaves of the community we are however for enough removed from the actual condition of the slave to make us largely responsible for their continued en sfeve ment or their speedy deliverance from chains for in the proportion which we shall rise in i the scale of human improvement in that proportion do we augment tbe probabilities of a speedy emaneipation of our enslaved fcliow countrymen it is more than a mere figure iof speech to say that we are aa a people chained together we are one peopleone j in general complexion one in a degradation one in popular estimation aa coe j rises all must rise and aa one fella all moat fall having now our feet on tbs rock oi freedom we most drag our brethren from the slimy depths of slavery ignorance sod ram j every one of us should be ihimsii to nnsaid or himself free while his brother is a slave tbs wrongs sf mu brethren should he out eoostast theme there should be no time top precious no calling too boly no place too ej ered to make room for thu cause we should not only feel it to be the cause of humanity but the mam at ehristtamty and fit work for men and angels we ask you to devote yourselves to this cause as one of the first and most successful means of uolf improvement is that careful study of ft yos will learn voaf own rights and numpto hrod tbe vista of coming rime your high and god appointed destiny many of tbs brightest end beet of our number have become such by toeir devotion to this cause sad the somety of white abolitionists the fetter bate been willing to make themselves sf in reputation forsur sake and in return let ns show ourselves worthy of their teal and devotion attend antisfe very meetings show that you are interested in the subject that yon hate slavery and fore those who ats laboring for is overthrow act with white abolition societies wherever you can and where you cannot get op societies among yourselves but without exclusiveness it will be a long time before we gain all our rights and although it may seem to conflict with our views of human brotherhood we shall undoubtedly for many years be compelled to have institutions of a complexions character in order to attain this very idea of human brotherhood we would however advise our brethren to occupy memberships and stations among white persona and in white institutions just so fast as our rights are secured to us never refuse to act with a white society or institution because it is white or a black one because it is black bat act with al men without distinction of color by so acting we shall find many opportunities for removing prejudices and establishing the rights of all men we say avail yourselves of white institutions not because they are white bat because they afford a more convenient means of improvement but we pass from these suggestions to others which may be deemed more important in tbe convention that now addresses yon there has been much said on the subject of labor and especially those departments of it with which w f e as a class have been long identified you will see by the resolutions there adopted on that subject that the convention regarded those employments though right in themselves as being never ibeltjs degrading to us as a class and therefore counsel you to abandon them as speedily as possible and to seek what are called the more respectable employments while the convention do not inculcate the doctrine that any kind of needful toil is in itself dishonorable or that colored persons are to be exempt from what arecalledmenial employments they do mean to say that such employments have been so long and universally filled by colored men as to become a badge of degradation in that it has established the conviction that colored men are only fit for such employments we therefore advise you by all means to cease from such employments as far as practicable by pressing into others try to get your sons into mechanical trades press them into the blacksmiths shop the machine shop the joiners shop the wheelrights shop the coopers shop and the tailors shop every blow of the sledge hammer wielded by a sable arm is a powerful blow in support of our cause every colored mechanic is by virtue of circumstances an elevator of his race every house built by black men is a strong tower against the allied hosts of prejudice it is impossible fur us to attach too much importance to this aspect of the subject trades are important wherever aman may be thrown by misfortune if he hasin his hands a useful trade he is useful to his fellow man and will be esteemed accordingly and of all men in the world who need trades we are the most needy understmd this that independence is an essential condition of respectability to be dependent is to be degraded men may indeed pity us but they cannot respect us we do not mean that we can become entirely independent of all men that would be absurd and impossible in the social state but we mean that we must become equally iudepen dent withother members of tbe community that other members of the community shall be as dependent upon us as we upon them that such is not now the case is too plain to uced an argument the houses we live in are built by white menthe clothes we wear arc made by white tailorsthe hats on our heads are made by white hatters and the shoes on our feet are made by white shoemakers and the food that we eat is raised and culti i vated by whits men now it is impossible that we should ever be respected as a people while we are so universally and completely dependent upon white men for the necessaries of life we must make white persons as dependent upon us as we are upon them this cannot be done while we are found only in two or three kinds of employments and those employments have their foundation chiefly is not entirely iu the pride and indolence of tbj white people sterner necessities will brio j higher respect tbe fact is we must not merely make thj white roan dependent upon us to shave hl but to feed him not merely dependent upoj us to black his boots but to make them ifl man is only in a small degree dependent os ul when he only needs his bouts blacked m hffi carpet bag canted as a hide fees pride and little more industry on bis part may enable hiu to dispense with our services entirely as wise men it becomes us to look forward to a stats of things which appears inevitable tbe time will come when those menial employments will afford less means of living than they now do what shall a large class ol i our fellow countrymen do when whits men find it economical to black their swr boots and shave themselves what wiu they do when white men learn to wait on themselves i we warn you brethren to seek other

and servants signed by the committee in behalf of the convention frederick douglass h w l day d h jenkins a h francis g warner esq editor of the rochester courier sir my reasonsl will not say my apology for addressing to you this letter will become evident by perusing the following brief statement of facts about the middle of august of the present yeardeeply desiring to give my daughter a child between nine and ten years old the advantages of a good schooland learning that seward seminary of this city was an institution of that characterl applied to its principal miss tracy for tbe admission of my daughterjintoihat seminary the principal after making suitable enquiries into the childs mental qualifications and informing me of the price of tuition per term agreed to receive the child into the school at the commencement of the september term here we parted i went home rejoicing that my child was about to enjoy advantages for improving her mind and fitting her for a useful and honorable life i supposed that the principal would be as good as her wordand was more disposed to his belief when i learned that she was an aboli tionista woman of religious principles and integrityand would be faithful in the performance of her promises as she bad been prompt in making them in all this i have been grievouslyif not shamefully disappointed while absent from home on a visit to cleveland with a view to advance the cause of education and freedom among my despised fellow countrymenwith whom am in all respects identified the september term of the seward seminary commenced and my daughter was promptly sent to thu school but instead of receiving her into mne school according to agreement and ad in honor the principal was bound to do she was merely thrust into a room separate from all other scholars and in this prisonlike solitary confinement received the occasional visits of a teacher appointed to instruct her on my return home i found her still going to school and not knowing the character of the treatment extended to her i asked with a light heart as i took her to mjyaide well my daughter how do you get on at the seminary she answered with tears in her eyes get along pretty well but father miss tracy does not allow me to go into the room with the other scholars because lam colored slung to the hearts core by this grievous statement and suppressing my feelings as well as i could i went immediately to the seminary to remonstrate with the principal against the cruelty and injustice of treating ray child as a criminal on account of her colorsubjecting her to soti i tary confinement because guilty of a skin not colored like hex own in answer to all that i i could say against such treatment i was answered by the principal that since she prom stjaed to receive the child into school she ihad consulted with the trustees a body of i believe unknown to the public andi that they were opposed to the childs admission to the schoolthat she thought at first of disregarding their opposition but when she re rnembered how much they had done for her in sustaining the institution she did not feel mi liberty to do ao but abe thought if i allowed her to remain and be taught separately for i term or more that the prejudice might be overcome sad the child admitted into tbe school with the other young ladies and misses bit a lost to know what to do for the best in rut of the child i consulted with mis hrogfero and others and the result of tbe ouauhatiou was to take my child from the seminary as allowing her to remain there in such circumstances could only serve to degrade her in her own eyes and those oi the other scholars attending tbe school before however carrying out my determination to withdraw tbe child from the seminary mias tracy the principal submitted the question oi the childs reception to each scholar individually and am sorry to say in a manner well calculated to rouse their prejudices against her she told them if there was one objection to receiving her she should be excluded and said if any of theta felt that she had a prejudice and that that prejudice needed to be tfreegthened that they might have time te whisper among themselves in order to increase and strengthen that projudioe toons young lady who voted to receive the child she said as if fe utoauhment did you mean to vote so are you accustomed to black pctaomv tbe young fedystood silent the question was so extraordinary and withal so ambiguous that she knew not what answer to make to it dpiie however of tiro no womanly seuduet of the principal who whatever may ha her religious feitb has not yet learned thu ampfaet pnneipleof christianity do to others as ye would that others shswld ds unto youthanks to the uaeorraptihle virtue fchtidhood and youth in the fetuses of then mao f them to share with them tits menmngv and privilege of the school and when asked here the should ait if admitted several ymng ladies boated by me by after lb matidestmjoa f mtimnl on lb pwt of ifte khofen one would bare ooppooed bat ail oppnaitmhi on the pvt of the principal would bare ceased but bis was aut be case the childs admission was subjected to a severer test each scholar was then told by the principal bat the question most be submitted to tbeif parents and that if owe parent objected the child would not be received into the school the neat morning nsr child went to school as ssual but returned with her books and other materials saying that one person abated and that aha was thuirfnri sirluitiul from the seminar now sir these are the whole beta with one important exception and that fact is that you are the person the only person of all the parents sending young ladies and misses to that seminary who was hardened and mean enough to take the responsibility of excluding that child from school isay to you exclusively belongs the honor or infomy of attempting to degrade an hmoeent child by excluding her from the benefit of attending respectable school if thia were a private affair only affecting myself and family i should possibly allow it topass without attracting public attention to it but such is not the case it is a deliberate attempt to degrade and injure a large class of persons whose rights and fadings hare been the common sport of yoomdf and such persons as yourself for ages and thiak it bitwise to allow you to do as with impunity thank god oppressed and plundered as weare and bare been we are not without help we hare a press open and free and have ample means by which we are able to proclaim our wrongs as a people and your uwn infamy and that proclamation shall be as complete as the means in my power can make it there is a sufficient amount of liberality in the public mind of rochester to see that justice is done to all parties and upon that liberality i rely the young ladies of the school who saw the child and had the best means of determining whether her presence in the schoolroom would be offensive or degrading to them have decided in favor of admitting her without a dissenting vote out of all the parents to whom the question of her admission was submitted not one except yourself objected you are in a minority of one you may not remain so there are perhaps others whom you may corrupt and make as much like yourself in the blindness of prejudice as any ordinarily wicked person can be but you are still in a minority and if mistake not you will be in a despised minority you have already done serious injury to seward seminary three young ladies left the school immediately after the exclusion of my daughter and i have heard of three more who had intended to go but who have now declined going to that institution because it has given its sanction to that antidemocratic and ungodly caste i am also glad to inform you that you have not succeeded as you hoped to do in depriving my child of the means of a decent education or the privilege of going to an excellent school she had not been excluded from seward seminary five hours before she was gladly welcomed into another quite as respectable and equally christian to the one from which she was excluded she now sits in a school among children as pure and as white as you or yours and no one is offended now i should like to know how much better are you than me and how much better your children than mine we are both worms of the dust and out children are like us we differ in color it is true and not much in that respect but who is to decide which color is most pleasing to gd or most honorable among men but i do not wish to waste words or argument on one whom i take to be as destitute of honorable feeling as he has shown himsetf full of pride and prejudice frederick douglass hon john p hale we owe an especial

is no halting place ask ourselves the question where are we and we may even succeed in gathering up an answer in some measure satisfactory w here art me about thttty years ago fulton requested the use of the hall of rep teaeutativea to deliver a lecture on steam power and its applicability to navigation he was denied on the ground that his scheme was visionary and impracticable avery few years rolled round and hi visionary and impracticable scheme became one of the greatest and must important facta of modern history and tbe one thought that was working in the brain of that one man and which he wished to communicate to the public in the hall of representatives baa in the course ot a very few years effected more changes and produced greater results than all the fret and fame of legislation and the thought and talk of legislators ever willever can produce that is not saying much say some for it is not tbe intention of legislators to produce great resultsall that they want is to get office for themselves by shutting others out of it well i will not dispute that pointper haps it is perhaps it is not at all events did we take their word for it we should come to a very different conclusion for hear some of them talk their patriotism is bounded only by the ocean scarcely by that if they can contrive to annex it and their philanthropy by space that day then has gone by our legislators would not now refuse the use of tbe hall of representatives for a lecture on steam power on tbe ground that the scheme was visionary and impracticable another discovery was made as it were only a few days since electricity has become the earlier of intelligence and by its means space may yet be almost annihilated the statement was made to a respectable farmer not many miles distant from where now write that a message could be sent from rochester to albany in the course of two or three minutes he stoutly denied the possibility of any such thing anything in rea sonbut thats impossible he was hard to convince but the evidence of his senses was not to be disbelieved and he went away wondering what the world was coming toit is a common remark nowadaysthatth most intelligent men are the most credulous this remark is in some respects true but in other and more important respects it is false the knowledge which intelligent men possess and the estimate which they have formed in their own minds oil the basis of that knowledge of the distant probabilities of scientific discoverylead them at once to arrive at a conclusion and generally a correct one of the truth or falsehood of any alleged discovery it is no sign of a philosophic inind to be incredulous still less is that man deserving tobe considered intelligent who is for ever running after the last discovery discoveries are often made which after all are no discover iesbut either he veriest humbug or the offspring of an over heated brain the visionary enthusiast wishes for somethingprays for it in the truest sense of the word his mind is full of it and lo there it is the very thing he wished the dreams of the millenarians the fanaticism of the mormonsthe power of performing miracles of many nameless sects are cases in point many believed in them but they were not the philosophic or intelligent there would seein to be a periodical return to a belief in miraculous manifestations there is nothing new under the sun after a certain period the old fashion of a coat comes back again the old tie of a cravat and the old belief in the su pernaturaltho salem absurdities the witch burning of judge matthews in the midland couuties of england during tbe commonwealth and the foaming at the mouth and miraculous conception and olbet wonderworking exhibitions of the kentish monastery and so on back as far as there is any history secui to indicate that it returns cornetlike ata distant period after having travelled a certain orbit changing its character awl each time losing a portion of its grossness to suit the more advanced civilization and intelligence of the age in the greater number of these cases the actors have been found to be either grossly deluding or grossly deluded and the believers have for the most part been the ignorant and superstitious nor can it be otherwise where there is no bast to rest an argument tbe reaaooing mao cannot reason if be is shut p to a simple belief or a denial of what appears to him from all his previous conceptions of truth and falsehood to be a mere absurdity of course he denies it if what is asserted is contrary to all the known laws of natures operations aid no proof appears of any new mode or of any discovery of what is perhaps old but hitherto unacknowledged be will simply say be knows nothing about it if n bears any resemblance to what has before repeatedly been proved tobe a delusion he will in all probability go farther and say this is all a liel dont believe a word of il ere long it will share the fate ef its predecessors aad will become aa though it had never been to all buttbe viafon arjr the ereduloee and the ignorant some things are believed eves these days which are sufficiently incredible and aboard tbe following is an qhwtration quoted from the london daily news of may th  tn bulls aho tub kky mary philips a laundress residing at no camden place kensington appeared at the police court to answer a aunreoea charging bei with having seed abusive language to elizabeth haines efaaheth haines deemed she waa an faaer fa tha employ ef the defendant and while at wash fa defendants fanes she fas defendant maned

ife fcfaxum to j key up in a bible and held the handle of the key which waa sticking out of the bible on her finget and when the defendant drooped it at her feet she fromedmtety reclaimed my god betsey you have gut the roverejgn and you moat leave my heww directly the judge further aahod whet waa the meaning of such a trial by a bible and a key the complainant mid she really could not my aa she bad never seen or heard of soeh a thing before when the defendant dropped the bible and key on the floor she mid toe key bad turned toward her complainant aad had pointed her out as the thief and said she would not have her in the home any lunger when the defendant saw her again m the street she called out to her i know you have got the sovereign and spit at her and told her to keep it saying may it do you no ul this no doubt waa a very short and convenient way of convicting a thief but a it wan devoid of ll reason and had no foundation except in the credulity of a superstitious woman no one paid any attention to it it fa a kind of revival of the old ordeal under a different appearance but still trusting to s supernatural dccisioo which of course was not given the falling of the key in a certain way was as almost evety one knows tbe effect ofa fixed and unvarying law and it would have fallen just so if there bad been no woman there for it to point ati read a more recent case of popular credulity in a bristol paper which i cannot find it was to this effecta certain dines had been unusually prevalent somewhere in that neighborhood it attacked the cattle first which waa no uousual occurrence it then attacked men and women but more especially children this peculiarity in its attack led the ignorant to imagine that it was the effect of the evil eyethat some persona bad the power of bringing this disease on those upon whom they looked these suspected persons were in consequence of this belief like to have suffered and but for the timely interference of the authorities would have suffered the trial for w itchcraftsink and be drowned or swiin and be lynched these are sufficiently melancholy illustrations of superstition in the nineteenth century rand show that not the intelligent but the ignorant are the most credulous this and others like it are the modes by which those who do not relish the labor and have little ability to reasou to a conclusion endeavor to arrive at knowledge it is tkeir royal road unfortunately however it leaves them just as ignorant as they wete before they tried it but this is not all an illustration sufficiently remarkable and worthy of note can be had at our own door even in this city of rochester were what lam about to relate told me of any place at a distance i should not believe it possible that any one of common intelligence could be concerned in it but should at once conclude that it was a mere dream of the visionary or a scheme of the designing and no doubt it will be so judged by those who read it which it is i have not had sufficient evidence to determine no doubt a very few days will be sufficient to decide the point the case is this some time since i do not know how long a man suddenly disappeared from a village called hydesvillc it was suspected that he was murdered and to confirm this suspicion certain mysterious rappings were heard at his house these rappings as is quin probable are said to have been accounted for on natural cause notwithstanding that they have since been heard at several house in this city the manifestation or spirit as it is called gave instruction to dig at the roots of a certain tree and tbe bones of the murdered man would be found the digging was done on the ist d and d of august in tbe presence of hundreds and of course the bones were not found for they were not there the spirit now says that they did not dig deep enough since then the bones have been forgotten and not only the spirit of that man but those of many others have made themselves manifest everyone indeed may have a confab with just what spirit he likes clarkson raps to abolitionists gall spurzheiin c to phrenologists and those who are so minded bold long conversations with their most intimate friends deceased the mode of operation is this and to the unbelieving it appears a very roundabout and clumsy contrivance tbe peroott wishing to converse asks the question who are

question of no small degree of interest is presented for the consideration of the colored voters of the state doubtless the most of them look with favor upon the freesoil movement and intend to aid its progress by voting for the nominees of the buffalo convention however anxious they may feel to do this i trust not one of them will vote for general dix for governor for however plausible or conclusive their reasons may be for supporting martin van buren for president of the united states as the representative of the principles embodied in the national platform erected at buffalo they will not be held guiltless if they vote for gen dix for governor of the slate of new york do you ask me why will endeavor in my feeble manner to inform you it is well known that martin van buren and ninetenths of the prominent men among the barnburners voted against the extension of the right of suffrage and in all human probability would do so again indeed not a few of them have already declared that their sentiments upon this subject are unchanged and that if they were called upon to vote upon the same question to day they would again vote to fasten the chains of political thraldom upon the limbs of our suffering countrymen this being the case it is a question of vital importance to colored men ist whether they can consistently vote for a res a to fill any office who if he had it in hiv power would deny them the right to vote coufess i have been much perplexed by this question and am still in doubt iu regard to it the only ground upon which colored men can justify themselves for voting for such a man to fill any office is in regard the great national question and that he is to fill an office in which he will not by virtue of such office be called upon to act in any way whatever in regard to the extension of the right of suffrage and furthermore concurring with them upon all the questions upon which be can be called upon to act by virtue of his office it is all that can be required of such s candidate it is upon this ground i propose to vote for martin vm buren however proslavery his former acts may have been but few will deny that he now stands upon the buffalo platform the only reasonable objection then that can be urged against voting for him is that enough is not included in that platform candor requites me to admit that many are of this opinion some are dissatisfied because the free soil party did not declare in favor of universal suffrage with great dcfcienoe i must differ from these gentlemen the buffalo platform is of a national characterestablished as the basis of a great national party the object of which is to act with reffercnce to gtcal national questions a national question is ooe in the sense in which i make use of the term upon which congress or other officers of the national government may be called upon to act by virtue of their office the suffrage question is not one of this nature no ooe holding office in the national government can be called upon in consequence ol holding such office to actin regard to the right of suffrage iu the states the most superficial observer must see at once that the suffrage question instead of being s national is only a local question confined to those states in which it may origi nateand for the final settlement of which each an devery state alooe must be held responsible and not the nation at large if thia mode of reasoning bs serreet what right haa any one to complain because this question was not included in the nalasoal platform erected at buflhlo the

removed from the character of this great state the antirepublican character and the withering effects of this proscriptive policy have been time and time again presented to the people of this state

great speech on tlie bill to establish territorial government for oregondelivered in the united states senate no the th day of last jane in which be embraced the opportunity to express his hatred and contempt of colored men by making a mean nod unmanly attack upon our unfortunate race so gteat was his anxiety to heap reproach open ns that he even descended to the ineffable meanness of making statements that were palpably false and which he mast have known to be such at the time if he did not know anything about the subject then be ought not to have said anything about it the general welcomes to our shores the swarming millions of the old world among whom are many paupers and felons and regards them as an element of strength to the body politic and touse his own language if shades of variety exist in their intellectual and physical character he attributes it to the influences which diversities of soil climate and government have exerted upon them forgetting that similar causes produce similar effects lie can find no such apology for us but says our race is an inferior caste at the north and counts nothing in the estimate physical or intellectual in the body politic after staling what will probably as he thinks be the result of the disabilities under which we labar he makes the coldblooded and heartless declaration nor is it the work of inhumanity or wrong it is the slow but certain progress of nature working out her ends by laws so steady and yet so silent that their operations arc only seen in their results the feeling which gen dix evinces towards us proves that he has a heart as icy as the snowclad mountains of greenland such a sentiment is only worthy of the bloody demon of oppression again after complaining that manumitted blacks come to our state in spite of any discouragements it may oppose he says all such additions to our number are in the highest degree undesirable they add nothing to our strength moral or physical he finally winds up by saying if the free blacks were were removed from the state its strength and prosperity would be proportionally increased c these extracts taken from his speech delivered on tire th of june prove what his sentiments were about two months since there is no evidence before us to show that his views upon this subject have undergone any change the presumption is they have not can colored men then assist in elevating him to the office of governor of the state of new york in which office lie may be called upon to acton the suffrage question and upon other laws that may affect us vitally every colored man must answer with an emphatic no if it be the duty of colored men to withhold their votes from gen dix for reasons which i have assigned is it not also the duty of their professed friends who are desirous of improving their condition morally mentally and politically to do the same have colored men as members of the body politic any duties to perform which are not equally binding upon all other men certainly not if then it be the duty of colored men to withhold their votes from gen dix for governor of the state of new york and no one will deny that it is because he would not only not extend to them their political rights but by declaring that our presence in the state is in the highest degree undesirable and by intimating that it would be a blessing to the state if the free blacks were banished from it shows that if be had it in his power he would deprive us those rights we already possess if this be the case i ask is it not the duty of abolitionists for i mean them our professed friends to refuse to vote for him for the same reason let no man dare answer these questions in the negative these propositions are self evident they need no arguments to sustain them i call upon the editors of the north star as faithful watchmen upon the wall to sound the tocsin of alarm and thunder into the care of the colored voters of the state what will bethe fearful consequences of voting for gen dix let ward and garnet smith and cram tnell and all others speak out and endeavor to save our countrymen from the everlasting infamy of having voted for gen dix or any other mao tinder similar circumstances for governor of the state our friends may tell asit was necessary for them to do so for the purpose of securing the triumph of the freesoil party but let us prove to them and the

years of age recently left this city for the island of cuba to engage as clerk in an extensive wholesale commercial establishment tl is establishment was represented by gentlemen of this city who professed tobe connected with it as a large respectable and honorable concern the boy was to have only one hundred dollars for the first year the j knowledge of the business and the chance of being connected with such a concern being a sutheient recompense and inducement the second year he was to have a liberal salary the prospect was sufficient for the most ample anticipations of the mother and son hence the boy was taken from a flour store in this city where he served in the capacity of clerk and on the representations of the gentlemen concerned and the advice of friends he embarked for st

was with hearty goodwill and without any previous concert convention of colored people i the national convention of colored people met at tbe court house yea terday and organised by appointing frederick douglass of rochester ny president several committees were appointed and some speeches made during the day the number of colored men present was not large but they were highly respectable in appearance and manifested a high degree of talent mr douglass presides with dignity and ability he is not only a distinguished man but worthy of distinction and a gentleman the court house was crowded

labors during that and the two following dayssome sixty or seventy delegates were in attendance from various parts of the northern states among others henry bibb and frederick douglass both of whom as all are aware were formerly slaves in the south mr douglass was madetpresident of the convention the duties of which office he performed with an ability and dignity that would have done honor to more experienced men of the white race we had the pleasure of listening to his remarks on the occasion of his taking the chair and purer language nobler sentiments and more glowing eloquence wc never listened to one object of the convention as stated by him was to devise means by which the colored race might become more elevated in life have higher aims and live in such a manner as to command the respect of their fellowmen and gain for themselves a bestowal of those rights of which they are now so unjustly deprived few inducements were held out to colored men to become useful mechanics and tradesmenthe white man had nearly monopolized these avocations of life or at least had made the customs of society such that the blackman with the same natural ability could not comnete with him but said the orator temperance morality christianitythese the white man cannot monopolize and in these aswell as in the world of labor we can and must show that we are equal to any other race and the high moral tone of the entire address and the mass of intellectual heads and faces before him and the resolutions adopted by the convention as well as the spirited discussions and close logical reasoning which they elicited all gave ample testimony that his words were true and that they came from the heart and reached the hearts of those to whom they were ad dressed for two or three successive evenings large and enthusiastic meetings were held at the tabernacle church w here addresses were made by bibb douglass delany lyle and others all giving confirmation strong that an opportunity for the cultivation of their intellects and physical powers is all that is necessary to make africs sons our equal brethren viewing this convention in its moral aspect we must say we rejoice that it has been held for we can see in it the germ of that harvest which the friends of humanity will one day reap as the reward of their labors it will tell for good in its effects on the nominally free colored people of our land inasmuch as it will raise their hopes of standing on higher and better ground and incite them to make yet higher attainments in all that can add to their characters as useful citizens and heartfelt christians its proceedings when given to the world will have a tendency to break down much of that prejudice which teaches that god has created the black man with an inferior intellect and we are constrained to bail it as one of the evidences of the goodtime coming when a universal brotherhood shall be recognized throughout the land among all the inhabitants thereof for

prophecies and especially the book ot revelations quitting the shopboard h turned out a preacher or rather a prophet until his customers hfd left his shop and bis family were likely to famish his monomania was wellknown to the dean who benevolently watched for an opportunity to turn the current of his thoughts one night the tailor as be fancied got especial revelation to go and convert dean swift and next morning took up his line of march to the deanery the j dean whose study was furnished witha glass door saw the tailor approach and instantly surmised the nature ol i his errand throwing himself into an attitude ofsolemnity and thoughtful ii ness with the bible opened before him and his eyes fixed on the tenth chapter of revelation he awaited his approach the door opened and the tailor announced in an unearthly voice i dean swift lam sent by the ai mighty to announce to you come in my friend said the dean i am in great trouble and no doubt the lord has sent you to help me out of my difficulty j this unexpected welcome inspired the tailor and strengthened his assurance in hiu own prophetic character and disposed him to liirten to the disclo sure my friend said the dean i have just been reading the th chapter of revelations and am greatly distressed at a difficulty i have met with and you are the very man sent to help me out here is an account of an angel that came down from heaven who was so large that he placed one foot on the earth and lifted up his hands to heaven j now my knowledge of mathematics continued the dean has enabled me to calculate exactly the size and form of this angel but am in great difficulty for i wish to ascertain how much cloth it will take to make him a pair of breeches and as that is exactly in your line of business i have no doubt the lord has sent you to show me this exposition came like an electric shock to the poor tailor he rushed from the house ran to the shop and asudden revulsion of thought and feeling came over him making breeches was exactly in his lino of business he returned to his occupation thoroughly cured of his prophetical revelation by the wit of the dean determination a man carrdo anything that he is determined upon and goes at work rightly to accomplish the alps will appear little more than mole hills when he hus made up his mind to scale them the heavens will be as plain as a printed sheet
