doings in maryland correspondence of the tribune baltimore june i observe that you state on tie authority of the baltimore sun he fact of the recent conviction in somerset county of the free colored man stephen redden on the charge of having in his possession certain pictures of an abolition character contrary to the act in such cases and express the regret that the nature of the penalty was not stated observing a similar call for light in other northern papers i have thought it well to answer your questions in order that if there be yet in the free states a single man who is really uninformed of the true character of the slaveryprotecting laws of the land of calvert tolerant calvert he may not be left in ignorance on the subject any longerperhaps to the pleading of that ignorance hereafter as an excuse for not having thrown his voice and his vote against the further extension of the prolific root of all such oppressive laws the law under which redden was convicted was doubtless that passed in as a supplement to a previous law on the same subject which was enacted in but not found sufficient in its provisions and penalties it has several sections one of which relates to the publishing of forbidden matterintended to overawe the freedom of the press the section relating to the circulation of incendiary matter reads as follows be it enacted by the general assembly of maryland that after the passage of this act it shall be deemed a high offence against the supremacy of this state for any person knowingly to circulate or in any way knowingly to assist in circulating among the inhabitants thereof any pictorial representation or any pamphlet newspaper feaolmu or other paperprinted or writ lea of sr tefiaminatory character having a tendency to create discontent among and stir up to insurrection the people of color of this state and that every person that shall be duly convicted of this offcttee ahull be guilty of felony and shall be seiiteneed to undergo a confinement in the peniteatiary of this state for a period of time not less than nor more than years from the time of sentence on such of fender lo you ask me whether this enactment is not a dead letter on the statute book of maryland sq as to ren r the conviction of redden a mere pf trough for the purpose of intirmdqtion answer no such cruel farces re i know sometimes enacted m our houthern courts as in fbe memorable case of brownwho was seateuoed to death by judge oneil under the laws of south carolina for piritmg away his betrothed but our w ts reality but recently our new democratic governor reprieved a colored man who had been confined in the penitentiary for nine of the ten years provided in the above law as the minimum penalty for this felony j nm for to the ew of sherry wilson which the readers of that valuable melange the liberty hell will remember to tare read m described by caroline healy dale in words of touching pathos it is true that the indulgent treatment poor the north star during those long nine years placed ashe was in the capacity of gardener in summer and bootblack in wintera general favorite of the officials did he indeed become indicated more plainly than words could have done that those who daily looked upon his venerable form felt that he was guilty of no crime and deserved no punishment and that the law ought to be a dead letter but still he remained in that gloomy prison i for thoee long and weary years an ex i ile from home and family in obedience to this same law unwarrantably cruel as it will seem to those who read its provisions for the first time no it is not a dead letter and doubtless had not the present victim ol this law in the spirit of roman chivalry preferred death to imprisonment stephen redden would ere this have taken sherry wilsons place for be it known that like the slaves in kentucky whose tragic end is now thrilling the minds of uiousands of humane readers wherever the newspapers have dared to give them the facts stephen has chosen to die by his own hand i never have been able to justify the act of suicide and i have been of the impress hi that it could not well be the promptings of a sane mind but if there is an exception to be allowed it seems tome that exception is furnished in such a case as this if there was meaning beyond the mere sound of a rhetorical imprecation in the exclamation of patrick henry give ine liberty or give ine death then we cannot help sympathizing w r ith a poor frieudless individual of a downtrodden race arraigned in a slaveholding community before a slaveholding judge and a slaveholding jury without money to employ counsel and convicted under laws of which he was in all probability totally ignorant as was sherry wilson and whose penalties his imagination might well be expected to exaggerate into worse than a scaffold deathay even in that act of suicide which has hurried his soul into the presence of its god an antislavery writer has well and forcibly remarked that slavery is an anomalythat one cannot subject it to rules of right and wrong applicable to most other subjects of human inquiry thousands of facts in the terrific history of this our national crime have illustrated the thought and stamped it true while i have my pen in hand i will give your readers another piece of news which may serve to relieve the giooui of the narrative just given it j had been for some weeks rumored that our prince of slavedealers hope hull blatter had abandoned the accursed traffic and closed up histolave prison although a friend of mine doing business nearly opposite to the establishment told me that he had the fact from slatters own lips it was such cheering news as to stagger my credulitytoo good to be believed but when at the prison of one of his competitors campbell co where let me say ina satisfactory parenthesis i went to receive into freedom ellen stewart slave of mrs madisonone of the pearl fugitives was assured that there was no mistake about the truth of the rumor it seems the lot from the pearl over which rev henry slicer struck hands in such clerical complaisance according to the graphic description of hon mr siingerland was about the last that slatter had the heart to buy whether the scathing denunciations of him and his tnffic quoted by mr slicer in his lame attempt at a defence were instr umental in converting slatter i am unable to say but certainly the publication of them in the body of mr slicers letter in the clipper was at least one help to the cause of truth albeit the reverend gentlemen was far front intending it to have any such goodly effect by the by i observe that some of the northern papersthe antislavery standard am ng themstill speak cf slatter as a member of the methodist episcopal church this is certainly not the fact so far he is only a pewholder iu the pew church built i year or two ago by the methodist elile his wife being a member i believe however it is not improbable that he will be a member before long should he continue in his penitent state my friend above mentioned understood him l to say that he would join the church if they would receive him why not receive him mr slatter aside from his disreputable business is a man whose qualities could not fail to make him a i useful member indeed so different in physical and intellectual conformation so far as one can judge without intimate acquaintance is he from most oi the men who have stood forth as human fleshmongers that the surprise ha always been that he has continued sot long in the business but apart from these considerations surely a slave dealer out of the business is as worthy to beeorne a church member as a slaveholder in his position and it is wellknown that there are thousands of slaveholders in the methodist episcopal church i see no reason therefore w r hy mr slatter should not be received with open arms the moment he gives reasonable evidence that be has resolved to sio no more if a precedent were wanting it might easily be found in the case of mr parsons of this city who becoming convinced of the sinfoiness of the same traffic abandoned it tore down his slaveprison built dwellings with the materials and joined the church by the by teeing that the general conference during its recent session in pittsburgh restored the good old wesleyan rale respecting the exclusion of rumsellers from the church would it not have been wise mad more ooaaiat  fo fcw jfujrged to ikfi wpsbyaa right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us afj and all we are brethren platform with respect to slaveholders also alas how has the glory of early methodism departed no longer do we hear slavery denounced in the language of scathing rebuke which he habituelly used but on the contrary we behold the lamentsble spectacle ofa division of tbe church preferred to the giving up of this darling sin and one half thereof seemingly taking the ground of the calhoun school as if slavery were the only sure foundation of christianity as well as of republicanism but do not wish to be understood as singling out the methodist church as alone guilty in this respect the presbyterian churchthe church of my fathershas indicated afresh through her general assembly recently convened in this city that she is given over to the same unrighteousness never was more special pains taken by any body of christians to keep the subject of slavery out of the discussions than by that same bodyfirst by placing rev dr thornweli of charlestons c at the head of the business committee the committee on overtures believe it is called and secondly by the maneuvering of the stated clerk who appeared to be a northern man with southern principles selected with special reference to his qualifications for the work every avenue whereby the question might by any possibility find an entrance was guarded by cerberuslike care so much so that the word slavery would probably not have been found on the minutes had it not been for rev mr finney a quite young man from new philadelphia ohio and some two or three other noble spirits who had the nerve to join with him in a protest against the exclusion of the usual epistle from the irish church this was not all the assembly even resorted to the expedient of puffing the african colonization scheme as such a plan of quasi antislavery which just serves to quiet the consciences ol thousands whose moral feelings have been touched by the living truths of reform oh the immensethe irre i sistihle power of the churches of this land if they would only consent to bear the cross in their hearts and lives instead of upon their steeples and on their lips in forms of outward praise and prayer but i must stop having extended this letter to a length far beyond what i designedled on as i have been by a class of facts and feelings that ever rush to my pen and clamor for utterance the moment i touch the theme of my countrys giant curse and sin j e sfree roil convention at worcester the following resolutions among others were reported by the coinmitee and adopted whereas the whigs of massachusetts in their convention of the th of september unanimously adopted among other resolutions the following resolved that if the war shall be prosecuted to the final subjugation or dismemberment of mexico the whigs of massachusetts now declare and put this declaration of their purpose on re cordthat massachusetts will never consent that american territory however acquired shall become a part of the american union unless on the unalterable condition that there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude therein otherwise than in the punishment of crime resolved that in making this declaration of her purpose massachusetts announces no new principle of action in regard to her sister states and makes no new application of principles already acknowledged she merely states the great american principle embodied in our declaration of inde pendencethe political equality qf persons in the civil statethe principles adopted in the legislation of the states under the confederationand sanctioned by the constitutionin the admission of all the new states formed from the only territory belonging to the union at the adoption of the constitution it is in short the imperishable principle set forth in the ever momora ble ordinance of which has for more than half a century been the fundamental law of human liberty to the great valleys of the lakes the ohio and the mississippi with what brilliant success and with what unparalleled results let the great growing states of ohio indiana and illinois michigan and wisconsin answer and declare and whereas a portion of the whigs have since that time nominated candidates for the presidency and vice presidency without paying the smallest regard to the principles herein declared and even ventured to stifle the discussion of the same in their national convention resolved that we tbe people of massachusetts reaffirm the said declaration as tbe voice of the commonwealth and whoever else may desert or betray we will inflexibly adhere to the principles of freedom therein declared as the ark of our political salva tion resolved that we the people of massachusetts wshl support no men as candidates for the offices of president and vice president but those who are known by their acts or declared opinions to be opposed to the extension of slavery resolved that the power to prohibit the introduction of slavery into the territories of the united states in dearly delegated to congress by the constitution and that the highest considerations of patriotism the wrongest sentiments of justice and humanity nod a proper respect for tfe enkfbtcaed rochester n y friday july opinion of mankind require that this power should be exercised in favor ol freedom resolved that in view of the importance and necessity of a full discussion of the greet question of the dsy we recommend to oer friends throughout the state the establishment in every town and school district of freedom leagues for tbe dissemination of free principles and of a like central league for the county for the dissemination of sound opinions on these subjects by personal discussion and cheap publica tions resolved that massachusetts wears no chains and spurns all bribesthat massachusetts goes now and will ever go for free soil and free men for free lips and a free press for a free land and a free world resolved that this convention deems itself greatly honored by the presence of joshua r giddings ol ohio and that it desires to express the universal conviction of the opponents of slavery throughout the free states that there is no man living by whom the great cause which they have at heart has been so effectually sustained or to whom at this critical moment in view of all that can be required of ability and discretion and firmness it can be more safely entrusted resolved that this convention regards with deep interest the position assumed by the democratic party of the state of new york as represented by the convention recently held in utica that it applauds the earnestness and unanimity with which the principle of free territory has been incorporated into tbe basis of their organization that it commends the wisdom and manliness which have been exhibited by mr van buren in his correspondence upon this subject and that it anticipates the most satisfactory results from the effect of its proceedings upon all true democrats throughout the free states who are prepared to act together in prohibiting the extension of slavery extract from the address read to the peoples convention at worcester by hon c phillips to the people of massachusetts fellow citizens the occasion on which we have assembled demands of us an appeal to the public sentiment of massachusetts the occasion in all its aspects is extraordinary and we cannot but feel that when you shall ponder as we have done with calmness and under a high sense of responsibility the duty which we all owe to the state and country the purpose we have formed will commend itself to your judgment and that your hearts must respond to the motives by which we are actuated this convention as is well known was called by a small body of whigs acting without any formal organization and relying upon the supposed state of public feeling to mould its character and demonstrate its effectiveness the call was addressed to all who should feel themselves interested in the declared purpose of the convention and now that the day of meeting has arrived the convention is found to be composed of many thousand citizens of massachusetts of all parties who agree in the conclusion that they are not prepared and that they cannot be persuaded to support gen taylor or gen cass as a candidate for the presi dency it is deemed an insuperable objection to the support of gen cass that with his admitted qualifications in some respects he is still too much of a politician and not enough of a man to meet the crisis in which the country is involved born and educated in new england a pioneer in the settlement of the western wilderness and bound by all his habits and associatons to preserve untainted the spirit of a free man he has been prevailed upon to barter his birthright for the presidency and he stands before the nation availing himself of the advantages of his position as a candidate from the free states that he may acquire the power of establishing a policy which is designed to perpetuate the ascendancy of the slave states shame we say upon any professed democrat who can thus prove himself insensible to the monstrous incompatibility between an adherence to democratic principle and the political support of slavery shame we add upon the candidate and the party who are not only prepared to assent to the continuance of slavery in this professed republic and a bo do not think it hardship and disgrace enough to pledge their power to sustain it where it exists but who also combine to make it a condition of the coming election that there shall be no opposition to the extension of slavery so far as slaveholders may find it for their interests to extend it into any free territory acquired or to be acquired by the federal government let us congratulate ourselves that recent demonstrations in new york and elsewhere make it certain that the legitimate antislavery tendency of democratic sentiments is beginning to be felt avowed end acted upon and let us rejoice to be assured that there are already those amongst our democratic fellowcatiseft of massachusetts who will henceforth emulate the firmest whigs in resisting aft tbe polls the election of any candidate from their ranks wbouu chief recommendation it is that he is the champion or the dupe of the slave power by the whig kero assembled it is felt to be u duty to protest against tbo priori sal act ol tbe convention recently held in the name of tbe whig party i philadelphia upon u review of tbe j proceedings of that body it as imposm ls mi to sss that ibsjr as without a precedent in the history of the part and that the involve alike an abandoo meot of its principles and usages a disregard of the merits and services ol its wellknown and longtrusted leaders and the surrender to exterior dictation of all discretionary authority in the convention to deliberate and act for itself abstaining from the performance of its manifest duty by nominating as a candidate for the presidency some universallyrecognized and approved whig that convention has resorted to the suicidal policy of endorsing a nomination previously made by organizations snd anomalous assemblages having no political sympathy with the whig cause of the candidate thus adopted it were under ordinary circumstances enough to state in objecting to him that he had explicitly refused to be considered an expooent of the doctrines of the whig party and that he waa known to be unwilling to accept a whig nomination on the only terms to which in reference to any other candidate the party would accede but it is not under ordinary circumstances or in conformity to an usual course of proceeding or solely for the sake of aiding the legitimate objects of the whig party that general taylor has been enabled to attain the position in which it is claimed for him that he is entitled to their suffrages so extraordinary a result has been of course brought about under extraordinary circumstances by the use of extraordinary means and for the promotion of an end which ought now to be considered and ex posed there may be no foundation tor the suspicion that general taylor has been unduly prompted by his military fame to aspire to the rewards of political ambition although it is to suppose him exempt from human infirmity not to regard him as in great danger of yielding to a temptation which has seldom failed to be irresistible that none could have been more surprised than himself by the form and degree of the manifestations of public favor of which he has been the object is made apparent by his acknowledgments and conduct and it is a compliment to his candor which ought not to be withheld that he has made himself the highest authority for declaring his entire disqualification for the distinction which is sought for him that the resort to gen taylor as a candidate for the presidency was at first a movement which seemed scarcely to be seriously undertaken all must remember and it is therefore important to review the succession of circumstances which has gradually imparted to it alo many elements of probable success the leaders of the whig party determined like their opponents to risk the result of maintaining their organization the hope was entertained fora while that the obligations of the party to henry clay and the public sympathy which in some striking modes had been expressed in his behalf might enable them once more to rally upon him as their candidate without incurring the risk of the division that otherwise seemed inevitable it is a fact tobe thought of that but for the prospect of a union upon mr clay the whig party must probably have been dissolved at the commencement of the canvass no northern whig acceptable to the north has been named of whom it is believed that the south would vote for aud it has been all along understood and virtually conceded and the whole action of the party has proceeded upon this assumption that the north must accept a southern candidate and must i not even claim any other with the approach of the time for holding a convention the hope of succeeding with mr clay and even of uniting upon him became visibly impaired there was a want of confidence in his political strength he was a thricedefeated candidate he had not done enough for either partyas of course he could not do enough for bothto bring himself into full communion with the north or south upon the great question of the day he seemed disposed to maintain j his old stand upon the ground of compromise snd it failed from under him he was still not without bis friends for no man has been surrounded with wanner and truer ooea but there were tboae who called themeelvea bis friends who bad resolved to abandon him it was in this emergency that the yet tardy movement toward the support of gen taylor began to acquire an increase of interest the hero bed received the nomination of the native american party and bad aceefrted it some detached portions of the democracy bad tendered kirn ibeir support and be had accepted it sundry meetings of the people almost exclusively in the shareholding states bad agreed to go for him without distinction of party and be bad approved their purpose and encouraged k au this bad been done manifestly without sny expectation on his part that the movement would make any farther progressor assume any other shape than to bun before the public aa a competitor with the regular candidates of um two grant parties and acta made k certain that he permitted the movement and promoted it with the sole expectation and wish of eneonoteriag the candidates of both parties and of i defeating them in this state of things the whig polkieiaasdf the south ready parcel vtag that noon the abandonment of mr clay there was an other atsveboldiag whig in behalf of whom tho northern whigs could be expected to snerifico their sdmktsd right in a candidate to contemplate the position of gen taylor they duly as y a timeted the advantages of has military reputation and tho political value of the popular applause which for dm mo meat waa everywhere concentrated upon him they recognized in him a slaveholder all whose interests wtre deeply staked in the maintenance ol slavery and who bad allowed himself to be described by bis friends as being as true to the south ns the needle to the pole they saw toe that the glare of his military reputation would be sufficient to conceal this fact at the north from the vision of nil except tbe more sensitive abohtionists and they calculated with tbe help of northern advisers bow much this fact might contribute to make him tbe only slaveholder that coum be elected the coincidence of the facts that the conventions of both parties have resulted in the nomination of candidates identified with or pledged to tbe slave bolding interests end that it has been the immediate effect of such nominations to produce at once a division in each party of sufficient importance seriously to impair its strength or to destroy it is the explanation of still another and most important fact which the numerous attendance at this convention most strikingly attests we refer to the fact that there is thoughout the free states a large body of intelligent and respectable citizens until recently connected with the whig and democratic parties who in connection with others who had previously abandoned those parties now find themselves ready and able in good faith and upon principle to organize a new party which shall have for its immediate object the resistance of every scheme for the extension of slavery and the promotion of all constitutional measures that are adapted to make the country to the utmost practicable extent a free virtuous and prosperous republic the present convention has been held to deliberate upon and to provide for such an organization at least so far as it can be rendered effective in reference to the approaching presidential election by a similarlyconstituted convention which has been recently held in the state of ohio it has been proposed to hold a national convention in the city of buffalo on the ninth day of august next at which delegates from all the states are invited to attend for tbe purpose of nominating a candidate for the presidency known to be opposed to the extension of slavery and who may therefore be worthy of tbe many thousands of fiee citizens whovill not give their votes to gen taylor or gen casa this convention has now responded to tbe call by providing for the appointment of delegates who shall represent the state of massachusetts and we do not suffer ourselves to doubt that the popular sentiment of massachusets is so far pledged to our object as to make it certain that none other than the candidate of that convention can receive her electoral vote can we be mistaken if we are wrong in the supposition that general taylor should not be expected to be in favor of the legal prohibition of the extension of slavery we may do him injustice but if that supposition be wellfounded is it not to do you the grossest injustice to take it for granted or to believe it to be possible that any political combination can be strong enough to place massachusetts in a position in which her prinoiples must be seen to have been abandoned and her character to be sacrificed does massachusetts abandon her principles and will she sacrifice her character what has been inscribed upon her legislative record so deliberately and solemnly and repeatedly aa the declaration of her purpose to resist the aggression of the slave power to exert all her political and moral influence to promote tbe j abolition of slavery where it exists and to assume an attitude of determined and uncompromising hostility to its extension can she be induced to support the nomination of a candidate who is pledged or must be expected to defeat his purpose again upon what other groooda can j massachusetts be asked or expected to aid in tbe election of gen taylorj can she now begin to assent to tbe doctrine that k is wise or necessary or safe to lavish civil honors sod to confer the highest political responsibilities upon military chieftains can she see in the hasty accomplishment of a few victories in the mexican war au the evidence she requires of sound and enlightened statesmanship and all tbe necessary elements of executive ability and usefulness does rim desire to establish the precedent in conformity to which nil tbe heroes of that war from the highest general to the lowest subaltern are to consider themselves entitled according to this popularity or k may be toe pertinacity wkb which they shall prosecute their claims to uke precedence of other citizens in obtaining tbe various eivtl offices of tbe government or if different results are to he chiefly kept in view is k enough for masse ebueeto as aamduco promiees which ate demanded of her to receive the iterance that her cki zene

inundation of frogs if they looked upon their tables behold th r were frogs even in nearer and dearer domestic relations too mysterious to be alluded to they were still cursed sy frogs thus it was

the land should bring this important question home to his jown heart it is not enough to know that white men and women are nobly devoting themselves to our cause we should know what is being done among ourselves that our white friends have done and are still doing great and good work for us is a fact which ought to excite in us sentiments of the profoundest gratitude but it must never be forgotten that when they have exerted all their energies devised every scheme and done all they can do in asserting our rights proclaiming our wrongs and rebuking our foes their labor is lostyea worse than lost unless we are found in the faithful discharge of our antielavery duties if there ka one evil spirit among us for the casting out of which we pray more earnestly than another it is that lasy mean and cowardly spirit that robs us of all manly self reliance and teaches us to depend apon others for the accomplishment of that which we should achieve with our own hands our white friends can and are rapidly removing the barriers to our improvement which themselves have set up but the main work must be commenced carried on and concluded by ourselves while in no circumstances should we undervalue or foil to appreciate the self sacrificing efforts of our friends it sliould never be lost sight of lhat our destiny for i good or for evil for time and for eternity is by an allwise god committed to us and  thst all the helps or hindrances with which we may meet on earth can never release us from this high and heavenimposed responsibility it is evident that we can be improved j and

see this j tendency id us and encourage it the same persons who would puff such demonstrations is the newspapers would mob us if we met to adopt measures for obtaining our just rights they see our weak points and avail themselves of them to crush us we are imitating the inferior qualities and examples of white imen and neglecting superior ones we do not pretend that all the members of oddfellow i societies and masonic lodges are indifferent to theirrights and themeans of obtainingthem for we know the fact to be otherwise some of the best and brightest among us are numbered with those societies and it is on litis j account that we make these remark we desire to see those noble men expending their time talents aod strength for higher and nobler objects than any that can be attained by the weak and glittering follies of oddfellowship and freemasonry we speak plainly on this point for we feel deeply we have dedicated ouiself heart and soul without reserve to the elevation and im prove inent of our race and have resolved to bink or swim with them our inmost soul is fired with a sense of the various forms of injustice to which we are daily subjected and we must and will speak out against anything within ourselves or our guilty oppressors which may tend to prolong this reign of injustice to be faithful to our oj i pressors we must be faithful to ourselves and shame on any colored man who would have us do otherwise for this very purpose the north star was established that it might be as faithful to ourselves as to our oppressors in this respect we intend that it shall be different from most of its predecessors and if it cannot be sustained in its high position its death will be welcomed by us but to return it is a doctrine held by many good men in europe as well as in america that every oppressed people will gain their rights just as soon as they prove themselves worthy of them and although we may justly object to the extent to which this doctrine is carried i especially in reference to ourselves as a peo pie it must still be evident to all that there is a great truth in it one of the first things necessary to prove the colored man worthy of equal freedom is an earnest and persevering effort on lis part to gain it we deserve no earthly or heavenly blessing for which we are unwilling to labor for our part we despise a freedom and equality obtained for us by others and lor which we have been unwilling to labor aman who will not labor to gain his rights isa man who would not if he had them prize and defend them what is the use of standing a man on his feet if when we let him go his head is again brought to the pave meat look out of ourselves as we will beg and pray to our white friends for assistance as much as ure will and that assistance may come and come at the needed time but unless we the colored jieople of america shall set atiout the work of our own regeneration and improvement we are doomed to drag on in our present miserable and degraded condition for ages would that we could speak to every colored man woman and child in the land and with the help of heaven we would thunder into their ears their duties and responsibilities until a spirit should he roused among them never to ibe lulled till the last chain is broken but here we are mortified to think that weare now speaking to tens w here we oaght toi speak to thousands unfortunately those who have the ear of otrr people on sundays have little sympathy with the antislarcry cause or the cause of progress in any of its phases they are too frequently disposed to follow the beaten paths of their fathers the most they aim at is to get to heaven when they die they reason thus our fathers got along pretty well through the world without learning and walien meddling with abolitionism and we can do the same we have in our minds three pulpits among the colored people in the north w web have the power to produce a revolution in the condition of the colrted people in this country in three years first among these we may mention the great bethel church in philadelphia that church is the largest colored church iwthis uuiua aod from two to three thousand persona worship them every sabbath it has its branches in nearly all parts of the north and west and a few in the south it ts surrounded by aomeruns little congregations in philadelphia its ministers and bishops

without it we must continue to be marked for degradation and stamped with the brand of inferiority with character we shall be powerful nothing eaa harm us long when we get character there arc certain great elements of character in us which may be haled but never despised industry sobriety honesty combined with intelligence and a due selfrespect find them where you will among black or white must be looked vp to can never be looked dorrn vpon in their presence prejudice is abashed confused and mortified encountering this solid mass of living character our vile oppressors are ground to atoms in

to these men and ilia sneers of the multitude there is nothing in the wide world half so effective as the pre scrtation of a character precisely the opposite of all their representations we have it in our power to convert the weapons intended for our injury into positive blessings that we may sustain temporary injury from gross and general misrepresentation is most true but the injury is but temporary and must disappear at the approach of lightlike mist from the vale the offensive traits of character imputed to us can only be injurious while they arc true of us for a man to say that sweet is bitterthat right is wrongthat light is datknessis not to injure the truth but to stamp himself a liar and the like is true when they impute to us that of which weare not guilty we have the power of making our enemies slanderers and this we must do by showing ourselves worthy and respectable men we are not insensible to the various obstacles that throng the colored mans pathway to respectability embarrassments and perplexities unknown to other men re common to us though born on american soil we have fewer privileges than aliens the schoolhouse the workshop countinghouse attorneys office aud various professions are opened to them but closed to us this and much more is true a general and withering prejudicea malignant and active hate pursues us even in the best parts of this country but a few days ago one of our best and most talented menand lie a lame man having lost an important limbwas furiously hurled from a car on the niagara buffalo railroad by a band of white ruffians who claim

was brought before the grand jury but that jury found no bill we cannot at this time dwell on this aspect of the subject the fact that we are limited and circumscribed ought rather to incite us to a more vigorous aud persevering use of the elevating means within our reach than to disheaten us the means of education though not so free and open to us as io white persons are nevertheless at our

are the most ignorant part of the people of great britain this r class is composed chiefly of dissenters who s in geuerii wish themselves to be understood as the must religious but who with few exceptions know very little about practical religion john bullhas his own way of doing y every thing and his route is genenhy a t rather circuitous one lie has such a high opinion of himself that no one can teach j i him i i the article from the times closes with the following comment j the north star like its cotemporary at j new york assigns this as a reason why no serious political reform is to be expected herein a regular way one only conclusion it however will be drawn from all this wrathful i and vituperative language these gentlemen who do not however fairly represent their fellowcitizens are a good deal put out that l there has been no revolution in england but why so angry if the thing must be the certainty of early success generally soothes disappointment nobody is out of temper i with the foe whom tomorrow he will see in the dust but these yankee gentlemen are j very angry and scurrilous indeed we are forced to conclude that they are not quite so sure of the boulevirscueut as they pretend at least they appear to think that it wants a lit j tie help from their pens in answer to the times we may state that the north star does not and will nut hold i t itself responsible for all the sentiments of its correspondents and that the article in ques tion was inserted in its columns in the absence of its editorand s not in harmony with his views nothing could be more at variance with our estimate of the intelligence worth and piety of the classes referred to than the statement of the london correspondent as expressed above and if the times will read the fol j lowing comments from our pen written and published la the north star immediately alter the failure of the great chartist demonstration on the th of april it will at once see the injustice which it has done us in classing us with the new york herald and other malignant american revilers chartists of englandwhen we first learned that tins class of reformers had resolved upon a resort to brute force to overawe the government of that country we were satisfied that the wild and wicked measure would be defeated it was therefore as expected as it was gratifying to learn by our last advices that they had wisely abandoned the mischievous and useless project in all circumstances we are inflexibly opposed to a resort to violence as a means of eiiecting reform and of all violence we iegaid none with more absolute horror than that attending civil j war w hatever may be the evils and however inveterate the forms of oppression and tyranny in continental europe and whatever prelexis may exist there for assailing those lorms of oppression with brute force we are confident that no such causes or pretexts can be properly cited in great britain as justify log a resort to violence while ibe liberty ol j speech is allowedwhile the freedom of the press is permitted and the right of petition is respected and w hile men are left free to originate reforms without and members are left free to propose and advocate them within the walls ot parliament no excuse can be valid for resorting to liie leartui use of brute force aud bloodshed when worjswdl accomplish as they certainly will d righteous measures it is wild irraliouai and wicked to resort to blows under no government in the wide world is there more respect shown or encouragement ottered to reform than under that of

after the horae is oat the committee of the american anc foreign antislavery society hare sent fortl i an address exhorting the members of th liberty party to stand aloof from the wilmo proviso movement and to adhere to tbeir owr party and nominations this advice coming t torn that party has much the appearance o a mere farcea most abeuid sham it would imply that thee party has up to this time had a distinct sod separate existence and maintained its principles in all their integrity when the fact is the party has been in this sense dead for more than half a year h gave up the ghost m the nomination of john p hale and that committee sanctioned thatnomination of mr hale we would never speak reproachfully or lightly ho has done much before and since his nomniabou to fix public attention upon the slave power of the country and has put forth many noble sentiments against slavery in the abstract but has done no more to identify himself w ith the liberty party than what has been done by messrs giddings palfrey and othere who have rebuked the j slave power and opposed the extension of slavery in nominating john p hale as i their candidate and representative the liberty i party virtually dissolved itself into a wilmot proviso party and cannot be said in truth to occupy any higher antislavery ground than j that occupied by the convention at columbus and other independent advocates of the wilmot proviso and it is in such circumstances absurd if not something worse for that committee or any other body to assume for that party any higher ground than that occupied by other opponents of the extension of slavery as a means of inducing the approaching free soil convention to be held in buffalo on the ninth of august to take up their candidate their address may possibly answer very well but as showing that party to be more antislavery in its position than the general free soil movement the document must be regarded a failure on this subject the national eva is just where it might be expected to be from its milkandwater tone it takes ground in favor of uniting with the general slavery limitation political movement at the north and shows most conclusively we think that that movement can and promises he accomplishment of every thing for antislavery that any political party can do which admits as the liberty party now does that the constitution does not give to the general government any power to interfere with sla i very in the states the era shows that the i liberty party acting as a party can never act against slavery in the states and falls back upon the gruund of the oftenreproached i moral suasion ists as the only mode left them for the abolition of slavery in the states webster once said a lawyer will tell the truth when it is for his interest to do so itis now confessed by preity high authority in the liberty party that aller all tbeir precisions to abolishing slavery by political means that such an object cannot be accomplished in any such way and in no way except by moral i action this we have believed from the first and do now believe and shall therefore go on doing what we may to change and concentrate public opinion against slavery and all its upholders as the surest and best means of bring ing about the entire overthrow of slavery womans flights convention a convention to discuss the

prevent the name of such a person from corning before the convention after repeated attempts to peak without success the southerners all haring done ears mr vaughan and the president being nominated a southern delegate rose n his place and obaerved the northern members can now nominate the vice president the south dont want all the officers and this said the speaker was said with such an air of conscious generosity on the part of the southern delegate that he wan gracious to hia inferiors that o f aid he i only wish that every freeman in ohio could have been there to hear him and i have no fears but every one would immediately have denounced all the old parties and nevermore favor a southern nomination another speaker said wo we for the liberties of the whole amecican peoplewith out distinction liberty equality fraternity is our watchword mr hamlin whig exmember of congress and also mr vance were quite ami ilavcrv in their definitions but mr briggs a prominent whig of cleveland one who so assiduously labored for the elevation of henry clay to the chief magistracy of this nation was particularly and unreservedly explicit ingiving utterance to his sentiments and what lie conceived to be genuine republican w big nd democratic principles it was intended said mr briggs by our forefathers that this country should bethe home of the children of every country and cl me under heaven they tell us that the negro is inferior give the slave a chance give the black an equal chance with the white man and he will be all that the white man is lam in favor of universal education and the universal equality of all mankind and with these principle we will march under a white flag with a single llack stripe in jit which shall represent the american slate thaw and similar remarks were received with rapiuious applause mr briggs was most happy in his remarks and made a dear aod dwtiu exhibit of those principles of republican jdytlaailiropy as the basis upon which shoum twt rise superstructure of every free and enhtgbiejuttd government altogether this was a cheering and hopeful event for the downtrodden and oppressed f our land a ray of light beaming upon the difficult pathway of the half million nominally free colored residentoof the u s in general and on those of ohio in particular i know not whether it ras the effect of policy or the ab ftfcace f proper feeling towards tliem but itis a fact worthy of remark that all the sympathy expressed or manifested for the colored people by the speakers emanated from the win and democratic members and save c f messrs chase and perhaps hull none from the liberty party delegates i cannot cnuoteuiace and tolerate in liberty men that wkiek l hive ever condemned in the oij conservative parties tail shall say here as i have and shall ever say elsewhere that i hope that our liberty party brethren may never lose sight of the fundaments aad pri raarv object of their party at least of anti slaverv organizations because so soon as they become conservative they cease to bethe friends of the oppiessed and like the other parties stand as despots and tyrants resting in very indifference with their horrible weight upon crushed and outraged humanity i earnestly entreat our liberty brethren in their deliberations to think and say more about the slave and the condition of the free colored people if these be discarded if as have heard it asserted these form no essential part of the liberty party if indeed these form not the foundation upon which rests the liberty templethen let it with the other parties be scattered to the four winds of heaven and by every colored person loathed as a monster in disguise like the liberty boys of seventysix only requiring power to carry their designs into execution but we must and shall hope and believe differently until the contrary be fully proven and ithen and not till then shall we lift up the ibattleaxe in vindictive warfaie against it ißut our friends if they desire our cooera ition or approbation must not forget or neg llect our interest this is imperative we lhave been duped and cajoled now quite suff icient the liberty convention met on thursday frit d

those country places went being attracted there by the novelty of strangers yet apprehended nothing more then usual in such cases i was soon in a polite manner questioned by the proprietor of the hotel whom i found to he a liberty man who suspecting our mission and who had attended the recent columbus convention and withal a very clever man finding who i was and learning my miesioo a meeting was immediately proposed by this gentleman whose name neglecting to note down have since forgotten consultation being had with several persons especially one person pretending to bean abolitionist who sat in the room with us making many inquiries about douglass garrison and reroond arrangements were effected and a meeting determined upon the house being lighted in a few minutes as it was now dark mr langston and i went off to the place of meeting the school house on passing along the streets the sideways were strung along with young men lads and boys among whom were those who were the most eager for the meeting aad had lighted up the house who as we passed scoffed and used disrespectful language falling in the train immediately behind us and close to oui heels until we entered the arhoolhouate which we found empty with the exception of some three or four respectablelooking men who appealed as if they came for the sake of the meeting we had barely entered the house w heu they came pouring in boys and men to the number of perhaps forty or fifty looking ready and eager for any and every mischief to this however i make the exception of about half a doaen gentlemen among w hom are included our host of the hotel and a bookbinder who sojourned at the same house when on our way to the schoolhouse i turned back for a copy of the paper mr langston slopping by the wayside to wait for me w ho being so light in color that many of them mistook him to be what is called white hence he had a favorable opportunity to hear their schemes and language concerning us on my return to mr langston he immediately related to me what he had heard peremptorily refusing in consequence of the disrespectful spirit manifested and the conduct of ilie persons present to speak at all on the occasion rose up and in a respectful manner declined to speak under the circumstances the house it is true was quiet and may have for aught i know remained so until had finished a long diseouse at least until some position was taken which displeased them when from what really followed it would not then be difficult to determine the consequence the host of the hotel and one other gentleman whose motives there is no doubt were the best hoped that i would give them a lecture they having no idea of the cause of my refusal ins tauter a man rose up the identical person who had previously judaslike manifested at the hotel such friendly feelings and observed i move that we adjourn by considering this a darkey burlesque tills was but food for the rabble all leaving the bouse with a loud shput of darkey burlesque and this repeated continually with many other epithets of disparagement until we reached the hotel but nothing less than a mob would satisfy these craven wretches they bad come to the meeting with the full intention and were now ready to destroy us by the aid of any hand that would administer to their wrath and second their vengeance the more effectually to accomplish their object a brass drum tamborine clarionet violin jawbone of a horse castanets and a number of other instruments or whatever would lend to excite and rally a formidable mob did these miserable outlaws resort to the crowd which consisted well nigh ol all the men and boys in the neighborhoodwho were able to throw a brickbat being now assembled the tar and feathers w ere de j inanded with a tone which told forcibly the determination with which they intended carrying out their threats a tar barrel was procured and after many yelps and howls whief rent the air around they succeeded in tht the course of some twenty minutes in staving in the head but it appeared that this barre had been too closely diained of its contents and as the village was but small thete trai i none other in the place as the barrel wai i obtained from the principal store directly opposite the hotel which place was the genera headquarters of the rowdies for the night failing to find tar suffcent in w inch to saturate us they resorted to another expedient which they were certain would lave th desired effect a torch was brought an the tar barrel set in a flame when store boxes were piled upon it which produced a fire

persevere in their efforts for the oppressed and suffering bondmen who still remain toiling unrequited in the southern prison house we are frequently brought painfully to remember that uot only b their labor wrested from them unremunerated not only do they suffer from intense hunger and cold not only are the females ova sisters subjected to the cruel and passionate outrages of their tyrannical masters and overseers but there are daily instances of sundering the dearest ties in nature thus separating them forever and can we expect anything bettercan we look for benevolence or fine feelings from a system so foul and fiendish as slavery it would be unreasonable because a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit therefore knowing that without associative action we cannot render efficient aid to this holy cause we affectionately invite the cooperation of the citizens of rochester and the public generally we ask them to bear in mind the injunctions of jesus all things whatsoever ye

of corruption and wickedness we should be a light to the world we hope no one will feel too poor nor any too rich to enlist in this holy cause the christians influence in whatever situation is always salutary and will certainly produce its good effects we ask for the aid of men and of women we call on the old and the young the farmer the mechanic and the merchant we ask all and every one to give us their help to devote what they can spare either of money or of the fruits of their lar bor to the work of restoring men and women to themselves to their manhood to the rights and blessings with which they were endowed by our creator for this object we propose holding a fair in december next we ask the females in the adjoining towns and country around us to get up sewing circles and prepare such articles as will be most saleable and to come fur i nish tables give us their company and help us not only in selling those things thus prepared but in convincing the public mind of i the necessity of our perseverance and fidelity and thus be helpers in hastening the day of emancipation sketch of the life amd character of david walker it it generally the dew re of the vender of any intellectual production to know aometking of the character and the life of the author the character of datid ifalker is indicated in hia writings in regard to his life but a few materials can be gathered but i what is known of him furnishes protl to the opinion which the friends of man have formed of himthat he possessed i a noble and a courageous spirit andr that be was ardently attached to the t cause of liberty mr walker was born in wilming l ton north carolina sept  his mother was a free woman and his father was a slave his innate hatred to slavery was vary early developed j when yet a boy he declared that the slaveholding south was not the place for him his soul became so indignant at the wrongs which his father and his kindred bore that he determined to rind some portion of his country where he would see less to harrow up hit soul said he if i remain in thu bloody land i will not live long at true as god reigns i will be avenged for the sorrow which my people have suffered this is not the place for meno no i must leave this part of the r country it will be a great trial for me to live on the same soil where so many men are in slavery certainly i cannot remain where i must hear their chains continually and where must encounter the insults of their hypocritical enslavers go i must the youthful walker embraced his mother and received a mothers blessings and turned his back upon north carolina his father died a few months before his birth and it is a remarkable coincidence that the son of the subject of this memoir was a posthumous child after leaving home david walker travelled rapidly towards the north shaking off the dust of his feet and breathing curses upon the system of l human slavery americas darling institution as might be expected het met with trials during his journey and at last he reached boston mass where he took up his permanent residence there he applied himself to study and soon learned to read and write in order that he might contribute something to the cause of humanity mr walker like most of reformers was a poor manhe lived poor and died poor in he entered into the clothing business in brattle street in which he prospered and had it not been for his great liberalityand hospitality he would have become wealthy in he married miss eliza he was emphatically a selfmade man and he spent all his leisure moments in the cultivation of his mind before the antislavery reformation had assumed a form he was ardently engaged in the work his hands were always open to contribute to the wants of the fugitive his house was the shelter and the home of the poor and needy mr walkei is known principally by his appeal but it was in his private walks and by his unceasing labors in the cause oi freedom that he has made his memory sacred with an overflowing heart he published his appeal in this little book produced more commotion among slaveholders than any volume of its size that was ever issued from an american press they saw that it was a bold attack upon their idolatry and that too by a black man who once lived among them it was merely a smooth stone which this david took up yet il terrified a host of goliaths when the fame of this book reached the south the poor cowardly pusillanimous tyrants grew pale behind their cotton bags and armed themselves to the teeth they set watches to look aftei their happy and contented slaves the governor of georgia wrote to the hon harrison grey otis the mayor of boston requesting him to suppress the appeal his honor replied to the southern censor that he had no power nor disposition to hinder mr walker from pursuing a lawful course in the utterance of his thoughts a company of georgia men then bound themselves by an oath that they would eat as little as possible until they had killed the youthful author they also offered a reward of a thousand dollars for his head and ten times as much for the live walker his consort with the solicitude of an affectionaie wife together with some friends advised him to go to canada lest he should be abducted walker said that he had nothing to fear from such a pack of coward bloodhounds but if he did go ho would hurl back such thunder across the great lakes that would cause them to tremble in their strong holds said hei will stand my ground somebody tntwf die t this cause may be doomed to the stake and the fire or to the scaffold tree but it is not in me to falter if i can promote the work of emancipation he did not leave the country but was soon laid in the grave it was the opinion of many that he was hurried out of life by the means of poison but whether this was the cause or not the writer is not prepared to affirm he had many enemies and not a few were his brethren whose cause he espoused they said that he went too far and was making trouble so the jews spoke of moses they valued the fleshpots of egypt more than the milk and honey of canaan he died in bridge street at the hopeful and enthusiastic age of years his ruling passion blazed up in tbe hour of death and threw an indescribable grandeur over tbe last dark scene the heroic young man passed away without a struggle and a few weeping friends is

head quarters was at this inn one of these officers was given to habits of intemperance and sometimes after hard drinking he became quarrelsome and irrational approaching ever to madness one afternoon having sat long over the bottle a difference arose between him and a brother officer when he became so furious throug intoxication that he drew his sword and dared his opponent in a single combat at the same time rushing intc the yard ready for the bloody purpose there he continued raving and reeling for some time with his naked swore flourishing about making very ludicrous gesticulations and shouting fort most amusing potvaliant defiances when a number of thoughtless peopu gathered around him to enjoy the fun at this juncture the landlady observing the scene concluded that murder woulc most assuredly follow and that foi which her husband who was then absent might be seriously brought intc trouble and she was so affected at the sight that she fainted in this dilemma mrs winter was hastily applied to for advice and assistance and having surveyed the ground she immediately perceived the danger the people were in of being wounded or killed through some eccentric lounge of the drunken warrior and she paused a few moments to consider if she could do anything to avert such a catastrophe confiding in the purity of her motives she now put on her bonnet and proceeded to the scene of action having quietly made her way through the crowd she placed herself directly before the vaunting soldier at the same time looking him placidly in the face his countenance quickly fell and he ceased his boasting gazing on his unexpected visitant with awe and reverence as though she had been an angel mrs winter now very gently put hei hand on the hilt of his sword when he unconsciously relaxed his grasp anc she drew it away from him having secured the dangerous weapon she carried it home to her owr apartment to the no small amusement of those who witnessed the hazardous deed the drunken man having stared vacantly around him for a while staggered off to his quarters and slept away the fumes of his potations oi awakening a few hours afterw ards hi recollection returned and he inquirec anxiously for his sword as his appearance without it on parade next morning might lead to some very awkward inquiries he therefore sent his servant with major s compliments t mrs winter and begged that she would return the weapon her answei was that she had it safely locked upii her closet and if he would call hirnsel in the morning she would deliver it t him these were hard terms for i british officer to submit to but he very prudently considered under present circumstances it was the best policy to yield in the morning the major arose fully sensible of the folly he had been guilty of and the dilemma in which he ha placed himself he however determined now to pursue the only righ course before him mortifying as it wai to his feelings and he accordingly sought an interview with mrs winter to whom he apologized very amplyan acknowledged himself under the greatest obligation for her kind and timely interference mrs winter then restored his sword desiring him to replace it in the scabbard after whici she delivered him a short lecture on tin benefits arising from temperance anc peace promising to be more rircum spect in his future conduct and agair thanking her for her kindness he departed let us hope a somewhat wisei and better man peace advocate oconnells tact in crossex amination he was once examining a witness whose inebriety at the time to which the evidence

of waste lands a tract of land containing sointiiiing like a thousand acres hitherto entirely unimproved south of hicbsville long island has been purchased for a company of germans who are to take

called to order by d r chapman esq and organised by ibe choice of william b sropner esq as chairman vice presidents james tolraan f f boure dr walter channing t p chandler esq secretaries george f williams j j meston the chairman addressed the meeting in a few appropriate remarks as follows fellow citizens every body knows who joshua r giddings is now that john q adams was no more mr giddings was the great champion of freedom in the house of representatives and upon him the mantle of that venerable statesman had fallen he alluded to the argument that having sent delegates to the philadelphia convention those delegates and those by whom they were sent were bound to adopt the candidate nominated but they had sent their delegates to nominate a whig and he asked whether gen taylor could becalled a whig one whig measure was that slavery should not be extended over new territory but gen taylor had never given a word of assurance on that point it was against the course of human nature to suppose that a man who was born in a slave state moved into another bought a plantation of slaves in a third who fought the battles of slavery first in the seminole war and afterwards in the mexican war could be opposed to the extension of slavery mr taylor was a slave man and there was no mistake about it perhaps the autocrat of russia or the jdey of algiers might be honest men but he would ask if such men had the right sort of principles to govern a free people the amount of it was that he was the candidate of war and slavery his flag was black its stars were blotted out its stripes were red boston whig greeley coming out right saturdays tribune contains an excellent article from mr greeleys pen entitled no compromise of which the following is the conclusion then let the friends of freedom stand firm we shall never be more ready for the struggle than now the general breaking up of party lines is auspicious to the formation and expression of free sentiment let us meet the danger at the threshhold opposing firmness to violence and calmness to threats the north may be betrayed as she has heretofore been but let no true man flinch or falter let a political grave yawn by the side of every traitor while every man who prizes liberty too high to sell it and reveres principle too much to compromise it stand like a rock hy the side of universal freedom pass the watchword from rank to rank and see what coward lip it blanches what false heart it flutters jyo extension of slavery this looks encouraging we have strong hopes that mr greeley will decide to act for freedom he exerts a powerful influence and we believe he has it in his power to prevent general taylors election by the people thousands of freemen are awaiting mr greeleys decision will he not take a manly stand on the side of freedom hampshire herald slavery requisition on ohio for persons aiding slaves to escape we learn that fifteen citizens of this state have been arrested on a warrant issued by a justice of warren county and held to bail in the sum of apiece to await the answer of the governor of ohio to the requisition of the governor of kentucky for their presence at the court of common pleas of campbell i county ky to answer to the charge of stealing five slaves the property of citizens of that county the affidavit upon which this warrant was issued was made by gen taylor of newport if we mistake not everything now depends upon gov bibb they cannot be compelled to appear in kentucky l u p oo hla answer to the requuiti i will he deliver them up they cannot be charged with having committed i the crime m kentucky eacept constructively by aiding and abetting after the escape of the slaves the example of gov shunk will recur to every one he retused to comply with the requisition of the governor of maryland founded on an indictment for the reason that no such constructive presence could he admitted in law we do not think that gov bibb would de kexr if reave understand that corwin and codings have been retained to manage the suit the arrested persons are resident in various parts of the state on the line from here to sandusky city and are ail of them of high respectability  bince the above was written we rm gov bibb baa begged tobe excused from complying with the p que of the governor of kentucky on the ground that ohio lawf dot recognize property in manci cwmalt herald my frtaad has a great reverence idt the truth said baronet to a gsntkman so i perceive waa the pirtfal the it is a fact well worthy of notice that the anglosaxon the phoootypic newspaper published in this city by andrews and boyle has attained the extraordinary errcautioa of six thousand weekly n little asore than one year since he establishment this is certainly one of the boldest attempt at innovation on a large scale that we have ever known and is so far decidedly one of the most successfek phoaotypy and phonography together constitute what is known as the language reform or the writing and spelling reformation we have heretofore spoken approvingly of the principle which lies at the bottom of this movement but apart from its merits the fact that a family newspaper in the english language printed in an entirely new system of spelling words with analphabet of fortytwo letters instead of the twentyeix old stagers which have served our forefathers is liberally sustained and that its circulation is rapidly increasing is indisputably one of the most striking and singular phenomena of the nineteenth century the sheet itself is one of the curiosities oflitera ture to the uniformed eye it may seem the absurdest thing imaginable but the reputation of its conductors for scholarship the fact that their labors are not only approved and sanctioned but warmly advocated by some of those most interested in education together with the success which accompanies the undertaking should at least render these who have not thoroughly studied its principles and understood its advantages somewhat modest in condemning it phonography a kind of rapid and scientific short hand is rapidly coming into use for verbatim reporting and even for letterwriting it is undoubtedly the most perfect system of writing ever invented i he most obvious and immediate use of phonotype is its influence in correcting false habits of pronunciation a years reading of the anglosaxon for this purpose only must be worth far more as a means olfamily education than its subscription price of two dollars and even more than years of systematic study devoted to pronouncing dictionaries children read the paper at once prompted by mere curiosity at its novelty and incidentally they learn the true pronunciation of every word in the lan guagephonotype being an exact representation of speech we wish the enterprising editors and conductors of the anglosaxon even more triumphant success in future jy y evening posl selfemancipated the rochester american in a letter from augusta georgia gives the following noble instance of man struggling to be free the talk of the town toda is the departure of frank shadwick a self emancipated slave his wife and children to seek a more congenial home in the state of pennsylvania this slave who is a native of this beautiful city began his work of emancipation by purchasing his time from year to year at about loo per annumthe usual hires jfor a good servaut possessing great energy and much intelligence with perfect integrity he could both oversee other slaves and labor well himself and very justly commanded his wages his surplus earnings soon brought him horses and drays and enabled him to hire good servants of such as had them to spare thus established in business in the course of years he has made money enough to buy himself at about looo to pay a larger sum for his wife and children and take to harrisburg three or four thousand dollars besides some ten or twelve of the first men in augusta united in giving him a letter ol high commendation it was with pain and reluctance that frank left his troops of friends and the scenes of his childhood the only motive was the lawful education of his children an advantage denied them by the laws ol georgia ocean penny postagewill it pay there is one fact of great importance lying at the threshold of our argument for an ocean penny postage the english government has never stipulated with any ocean steam packet company to adhere to any fixed price of postage on letters or newspapers transmitted in its mails if the government should ever undertake to convev the letters of the world across the ocean for nothing it would be no breach of contract with cunards or any other steam packet line in contract with these lines not the slightest allusion was probably made to the rates of postage which would be charged on the matter conveyed in the mail bags let it be remembeied then that in giving the world an ocean penny postage england will not have to pay a farthing more per annum to the steam packet lines in her service than she does at the present rates of postage on letters and newspapers to and from ccuntrio beyond the seas there can be no reason to doubt that the ocean which divides between live old world and the new is to become a vast field of competition between the great commercial nations tor the transportation of mail matter and passengers the english lines can bid as low for this carrying trade as any other nation on the globe and there is no reason to doubt that they would be glad to retain their present price of carrying the mails between eogktod and america though newspaper were free of charge and only a penny apiece when uoder halfan ounce in weight perhaps this fact in itself may serve to soflea down the obstacles to an ocean penny postage which occur to the minds of those who casually glance at the proposition froma certain magnifying distance blood or ajv inebriate lir pray recently bled a toper and found
