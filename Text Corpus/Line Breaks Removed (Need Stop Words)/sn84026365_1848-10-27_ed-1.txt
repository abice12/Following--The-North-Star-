from the philadelphia republic slave representation it is strictly correct to say that the slaveholders cast in effect votes for every five slaves which they hold that is the vote of a southerner who owns five slaves goes as far in the election of a member of congress as the ballots cast by four northern men this statement does notjnean that he deposits four ballots in the box nor that bis one ballot is counted as four on the tally list but that in apportioning the congressional representation of the union five slaves are counted as three freemen and the citizens of the slave states have the advantage of this addition to their own number in the apportionment of the members of congress to them south carolina with only five or six thousand more free white inhabitants than philadelphia city and county in ilo would have been entitled to the same number of congressmen but by the addition of threefifths of her slaves to the number of her free people she took seven members instead of tour and so enjoys the advantage of three congressmen over and above the equal free population of our own four districts the southern slaveholder has no advantage at the ballotbox over the southern nondaveholdcr but he has it against the northern freeman altogether this threefilths rule gives the fifteen slave states twentyone members of the lower house and as many votes in the election of president and vicepresident for which the north has no equivalent or compensation they have twentyone members who represent property merely the north has no representation of her property but only of her people these twenty one votes are enough to decide almost any question which greatly concefns the welfare of the country the northern light states the mat ler in the following clear and striking manner in io the number of slaves in the united states was in round numbers two millions and a half in apportioning the representatives in congress among the states slaves are counted that is to say every five slaves including both sexes nl ijimpßll m r counted equal to three wntreftgpjns and thus the equal weight in determiuimlfclß tuner of members of the alive states to f sons by the ratio of representation established in founded on the census of io every persons are entitled to one member in the house of representatives the slave states have therefore on the strength of their laves tweotyone members of that house this is equal to the entire representation of the five states of maine new hampshire vermont rh e island and connecticut it is equal to the whole representation of the state ot ohio and nearly equal to that ol pennsylvania it is nearly twothirds of the state of new york it is equal to the representation of massachusetts new jersey connecticut and rhode island it is greater than that of the states of indiana illinois and michigan it is just three times as great as that of the young and vigorous states of wisconsin and lowa again south carolina by the census of io has a free population of this entitles her to three members of the house of representatives the north starr with a fraction or of people it seems that fear member were awarded to her on the basis of hei white population she has a slave population of threefifths of hei slaves are this divided bj th the ratio of representation would give her taro members with fraction or overplus of sh has in the house of representatives four members on the basis of her free population and three on the basis o her slaves hut the whole seven are i elected by her free population who arc j the only constituents and the only persons whose interests arc represented divide the free population of fmj by the number of representatives and it will be found that in south carolina every free persons have a member of the house of representatives but in the state of new york and in every free state there is only one member for every free inhabitants thus the slaveholders have nearly double the representation in that house that the same number of citi i zens in new york have i this is unjust and unequal if it be regarded as a representation founded on numbers it is more unjust and unequal if regarded as a representation founded on property because you may select in the state of new york a portion of its population equal to the free population of south caiolina who are worth the whole stale of south carolina counting every negro at his full value and all other property at the same rate nevertheless the citizens of new y t ork have in the house of representatives only a little over half the number of members which the same number of the free people of south carolina have take another example florida by the census of contained people of whom were slaves the free population therefore wasonly  and yet it had a representative in congress and two senators in the senate of the united states l its political power is equal to the state of new york but compare the representation of the lower house with that of new york take the census of and give us a member for every inhabitants the number of free people in florida and instead of sending members this state would send eightyfour but the slaveholders are not satisfied with this enormous disparity of political power they demand more and threaten to dissolve the union if they do rtot obtain it kale ol aw american citizen the following pithy article is written by mrs jane swissheltn of the pittsburgh saturday visitor the writer refers to roberts the colored preacher who was sold for one year for because he bad taken up his residence in kentucky contrary to the barbarous enactment of that state which makes it unlawful for colored men to remain thereover a limited period i believe it lias since been found that the sentence was unconstitutional and roberts will necessarily be liberated but the mean arid miserable spirit of the kentuckians is not on that account the less apparent j d yvc call attention to the article from the gazette about the sale of the preacher in louisville who was adjudged not to be a citizen of the united states and so not entitled to protection under the constitution how will massachusetts and the other states which recognize the colored mans right of sulfrage like this comment upon their laws a kentucky judge can tell them whom they may reckon citizens aud whom not to us the idea is novel that a man born in a country free by the laws thereof is not a citizen of that country this resort of this petty tyrant is about a match for calhouns position that men are born and only one ever was created the judge allows free negroes may be born but they cannot be born americans what next y t ill the insolent bragadocia womanwhipping chivalry of kentucky who put ladies in the penitentiary for beingacquainted with folks who aid the spoiled to ascapej from the hands of the spoiler beper mitted to sell free citizens of the north for the crime of going into one of their polluted cities to shave their impudent faces for sixpence a piece the state that put miss yy t ebster in the penitentiary for riding in the carriage with a methodist preacher who was aiding her slaves to regain their liberty was well employed in selling another methodist preacher for acting barber for them in kentucky slavery exists in its mildest formit was there in louisville we gained our ideas of slaveholders and touud the utter impotence of language to convey any impression j of their meanness much has been said about their cruelty and tvranny but their mean lousy idleness was the feature which struck usthe cowardice which induced them to threaten us with ja coat of tar and feathers for telling them they were not men but woman whippera ibr fear as th said such talk should overthrow tie stitutions just think of a set of knows calling themselves men and living under the institutions they are afraid some little old woman will blow overjust think of them breaking up a barber shop and selling the barber for fear that he should subvert their glorious institutions and teach their happy slaves torun from their eden yve were once badly off for a girl when there and mr is mentioned it to a big loaferwho used to go swaggering through the streets all day in satin broadcloth fine linen and gold chains with a cigar in his teeth flis lofcrstup informed him with a  p right is o no sextruth is of no colrgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren pompous swell that he had a woman tc hire a firstrate servant that we coulc have for two hundred per annum buli added she would be of no use to thai wife of ours unless you would horsewhip her twice a week yourself how we felt to think such an animal had dared to measure our abilities for wringing unpaid toil out of the sinews of an one of god s creatures or had the iu solence to propose that our husbsflnb should horsewhip an old woman one hundred and four times to make her earn two hundred dollars for any idler to spend in cigars and debauchery this is a specimen of their chivalry thousands of fellows swagger round acting the dandy while some poor crippled old man is sawing wood or some old wofpan wpshing to support them if there is anything on gods green earth as mean as a kentucky slaveholder it must be a similar animal in some other state they have a cant phrase there about the meanness of stealing cents off a dead niggers eyes but it is almost as clever to steal them out of a living niggers pockets this bounds our ideas of gen taylor he hires a man or a thing that looks like one to whip old men and women young ones and children to make them work for him when he was away hunting squaws and pappooses in florida and killing women and children in mexico his overseer was on the banks of the mississippi whipping twelve hundred bales of cotton per annum out of the unpaid laborers whom the old hero claims to own body and soul and who never were taught to read or write or cypher either well well he is a beauty and these preacher selling chivalry are all beauties after their kind every animal after its kind the name or thought of them fills us with loathing they are so mean so little so contemptible  from the practical christian the political skies watchman what of the night look up into the political skies read the signs thereof let the constellations declare the coming future let the grey streaks of early dawn proclaim the approaching morning downtrod j den humanity hll up thy head for thy redemption is foretokened in the firmament the lord god omnipottnt reigneth he frustrafeth the tokens of the liars and maketh diviners mad he taketh the wise in their own crafti nessand the counsel of the froward is carried headlong they meet with darkness in the daytime and grope in the noonday as in the night so the poor btw bivnr and uvtguily slop pet bt tier mouth democratic proslavery has nominated lewis cass and whig proslavery has nominated zachary taylor for president of the united states what were these two great partizan assemblages at baltimore and at philadelphia essentially better than political inobs the most profligate and unprincipled trampled underfoot the more decent and well disposed members and impudently proclaimed the dictates of slaveocratic despotism to be the supreme law of their respective parties the whole of it is utterly abominable but we rejoice at it with devout thanksgiving to god the cloven fool which the seers have so long endeavored to make the people see now kicks out from beneath the silken robes of deceit and unintentionally kicks thousands of professed freemen into their senses god he praised that the majority of the baltimore convention were left to nominate a most supple and servile northern man with southern politics as their candidate for the presidency and thrice praised be his holy name that the majority of the philadelphia convention were left to nominate a mighty hunter and holder of slaves distinguished as a commanderinchief of both human and canine bloodhounds we have now fairly entered on the beginning of the end the two great political parties which have so long vied with each other which should crouch lowest before the juggernaut of sayery are now doing their last obeis and they are doing it in a quag which if either of them ever cdfcesout alive it will come out a poor bedaubed thing so smutty as to require at least a decent hath and a clean suit of clothes the great political disease of this nation is hastening to its crisis it is this that rejoices us we rejoice not at the iniquities and profligacies of corrupt men in high places but we do rejoice that a wicked oligarchy is on the eve of its final and everlasting overthrow and at all the signs of the times which foretoken such a consummation our heart becomes more and more hopeful we now behold the two sets of political gamblers playing their last game they have become desperate their eyes are fatally fixed on the grand stake they go the whole hog for slavery they have delivered themselves over body and soul in a league with the devil and when they have got through he will jost pitch them into the bottomless pit but what is taking place among the people of the the north they are waking up and coming to their sense the stern outcry and flaming sword of abolitionism behind them and the roar of the devouring monger in front of them lapping his bloody jaws aud growling for fresh blood have roused thousands and tens of thousands from their long slumbers every where we hear of men formerly devoted to the two great political parties trampling their allegiance under fool denouncing the nominations of cass sad taylor and pledging themselves to stand up manfully against the anther spread and domination of dare rochester n y friday october  ry hitherto the chains of party havi been indissoluble now they are snapping asunder like the withes aboul sampson when he heard the shout the philistines be upon thee samp son what then may we anticipate taylor may possibly be elected by thel united forces of ail the proslavery cle i ments north aud south if so the whig party dies of proslavery infamy if not it dies under the compound effect of infamy and defeat henceforth it may be considered incurable taylor should be elected the worst elements of the old socalled democratic party will coalesce with the worst elements of the other and share with them the spoils for sfocbary taylor will be pretty muchatch a whig as john tyler proved rramalf meantime whether taylor or casa succeeds or the election by the people fail the new york barnburner democrats will leadoff and consolidate around them a regenerated democratic party which will ultimately combine in it the conscience whigs take the wind out ol the sails of the liberty party be forced forward by the moral power abolitionists draw into it the masses ol the whole north and not improbably enough of the south to bring about the formal abolition of slavery throughout the union or else necessitate a dissolution of the union which will soon be followed by inevitable abolition this will come step by step but the steps will succeed each other much more rapidly than many are now prepared to anticipate is the process of these political movements the new and powerful democratic party growing up will lose nothing of that bold determined goaheadativeness through thick aud thin which has given the old rotten party all its successes hut it will receive such an infusion of moral stamina from its new materials as to render it altogether more rational considerate and just in its measures than any preceding party it will ultimately become a party of moral and social progress it will at no distant day abolish ail political and governmental oaths and every good man will be left at full liberty to vote hold office and discharge all his duties as a citizen without compromising his moral integrity as is nowthe case by a wicked promise expressed or implied to go for his country right or wrong to support the evil aswell as the good of the civil constitution to execute human laws however contrary to divine law audio be bound by the will of majorities against the dictates of a good conscience all this stuff must go by the board sooner or later the moral reformers the true amistavery people nonresistants and peacemen are now excluded from political action by these vile claptrap oaths which being set at the threshold of every governmental office ensnare the simple drive off the upright and focilitate the ingress ol the unscrupulous who dan swear to any thing and then act as they list when these oaths and engagements are abolished government will rapidly advance to its perfectionits full chris tianizationits true moral excellency and usefulness such are our interpretations of the signs in the present political skies and such our anticipation of the progress ot events in this country twentyfive years will develop astonishing results humanity will gain directly or indirectly by every overturn and modification of political affairs but moral forces are the controlling forces of the power behind the throne greater than the throne those who do most to change the politics of this country are the men of moral principle who stand behind politics and compel politicians to raise their moral standard let these continue faithful bide their time and only enter into actual politics when politics bow implicitly to principle the new states the following table whi show the time when the new states or those not included in

committee in senate hut no further action on the subject jour of commerce wars are unprofitable war is usually a source of taxation and oppression most of the european nations are now ground down with taxes to pay the interest on national debts incurred in prosecuting unjust and unnecessary wars england and ireland are sorely oppressed by taxation the main purpose of which is to pay the interest on her vast war debt much of which might have been avoided if the government had been wise and desirous of remaining at peace hut the folly of the rulers in plunging the people into war has caused the whole population to groan for aces under the weight of heavy taxation the unprofitableness of military conquests is illustrated in the case of france and algiers france undertook o conquer algiers cut easy job she succeeded at the cost of much treasure and took possession of the country and reduced it to the condition of a french province but ever since the conquest it has been found necessary to keep soldiers in that region to keep the inhabitants insubjection and every year since the conquest the cost of occupation has been more than one hundred millions of dollars over and above all the taxes imposts and revenues that could be exacted or extorted from the people of conquered algiers thus the conquest turns out to be a permanent loss a lasting evil this is the case in the occupation of a country that only extends about two hundred miles from the sea coast the united states undertook to make war on mexico and many of our citizens supposed that it would he a very light affair to conquer that country the mexican war might have been easily avoided if onehundredth part of the trouble that was taken to prevent war with great britain about oregon had been taken to preserve peace with mexico but the government was dazzled with the idea of national aggrandizement and military conquest and acted so as to precipitate a warthe consequence has been that thirty thousand of our citizens have fallen victims to the sword to sickness and to the casualties of war and the nation has in prosecuting the convuest expended at least one hundred and fifty millions of dollars but the end is not i yet peace is made and an army of occupation will have to be kept to occupy the conquered portion of mexi j co will require nearly as many men and cost nearly as much money as the occupancy of algiers bacause the country is more extensive more difficult acid further distant and the people more restive treacherous and turbu lent if the idea of occupancy or of conquest of mexico be adhered to we must calculate that it may cost us one f hundred millions of dollars every year j this in ten years will make a thousand millions and thus a huge debt will be accumulating that will press heavily jupon the people for the next genera j non this debt will cripple business paralyze enterprize and hang as a f heavy weight on all useful branches of j business the people engaged in agriculture commerce manufactures and other useful branches of business will j have to pay for the folly of the politii cians and for the glory of the military the office holders the military officers the public agents and contractors the jobbers speculators party favorites and political loafers may grow rich by the war and they will exert their influence in favor of war conquest and military occupation but the people want peace and must in every even be the sufferers by war st la era punch says that the milk of human kindness is not to be found in the pail of society if so we think it is time for all hands as pat would say to kkk the bucket the merchant and quakem a merchant of london bad a dispute with a quaker respecting the settlement of an accouat the mere ban was determined to bring the question into court a proceeding which the quaker deprecatedusing every argument in his power to convince the merchant ol his error but the latter was inflexible desirous to make a last effort the quaker called at nia house one morning and inquired of the servant if his master was at home the merchant hearing the inquiry suid knowing the voice called aloud from the top of the stairs tell that rascal im not at home the quaker looking up towards him calmly said well friend god put thee in a better mind the merchant struck with the meekness of the reply and having more deliberately investigated the matter became convinced that the quaker was right and lie was wrong he requested tosee him and after acknowledging his error he said i have one question to ask you how were you ablewith such patience on various occasions to bear mv abuse friend replied the quaker i will tell thee i was naturally as hot and violent as thou art i knew that to indulge this temper was sin andi found that it was imprudent i observed that men in a passion always spoke loud and i thought that if i could control my voice i should suppress my passion i have therefore made it a rule never to suffer my voice to rise above a certain key am by a careful observance of this rule i have with the blessing of god entirely mastered my natural temper the quaker reasoned philosophically and the merchant as every one else may be was benefilted by his example a righteous decision some time ago a poor fugitive escaped from maryland nnd hotly followed by tiie pursuer on his way to safety beneath the broad flag of old england in canada was overtaken and seized in vermont the abolitionists iustantly got out a habeas corpus and carried all parties before the court to see what warrant they had to arrest any man in vermont who had committed no crime three judges were on t e bench two of them youug and energetic one aged arid feeble who came to his seat by habit ot years but seldom spoke his eyes being dim and his strength abated the counsel spokethe defence wished to know why the man was held in custody the lawyer for the slaveholder rose to reply and said he should move that the offender was guilty of a breach of the laws of maryland state he was a slvae and had stolen himself the other lawyer thffl said he should require proof that he was a slave the slaveowner then stood up and held forth a document this he said is a bill of sale made in my favour for this man signed by his original owner the old judge rose to his feet and with a voice of thunder strangely loud for one so old demanded who signed it sir john williams replied the astonished owner take it away take it away said the old man taising his hanbs to heavenlt is not valid sir it is falsely signed sir it is a blasphemous forgery none can sign that bill of sale but god almighty the court was electrified the slaveholder slunk out and vermont awakened like a sleeper gave twenty thousand abolition votes at the

residing in illinois and may be relied on as veritable to illustrate the difficulty of getting a slave back into bondage let me give you a specimen of the jurisprudence of our country which occurred yesterday at our country seat woodstock two white men appeared in town having in custody two gentlemen of color whom they had taken in wisconsin as their property escaped from missouri these were brought before a magistrate in woodstock and claimed as their slaves the court decided that it had no jurisdiction in the case as the negroes were illegally taken by tbe plaintiffs out of the state whereupon the prisoners were discharged at the instance of the white man the men of color were then taken up for stealing two horses when they left missouri from plaint ills defendants acknowledged having stolen the horses alleging that they were indian horses not belonging to plaintiff a long debate here arose between the learned counsel whetherail being property the negroes stole tbe horses or the horse carried off and consequently stole the negroes the prisoners were again discharge d and went their way rejoicing in the blessing of liberty but the cud was not yet a suit was immediately instituted against plaintiffs on behalf of the people of the state for kidnapping and the court held them to bail in the sum of which not being able to obtain they were obliged to pay the amount and

would ask the editor of the north isiar to publish it also repcuully vours prior foster general agent boston oct to the public we the undersigned have examined all the books papers snd documents of mr prior foster agent of tin woodstock manual iahor school among these tapers we find his annual reports as agent from his first appointment up to the last year with the rotes of the trustees accepting and approving the same with their signatures attached we find also a written copy of an act incorporating the woodstock manual ialior school passed by the ol michigan last winter said copy being eerti i fied to by the secretary of state and addressed j to ud foster in an envelope postmarked lansing the capital of the state we find also a certificate dated april th signed by the president and secretary of the board of trustees appointing said foster agent to travel and collect funds for the institution and also another certificate signed by many of his ncighlmrs citizens of woodstock expressing their confidence in his honesty and integrity and their testimony to his labors and sacrifices in behalf of the institution and the education and elevation of his colored brethren we cannot doubt the genuineness of these documents and from our examination of them we are led to believe that the remarks made in a late number of your paper about mr foster arc unjust to him and that he is worthy of confidence as an honest nun and of encouragement and sympathy in his present enterprise revl s k loth hop f i huntington edward n kirk edward beecher francis parkman boston october boston oct this is to certify that i have lcen acquainted with mr prior foster for sonic eight years also know many who have been interested with him in the same enterprise also the president of the

fletcher meichants exchange boston october this may certify that i have been acquainted with p foster for twelve years past have every reason to esteem him as an upright rad strictly honest man and was extremely sorry to sec the cruel attack upon his character in the liberator and hope it may be immediately refuted m a adams springstreet boston p s since the above was prepared have received the following alluded to in my foregoing note p f jacksons mills octt h bkothkh foster our mass meeting came oft yesterday in good spirit though our gathering was not large and the day previous was the

board resolved that the report of prior foster general agent of the woodstock manual labor institute is entirely satisfactory to us and as more funds are still needed for the accomplishment of the good object for whiel the institution was established therefore we do hereby cordially recommend him to the confidence of all who are interested ill the education and elevation of our colored frieuds hoping that they will contribute freely for the accomplishment of this good object resolved that as the w m l institute has been established for the special benefit of the colored people by their friends without reference to party or sect we therefore recommend that the views peculiar to any one sect of christians be not taught at the institution d resolved that we deeply regret the course taken by one ol the editors of the north star in reference to prior foster agent of the woodstock manual labor institute because we balieve that it is calculated to injure the cause w hich must lie near the heart of every lover of humanity we also believe the statements made hv that paper ol august to be incorrect we are personally acquainted with prior foster and with the institution and have entered into a thorough examination of the books and accounts of the institution and of the doings ol the agent no fraud or deception having been discovered by us in the doings of the agent we trust the frieuds of education and of the colored people will not suffer their minds to he massed by such statements but reposing confidence in thu general agent w ill contribute freely and thus assist in

from colored persons in this country hare bad a wider circulation it seems to be hailed as the commencement of noble results even our old persecutors the colonization ims speak of the address in term of complacency the colonization herald published in philadelphia reviews the address in a spirit of kindness rather than candor it says je address embodies much good advice in spirit tone and composition it is superior to most of the addresses by abolitionists and it will we dare say commend itself accordingly to a wider circle of readers and secure for the furtherance of its objects a larger and more influential body of supporters among the benevolent in our land than has been obtained lor the more ardent not to say inflammatory and disorganizing appeals w hich have too often brought odium oni the cause of abolitionism as coloniza tionisis we have ever held the same opinions and advocated the same means of practical amelioration with those promulgated in the address we have appealed to the better ambition of the colored people and have urged them to take a higher position in the acalo of society than can be procured by continuing iu the menial offices noticed in the address if this were a true picture of colonizationists generally or to any considerable extent much cause for hostility to that society would be removed hut such unfortunately is not the case that society through its agents papers pamphlets tracts and books has ever held to the utter impossibility of colored persons occupying a higher position in the scale of society it has invaribly taken the facts of our present condition as fixed and final demonstrating that we can never fill higher stations in this country than those which we at present occupy whole volumes might be adduced to prove this charge if the altered condition of thingsthe growing interest felt in the cause of injured man ourselves includ edif a larger idea of christianity and democracy is finding its way into the public mind and a general spirit recognizing in every mana brother is pervading the heart of this great nation and colonizationists arc in common with others feeling its genial influence let them come out and confess their errortheir great want of faith in the truth and their countrymen and resolve to abandon their old and hurtful errors and none will mure readily forget and forgive their former errors and mistakes than we the victims who have suffered most by them let them take the course recently adopted by a large and influential class of politicians in this country many of whom like the colonizationists have been prominent in their opposition to every thing like the colored mans elevation in this country hut who iow stand forth the undisguised advocates of his rights now we say when the waters eire troubled let the lame halt and the blind of all classes jump in and he healed hut after all our colonization cotemporary des not even now advocate the elevation of the colored people while they remain in this countryfor he says n a spirit which looks somew hat boastful while abolitionists are claiming for thrir colored brethren iho italics are ours the full rights of citizenship and arguing that the latter ought to hold offices and he promoted to the social and political distinctions colonizationists now actually obtain for them an extensive field the full and entire enjoyment of those rights and a position and distinction which cannot be taken from them by popular caprice tumult or party management of the w hites in armver to this we may sav that had the same amount of money which has been applied to purposes of colonization been appropriated to the cause of elevation at home we should now see results far more happy and agreeable than a mere hand full of people called a republic in liberia f d colored churches iu philadelphia auother column will lie found a letter signed w d which will be read with interest especially by our readers in the city of philadelphia we extend to the writer of it a heartfelt welcome to the use of the columns of the north star and are exceedingly glad that he has taken up his pen and hope that he may be induced to write often in spirit and style his letter is admirable in grammatical accuracy and excellence of chirography his letter may be called a model such talents and attainments under a sable hue are worthy of a better cause than that which in this instance they are most unfortunately employed to defend the lateness in the week at which this lengthy communication arrived and the desire to give it immediate publicity and the necessity of passing it at once into the hands of the printer makes it impossible to give its contents such a review as some of our readers may think they deserve the exceptions which w d takes to our charges against stephen gloucesters church large bethel arid st thomass church we of course think unsupported and really ought not to require a length reply those charges are clear specific and strong and as we thiuk sustained by an array of striking facts which can neither be denied nor explained away to those facts we direct the attention of w d and all others lie is too much of a student and a reisonernot to acknowledge that wellattested facts cannot be set aside by a mere vague and general assumption the theory that because colored men are oppressed that they must be therefore necessarily the actict enemies of oppression is disproved by the whole history of our people upinencss indifference and timidity have ever been the rule while active oppo mutm to oppression has been the exception to our general conduct to be in uvur of the antislavery movement means something more than a quiet lokeron upon the struggle there is truly no neutral ground between liberty and slavery he who w not or us is against us you are cither helpers or hindranceeither pressing us forward or holding us back you cannot setve god and mammon at the same tnue you are our fnends or our enemies you either belong to our ranks of to the ranks of there hostile to us where then are the three colored j churches in philadelphia let the facta show tans coots abb booted sabbed ab aint those who abe the bjkhvx and acknowledged advocates ot libkhtt t and abb wide oftor to those who abe ex own and distinguished fob theib advocacy of slaveby to view of this disgraceful end incontrovertible fact can may ooe blame os for speaking of such churches as proslavery and occupying a position hostile to tbe antislavery cause t these churches are not only shot against the antislavery cause bat two of them at least are in full christian fellowship with those who gain their fortune by the blood of souls what is the antislavery movement in this country it is a movement on tbe part of a class of men and women who believing sl very to be a sin are acting in hannooy with that belief by proclaiming in the ear of nation the accumulated wrongs of tbe perishing slave and exposing the many embarrassments under which the nominally free colored people sutler and are demanding in the name of god and eternal justice immediate entire and unconditional emancipation for the former and equal rights for the latter this is the antislavery movement it is a movement it is not standing still its motive power is faith in god its wheels are tbe press and the living speaker and he who presumes to obstruct tbe one wheel or the other intentionally or umntentiqjpuy is thus hr hostile to the antislavery mnti mriif and deserves tobe branded thus by all who love the cause of human freedom more than the narrow bigotry of sectarianism but granting all this w d would hare us mourn over it rather than denounce it this is matter of opinion we will do both mourn over it and denounce it but while there are three millions of our brethren under the galling chains of slaveryscarred by the bloody lashshutout from their fellow crea turesdenied all rightsunable to tell their wrongs we may be pardoned if our tears should how for those rather than those traitors to the cause of righteous liberty who to gain the smiles of the oppressor meanly turn their backs upon the oppressed r d the hutchinson familyllnnkeiism the circumstances attending the visit paid last week to our youthful and beautiful city by these mountain songsters makes it deserving of special notice the proslavery and narrowsouled demon had preceded them old hunkcrism filled with pride and selfishness dreaded the presence of these high souled mountaineers in rochester it had no taste for their soulenlargingand heartmelting melody to defeat what it could not enjoy was its first object the ilulehinsons were described as poor performere their popularity was said to be on the wane abolitionism had ruined them c other modes were meanly adopted to disparage them in the estimation of the people of rochester in this mean work of detraction we scarcely need say that the miserable doughface who edits the cass paper in this city and through whom our daughter was basely excluded from seward seminary on account of her complexion very appropriately took the lead this selfelected umpire of taste in the city of rochester claims as much skill in matters relating to the harmony of sounds as he assumes with re spcct to the harmony of colors we warn the good people of llocheater against attending either seminaries or concerts on pain of being expelled from respectable and refined society should they venture to do so before obtaining the opinion of this most learned judge whose word is sufficient to set at defiance and veto the wishes of seminary of young ladies and misses webelicve he does not object to the virginia minslrels christys minstrels the ethiopian serenades or any of the filthy scum of white society who have stolen from us a complexion denied to them by nature in which to make money and pander to the comipt taste of their white fellowcitizens those performers are undoubtedly in harmony with his refined and elegant taste then those beautiful and highly sentimental songs which they sing such as ole zip coon jim crow ole dan tucker jim alone josey and a few other of such specimens of american m usical genius must spread over his spirit a charm and awaken in his bosom a rapture only equalled by that celestial transport which thrills his noble heart on witnessing a tremendous squash we ought perhaps to feel less indignation than compassion for any man to whom the aongs of our mountain warblers are disagrees ble such a fact betrays an unenviable state of mind more to be deplored than blamed it might not be an uninteresting investigation had we lime to pursue it to ascertain whether the fault really be in this mans organization or in oilier words whether his tastes are natural or acquired but lor this we have no time we understand that he says that their songs would do well enough were there touse his own diction less of nigger in them poor soul this tells the whole story we wonder what has excited within his heart this intense and burning hatred of niggers has he ever been eclipsed by a nigger was he ever refused the society of niggers has lie ever beeu robbed by a nigger hid a mgger ever steal and enslave a white man were his children ever excluded from school by a nigger if so there may be some extenuation of his burning hatred we were a little surprised to fiud so unhappy a specimen of cuhirphobia seated in a room as large as minerva hall on equal terms with niggers it may be after all that he is repenting of his old proslavery and that this is the first fruit of his repentance we shall therefore let him rest for the present at least until we shall have other developments from that quarter at to tbe concerts we doubt if two musical entertainments were ever more successful in rochester than those given by the hulchinsoo family on thursday and saturday evenings of last week in mmema hall a more uo propiuous evening thaa that of thursday could not well have been selected tbe streets were exceedingly muddy and therefore greatly against the attendance of ladies the night was cold dark and rainy and the price of tickets of admission was just double that asked by the most popular singers and yet l bey had a crowded house it is not however of their pecuniary oc cess that we would speak but of the real good done to their hearers when we entered minerva llall there was evidently some ill feclidg towa ids th e colored part of the au diene but as the glorious harmony proceeded easts stood abashedthe iron hearl of prejudice pride and acorn seemed to melt stray and the general expression of the audi enee aftong white and black confessed the truth of a common origin and a common brotherhood we all looked and felt alike our hearts were touched and saddened by the i slate mothers lament cheered and delighted with the good time coming wrapped in admiration of excelsior filled with indefinable associations by the old church bellsoftened to tears by the bridge of sighsinspired with a dauntless courage by the psalm of life and terrorstricken at the ship on fire the singing of this piece by john exceeded aoything of the kind to which we ever listened its value is not to be estimated by dollars and cents v e thought we bad beard john sing his best but never did we bear anything from him equal to the ship on fire he needed this song to call forth and bring into fercise his magnificent vocal powers in a w brief moments he dropped us in the midst of the wide waste of waters and in sympathy thrilled our hearts with almost the horror of the inmates of a ship oo fire the stilled cry of fire fire from the hold of the ship bursting up through smoke and flame and the wild screams of a frantic mother clinging to her sweet infant the long night spent on the shattered fragments of tho ship on the mad dashing billows the gratitude with which the light of day was hailed and the ecstacy of delight at the prospect of deliveiance were all most powerfully brought out this one perfonnance was worth more than double the price of admission they sung as usual the family song and brought into it the cause of temperance and antislavery singing the latter in the spirit as well as the understanding they have now left for the west we anticipate for them a brilliant career great success and great good to those who may be so fortunate as to hear their sweet mountain warblingr d we think some of getting up a picture of h g warner editor of the rochester courier in the act of driving a colored child out of seward seminary as general cass is soon to be consigned to oblivion the shades of which will probably overcast all his dupes and our hero among them we know of no better mode of rescuing his memory than by availing ourselves of the pencil of the artist we should like to have his opinion of the matter as w ithout his will we would do noth ingf da blind mans offering this is a neatlyprinted and wellbound book of four hundred and thirtytwo pages by b b bowen himself a blind man the object of the author in publishing his book is to excite in the public mind a deeper interest in the condition and claims of the blind the preface assures us that the book was written as it was delivered to the amanuensis without even the slightest verbal alteration we are acquainted

intrinsic value imparting a knowledge of the thoughts and feelings of one though in the midst of us is yet shut out from the sights and scenes of the world and for the sake of humanity this hook

years the secretaries of state have been chiefly southerners during the same period the south has held that office thirtynine and the north twenty years it thus appears that the south besides being as

this good cause as it regards those tried friends of humanity who feel specially rooted to urge onr guiltv nation to a speedy removal of the crying sin of slavery wc detpur not against their denouncing it in terms of the most pungent reverity aside from those who have derived from nature warm and ardent temperaments we cannot conceive how any man with a wellbalanced mind unbiased by cruel prejudice and heartless selfishness can look long enough at its odious features to delineate only the out ines of the hideous monster withoot having the indignant feelings of bin soul roused to the highest pitch of intensity and being thus aroused if the language of rebuke used under such circumstances should not be of the most pointed keen and withering character it would be universally regarded ls a strange anomaly in the philosophy of tho mind this is a sin which richly deserves tobe sharply rebuked as well as all its apologists and abettors hut notwithstanding these concessions are made we mnst confess that we are not a little puzzled to see how such denunciations can justly apply even to a considerable number of our people here muchi less the mass sustaining as they do the mortified relations of the oppressed persecuted and downtrodden to charge them with being hostile to the antisanry movement in their feelings sontimentsor actions to my mind is both cruel and absurd in the extreme mere we are forced to brunt prejudice derision and contempt as best we may in every part of this land of professedly lib ertyloving people whether in following our daily avocations or

have referred daily and w e too well know and too sensibly feel the bitterness of it our cup of misery is now well nigh full hut has the time arrived when another galllike ingredient is to be added have we henceforth not only to bear the scorn of the oppressor hut are we to lie odious and revolting to ourselvesto be hated and forever bating one another are we to have enacted over again the sumo

one of those evils we are very much deceived in sustaining a charge of this kind it must be shown that our people are more grossly stupid than any among their ranks we think arc prepared to admit all the attempts within our knowledge that have hitherto been made to fix this stigma upon them appear to our mind to be founded in erroneous views which cannot possibly result in any good whatever to our people but may be productive of some mischief we have iio design to impugn any vines motives who may differ from us on this point we charge none with evu intentions tn their endeavors to sustain this charge we have heard several who take the affirmative side of this question both in public and private disclaim all evil intentions and we are hound in honor to believe them until otherwise convinced hut in every instance we could not help recollecting the man who is represented in scriptures as scattering firebrands arrows and death and then saying am i not in sport we repeat that we do not impugn the motives of any but it does appear to us that the charge of hostility is founded altogether on erroneous views having a tendency to evil results this we shall if n cessary endeavor to show

the united slates yet with all my liking i have somewhat against your paper i understand it to advocate the antisabbath doctrine that there is uo difference in the days of the week and that the view that tha first day of the week should e kept holy unto the lord is an old and exploded dogma if this be your it is certainly most decidedly antiscriptural i hope i am adj dressing one who receives the

felicitations of the inhabitants to their gallant compatriots on the success which had attended their march the immense procession then proceeded to the church where a te dcum was sung and thanksgiving offered to the god of nations for the care which he had extended over the haitian republic that evening and the two following ones the city fairly blazed forth its joy in view of the triumph of order and the restoration of public tranquility these illuminations of which the very sight was pleasurable were rendered still more pleasing by their suggestions there they gleamed the emblems of the dawning of a brighter anda better time the president had gone forth on his expedition to the south at a moment when the political horizon presented the aspect of a coming storm the darkest and most fearful that anation can be called upon to encounter fierce clouds freighted with the dread elements of civil war hung lowering over this unhappy country threatening to deluge its highlands and savannas with fraternal slaughter his stay in the disaffected legion had the happy effect of tranquilizing the public mind and his return was heralded by the reestablishment of national confidence and glad promises of an era of prosperity heaven grant that they may not be futile and that the blessed lime they predict may be of long con tinuance the illuminations which gladdened the streets of portauprince on the evenings o which i speak have been renewed on another and yet more joyous occasion the first of september in this city was by turns a day f the profoundest grief and of the loudest exultation four persons who had been tried for political offences and condemned to death were carried out to lastaobas a place on the frontiers to be shot they were accompanied for some distance by a large number of persons the greater portion of whom were women the loud shrieks and violent despair of the last mention rendered the spectacle a very melancholy one while ihey contrasted strangely with the dignified hearing and submissive composure of the unfortunate prisoners for some hours after their departure a deep gloom brooded over the place and sadness was depicted upon the countenances of all about two oclock in the afternoon however it was reported throughout the town that his excellency had pardoned the condemned sod had sent off menengers to command their return the news spread like wildfire and gave binh to a general rejoicing as loud in its manifestation as was the grief of the morning almost the entire population flocked to the portal of st josephs to congratulate the prisoners on their escapu from execution and as they followed them along the streets caused the air to ring with shouts of vive le president vive ie president soulouque as before stated the city was brilliantly illuminated and on the following morning large number ot ladies proceeded to the palace to present tbetr respects to hu excellency and return him thanks for having seen proper to render the condemned the sebjerte of the executive clemency since that time quite a urge number of political prisoners hare been lther a ted and it is daily anticipated that more will shortly he released i regret exceedingly that it was not permitted me to spend the first of august this year in ray natire land the unfortunate circumstances in which this country has lately been placed prevented the voice of philanthropy here from joining in the hallelujah which hailed the anniversary of the birthday of eight hundred thousand freementhat glo rions event which set an example to the nations in the progress of human liberty previous to that time oppressed humanity had regained its rights by deeds of blood and violence stem indiscriminate war or expatriation equally fearful had ordinarily marked the restoration of the godgiven gift of freedom through the fierce deluge of inflamed and unbridled passion the ark bearing the elements destined for the construction of another and a brighter world had been condemned to float but the emancipation of the british west indies pointed out another i mode for the redemption of a people it told that henceforth man was to resume his wrested rights through more pleasing means and that liberty with strength gathered from former conflicts was to march on henceforth with flaunting trophies and through triumphal archesa bloodless and joyous conqueror the emancipation of martinique and guada loupe of st thomas and santa crux has declared that some of the nations of the earth have profitted by the lesson it is a sad reflection that the land of washington is still associated with cuba porto rico and the brazilian empire in eflbrts to annihilate the inborn dignity of man in the hope that this may not long continue and that before

said he an interataie lover ol tobacco and l know how difficult it is to break the habit of nsing it still it can be done indulged in the use of the weed toa great exccess i loved it but knowing that its effects were bad and especially illbecome a man of the gospel i made one almighty resolve o quit it with that resolution i tood a tremendous cud which was to be my wind off i chewed it and chewed it and rolled it as a sweet norsel under my tongue and from one cheek to the other for three weeks it is certain tobacco never tasted so good before and i shed tears when i recollected that it was to be my last indulgence when its strength was all gone i threw it away there burehard said i there goes your lastyotr omega of quids well for a while it was very hard doing without it and i was often sorely tempted to try it again old tobacco chewers would pull out their rusty steelboxes give them a scientific snap and say burehard have a chew and for along time whenever i heard the elick of a tobacco box i involuntarily put my hand in my trowsers to get hold of my pigtail in fact i am afiaid sometimes blundered dreadfully in my sermans my thoughts being more rrhaps on tobacco then upon the lord but stuck to my resolution and neither cavendish noi pigtail hts ever been between my teeth from that day to this in my youth says horace wapole i thought of writing a satire upon mankind but now in my old agel think i should write an apology for them selections an adventure the morning of july th which had been settled on as the which was t take the boats op thriver for water was anything but promising a fresh breeze blowing from the southeast and a heavy swell setting or the bar and i ought to have bee warned of the great risk was about trun but at that time i had to pass an often without any accident that i hac become foolhardy and verv dcnrli fought the experience which has sine made me much more prudent tin captain had exchanged the jollyboai for a gig sharp at both ends but wit i much less beam than a whale boat wc had raised her one streak and being anxious to try her took the leat on shoving her off having with me denman and law but finding hei on deep i advised denman and lawl to get into the pinnace or barge and put also two heavy bags into the latter when close to the bur i hove to ti bale out dry and practise the men lot crossing a surf on entering the breakers i found them much heavier than had anticipated and saw from the first that it would be quite a mercy if wc crossed safely however we got ovci four breakers beautifully the boiling foam taking us with it at a most violent rate the fifth followed us like an overhanging mountain with its crest in the act of curling and w e rose to it just as it broke becoming as it were a component part of the foam my feeling was that of intense anxiety and i onetime thought it would pass us and had an encouraging all right upon upon my tongue when the angrv surf hoiled up afresh there was a crash a cry and in an instant we were in the breakers and never wore men rescued froma more hopeless situation my first impulse was to dive from under the boat and just as i rose to the surface i found myself grappled by a man who could not swim whom i endeavored to shake oil but finding i could keep him up told him to keep his hand on my shoulder and took him to the boat which kept constantly turning round and round like a cask and the seas constantly breaking over us gave us so little breathing time that nearly all hope of being saved was taken away it was a most awful moment and all the places and things i had ever seen seemed concentrated and present at the same instant to the minds eye with a startling distinctness then the misery of being cut oft from nil in rude health with succor close at handnerv ed us all to make extraordinary exertions and i mentally prayed for presence of mind for i felt that the safety of the whole depended so entirely on me that i used the whole of my breathing time in cheering up the three men who could not swim all eyes were fixed on the barge close to us and approaching rapidly hut every now and then hid by the overhanging crest of awave which engulfed us a second afterwards keeping us down longer and longer as our strength failed us and we tilled with water she was almost within our reach when a furious breaker swept her past us with the speed of lightning and buried us for some seconds how plainly i saw the faces of all in the barge as they passed ns pale as death with eyes straining with eager anxiety but they were as hopeless as ourselves and half filled their boat in endeavoring to roundto my men began to despair and utter the most piercing cries and one of them said hood bye mr barnard i am going down but i tapped him on the shoulder and told him to look at the pinnace then not fur from us and we held on by the keel of the boat with the energy and despair of drowning men at ltust six times did the surf wash me from one end of the boat to the other my hand grasping lie keel the whole length still on came our rescuers our only hope some screeched and howled others left the boat and swam towards the approaching oneand  exerted my remaining strength in calling out luff luir fearing she would pass us like the barge however we were all picked up but one poorboy named crapwell who was probably taken down by a shark i bad grasped the bight of the jibshcct and when hauled into tiie pinnace was quite exhausted and black in the face and my men were mnch in the same plight fortunately the chipoli was at anchor about three miles from us and we received every attention and kindness from the american officers and dr tuckeruiun soon restored us with bottles of hot water at our feet and friction of warm blankets and remained on

greenfield near detroit the facts noticed in the detroit advertiser are as follows the messrs grangers in boring to find water to supply their steam sawmill sunk a four inch hole to the depth of feet when they struck a vein or cavity as they withdrew the augur from the hole to their great surprise it was followed by a violent current of air that threw up stones as large as hens eggs or feet high por a few moments when the hole was first opened the air was accompanied by a stream of water which was throw n or feet high the water however soon ceased coming and the air rushed out with such violence that the roar could he distinctly heard or io rods distant on touching fire to the air it caught and the flames flashed feet high atd came near burning the building covering the machinery in which it is located they finally succeeded with considerable difficulty in stopping it by forcing down the blankets and driving a spile into the hole which was their only means of stopping the air or gas and extinguishing the flames for several moments after the hole was stopped the earth trembled and shook for some distance around as though an eruption was about to take place the people who by this time had gathered to the number of about a hundred were greatly alarmed at these symptoms and scattered with ail possible rapidity supposing that mil lerisni was about coming to a focus or that they were soon to be blown sky high by an earthquake from the time it was opened till it was thus closed about six hours the air gushed out with unabated force it has been opened several times since with the same effect the power and force of the air does not seem to diminish in the least ihc messrs grangers are pto poing to secure it w ith an apparatus so as to shoot it off and let it out a

of the supposed defunct came to take a last farewell she stooped to kiss the lips of her departed friend and remaining in that position i for some time the bystanders attemptec to remove her lest her emotion should be injurious to her she waived them with her hand and remained with her lips upon those of her friend andi breathing as it turned out afterwards the warm breath of life into her lungs at length she exclaims she lives and rising from the body pointed out unequivocal signs of life she stated that as she was kissing her friend she fancied she felt her breathe and in a few minutes was convinced of the fact the female was taken out of the coffin and placed in a uarni bed and in the course of a few hours fully revived she stated that she was during hei trance fully sensible to all

of these overparticular women either the stairs were wet and carpets upor else all the furniture was wheeled out of one room into anotheror the beds were being taken to piecesor the paint was being scrubbed downor the windows were being cleaned or the floors being scoured so that it was almost impossible to sit down in any room one wanted or to walk up stairs or along the passage without
