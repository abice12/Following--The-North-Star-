dear sir vou will have heard before this reaches you of father mathew decision to be silent while in tht country on the subject of slavery the abolitionists have learned it with deep regret being all of us with hardly an exception teetotalers utaly acquainted with and deeply interested in father mathews labors grateful for the noble protest he sent here against slavery in and tor the welcome be has given to american abolitionists abroadaccustomed our elves to give a fair proportion of our efforts to the temperance cause hoped for a cordial sympathy from the great teetotaller we did not expect and you will oh serve we did not ask father mathew j to take any prominent part or give any great amount of time to the anti lavery enterprise we recognized i with the rest of the world the peculiar sphere which providence seems to have marked out for him and approved as wll as admired his profound devo ton to hisone idea but no one much leas no one upon whom the eyes of millions are fixed can be ao exclusively a teetotaller or anything else that his opinions on other points may not be known and his influence counted on all ve asked of father mathew was that he would embrace every suitable opportunity to bear a clear and unequivocal testimony both in public and private against the enslavement of any portion of the human family and again with noi wish or design to divert him from his great mission we trusted that he would occasionally find an opportunity to admonish his countrymen to be true to liberty must a traveller do nothing but flatter if he may be excused from this then surely the man who onjanding had alluded in every speech in glowing terms to the free institutions of the soil on which he trodand pro mtsed to carry back a faithful picture of the workings of our admirable moral social industrial and educational establishmentswho could discuss with his american admirers his relations with the british government is a pensioner su c might we thought find time in some of bis thousand speeches for now and then a word worthy of a christian man as to those bloody laws which doom every sixth person in this land to worse than deathon that sin against god and rnan of whose horror degradation oppression and withering curse had spoken to the irish here eloquently in we ventured it is tiue to ask his presence if he had tune to spare at a celebration of the great british act of emancipation in deeming that tobe an occasion of such universal interest that a foreigner and especially an irishman might share in it father mathew replies thut he shall uol commit himself on this subject while in america perhaps we ought to have expected as much from one who years ago declared that he would rather the temperance cause were lost than that the catholic order should be injured but we hoped better things ono thing we must praisethe prudent fathers frankness he vu no juamt then he lairly confesses that m his opinion no one however worldwide his repute cao bt of use in america unless he the north star i i consent to be gagged on the subject ot slavery and be contentedly puts tfu gag on a poor compliment to be sure to the land he visits to saj your freedom is so nominal that noman however fenced about by good deeds and the worlds love can be ali lowed to speak his miod but suejb is father mathews declaration in i substance and many of our papers endorse and applaud hits perhaps you will say i judge him too harshlythat he tees the country divided into two parties on this question and chooses to side with neither remember then that the iwuuuage worse than murder according to coleridgethe sum gl all villanies according to wesley thit ou its side are many millions against it a few thousands a christian sword would leap from its scabbard in such a cause and lips which god had touched could not forbear speaking on slavery said father mathew himself in no one can be neutral he who is not against it is for it this excuse therefore dees not avail i our opponents have sometimes charged us you will remember with j exaggerating the influence of the slave system and the servile corruption of public opinion on the subject judge i now which party is right father mathew a worlds wonder almost sainted in the love of his contemporaries must keep silence on this dreaded subject if he would retain his influence how heavy then do you judge j the burden must rest on more coinrnun men if he cannot be allowed to speak who can like the maiden in spenser the philanthropy of his mission had tamed into admiring silence religious bigotry national antipathy and the bickerings of party there was one dragon whom no life of saintlike devotion could appease and father mathew vails his crest to the slave power of america in order to retain his influence is is think a fatal mistake he who in this way seeks to save his influence shall lose it americans knew father mathew to be an antislavery man and expected him to be himself everywhere they may profit by the treason but as in ail other cases will despise the traitor what has he gained he has lost the confidence of reformers every northern doughface sees the great teetotaller belittled to his own level is that a gain would a frank expression of his opinion on this subject occasionally oil wo ttjked liaro injured him with the irish of course he could never expect to have much influence with slaveholders themselves indeed few native born americans dream of taking the pledge at his hands and a slaveholding teetotaller finds no true description but the trite one in butlercompounding f or sins he it inclined toby damiing ihoae lie lias ro mind to an antislavery teetotal saint promising silence on slavery that he may win such how far is he from the kingdom of the same condemnation what then has he gained a noisy reception wherever he goes from wine drinkers civic feasts from the old foes of the temperance causethe hurras of the newspapers and thus he sells the wide scope of his large honors for so much trash as may be graped thus true this glitter has its effect upon the ignorant class he addresses but to injure the slave with one hand as much as he helps the irish laborer with the other is but a poor claim to a worlds gratitude it was the boast of oconnell that he would never set foot on american soil while it was polluted with slavery father mathew not only visits us but consents to go padlocked that he may be feted the reverend gentleman underrates both his own importance and the servile worship we gladly pay to rank when lord morpeth was in south carolina he commented freely on slavery his tuftloving hearers remembering the blood of all the how ards ate their leeks in silence had father mathew been true to his own conscience and fame we should have recognized him as noble by the right of an earlier creation and submitted stillmore respectfully to his rebuke you will observe also that he has gone too far in his submission even for our latitude all the papers which criticise this matter presume that the interview must be misrepresented no attempt however worthy of notice has been made to impeach the accuracy of mr larrisons account and the recent interview of mr rogers with father mathew fully confirms it but you will observe that taking it for accurate even our papera cannot defend it if so why hasten to presume that he did not say what he is stated to have said the reverend father has got so humbly on hts knees before the slave power that even our editors who are native here and to the manor born cannot get low enough to be level with him each man chooses according to his taste nd abilities the particular sphere to which he will devote himself but above and beyond that choice we owe each our countenance the expression ol our opinion and testimony whenever that expression will relieve suffering or correct wrong how else i shall proud majorities be stayd ireland looks for aid to the public opinion of christendom given her incidentally by those immersed in their own cares and struggles that is the fulcrum on which she rests her efforts against the cruel indifference of the british people slavery is in the same condition laws and oceans interposed cannot break the brotherhood of the race and father mathew owes the eure this right is of no sextrtth is of no colorod is the father of us all ant all we are brethren testimony in obedience to that fait which both profess which bids th strong help the weak he has n right to sell his silence on slavery thai with thirty pieces of silver he ms swell the treasury of irish teetotalisn silence from such a visitor is most sig mficant tuppori and no purpose however holy can justify a visit to oui shores at the price of such a com promise yve arc aware that the eyes of th world are fixed on father mathew am that whosoever censures his course has the world fur v auioe its verdict on the issui between us a christian minister confessing that he can innocently stani face to face wh the sinner and premise not to rebuke him a catloli submitting the spiritual to the civil power in that he allows human laws to excuse him from delivering his divide message do as you would be dont byopen thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction an abolitionisl coming to a land where humanity wages her battle against such fearful oddsto remain no neutral but by marked silence in such circumstances give comfort to the foes of truth throw discredit on the slaves friend and lull into false security the half awaking conscience of the oppressor a man gathering into his hand more influence than any other of the age can boast and cowering before a guilty people instead of rebuking them in the majesty of his godgiven power we deny the right of any man especially one of commanding influence to be silent on one question that he may enhance his weight on others we do not allow a foreign birth to absolve any one whose position gives him influence here from speaking in behalt of the american slave if there be anything in the character of the temperance cause to break down national distinctions and allow international influence there is tenfold as much in the antislavery agitation the slave a man denied education robbed of the bible of his wife his hildren of himself hopelessly im brutedwnmam doomed almost of necessity to licentiousnessmarriage an lihilated what stands between the servant of jesus christ and such a jicture to bar him from rebuking the vretch who creates it a law it he slaveholder made slaves as he irinks wine of his own free will the rudent father would feel at liberty to teal with hirn but he nas maae pro ititution tawful made murder lawful made the selling of his own children it auction lawful and so the true apostolic successor of peter and pauls disarmed and cries out we ought o obey man rather than god no aw can sanction slavery said ocon lell what murder is on the pirate deck that precisely is slavery on the american soil every lover of justice every christian is free and is bound to denounce it a christian minister hailing a pirate ship and promising to say nothing against their occupation if they would let him offer them the pledge would be a fit type of a teetotaller bound to silence on slavery to advance teetotalism we consider free speech no favor granted us by man but a right the gilt of god and abjure the policy of yielding any portion of it to save the rest we hold the truth which god shows us as no play thing or counter with which to traffic but to ne uttered all of it indue time and especially before those whom it concerns we hold it to be the first mark of goodness and the highest privilege of greatness to speak what you think and especially in times when words are deeds and mighty to work wonders painful indeed would it he to a sincere abolitionist if god condemned him togo up and down this land drying up the sources of intemperance and forbade him full of powers as he was to lift his little finger for the relief of that hideous bondage he was daily doomed to witness oil all these points at issue between ourselves and father mathew we shall cheerfully abide the verdict of the world and posterity according to father mathew while ireland is starving all the world not british born must keep silence on tho cruel mistakes of government which have ruined her and any great briton may be innocently still if so doing he can husband his influence for the peace or the antistate church cause was it indeed so when he saw the iron entering the souls of hs countrymen did he nut summon the world to her rescue the american slave a hungered with none to give him bread athirst with none to give him drink sick and in prison with none to visit hi n asks of the great irishman the bread of his testimony asks that he will not allow his potent name to be added to the list of those who justify silence in any circumstances ot such a sin father mathew thanks us americans that we have given the world the doctrine of total abstinence he would fitly return the favor by holding to oui lips the biller cup of antislavery god says to this nation let ny people go but father mathew is so very proper a ptiest that gods message must be countersigned by the national authorities before he will consent to deliver itunless indeedit be to a people like the irish who do not hold slaves and will not feel offended father mathew is so enthusiastic a teetotaler meanwhile that a man may sell his own children at auction unearned if ha will but do it aober father mathew is such a protestant suen a stickler for the right of private judgment on this question that he can see nothing specific in the scriptures rochester n y fjiday september hi against slavery though successive c popes infallible ha denounced it aso unchristian and a a still in fiber mathew could exhort his poor ueducated couutry i men to

winking at ii slavery might be for temperance sake but then hov xav er vould have laughed at a catholic chriitian allowing human laws or mtionfcl lines to stop the mouth of his rebjke and so he cannot be a jesut but is simply father mathew americanized whether for better or worse ireland will determine every irishman the victim of centuries ot oppression woild we should suppose sympathize with the oppressed and when we have seen it otherwise in the emigrants tfat crowd to our shores we have attributed it to ignorance and degradation but father mathew the brignt consunmate flower of your isles

defeat any measure offered him support on his irish question if lie would absent himself from antislavery meetings his answer was come liberty come slavery to myself i will never countenance slavery at home or abroad will take my part at antislavery meetings and though it should be a blow against ireland it is a blow in favor of human liberty and i will strike that blow again when the repealers

relation to the government under which i live this article is written in view of tit sentiments of the extract of a speech ot that noble champion of liberty j r giddirgs published in the star no referring to the decision o r the sup preme court on the obligation to deliver up the fugitive slave he says these slaveholding judges do not pretend that the government or the people of the free states are bound to encourage or sustain slavery on the contrary they solemnly declare that our whole duty is to abstain from secreting defending or rescuing the slave these obligations wc observe to the very letter they may have been violated by individuals but have never known an instance of the kind have heard and read of cases where citizens of my own state have been convicted of violating these stipulations and have suffered the legal penalties attached to such violation but no such case has ever come under my observation nor have heard of such an instance in northern ohio in another place he says we will lend him the slave all the aid in our power without violating the constitutions or laws of the land if these quotations mean anything and most certainty such a man as giddiugs does not speak to mean nothing they mean that he would not a sist my midnight petitioner to the externi of secreting him for he says the ob ligatioa to abstain from secreting fee we keep to the very letter aud s vre intonates do the people of nortberc  ohio but he says that these ohic  northmen regard the slave pursuer asa moral pestilencea legalized pirate but pirate though he be they will not at least giddings will not bless ins i victims with secrecy from him would i he secrete a tender harmless crafi i from an algerine corsairr he jgivc shelter to th c ti irom a thunderstorm of death ould he have secreted a babe at bethlehem his own lor instance from the infant cutthroat herod why then not se j crete the terror stricken innocent refugee against the moral pestilence the legalized pirate that pursues him but will giddings not do it does he mean all that lie says and does he mean that the thousands who take him for their antislavery oracle shall feel themselves under no obligation to secrete the refugee or at least under a counter obligation so much sironger j that they would leave him to perish rather than to hide him it is wellknown that the aid of secrecy often does more to defend the slaves retreat than any thing else is this most nrc i essary atd to be withheld we raise no constitutional question here we j know many differ from giddings on its j obligations but the masses think with him and must it be believed that from nil these no mercy shall come for the refugee when his pursuers are at hand and he needs a hiding place o tell it not in gath tell it not in algiers tell it not in the vatican tell it not to a turk tell it not where mercy orhumanity or justice live tell it not to the enlightened friends of mercy lest i they weep tell it not to her enemies lest they rejoice but no northern ohio will secrete the slave and j r giddings will but we fear there arc some who would have done it before reading giddingss speech who will not afterward his theory of the constitution is doubtless a consistent one hut it is so inconsistent with humanity christianity and justice that it will do no more to restrain the expansion of such a heart as we think he has than the parchment upon which it is written if we thought it wouldue would direct the slave to shun him as a moral pestilence and land pirate because in that case for the refugee to fall under his auspices when salvation depends on secrecy would be tvii i a r v m j s abolition of slavery in the portuguese colonies we arc gratified to learn that there is now a fair prospect that a law will soon he passed in portugal for the abo j lition of slavery in all the colonies of that country a hill for that purpose was read in the chamber of peers ot lisbon on the of may last andi the committee on colonial affairs to whom it was then referred made their report on the th of june approving the bill and recommending its adoption by the chamber the bill provides i that the children of slaves born after the date of the law shall he free from the moment of their birth j that all slaves who enter any territory or ship of portugal after the date of the law from whatever motive shall he considered free from the moment that they enter such territory or ship this clause is thus qualified in those countries where slavery is sanctioned by law if slaves go on board a portuguese ship while in any port of such country that they are of course amenable to the laws of that country while the ship is in port but if they be carried out of the port they shall be free from the moment the vessel is clear of the port the persons who decoy them or tako them away however are to he held responsible for their value slaves accompanying the embassies which african potentates send to the governors of potuguese colonies may be held as slaves while the embassy is in the country but will he set free if they remain after theem bassy has left the portuguese territory the transportation of slaves from one portuguese port to another oi from a portuguese port to a foreign country is strictly prohibited all slaves now belonging to the state are declared to be immediately free on the publication of the law and all who may hereafter become its property are at the moment they become j so declared free every person throughout the portuguese empire is to be considered a freeman unless he can be legally i proved to be a slave ti in each portuguese ultramarine colony there shall be kept books for the registry of the slaves and it shall be the duty of every slaveholder to see that the names of his slaves are entered with the descriptions necessary for their identification no person who is not registered can be held as a slave if a slaveholder shall cause to be registered as a slave the name of a person legally entitled to liberty he shall forfeit ail his slaves who are to he immediately declared tree and he himself is to suffer the penalty usually imposed on the kidnapper slaveholders are also required to report every half year any alterations which may have occurred in relation to their registered slaves and if they omit to make this report for three

all of them marked by the finger of god when i regard this sublime object the wellbeing of mankindpeacewhen i reflect on all that providence has done in favor of it and human policy against it a sad and bitter thought comes to my mind it results from a comparison of statistical accounts that the nations of europe expend each year for the maintenance of armies a sum amounting to millions of francs and which by adding the expense of maintaining establishments of war amounts to millions add to this the lost produce of the days of work for more than of menmen the healthiest the most vigorous the youngest the chosen of our populationa produce which you will not estimate at less than millions and vuu mm ot convince uuu uie suniuing armies of europe cost annually more than millions gentlemen peace has now lasted thirtytwo years and yet in thirtytwo years i the enormous sum of millions has i been expended during that peace on account of warapplause suppose that the people of europe in place of mistrusting each other entertaining jealousy of each other hating each other had become last friends suppose they said that before they were frenchor german they were men and that if nations form countries human kind forms a laraily and that enormous sum of millions so madly and so vainly spent in consequence of such mistrust let it be spent in acts of mutual confidencethese millions that have been lavished on haired let them be bestowed on love let them be given to peace instead of warapplause give them to labor to intelligence to industry to commerce to navigation to agriculture to

would pacifically extend themselves over the earth in place of conspiring for revolution men would combine to establish colonies in place of introducing barbarism into civiliza  tion civilization would replace barbarism great applause you see gentlemen in i what a state of blindness war has placed nations and rulers if the millions given for the last thirtytwo years by europe to j the war which was not waged had been given to the peace w hich existed wc positively declare that nothing of what is now passing in europe would have occurred the continent in place of being a battle field

mouth f the river from which it derives its name is finely located for trade and manufacturing purposes the w hole place wears an ictive business like appearance there is a plank road all tha w ay from hereto rome a distance of sixty miles and a railroad aid canal to syracuse these great thoroughfares give oswego great and it will doubtless one day become a laige and influential city the population of the place is now twelve thousand and from present indication of prosperity it it will dotble that number in the space of ten years like most of the young cities of the west itis largely stocked with newspapers of which there are fourone daily and three weeklies churches and ministers abound here and if the people are not what they ought to be it results from no lack of these there appears to be as much competition among the ministers as among the mill owners of the place every one wants to bring grift to his own mill such is life methodists baptists presbyteriansand roman catholics are all struggling for the mastery in saving souls of men but neither presbyterians baptists methodists nor roman catholics seem to have any special care for the bodies of men the soul is all important with them they are anxious save men iroiu nut ii c after but care nothing about saving men from hell here on the earth among these soul loving christians the slave stands no chance the antislavery advocate is refused admission into the churches and the ministers elders and deacons like the priests and levitts of old pass by on the other side and as in the days of christ it is only the common people who hear the truth gladly when my friends in this place heard of my intention to visit them they made an effort obtain the use of one of these houses of worship for me to lecture in but it was refused on the ground that i would speak against the churches my meetings here have been held in the market hall and despite of the proslavery influence of the church and the clergy i have had crowded meetings and have been greatly cheered by the kind and respectful manner with which ray addresses have been received by the public the meeting last evening was thronged many were cpmpelled to stand during the evening remaining till the last although may lecture occupied three hours at the close of the meeting six subscribers were btained to the north star and sixteen copies of ray narrative were sold am informed that many present heard the snbject of slavery discussed on this occasion for the first time soon after my arrival hero on thuisday henry clay passed through on his return trip westward i caught a glimpse of him as he passed he sat in a barouche drawn by two black horses covered with white nets and was followed by an admiring crowd there was no black servant by his side his attitude in the carriage was erect and proud disputing the sway of old king time his face was red but wrinkled and careworn i did not follow him i found myself facing the crowd as who were all rushing the other way all anxious to touch the hem of the slaveholders garment and to obtain a smile from the great compromiser poor man what will ail this applause and adulation avail him at the bar of god t of what consequttoce will it be to him when the tears of sundered families and the scarred hacks and broken hearts of his plundered victims shall confront him at the judgment seat as i looked upon him i felt differently from what i expected i should do on seeing aman who had done so much to injare my poor despised people my emotions were those of deep sorrow that one so gifted now on the verge of another world should have made so bad use of his talents but the time is past the hour is gone the sand has nearly run out lamentation is vain he with all others like him are in the hands of a power beyond and above him and eternal justice must and will be vindicated there are in this city about one hundred colored persons my visit baa afforded me a good opportunity of meeting with my suffering people asa mark of their esteem and regard they made a collation at the house of mr gray where ail were invited to meet me and have a friendly interview they manifested much interest in the subject of the proposed ve tional league and i have do doubt that a branch of the league will be formed in this plaee among those who are most active and interested in the cause of elevation and improvement are messrs grsy grant and dickens all activebusiness men and do bon or to the character of oar procnbed and injured people i go fiora this place to fulton trille thence to bed creek thence to paltnevrille and i on to my appointment as already announced frederick douglass oswego th sep  olorphobin uw the sob we bare sometime been in doubt as to the precise object of the sons of temperance we hate supposed it to be the benevolent ooe of promoting temperance in the community without inquiring whether those whom it benefitted were white or blacktail or short we have the small consolation of knowing now as we did not before know that we have been considerably mistaken this may be one object but it certainly is not the only aim of these secret societies there is another purpose which they also answer that is the building up of caste and prejudice hereat least it might have been expected where the ostensible object is a purely benevolent i one and no theological mist can possibly be brought to hear upon it the colored man would be admitted on equal terms is not drunkenness as immoral in a colored as it isin a wmiv t nt disgusting l lait not to himself fraught with as ruinous consequences why then shut him out from the muchtalked of benefjta said to be afforded by these societies of mutual counsel encouragement and countenance it is a fact and we are grieved to be compelled to the conclusion that the assertion is most true that sons of temperance lodges are the very spawn of slavery after this we shall not be surprised to find that the hellish spirit of american hate towards the colored man would if possible shut him out from heaven itself and condemn him to everlasting perdition even the perdition of the orthodox rather than that he should share an eternity of happiness in company with white men organized societies political scientific and religious in this land do all they decently can to effect this object the doors of all areas religiously barred against him as if he bore about with him an infectious leprosy hei cannot with few exceptions as an equal man enter the door of any of our large churches but must be stowed away like so much lumber in some fardistant loft in the ceiling he cannot at all either as equal or unequal become a member of a literary society of white persons and there is now presented an illustration of the allpervading spirit of proscription in temperance lodges no matter what may be the color of their skin whether black or white or brownwe maintain that men who can rise superior to such degrading and demoralizing treatment have in their composition a large proportion of the material of which heroes are made there are few white men who could go through this ordeal and come out unscathed the treatment of the free colored people in the northern states is only equalled in disgraceful and disgusting atrocity by the odious slave system of the south the one is the natural offspring of the other it may be useful to remind northern men that they have something more to do than to shout no more slave oiatoo owutciliiiig more oven than to nhout no more slavery after both of these objects are secured they have a task to accomplish nearer home they have to take the spirit of slavery out of their own hearts and learn to acknowledge really not in words only but in deed and in practice that the colored man is a man all the silly haberdash that can bo strung together about mans equality is jnst so much idle wind uni til they accomplish this it will then mean something until thennothing we do not intend from these remarks tobe understood to favor the destruction of all order in society far from it we know full well that so long as there are intelligent and uninformed men in societyso long as there are educated and illiterate menso longas there are men of low and men of refined tastesso long as there are sensuous men and men of high intellect and morality there must be orders in society these very differences of mental progress of themselves without any of the supeiadded circumstances of wealth make these orders the sensuous man though he inay have the wealth of croesus is not at home in the company of the refined and intellectual his proper place is amongst the low loafers whose tastes and inclinations are similar to his own what we desire and what all men desire who are really actuated by the true spirit of democracy is that those orders in society should be abolished not by mixing up uncongenial elements but by elevating the brutal ignorant and sensuous to the level of the refined educated and virtuous one means of doing this is to put within the reach of all the means ot moral and intellectual improvement if the colored man is a little more deficient than his white neighbor that seems to us to ho only an additional reason why lus requirements should be attended to with more carefulness and assiduity and he of all others should be invited and encouraged to constant and persevering effort after self improvement the very reverse of this is the case he is as far a possible shut out of the schools and then abused for his ignorance he is neglected and allowed to grow up destitute of all moral training and taunted with his vice the first wrong is made the excuse for the second and both of them clearly lie at the doors of the respectable and the professedly religious in this land a change must be effected herebefore any great improvement can take place in the organization of society will our social reformers take this matter into their serious consideration this is oue of the elements in social life which they are too apt to lose sight of we have been led to reflect on this subject by reading in a recent number of the impartial citizen the correspondence between revs r ward and mr pinkerton of dundee m reference to the proceedings of the sons of temperance in mr wards own case from this correspondence it is abundantly evident that temperance lodges do not admit colored men mr ward is well known to bean intelligent and polished gentleman and even if admitted his admission might not have been considered a concluaive argument in favor of the liberality and absence of prejudice prevailing amongst tbe sons but as if to make assurance doubly sure and seal their disgrace beyond the possibility of mistake he was first admitted and then expelled the proceee c will give in hta own words our division sent oat a committee to in i quit whether it were contrary to rule to admit black members the committee repotted that a resolution again t the admission otj blacks had been passed bv tbe grand division upon this we dissolved and threw up our charter for we were most of us believers in the bible i note particularly a few facts mi deputy land advised my expulsion special deputy cadv advised it in behalt of the grand division the district deputy who initiated me was censured and remojed tor initiating me the grand division approved of and endorsed this removal of the district dej puty capt cady paid the highest compliments to j my character and reported distinctly to the grand division that niy complexion was the sole objection against me in reporting to the grand division against the district deputy he uses the following words having actually initiated a colored man the grand division i repeat endorsed the whole of thw report as you will see tn then proceedings one tact more the grand division will not allow black men charfcts to form subor  dinate divisions under them that was tried in new york and they refused hie black divisions are all independent of the g d having received their charters from the calc donia division a division of scotchmen after this who will dare deny to the loflgcs oi uic uu j xrt tj u ht to arrogate to themselvea the title of benkvo lent and philanthropic societies the passwoid it seems is not enough to admit aman to their meetings they also require that his skin should be of a particular color w e have heard individual members of societies assert that their lodge would admit colored men they dare not do it their charter would be taken from them and their lodge dissolved if they persisted in treating their colored brother as a man we pity those respectable men who have got into the meshes of such an inquisitorial and tyrannical despotism for ourseives we might be well content to be forever excluded from such societies jwe do not pietend to have any strong partiality for gewgaws ribbons and childs play there are many however who attach a high value to these things to such it must be some deprivation to be shut out from them the attempt to prove them mischievous or even useless would perhaps cost more than it comes to so we will not try to disturb the complacency of those who have a high opinion of temperance lodges but let them not pretend to be benevolent societies for the reclaiming of the drunkard and the debased while they pass by that class who the sons themselves being judges stand the most in need of their aid and encouragement j i address to the antislavery ladies of hi eat britain ami ireland from tiro kniflish friends i through the medium of the columns of the north star we earnestly desire to solicit your aid and cooperation in the good antislavery cause and we would plead with you more especially for assistance on behalf of the western new york anti slavery society one of the objects of this society is to help to sustain the north star newspaper which is we believe one of the best antislavery instrumentalities now in operation the annual antislavery fair will beheld at rochester towaids the close of the year and a series of antislavery fairs are now being held in the towns and villages of western new york consequently then is an unusual demand for useful and fancy articles we earnestly entreat our british friends to send us renewed help in the way of contributions to our london friends

member of the roman catholic j church the archbishop refused to sanction their marriage because the minister would not renounce the protestant faith the lady consented to be married by the american chaplain of the flagship the archbishop immediately addressed mr barton a letter charging her with becoming the concubine ofa dissolute foreigner threatening her with the anathemas of the church ac colonel barton then appealed to the minister of foreign affatis for the protection of the governj merit but was informed that it could not be granted because the archbishop was a roemf ber of the

denied the right of citizenship in despite of all that massachusetts may say to the contrary is not a citizen united stales jaw authorizes slavery else how is it that slaves are held and the perpetrators of that wickedness are not brought to justice t nited states law in one shape or another either by allowing the separate states to make unjust laws for themselves or by the direct contract of confederation allows new york and other states to deny to the colored man the rights of citizenship unless he is possesses of a certain number of dollars worth of realestate but what we arc particularly interested in is the fact of the matter colored persons arc not citizens of thc united states either according to law or against law the colored man is robbed of this light if against law of what value is the law it may aswell have no existence a law is of little use unless the moral sense of the majority is on a level with its requirements laws that are either above or below the moral sense of the community as might be shown by numberless illustrations are mere waste parchment create in the community an incorruptible sense of justice and what ate says on the subject will be a

the people is the almost universal feeling expressed by the english public the peace congress attract a large share of attention and if its members set upon the suggestion of mr cobden to keep up an antiloan agitation it will attract still more attention this is a phase ol the subject which probably has not occurred to some who are loud in denunciations ol the horrors of war and eloquent in declamation on the beauties of peace gentiles not lesi than jews are willing to lend money t governments and receive the consideration for it asking no question for consciencr sake of the use made thereof it is very evident that war has been the chief if noi f the only cause why england and other nationi  of europe have had to borrow at all thc prevention of war will undoubtedly pievem the

is a good one and in so far as it is successful will be matter of rejoicing even should it not effect all that it proposes if it only in eome degree takes from governments the immense power for mischief placed at their disposal by the loan system it will havo done somethingmuch to bring about a better state of things for thc suffering masses in london the deaths from cholera during the week were and from all diseases which is an increase of on the total mortality of the preceding week and an increase of in the deaths by cholera a murder committed under unusually atrocious circumstances has just been discovered in london the discovery and apprehension of the murderer who was a woman give a lemarkable illustration not only of the unanimity with which all parties in the government service in that coantry lend their aid in promoting the ends of law but also of tho wonderful practical advantages of steam and electricity the chief actor in the horrible tragedy was the wife of a man named manning the man himself had also a share in it though as a secondary actor patrick oconnor their victim was a guager in the london custom house and had accumulated about ooo for which he was murdered he seems to have been intimate with mrs manning and the last time he was seen slive was in her back parlor on the evening of thursday august th the next morning oconnor was absent from his duty at the docks the same for several days after before his friends expressed any alarm on his account on the tnesday following inquiries were made for him at the house of mrs manning which were answered by her with coolness and composure suspicions were thus lulled to sleep two days after the police paid a second visit to the house and found it deserted they then commenced searching the premises and found the body of the murdered man under the floor of the back kitchen which was paved with flagstones previous to her flight mrs manning had called at the lodgings of oconnor and opening his drawers carried off all their valuable contents there is nothing very remarkable in all this it is simply a new exhibition of an oft repeated tragedy the remarkable part of the story is the capture of the murderer where the guilty parties had gone no one knew it was at first rumored that they had sailed for america by a vessel fiom london a communication was then made to the admiral of the port and he immediately ordered out a steam yacht in pursuit of the victoria the vessel in which two persons bearing the name of the accused had taken passage for new york the flay following the steamyacht came up with the victoria but the objects of her search were noion board and she immediately beat back to southampton where a steamsloop was getting teady to join in the chase this attempt havmg failed an officer was dispatched to the continent but coukl find no trace of the fugitives but the driver of the hackney coach who conveyed mrs manning to the railway station having been discovered it was ascertained that she had gone to scotland a telegraphic message to this effect was instantly sent off to edinburgh tad before an hour had elapsed an answer was received communicating

arrived at adrianople where they have embarked in an english ship j d we have been requested to give publicity to thc following repudiation through the columns of our paper we do not at present understand the merits of the case and cannot be expected to take sides with either party but as we are informed by the committee that the a m e zion church have no organ of their own through which to defend themselves we shall be happy to publish such articles as they may desire if of reasonable length and of sufficient public interest to warrant their insertion in the north sar i n repudiation mr editor lt is now pretty generally conceded by those who have impartially investigated the subject that we as a people can never become elevated in common w ith others until we like them become united so that wherever a spirit of disorganization is manifested whether in church or state among the laity or among the clergy it is regarded as being at war with the common interest of our race we hold therefore that wherever a church is found to be a party with those who are united against our common good she is heterodox to the doctrines of the bible and justly merits the appellation of hypocrite as the authorized representatives of that portion of the colored people composing one of the grand divisions of the church in this country we shall show that that party which through public periodicals spoke loud and long on the advantages of a union of the two connections was the first to throw obstacles in the way of its consummation and then to conceal their gyiilt they falsely charge the innocent it is a well known fact that the rev mm clark willis nazarey and dr j j g bias of the a m e connection and rev i moor win jones and edward johnson of the late a m e zion connection met in convention for the purpose of adopting some means by which to effect a union of the two connections and it is our opinion that if the said contemplated union had been effected it would not only have proved a blessing to the two connections but must have enhanced the interest of the colored people in the general we cannot but believe that the motives of the above named gentlemen were pure but unfortunately for the interest of the church most unfortunately for the moral as well as political interest of our race in america a spirit of a different nature manifested itself in an assertion emanating from a minister occupying no low station in the a m echurch the purport of which was that thea m e zions miaisters greatly rejoiced at the idea of becoming connected with thea m e church and had expressed their readiness to comply with and become subservient to whatever plan the latter might adopt that the idea of a union of the two bodies was to us a subject of rejoicing is a fact the truth of which we are happy to admit bui that we have ever manifested a disposition to unite upon the principle of subserviency or any other aside from the strictest equality is to say the least of it a glaring absurdity an assertion so ungrounded and fallacious had the unhappy effect of changing the sentiments of many who had truly and honestly espoused the cause and struck the fatal blow to the long wished for union of the two connections it may revive and our united prayer to god is that it may revive speedily but the more recent transactions of the a me connection warrant us in saying that while their theory on this important question seems to indicate no small degree of sincerity they are practically opposed to union upon any other principle than that which will secure to them the ruling povocr in thc church the following preamble and resolution show the action of the conference with regard to the above together with the sentiment of that body in relation to the north star whereas there exists a paper denominated the north star edited by the talented frederick douglass that staunch and tried friend of his people and whereas that paper is devoted to universal liberty equality and fra ternitybelieving that resistance to tyranny is obedience to godopposing alike oppression whether found in sacerdotal robes stolen from heaven to serve the devil in or in the less crafty but more honest statesman there foie resolved that we the members of the allegheny conference of the a m e zion connection do highly approve and appreciate said paper and wish it success and

very distinguished citizen of the southern states the is apparently an amiable free woman the daughter of a wealthy irishman he brought with him letters of introduction to fredensk douglass and gerrit

york will be a safe retreat for the poor panting fugitive it is truly a cheering indication when our young men deem it coirardly to suffer a recapture of the oppressed victim of the slave power those individuals in the employ of the slaveholder will soon receive a mark by which they will be known as readily as was the brother of abelnot a mark of tar and feathers the whip or branding iron but the

antislarery fair earnestly desiring the abolition of slavery in this land and being deeply convinced that this result can only be accomplished by renewed efforts to change our present corrupt moral sentiment the undersigned members and friends of the western new york antislavery society again make their appeal to the friends of the slave in behalf of their annual bazaar which will be held in rochester in december next while we have been cheered and gladdened by the progress already made and the good already done and while we rejoice to observe that friends have been raised up to plead the cause of the bondman among persons and in quarters where we had least expected them we still see the harvest to be great and the laborers to be few and instead of relaxing our efforts we are impressed with a sense of the duty of doubling our diligence and applying more closely our energy to the means of advancing this holy causewe appeal the more boldly to our friends because those for whom we plead cannot plead for themselves while we are surrounded by our domestic circle with none to molest or make us afraid there are three millions of men and women in our own land doomed to abject slavery and chains robbed of every rightcivilsocial personaland political remembering those in bonds as bound with them wc desire to plead their cause as though they were on our own limbs and the knotted lash were applied to our own backs while to obtain means for enlightening the public mind is the strong motive for holding our annual fair it is not the only one agreat amount of good may be traced directly to such occasions many who are now active workers in behalf of this holy movement became first interested in it through the instrumentality of those annual exhibitions of antislavery industry tact and skill the present object of the rochester antislavery bazaar is for the general enlightenment of the public mind on the subject of slavery recognizing the north star published in this city as an efficient antislavery instrumentality we propose that the funds raised by the sale of articles at the bazaar on behalf of which we here appeal ahail be mainly appropriated to the support of that important paper we gatefully acknowledge the prompt assistance rendered to oar last fair by our fnends and coadjutors in various parts of our own state wisconsin and michigan and ire earnestly solicit their continued cooperation with us in the good wotk that no time maybe lost we especially recommend to them the immediate formation of tewing circles in their various towns with a

heresy as for their trea j onable practice father don alvez was particularly active in this pious work he was a younger member ofa castilian house aod had been bred in the strictest discipline of the jesuits he had spent his life in penances and intrigues the former i presume to give him a keener relish for the latter and the latter to compensate for the tedium of the former at the time knew him he was past the middle age his features were already wrinkled with years but were marked by that haughty and cruel expression so apt to be produced by the indulgence of arbitrary power he had come to naples with high recommendations to the court to assist in purging the city of the disaffected his diligence in this pursuit was truly beyond parallel am yet unable to conceive by what process he became so minutely conversant with the previous history of such an immense number of persons in so short a time his information was never at fault and his measures very rarely j thwarted by miscalculation either in design or e ecution as soon as he had made himself masterof a suspected person he did not at once act upon his evidence to bring about an instant infliction of punishment but used to give the prisoner the benefit of a dogmatical exposition of what he called the salvation of the holy church if this had the desired effect after a little longer confinement the captive was liberated on his good behavior but if the heretic persevered in his rejection of the prescribed process he was forthwith i handed over to the headsman the society in which i moved made me acquainted with father don alvez i was then young and fond of adventure and very naturally conceived a strong desire of visiting with him some of the unfortunates wom the police were constantly arresting by his orders by practising some courteous assiduities as well as a little flattery i ingratiated myself with him and obtained permission to accompany him on his dismal visits to the prison after visiting one or two cells in which we found inmates quite willing to believe any thing and every thing which my guide thought proper to propound we entered a narrow dismal hole surrounded by walls down which the damp trickled almost ia a stream and with the floor composed of granite of uneven surface and sharp edges the torch carried by our attendant discovered a bundle of straw in the corner farthest from the door aud resting upon it a young girl don alvez motioned to the jailor to withdraw the creaking of the hinges disturbed i he prisoner she started from her recumbent posture but her eyes had been too long accustomed to darknes to endure the glare of the torchlight she arranged her disordered hair and clothing as fast and as completely as she could and when at length she ventured to scrutinise her visitors marked the deep crimson that suffused her face and bosom i had been accustomed to behold the exceeding beauty of the women of spain aud italy but when i saw this unfortunate captive i felt at once that i had never met with any one whose loveliness was so perfect when i say that she was a greek and bore in every lineament the impress of her clime and nation i need not attempt a description don alvez told me previous to entering the cell that it contained a heretic who had been some time under confinement and appeared resolved to reject every chance of salvation this he added is the last opportunity of repentance i shall give her these words still echoed in my ear as i contemplated the stern front of the jesuit and the pensive innocence of the greek maiden perverse child commenced don alvez i have come once more to offer thee liberty and the favor of the virgin if thou wilt embrace the holy faith adela so the jailer had whispered ine she was called had now sat down on her coarse bed and with her hands folded on her bosom seemed prepared for any calamity which might await her she returned no answer to the priests observation what continued he dost thou treat with contempt the servant of the church mark me perverse infidel thy fate is in thy own hands thy death i swear by all the blessed saints shall be the penalty if thou persistest in thy unbelief but if thou wilt listen to the truth not a hair on thy head shall be injured how sayest thou caust thou endure death or wilt thou liver i am heedless of my fate replied adela in a tone of melancholy which pierced my heart still not heedless she added with animation so long as i know not the fate of conrade tell m piicst i conjure thee is he in thy power why is the fate of that young manso dear to thee replied don alvez that it is preferred to thine own sal vation adela met the look of the jesuit witha calm and penetrating glance thou inayest be learned in thy faith she said but thou art a novice here laying her hand upon her heart if thou knowest not that a woman love in dusting upon its object forgets all other interests then it is sinful and deserves perdition replied the priest then it is impossible that can be saved quietly rejoined the youne greek what if i tel thee after a pause said don alvez that conrade is not in my power but hast left naplee with another paramour adelss blood mounted to her cheeks with indie nation as she exclaimed then i till thee thou art a liar aswell ss a barbarian not for a moment will believe ao base a calumny iuevleai bciettt i replied my companion i will forthe last time inquire dost thou refuse the mercy of the church do i refuse the mercy of the church said adela why wretch dost thou call these bolts and bars thi dungeon this darkness my long imprisonment my wasted health my tori lured mind my almost broken heart dost thou call these mercy i know not what is meant by the church and i care not i despise and reject both it and thee you dragged me hither because worshipped according to the i customs of my fathers and my nation and you would have dragged hither also one who was too noble too gene j rous all too worthy to commit the smallest wrong but he hss escaped thank heaven be has escaped o conrade she exclaimed clasping her hams who shall love thee when adela is gone for a short time sobs convulsed her beautiful form she soon recovered and then added with an emphasis i shall never forget i do reject thee thy mercy and thy church cannot believe that truth j is allied to cruelty or that heaven has given you power to destroy its own creatures i know not who is your god but i feel that the great and good intelligence who rules the world will not punish me for serving him as i have been taught for believing as my simple reason dictates and above all for rejecting your creed so full of cruelty bloodshed and oppression leave menow in an hour i will be ready to do your bidding enough said don alvez sternly and moved towaids the door i took advantage of his position to whisper to adela do not hope too much but will be your friend her lurge dark eyes spoke a gratitude which i am confldent i shall never again receive from any human being the jailor fastened the heavy door and followed don alvez who was hastening from the building w hen overtook him i inquired his resolution as to the fate of the young greek she dies tomorrow at noon was the laconic reply it was then near evening he was jat first very unwilling to answer any j questions concerning her but by dint of close application i extracted as much intelligence as put ine on a track by which i at length discovered conrade have not the abilty to describe the gallant youth there was the genuine attic stamp on his character and frame he entered eagerly into my plan of rescue it was sufficiently perilous but that to him was a recommendation rather than otherwise the design was to bribe the jailer to connive at our admission to adelas cell and then to bring her away with us and to fight a passage through all opposition a friendly fisherman engaged to await us in the bay w ith his skiff at a point trom which fortunately the prison was not far distant with some difficulty obtained an interview with the jailor and for one hundred piasters received his promise to admit us he was as good as his word we found adela in a calm slumber perhaps she dreamed of conrade for the instant ne stepped towards the couch she sprang into his arms without a moments doubt that it was any one but him she willingly resigned herself to our direction when we had emerged from the cell we gained the outer gate before it was discovered that we had with us the condemned captive the first and second assailants were laid at conrades feet by stabs from his rapier we were now in the street fleeing for our livesconrade first with adela on his left arm i defended the retreat the fate of the two men had a salutary effect in checking the temerity of their companions after some hard blows j had been given and received we gained the beach the fisherman placed adela in the boat while conrade and myself stood at bay and repulsed our pursuers i think another life was sacrificed in the struggle the case was now desperate for the number ol enemies increased every moment threw ourselves into the boat and the first stroke shot us into deep water a volley of musketballs whizzed over our heads without doing us any damage the night was daik and we were rowing with our utmost strength two things which every moment diminished our danger

excitement of the crisis died away father don alvez found more difficulties in procuring victims his zeal could not be satisfied with a solitary delinquent or two so he retired to rome in a pique at the aversion of the neapolitans to undergo martyrdom when he was gone i had less difficulty in negotiating an indemnity i was attached to the locality or i should not have troubled myself to return but now i regard naples as the scene ol the action which of all others i have most occasion to look back upon with pleasure adela i heard may years after from an english captain was the mother ofa
