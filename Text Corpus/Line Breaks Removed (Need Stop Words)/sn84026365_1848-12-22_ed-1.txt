the prejudice of castepro scribed races of spain and france among all the injuries done by iman to man none has been so fruitful j of lasting evil as the antipathy of castes in whatever formwhether representing the hateful distinctions of fanaticism and superstition or the oppressive domination of a conqueror oy the vulgar insolence of mere diversity of race and color edinburgh rev j the paragraph above closes an interesting article in the edinburgh review of last april on the proscribed races of france and spain a history of whom by m michel has lately been issued in paris what is the ground of the popular prejudice in this country against the colored people j difference of race thenwhy is nat a similar prejudice observable between the celts aud anglo saxons among usr why does not the public generally regard the indians with the same antipathy as the af ricans is it color the educated indian or the wellhrecf chinaman is admitted to the social circle without encountering any sentiment of aversion and in england and europe the caucasian race regards the m in of african descent other things being equal with the same favor as one of their own race is it anything in the physical conformation the negro however well favored whatever the regularity of his featares or fairness of his complexion is a proscribed man while absolute ugliness and malformation disqualify no white man for association on equal terms with his brethren the prejudice cannot be a law oi human nature else were it universal but it is a matter of fact that it is confined to a very small proportion ol the caucasian raceour transatlantic brethren do not sympathize with us in this fealing the history of the proscribed races in spain and franceraces not yet quite extinctis full of instruction to those who would philosophize correctly on tho prejudices to which man is liable these races inhabited the vild districts in the west and southwest ol france extending from britanny and maine through poitou guienne gascony beam and the basque provinces to navurr and some ol the neighboring districts of spain on the other side of the pyrenees and from time immemorial were called ihe cagots capots jlgals or gahcts iu the middle ages they were quite numerous but now ure rarely met with they were white people and distinguished in nothing from their neighbor except it is said by the absence of the lobe of the tar sane of them were wealthy some educated and ns it regards moral j character they were not below the general standard and yet they were the proscribed subjects of a most inhuman prejudice precisely in kind like that which weighs dwn the colored raco in this country though more intense in degree their testimony was inhibited in courts sf justice they i had no part or lot in the government their children were excluded from the school where other children were taught a man or w man who married one of them became an outcast generally they were not even favored with t ie privilege of being taxed and when jat moma basse pyrenees a tax filled rancou was levied on all cagots t the north star of the commune to mark ihe contempt j in which they were held the collectoi was accompanied with a dog to which each cagk was obliged to give a piece of bread in the towns particular quarters were assigned them and in coonfry villages they lived in separate hamlets sometimes the people were forbidden to employ them as labors bv the municipal regulations of one place they could not enter its limits i without a badge of red cloth to indii cate their degradation and if they met one of the towns people they were obliged to stand on one side of the road till he passed they were forbidden to touch the vessels out of which people drank or to take water out of the public well in this place colored people are prohibited from entering the public grounds about the capitol unless of necessary businsss in the earlier j part of the seventeenth century the inhabitants of oleran complained as oi an intolerable nuisance trial some cagots of that place had presumed to keep pigeons which leaving their homes in search of food mixed with the pigeons of their neighbors and at another place a cagot was punished for having been found fishing with a line in the river a slave boy in georgetown ij c who should be found hying a kite would be liable to a fine of two dollars and in default of payment to whipping by the mayor at liis discretion they were forbidden to enter any tavern our free people of color are forbidden to keep taverns of any kind in the churches however the prejudice was most fearfully manifested the following extract from the edinburgh review will remind one of the negro pew sand cemeteries of this country only there is nothing in the bitterness the antipathy against colored people as shown iri our churches to equal the fiendish cruelty oi the pious people of france and spain inflicted on this unfortunate while race in some places they seem to have had at a remote period churches or j chapels of their ownat least the ruins or traces of small ecclesiastical buildings are found which popular tradition ascribes to them in most of the churches of the west and southwest ol france there is a small entrance door i now often walled up called the cagots door quite distiuct from the principal entrance there is also a division of the church at some distance from the portion ofitlie church occupied by the congregation which is understood to i have been set apart for the cagots anda sin ill holywater basin for their se j parate use the latter generally bearing j traces of ancient sculpture the street of the cagots a narrow dirty lane generally led to the little door of the church the cagots who were looked upon even by the church as an accursed race were expressly forbidden to enter by the same as the rest ol i the congregation or to introduce themselves into any other pait of the chmvh than that set aside tor them or to approach the large holywater basin in many f places as at luccarre in the j arondissemnt of pau and at claracq jin the canton of theze in the depart inent of the pyreuees where the cagots were adihitted to partake in the holy sacraments they were still kept apart from other people and the consecrated bread was reached to them at the end of a rod or cleft stick no one but a cagot would enter the church by the cagots door or even pass along the streets they inhabited at ossuq in the department of the hautes pyrenees so late as the year a cagot having ventured to dip his band into the larger holywater basin narrowly escaped becoming a victim to popular fury and it is recorded that in the department of the landez ol bardeaux at the beginning of the reign of louis xvi a rich cagot of that country for they were not always poor having been observed to use the holywater basin of the inhabitants of the place at three different times an old soldier went with his sabre to watch one sunday at the church d or and as the cagot was again preparing to violate the law by which his whole race was proscribed the soldier cut off his hand which was immediately picked up and nailed to the church door as awarning to prevent future offences of the same description on the other hand an old woman of sierre castet in the canton of morlaas hautes pyrenees informed m michel that she remembered having when a chljid been frequently beaten by her mother for putting her hand into the holywater basin of tue cagots it is still related at larroque in the same department as an atr cious act of revenge against the cure that a man once introduced gravel into the ck of the cures door so that he was obliged to pass into the church through the door of the cagots at argelos where this door happens not to have been walled up as is so often the case the aversion to the cagots continues so strong among ihe inhabitants that rather than pass through it they make a circuit of above twenty yards and descend into the churchyard by a short ladder although the way of the cagots is at the same time more direct and on a level with the churchyard at lurbe where as we hav said the cagots were numerous it was not easy to keep them separate from the rest of the congregation to there at annoyance of tht cure who took every opportunity of showing openly his contempt for them one of the inhabitants still alive very advanced age remembers that on one occasion just before the breaking out of what we have been accustomed to call the great revolution a cagot woman having acc dentally pasted the bouudary in the church ia which they were re right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren j strained the oure burst into a rage ii the middle of the service and shoutet out votre place ncat pas la cagot et sachez que moi que je soie devan ou derriere vous je auis toujour votr cure mais vous autres que vou soyez devant ou derriere vous ne seres i jamais que de villains cagots the prejudice agaiust the cagoti was not confined to the ulterior of the church for in almost every parish there was a separate cemetery for them or at least a place set apart for them ir the cemetery belonging to the church a person who was not a cagnt woulc not on any account be interred neat thorn people then were as ready in finding arguments to justify their antipathies as they are now at one time thej would charge the cagots with witchcraft at another they would denouticv them as lepers though not tire slightest proof lias ever been found to justify such denunciation according to popular tradition still preserved in two or three places they were the descendants of the carpenter who made tht cross on which christ was crucified and the only reason that could be given for this was that their occupation as mechanics was generally that of carpenter in reply to a remonstrance uttered by them against the refusal oi the clergy of navarre to allow them t participate in the rites of the church the huisser of the conseil royal in opposing their demands traced their genealogy back to gehazi the wicked servant of elisha as the africans are said to be the descendants of canaan the cursed and as the prophets curse was still hanging over them he concluded them to be spiritually leprous and damned one can see in all this the propensity of human uatureto seek justification for feelings which no reason can explain or authorize in religious sanctions it is worthy of remark that the proscribed races of white people like the slacks among us bore the contempt and persecution inflicted upon them j with wonderful patience and in a few instances where the attempt has been made to rescue the cagot population from an intolerant neighborhood by removing them to a distantpart of the country they always showed an eager desire to return to their native place in the beginning of the seventeenth century the medical faculty undertook to undermine this unaccountable prejudice by demonstrating that these cagots were just like other people and one may suppose that philanthropic persons more under the control of their judgment lthan feelings coaopereted in such efforts towards the close of the century the local parliaments began to take up their cause and by various judgments and arrets sought to secure them the enjoyment of civil rights itis recorded that a bishop of tarhes m de rnmagne who died in went so far as to admit to the priesthood several individuals of cagot origin l the first instance of such liberality on the part of the clergy finally i those distinctions of race disappeared almost entirely irf the convulsions of the i french revolution of the cagots of spain were not acknowledged by law till and so late as one of them was obliged to proceed against the inhabitants of arisau before the eccesiastical tribunal of pampeluna to obtain admission to a full participation in the ceremonies of the church the case was not settled till when it was decided in hu favor from the piewaylfaiiia freeman the right df suffrage a convention has been called by the people of color to assemble in harrisburg on the th of december toi take measures to secure their p ditical equality in this state meetings for the same purpose are being held by them in various parts qf the state and we see evidences of an awakening interest in the subject among these victims ol american prejudice and indications ola general and simultaneous movement to regain their rights such an effort we have long hoped for and anticipated as one of the results of their increasing intelligence and selfrespect of its ultimate success we have no more doubt than of the coining ol spring and summer to brighten the brown fields and bare forests let them fairly develops the latent powers which they possess now hidden not only from the world but from themselves let them feel the dignity of manhood and the value of their rights and merging all petty jealousies and coutenti ms in the great object unite in a resolute effort to gain those rights and they will not fail the moral power of forty thousand intelligent men in a calm and determined struggle by peacevul means for their long plundered liberties will be irresistible let none among them j be discouraged by previous failure or long endured oppressieb they are now capable of making a demonstration of feeling atid strength such as they have never before made and tbe whites are better prepared than ever before to listen to their demand they owe it not only to themselves and their children but to the abolitionists who have through year of reproach defended their cause and to ibeir brethren j m bonds whose deliverance their own elevatioa would hasten to lav agile all their

agitation for the am nduient of the constitution to give the tight of suffrage to the people ol color by proper exertions a mamoth petition can berolled in upon the legislature at the coming sessionwhich hall astonish and intimidate its opposers in both parties let them see that we are in earnest that we are willing to spend time and money and labor to secure our object and our request will be respectfully heard and considered a hundred thousand names to such a petition would give weight to our arguments ih their eyes we nelieve that this number can be obtained if every man andwomnn will do thwir duty but if we fail to secure such an array a half a quarter or even a tenth part of the number will make a powerful impression on the lawmakers of the state we are sometimes asked how we can demand a tight for our colored brethren which we would not advise them to exercise because it is their right they should have the same opportunity with ourselves of being their own judges whether to vote or not they j are tnen equal in rights to all othei men and this disfranchisement is a denial of their equal manhood it suggests and enci uiuges insults and injuries to them in all other relations to society and tends to destroy their self respect and degrade them in the eyes of others it is an act of injustice on our part injurious to our own hearts and a precedent to innumerable other wrongs and must tend to create and foster a jealousy among its victims toward th whites it is a denial by our government of our own religious faith and political creed and the support of a foolish aristocracy in our midst wt demand its repeal as an act of duty by the whites of justice to the colored man and a testimony of principle to tin world as we would demand the repeal of a law prohibiting the joining of roman catholic or mormon or ever mahom mfl ac tep sgun ebu relic aw hilt we should not join them or advis others to do so we demand of th government full religious and pniitira freedom for all its subjects and citizens a freedom which would permit them do many things which we wo lira persuade them to avoid and we are willing to trust entirely to the power o truth to restrain the exercise of the liberty we ask is there any inconsistency here then were the protestants ot england inconsistent in advocating catholic emancipation and the libera puritans of new england in removing legal disabilities frstn the quakero then we must limit our claims for thr rights of conscience and personal freedom to auch acts alone as wo believt perfectly moral and

that the petition he printed and referred to the committer on territories pon this motion a very animated dehate seasoned slightly with personalities sprang up mr beutonsaid i brought this petition up in a manner which if it was not the most judicious was certainly so in my opinion to avoid having one single word said about it at this time it presents questions which will occupy sir much of our consideration when wc arrive at them in their regular order andtphere is no necessity of taking them up by wav of anticipation i did nut even make the statement of the contents of the petition because that statement might be inure or less productive of debate asked to have it read and it was read asked that it should be pliuted and referred not making one word of remark all this was doing just as little as could be done to comply with the parliamentary forms mut sir it has been assaiied ami epithets applied to it the senat r from south carolina has said it was natural for me to think of that petition as do and natural for him to think of it as he did well sir the only opinion that expressed about it was that it was a petition of right and respectfully worded and presented that those petitioners were not subject to the imputation of insolence for presenting it and now sir since it has been persevered in will ay tliai the only part of that petition to w hich the term insolent applies in the opinion of the gentleman from south carolina is that part which relates to the subject of slavery i will say that perhaps without knowing it these petitioners have used the very words of the general assembly of virginia to george before the breaking out of the american revolution and though george did not grant that petition yet i never heard that he said it was insolence in the general assembly of virginia to present it mr calhoun replied mr president i made no charge as to the manner in which the petition was presented my objection sir was to the petition itself the senator sees in that petition no disrespect to the people of onehalf the states ol this union i see the greatest disrespect to the people of the south he endeavors to assimilate it to the base of the general assembly of virginia and george the ease sir is antagonistic it bears no comparison mut will not undertake at this time to point out the difference sir the southern states claim the right order the constitution of our country to go into any portion of the territory conquered by the arms of the united states and especially by troops drawn from that portion of the country and l think that to pray that vve shall be excluded from it is the height of insolence though thu senntor from missouri docs not perceive it but that is no fault of mine mr clayton after explaining the part ho had taken in regard to the presentation of the petition on consultation with mr benton defined his position after this fashion mr president i deprecate any discussion upon the two questions which are most calculated to excite any discussion while the petition is in this preliminary stagethe question whether slavery shall be restricted in that territory and the question whether the limits of the territory shall boon this side of the mio grande or whether they shall stop with the rivet these mattets may be appropriately discussed when the committee to which the petition will be referred can make their reort and state propositions distinctly for the consideration ot the american senate mut now fcir there is no question before the senate a debate upon the matter can only have the effect to prejudge the claims of the petitioners to have a civil government my views uwm one great question stated in the memorial aic perfectly well kuown to the senator from suutli carolina and to the senator from florida do submit to ihe gentleman from south carolina that upon full consideration he will reconsider the charge ot insolence it h means that the petition is disrespectful he is greatly mistaken as  thinklt it is insolent it ot coutsc must be direspectful and if it is disrespectful to onc half of the senators upon this floor if it ts disrespectful to any kirtion of ihe senatoib upon this floorit ought not to be received much less to be referred and printed but itis not there is not a word ol it calculated to excitaany such feeling these gentlemen say they are opposed to the introduction of slavery new whether they are abolitionists or whatever they are they have a right to asy thglhive they not j why sir if a petition was sent here claiming to be signed by some fifteen gentlemen who desired that slaves should be introduced there would any gentleman rise and say that it was desresnect ful to onehalf the senate or to onchalf the countryto the great north which has claimed through the whole campaign that thereshall b no slavery either in california or in new mexico mr president l sought to discharge toy duty merely by stating my disposition to give that people a form of cml govermnoot lj regret that any observation should haw fallen from any quarter caleo ated to injure the great cause of the petitioners who claim that a civil government shall be exndfd over them i hope sir that without further opposition if there bad been any opposition rhe memorial will be printedj mr hale spoke more lo the poitt his the conclusion of hb speech thk sir i a petition asking legislation upon a mnt serious subject a subject upon iuclt the honorable senator from mississippi ins well atd that the public mind has been trreatlv agitated and upon which it will cue iimio to bo agitated until the question is definitively sftthd not compromised i do not mievc that compromise will meet the case but it must be settled and settled upon prm cile and it i just as well to meet it here asat auy time hope sir that those who believe that tie people of that country are entitled to a government til be prepared to give a vote upon this question and to give it now ivories sir this question is put upon the democratic platformupon the platform ol of the nicholson letter that sff laid down the doctrine that the matter should be left to the jerplc of the country now eir the people have spoken they have probably read the nicholson lettor sod have thtwgbt that congress in its progressive march bad got up to the step indicated by that letter they may also have heard that there is a change going on in the public mind of this however not heme certain they have come here upon the nicholson letter and have pcttioned fr suh a government as they desire though the election has proved disastrous to the man who built the platform yet it principles arc not so entirely abolished but that they might appeal to the man who built the platform to stand by it now that ii has for the first tunc a practical and efficient meaning they have come here in the very spirit of the nicholson letter and hare asked that we would ghe them the first dose of the nicholson ri dicine and shall we refuse it flfhail we who have been fighting this great battle upon this platform now that the question u put to the test kick over the platform upon which we have stood and upon which we have fought so manfuiiy no sir i trust not but i hope that all those who believe that the ntclnlson lettei contained the true doctrine that there has not been a change in those things will come up and vote lor a government for this people which they asked for with so much confidence although they would have asked for it with stillmore confidence it the author of this nicholson letter had been placed at the head of the government i hojte sir that the memorial lo referred with instructions to the committee to report a bill in accordance with the prayer of the petitioners i pon the question of printing

comprehend our labors oi penetrate the pleasure of this partial toward the first volume of the north star is completed it has lived through one yearhas made its appearance regularlyhas not missed a single friday morning since the day of its publicationthose who subscribed at its commencement have not lost their money by the going down of the paper our pledge that the paper should live one year is redeemed those who refused to subscribe for it on the ground that the paper would not be sustained have thus far been reproved for their w ant of faith and unwillingness to hazard something in a good cause and we trust have been taught to act more w isely and generously in time to come the feasibility of the undertaking has been quite fairly demonstrated and the utility of the existence of such a paper has been established for all this we feel sincerely thankful of the character of the paper thus far we need say but little our readers can judge ol that perhaps better than ourselves that it has not been all that was desired or expected there can he no doubt many imperfections might be easily pointed outboth in the manner and the matter of it we brought to it only that which we had and all that we hadvery little to bo sure but the best could do no more in conducting the paper wc have aimed to make it a terror to evildoers and a praise to those w ho do wellnever in any case shunning to speak the whole truth or shaping our words to gain the favor of any whose friendship is to be gained by concessions to either their dptu wickedness or their neglect of the cause of righteous liberty we have spoken without the fear of man before our eyes at all times trying to place ourselves in the position of the outraged slave wc have striven t sec and to feel the injustice done him as doae unto ourselves and have thought and spoken accordingly on this point we have nothing to regret unless it be that the poverty of our language and the want of skill in the use of it have rendered us unable to convey a just impression ot the foul treachery and ruinous wrongs under which we as a people groat from day to day deeply devoted to the cau of the fettered bondman at the south we have not been unmindful of the rights and interests ot our disfranchised and oppressed brethren at the north while vindicating then rights w c hate not spared their errors or neglected to point out to themso far sew could see the true pathway from ignorance u intelligence and from degradation to respectability at all times commending the faithfu amongst us and rebuking the recreant encouraging what was good and opposing wba was bad hstever may be the complaint which may be urged against the editorial de panment with respect to its moral tone at tb bar of our own conscience we sund acquitted our

however regret the attempt the experience derived from it is most valuable and a satisfactory compensation now tothe future shall the north stsi i continue to sbioirupon the ranks of freedom advancing

these no periodical car long survive unless its proprietors arc disposed trun in debt and this we are resolved not tt do to do so would be a felony if tht north star is sustained it must be done ot j cash terms it must not be done by running it debt the failure to pay which would even bt more disastrous to the cause of the oppressed than would result from the abandonment othe paper great as the

fields have watered them with their bloodthey have baen the laborers of that state the source of all the wealth that the estate enjoysthey have reaped down the fields white the laay lounging whites have reaped the harvest and to expel them from their homes is an act of cruel rapacity deserving the execration of the civilized world we saj to our brethren stay in virginia do not move an inch from her borders give up your lives ralher than your homes be firm show that you are men and not beasts stand by your firesides your wives and your children many of you have wives in bondage stay by them never leave them god will stand by you and the sense of justice ol ihe whole world w ill be ou your side if you give way some other state emboldened by ilie wicked example of virginia will propose the same infernal measure and soon the colored man will be on the bloody bayonets ol white men throughout the union we would that you could hold publ c meetings among yourselves and give to the world an expression of your views and feelings on this subject hut alas in addition to the ten thousand other grievous wrongs you are compelled to endure the right to tell your wrongs to the world is denied you we are left to imagine your hardships and sorrows and this fact speaks trumpettongued of their terrible charfectgr the reasons urged by governor smith fol the expulsion of the free colored people defeat themselves and show that the evils ol which he complains result after all from the immorality and cruelty of ihe whites rathei than from the immorality of tho blacks ii easy to account for the fact if it be a fact that hete is a larger proportion of free negroes in the penitentiary than whites wher it is admitted tha by law he is forbid u intermarry with the whites to bear testimonj against themforbid to learn to read anc write to preach the word of god to his fel i lows and when it is remembered that the i bare testimony of one white man against thai i of a thousand blacks will send a black mar to the penitentiary the disproportion in question is easily accounted for in this same slate of virginia there are seventyone crimes for which a black man may be execuied while only three of the same crimes will subject a white man to the same punishment tne following is an extract from the governors message by the penitentiary report we also learn that on the first day of october last there were in the penitentiary whites and negro convicts the white population contributing about for each persons and ihe free negroes contributing from a similar number of their own race about persons to the penitentiary proving lhat ihe free negro perpetrates at least ten times as much crime in proportion to numbers as the white man this statement verified by our legislation presents such a picture of the moral degradation of our free negro population as i well calculated to excite the the philanthropist without meaning to enter into any discussion as io the moral and intellectual capacity of the negro as to which i have heretofore very fully and distinctly expressed my opinion ask how it is possible thafbe can beutherihan he is under the laws to which we subject him born in a hovel the companion of the slave and the tool ol the vicious white man he naturally sympathizes with the degradation around him bylaw he is forbid to intermarry with the w hites to bear testimony against them to learn to read and w rite to the word of god to his fellows to bgnr arms and to resent insults from a white man many other laws of the same character are on our statute book and in every relation from the cradle to the grave he ta never allowed to forget that he of an inferior race by the providence of goa such is his destiny and according in natural sts history and ihe expenence of all mankind he is rngaided as the third or an inferior species of the race ot man there is such a combination of impiety falsehood and absurdity here that one is led to doubt if such sentiments ever dropped from the lips of a governor in any state of this union why there are fugitive slaves who have never hail a days schooling till after arriving to manhood who would be ashamed to have suchjniserable logic go to the world over their signatures an inferior speats of the race of mm this is the same old trick of tyranny the haughty norman once looked down upon the degraded and subjected anglosaxon as an inferior ecies of the race of man the americans now look down upon tbs mexicans ss so infs riot pecies of the race cf man sod so we suppose it will ever be with successful

has driven a spike into these doubting editors and coolly informs them that he has seen the gold and those who any longer talk of mica in connection w ith it must be geese there is no help for it thenit is gold genuine gold nuw the question after all arires whether it would not be just as well if it were mica the idea insisted on in the message that a mint must at once be established in the gold district that the precious metal may forthwith be coined into u s currency and thus saved to this country is one of the last and cettainly not one of the least blunders in political economy the true policy oi the president ought to be to discourage by all possible means its too rapid diffusion acting on the satm qui pent principle so much in vogue wirh governments he should levy a tax of twentyfive or thirty per cent on all the gold that finds its way into the united stales this would yield a considerable revenue and drive not a small poition of it into other countries and they would thus share the difficulty and the danget of a too sudden expansion of the circulating medium very few argue in these days that gold is very valuable for its own sake it is indeed more ornamental than useful it is good as a medium of exchange representing so much labor it is not the standard of exchange itself but only the representative of that standard it takes a certain amount of labor to grow and bring into market a barrel of flour it takes also a certain amount of labor to dig from the earth and coin into american currency so much gold in the form of halfeagles the labor required to produce the barrel of flour must be just about the same that is rei quired to produce the half eagle else the me would not be an equivalent for the other thelmr merchant willingly takes the hall eagle in exchange for his flourthereforeth coin is by him considered a good representative of the farm produce but if gold could gathered by the handful in the publici streets either in the authorized government form or in chunks of a pound apiece it is very evident that a barrel of flour would be imuch more than an equivalent fuf the hall eagle no law could make the one equal to the other for this simple reason that the amount of labor bestowed upon the one would be much greater than that bestowed upon the i other if we could do without a medium ol exchange at all it would be just so much labor saved suppose the amount of what arc called the precious metals already dug from the mines to be just equal to one years entire crop the probability is that the mining and coining of these metals have required a years labor of as many men as are now employed in cultivating the soil tho men who dug the ore had to be rewarded for thctma j bor and it took just about as much of the earths produce to support life in them while they were thus occupied as it does now to pay and support the agricultural laborers this is what regulates the price of gold it is not in this respect like other articles of commerce regulated by the demand and supply the reason is that gold is not corruptible and loses little or nothing of its value by age that which was dug from the bowels of lie arth a hundred years since is just as valuable as that which was melted yesterday in the mint at philadelphia not so with manufactured goods or the produce of the farm they all lose and lose greatly by age some of them become entirely valueless in the course of a very few years therefore if there is more brought into the market than is required for immediate use the piospective loss by age leads those who have these articles of meichandize to dispose of to force asale by suffering a present perhaps comparatively small rather than run the risk of a futute and possibly a much greater loss that only then which affects the price of gold is the greater or less amount of labor required taking the average of the peruvian chilian virginian and all other mines to get t into a marketable state this has been for swne years past as before stated in this country at the rate of about half an eagle for a barrel of flour dollar bills and banknotes rest on s different foundation they are mere promises to pay either in gold or in something else of which gold is the representative the amount stated let it once be found that the promise to pay is sunply s promise and nothing more forthwith the bill become so much piper no one will take ths promise for the fact wbat tbe value of gold may hereafter beihat is how much labor it will represent is now the question itis not hfefcly that as was recently the case at california it may become so depreciated by the ease with which it can be obtained that s much as now sells here for may be tbe price of s barrel uf flour such an amount of depreciation is scarcely possible yet this one fact shows wherein consists the value of tfold it course an exaggerated ease tbe four being a necessary of hfr and tbe e being less to be got than there was a demand for it received an unusual and fictitious addition to its value by tbe com petition to obtain tv that there must and will be a certain da predation in tbe value of gold there seems tobe bat little doubt if the accounts of col mason an j tbe row akaie of monterey so to be relied spun sal then seems to be oo reaooo to doubt tbetr veracity it appears jhat one ma can make about eday that ia mere than twelve time the usual daily average f labor in the united states could i this ratio be kept up or a sufficient length of time nothing coukl pren at gold from becotn i utg twelve times less valuable tlan it mm i instead of net half eagle purchasing the bartel of floor six whole cashs would scarcely suffic lor that purpose where then m lh advantage ul this gold discovery thera i unite far as concents that metal as a me diuin of exchange it is of importance only as gold can be used for many ornamental ant useful purpxses in the meantime it is said that at least one hundred thousand adventurers are on then j way to the land of promise dreaming ol wealth without labor and as much gold ash they can carry for little more than the trouble of lifling it many of them are doomed tobe miserably disappointed ere long a process other loan that of w ashing it in a hand sieve will be required to get the gold it will have to be dug for in california as elsewhere long find deep it will have to be separated from other and baser metals capital will be required for this labor will be required for it and then the goldseeker will have a different story to relate about the gold regiou of california the probability is that instead of realizing lb a day the laborer will be tolerably well sati fied if he gets one dollat oic good effect resulting from this emigration to california is that the majority of the emigrants being northern men they may rea sonably be expected to hold northern views on the subject of slavery their influence will thetefore be used for the exclusion of slavery from that leiritory if this result follows in consequence of the emigration j thither who that is not himself a slavehuld er and an enemy to his race but will rejoice that the fortunate discovery has been made were the dmstets and disappointments attending them a thousand times greater than even those who indulge the most gloomy apprehensions anticipate will not such a glorious triumph of right over w

under circumstances like these could encouniei and overcome the task can there be i the whole world a youth who can fim an excuse lor thenonperfipance scotchmen and scotch music the following instance shows whai scotch music will mak a scotchman do when out of bis own country a gentleman who was a first rate performer of scotch music on the violin spent a winter in exeter and oi course soon became acquainted with the musical dilletanti of the place diniug one day with a professor the conversation turned upon scotch music and a wrong argument arose as to it bearing competition with foreign mo sic the scotchman whom we shall for the present designate the fhdier maiming that wbeo properly played nsthiag could excel it the professor on um other hand insisting that it vena only fit for tha bnreyardt i iv tell you what says the fiddler itf toy you a wagor of that if a patty of scotchmen can ho got together id make them abed tear one minute iwg the next and dancethe third done ay the professor and if your music is capable of that i will oat only pay you the with pleasure but will he convinced that it is the most enlivening pathetic and best music in the world the difficulty arose as to getting an opportunity for a trial but this was soon obviated by a third party informing them that a number of young scotchmen dined annually at the old london hotel on the anniversary of burns birthday this was a capital opportunity for the fiddler for these young men being principally rawboned overgrown scotch lads who had recently left their own country to carry tea in the neighborhood were the vefry ones upon whom he was sure to make a kit ah being now mranged and the utmost secrecy being agreed upon the eventful day was anxiously looked for at length it came and the fiddler and professor by an introduction to one of the party got an invitation to the dinner there were twelve altogether sat down and a right merry party they soon became for the whiskey toddy was not spared when the memory of any of scotias bards was toasted the fiddler was not long in perceiving that be had got among a right musical set and he waited patiently till they were fit for anything at length he gave a wink to the professor who at once proposed that bis friend should favor them with a scotch tune on the violin capital capital cried the whole party the violin was brought and all were in breathless anxiety the fiddler chose for hia first tune hercs a health to them thats aiva and played t in the most solemn and pathetic man ner thats a waefu tune said a great big rawboned youth to his next neigh bor lt is that sandy theres meikle in that tune man it reminds me o ane thats gane jamie at the same time giving a deep sigh and drawing his hand over his long gaunt face to hide the tears which were trickling down his cheeks the fiddler with his keen eye soon perceived that before he got through the second part of the tune he would have them all in the same mood he therefore threw his whule soul into the instrument played the tune as he had never done before and as the last four bars of the tune died away like a distant echo there was not a dry cheek amongst the company now is the time thought the fiddler and without stopping a moment struck up in a bold vigorous style willie brewd a peckomaut out went the handkerchiefs away went the tears chorus cried the fiddler and in an instant all struck up for ve arc nae foa were pa that fou but just a drappie in ouree the cock mav c aw ihe day may daw but aye well taste the barley hree the song ended up struck the fiddler in his best style the reel of jenny dang the weaver hey ye devil cried sandy scotland forever cried jamie and in an instant tables chairs and glasses were scattered in all directions and the whole party dancing and jumping like madmen out ran the affrighted professor for he did not know wlmt might come next up came the landlady with her terrified train of inmates but none durst enter the room the hurras and thumps on the floor being so boisterous aud it was only upon the entry of a scotch traveler who had just arrived and who cried to the fiddler for any sake to stop that order was restored it is needless to say that the professor paid his bet cheerfully and was fully convinced of the effect of scotch music when properly played and that the landlady took care that the fiddler never came into her house again on burns anniversary dinner the rev clesar otway in his recently published paper on the intellectuality of domestic animals gives the following anecdote which is by far too good not to receive thcben efit of a wider circulation at the flour mills of tubbera keena nearclommel while in the possession of the late mr newbold there was a goose which by some accident was left solitary without mat or offspring gander or goslings now it happened as iu common i that the millers wife bad set a number eggs nndera hen which iu due fluv and of course the time wepe incuuar or h ducklings as soon as they can ran with natural instinct to the water and the hen was in a sad puckerher maternity urging her to follow the brood and her selfishness disposing her to keep on dry land in the meanwhile up sailed the goose and with a noisy gabble which certainly being interpreted meant leave them to my care she swam up and down with the ducklings and when they were tired with their aquatic excursion she consigned them to the care of the hen the next morning down came again the iucklings to the pond and there was he goose waiting for them and there stood the hen in her great lustration on this occasion we are not at all sure that th goose invited the henob serving her maternal troublebut it iia fact that she being near the shore the hen jtmped on her back and there t the ducklitfg swimming and the goose and hen after them up and down the pond and this was not a aolitary event day after day the hen was seen on board the gooee attending the ducklings up and down in perfect contentedness and good humor numbers of people coming to witnese the circumstance which continued until the ducklings coining to days df discretion required no longer the joint guardianship of the goose and hen jh genius will never be neglected by the public unless it neglects itself u must not disdain the humble alliaoee of industry how can it expect encouragement unless its existence can be manifested by performances the sorest evidence of superior talent is that it force itself in spite of advene circumstances that it rushes a road where it finds bom  sltotthwmtnte lapertafct to
