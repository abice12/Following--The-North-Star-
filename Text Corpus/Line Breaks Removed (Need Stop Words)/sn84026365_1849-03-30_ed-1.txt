in die opening of this discussion we remarked that there were certain questions which deeply agitate us ut home it is indeed a part of that great movement in mens minds which pervades the whole civilized world abroad men are demanding more freedom for themselves here we are demanding it for the slave we have come and the whole world has come within a few years to a new view of the whole subject but at the present moment the demand here has taken a particular form a determination has very plainly manifested itseli in this nation within a few months past that there shall be no further extension of the slave system upon our territory we belive that effectively the battle for free soil is already fought and the victory won we rejoice at it more than we rejoice at any public event within our memory whether we are right or wrong the impulse of our whole heart is to say we thank god for it we rejoice at it aud we give thanks but it is in no spirit of unkiudness to our fellowcitizens of the southern states we respect many of them whom we know we believe them tobe perfectly sincere and conscientious in the defence of their system but they must allow us to be sincere too and conscientious we believe that enslaving men is substantially a wrong we cannot get over nor around nor away from the conviction that it is awrong which instead of being extended should bo extinguished as fast as possible we believe that it is awrong to human nature that it is awrong to man as man what it is toman as an animal we will not now ask wnether it feeds and clothes him well whether it makes him comfortable whether it allows him to be sportive and joyous or how often it visits him with stripes gushes him with wounds sends bloodhounds to pursue linn like a dog wolf we will not ask human slavery is u wrong to the nature that it takes effect upon it iniskes and maltreats that nature there stands a human being may his master cultivate his faculties as he would those of a child by no means it will never do he will be no longer a slave slavery then denies to this nature its inherent rights denies its progress comiflfaufe it to sop to stand stillwill not does not dares not permit it to rise by let me any man the stoutest defender of this system would you think it right to enslave the poorest meanest most misoruble most imbecile white man that lives in the next cottage would think it right right before god to seize bun and buy him and sell him and sell his wile and his children and their posterity forever after into hopeless bondage the answer is no the conscience of all the world says no what then can the complexion ot a skin whitened by a northern sky bronzed by an indian clinic or biuckenened beneath the heats of africamake all this stupendous difference beneath r hit and wrongmake that to be just under one shade of color which under another would be infinitely unjust u this the i ethics of the slave systemthat a brand or a chain upon a white skm is u heinous wrong to make all the world erv out with indigntiou and that a brand ora chain upon a colored skm is a righteous aud lawful mark or badge this is the strong ground of the the north star i free soil argument but this is not all the wrong principle work out bad effects not as visionary dreamers not as mere moralizers do we protest against the slave system bat as political economists as patriot citizens a those who wish to see upon their territories the most vigorous and prosperous growth of men if there were a upas tree which could be introduced into california and new mexico to spread a fatal blight throughout all the land who would permit it to be planted there slavery is that upastree it is a blight to industry making it a degra tion it is a blight to the very soil exhausting its fertility it is a blight to the general education of the white race from the necessary sparseness of that class of the population it is a blight to whole internal activity and mechanical genius and commercial prosperity ol any people why one of the strongest pleas for the occupancy of a new soil is that the old is worn out it is said we know that the torrid zone cannot be cultivated by any but black men suppose it were true is that an argument for making them slaves but we doubt if it be so we do not believe there is any region in which white men cannot be acclimated and accustomed to toil are the people of brazil and hindoostan and siam black men and even if the burning line bronzes the complexions of men as they approach it is that we repeat any reason for making them slaves do the free and fierce elements as they sweep around write slave upon the brow which they have darkened no complexion is not the brand of servitude even in the slaveholders estimation it is descent from the slave mother even though her children be almost as white as their master it is not natures direction but arbitrary enactment that makes a slave it is local law and it seems to us that it would have been much wiser for the slaveholder to have said that the law established a relation rather than a tenure a certain relation between him and the slave like the old serfdom rather than property in man a human being to be property commodity chattel implement universal human nature cries out upon it with abhorrence the idea is not tenable not tolerable hardly conceivable no it is a relation established by arbitrary particular local law the slaveholder is estopped by all natural law from arguing that lie has just as good a right to carry his slaves to the new territory as to carry lis horse or his plough or his cotton nill but here is the trouble if the planter vere forbidden by the government to arry a certain machine for packing cotton to the new territories because it was known to injure the fabrics doubtless then lie would be offended but it is a very different kind of offence that he takes at being forbidden to carry his slaves there what is this difference why does this latter prohibition or the proposal of it awaken such a peculiar sensibility it is that the refusal is put on moral grounds itis our fixed conviction that slavery is morally wrong that makes our position so exasperating to the people of the south they say you proscribe us by the proposed law you assail our character you say that we have among us a practice so bad that it cannot be tolerated then we must be bad men we cannot submit to this for our own part we are painfully sensible to this hearing of our position and our argument to their bearing upon many excellent honorable and christian men but we must say that the fault is not ours we have taken no new ground upon this matter of slavery it is they that have placed themselves into a new and a wrong position pressed by attacks from the north and indeed from the whole civilized world and led on by an eminent statesman of their own they have forsaken the old defensive ground and assumed the offensive they have forsaken the ground which their and our fathers held that slavery was a system entailed upon them and from which they could not immediately free themselvesand they boldly maintain that it is a most excellent a most admirable a most christian institution and ought to be permanent that it is is perfectly just and right to buy and sell men like cattle in the market and to hold them in bondage forever it is this that has brought us into direct moral collision as opposing parties who shall yield it is a solemn and momentous question we cannot it they will not if the southern states choose to break off from this republic and to set up a confederacy for themselves thore are two things we think not to mention others which are to be commended to their very serious consideration first it has been very well asked which of these states will consent to be border states will virginia and kentucky or will north carolina and tennessee they must build a wall far higher than the chinese wall or they cannot keep their slaves a month the bondman will have but to pass an imaginary line or leap a fence and he will be free next the republic that establishes itself with the feelings and on the simple footing of a preference of the slave system will lay itselt under the ban of the whole christiau world we should not wonder if some civilized nations should refuse to send embassadors to it we should not wonder if by others the very courtesies of private life should be denied to its citizeus the reproach of which they now complaiu would gather into a weight of universal re probalion that would be enough to crush down any people they may resent the suggestion now they may say right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren they are sufficient to themselves bul no family no community no nation can long stand against universal scorn and indignation the inhabitants ol such a country wauld gradualy forsake it or they would go down in selfre spect in virtue in character as certainly as there are laws of the social world that bind them in common with other men these are painful things to say butin common with many other considerations they persuade us that there will be no dissolution of this union it is painful to say this but on such a subject free frank plain woids are to bespoken the true courtesy between honest and honorable men is perfect and fearless sincerity if we had broilers of our own blood in the south we should say this we should say you cannot separate from us you cannot arrange any feasible plan of separation and you would bring upon yourselves the deepest injury and dishonor before the whole world if you could we say dishonor before the world there is no doubt about that but we mind not mainly in this matter what the world says what the world calls dishonor we stand upon the ground of eternal right where is the man on the face of gods earth who will say that for the slave to break the chain which binds him and to flee from it is an unworthy deed is forbidden by natures law nowhere the voice of all the world thus adjudges slavery to be a wrong to humanity freedom wejsay is our natures birthright weare called to liberty by the voice of heaven and now emphatically of earth also a cry has gone through the world saying up and demand justice up and be free justice empires are shaken thrones tremble kings grow pale at that word justice it is the stability of the universe it is the throne of heaven it is the guardianship of the world it is the law of all time it is the empire of eternity extract from gerrit smiths address on the constitution the most glaring instance in which in our own country government fails to afford protection to its subjects is slavery it not only suffers one person to enslave another with impunity butin all its departments legislative executive judicial actually encourages helps and defends the outrage one of its excuses for arraying itself on the of the slaveholder is that they intended it should who framed the federal constitution no such intentions however are expressed in that antislavery instrument nor the intention of its framers which should govern the interpretation of it the intentions of the framers of the constitution are entitled to no more weight in the ascertainment of its meaning than are the intentions of the scrivener in determining the sense of the deed or contract which he had been employed to write we do not deny that a few it was only a very fewof the framers of the constitution undertook to get slavery into it but the understanding unanimous from the first that if slavery were brought into it it must be so brought in as neither to be seen to be brought in nor ever afterwards to beseen to be in had laid an insurmountable obstacle upon the very threshhold of their undertaking slavery cannot be an invisible monarch it can exist nowhere without being seen as well as felt to suppose that the monster could unseen enter the constitution and unseen lie coiled up in it is as absurd as the supposition that satan could come among the sons of goi without being detected by the all seeing eye to speak less figuratively the instrument which is drawn up with the intelligent and steadfast purpose ol having it serve and be forever fully and gloriously identified with the cause of liberty republicanism and equal rights must of necessity be shut against the claims and pretensions of slavery the federal government has power under its constitution to abolish every part of american slavery and is supremely guilty for refusing to exercise it but why speak of the constitution or any other paper wdien the question raised is whether the government shall protect or suppress slaveholding suppose that the two hundred and fifty thousand pirates whom this corrupt and bloody nation cherishes in her bosom were to substitute for their claim to the black skin an equal claim to the blue eyes or for their claim to enslave men the more moderate one to kill them would government deign so much as a single glance at the laws statutary organic what not which these pirates might hunt up in support of their claims certainly not it would in that case feel as it always should feel that the sole end of civil government is to protect rights and that it might as well be openly repudiating its functions and destroying its very existence as to be giving countenance to searches after authorities for destroying rights laws which interpret define secure rights government is to respect and laws which mistakingly yet honestly aim at this end it is not to despise but laws which are enacted to destroy rights it should trample under foot for to say nothing worse of them they are a gross insult upon it inasmuch as they are a shameless attempt to turn it from good to evil and from its just and heaven intended uses to uses of a diametrically opposite character moreover civil government is to regard such laws as utterly void for the reason that hey are an outrage and an open war upon the inflexible and eternal justice which j underlies all obligatory laws such rochester n y friday march lavs in a word it is to regard as no laws should it follow them it would cease to be civil government no less so than the physician would cease tobe a physician and would become a murderer who should substitute for the purpose and effort to save life the purpose and effort to destroy it whatever then may be said of the lawfulness of slavery government instead of strengthening the hand of the slaveholder must punish him and because murder itself does not surpass his crime it is grossly inconsistent and partial if it do not punish him with the severest punishment which it inflicts be that punishment confinement in the state prison or suspension from the gallows again whatever may be said of the lawfulness of slavery government must abolish it if it have a constitution under which it cannot abolish slavery then it must override its constitution and abolish slavery but whether under or over the constitution it must abolish slavery we are not unware that there maybe persons who will admit that whether with or against the constitution the federal government is bound to abolish slavery within the limits of its exclusive jurisdiction as for instance in the district of columbia or a territory but who at the same time will deny that beyond these limits as for instance in virginia it has power over slavery a few words will suffice to show their error the powers of the federal government as specified in the constitution are cofessedlv paramount to state authority and the exercise of them is confessedly to be left unobstructed by state authority but several of these powers may be made either partially nugatory or entirely incapable of being carried out if the states may setup or maintain slavery the federal government has power to guarantee to every state in this union a republican iorm of government also to protect each of them against invasion also against domestic violence it has impliedly if not indeed expressly power to provide for the common defence and general welfare of the united states but to how very limited an extent can these powers be exercised amidst the influence and obstacles of slavery now if the states may thus counteract these powers it is absurd to say that certain laws give a man power to drive his carriage through the streets if at the same time other laws inay be effectually pleaded for blocking its wheels the federal government is reduced to no government at all beyond the sphere of its excluisve jurisdiction if the state governments are permitted to sink themselves into mere piracies and to create within their respective limits an atmosphere in which the federal government cannot live and move and have its being that the federal government lias the power to abolish the whole oi american slavery is not a new doctrine at the time our government came into being slavery was regarded on all hands as an expiring institution and hence this doctrine then met with very little of that ferocious resistance which it encounters now that slavery has become the rampant and supreme power of the land very distinguished opponents of the abbolition of slavery then admitted this doctrine said the celebrated patrick henry when opposing in the virginia convention the adoption of the federal constitution has congress not power to provide for the general defence and welfare may they pronounce all slaves free and will they not be warranted by that power there is no ambiguous implication or logical deduction the paper the constitution speaks to the point they have the power in clear unequivocal terms and will clearly and certainly exereise it we need add nothing to make it plain that the state governments cannot interefere with or deny the power of the federal government to abolish every part and parcel of american slavery but it is claimed that there are outside of the state governments two things which deny this power one of these is in thg constitution aßd the other is out of it that which is in it is the clause respecting fugitives from service it is enough to say of this clause that whilst it cannot by a proper use of language be made to apply to slaves it does by such use apply to otherssuch as apprentices and minor children the other of the two things we have already disposed of itis the intentions of the framers of the constitution being but that it is not only out of the constitution but has nothing to do with it whatever may be said of that part of the constitution which respectsrep resentaton in congress no one pretends that it forbids the abolition of slavery by either the federal or state governments and whatever may be said of that part of it which respects the importation of persons all admit that its force expire forty yesrs ago the admission ia often made by those who claim that the federal government can abolish the whole system of american slavery that it can do soonly through th judieiury but should even this much be admitted i the constitution says that congress shall have power to make all laws which shall he necessary and proper for carrying into execution its pow ers vested in the constitution in this government of the united states or in any department or officers thereof and it slavery as we have seen that it does stand in tba way of any of these powers then have we not both the clearest sad the fullest constitutional authority for taking the ground that congreas may make laws to remove slavery or any other obstacle which is in the way ofcarrying into execution its powers from th cayuga nenu foreign correspondence bristol england jan dear friend and as such i address you no doubt you will be surprised to receive a letter from me unknown as i must be to you but as a member of the committee of the bristol branch of the league of universal brotherhood wishing to have a correspondent in america i asked that noble advocate of peace and freedom elihu burritt to iurnish me with the address of an individual in the united states interested in the cause of the league and he kindly gave me your name with a wish that i would correspond with you and give some particulars upon the state of our cause in this country such is my reason for now writing since that magnificent assembly at brussels last autumn the peace movement has taken a new aspect for that demonstration has been the means of arousing the attention of the whole of europe to the absurd and costly system of war as a means to settle international disputes most of the principal newspapers in this country and in france have commented upon it and many of them in the most favorable manner the committee formed by the peace congress have been most energetically at work agitating the people of this country to support their proposals of establishing a high court of nations and submitting all future misunderstanding to arbitration e burrit with mr richards secretary of the london peace society have been traversing the country for the past two months holding meetings in most of the principal towns in england and scotland the meetings generally have been of the most triumphant character in fact the working classes appear to sympathize with the movement for although they may not abhor war as much as we would wish from its being a great outrage upon our character as a christian nation and a monstrous violation of every christian precept they most thoroughly denounce it when considered in a financial point of view for their eyes have been opened to seethat our enormous military establishments are a great burden to the nation and that the immense taxation under which they labor is owing in a great extent to their maintenance the voice of public opinion has begun to flow against this monster evil and the promised motion of richard cobden to reduce the army and navy will be supported most truly by the majority of my countrymen but when i remember that so many of our legislators are directly interested in opposing it i fear that the motion when brought before parliament will not be successful for the present but of its ultimate success there can be no doubt for our governors must yield to public opinion when it has gathered sufficient strength petitions will be sent to parliament from most of the towns in england in reference to our military establishment and also on arbitration vs war the league is now fairly organized in the country and as our pledge is so comprehensive our efforts are not confined to peace the abolition of slavery wherever it may exist is also our aim and i should suppose that in the united states every member of the league exerts himself in every possible way for its annihilation in your republica new movement has commenced in this country in reference to the subject the secretary of the british and foreign antislavery society has addressed large audiences on the connection of brazilian and cuban slavery with the markets of great britain for it appears that treaties exist between those countries according to which all slaves that have been introduced into cuba or brazil for many years past are entitled to their freedom but it isa lamentable fact that these treaties have never been respectedif they had been the abominable slavetrade with africa would in all probability have been annihilated long ago now the antislavery society are arousing the country to the facts of the case and petitions will be sent to the government calling upon our foreign minister to negotiate at once with spain and brazil for the fulfilment of these treaties and that in case those nations object to set at liberty the slaves that have been imported since the treaties it is proposed that great britain should close her ports against cuban and brazilian produce admirable proposition and the people of this country appear determined to be no longer outraged by their bad faith upon this great question in which the happiness of millions of our fellowcreatures are concerned i attended a meeting last week in this city upon the subject i should think there were two thousand persons present and it was resolved that a petition should be sent from this city supporting the proposal of the antislavery society how does the abolition movement gaps ground with you we hope to gel iff a meeting here on ocean penny postage between england and america the idea is gradually gaining the support of enlightened englishmen but it appears to me that you must first establish a penny postage in america before it can be earned into effect the present state of the european continent is tranquility how long it will continue so is impossible to say ilt certainly is delightful to think tbaff although the state of the different nations of europe has been most tumultuous and bloody conflicts have takei place old england has been quiet prosperous and happy and has beet the wonder and admiration of neighboring nations i will send a paper occasionally as no doubt you will be pleased to knowhow matters go on this side of the atlantic i should be greatly obliged il you would send me one of douglass north star hoping you will excuse the familiar way have addressed you i must now conclude hoping to receive as mr burritt told me i might expect a hearty response fori shall be glad to hear the state of the league and the slavery abolition movement in your republic and the informatich you can give me will not be confined to myself for i shall read your response to the committee of the league here i am your sincerely lancelot brown reply sfringfort d mo dear friend lancelot brown our brother leaguer l w capen has had the kindness to present thy letter to our society for their information and attention that they might answer it more immediately than he is able to do therefore we the members of the corresponding committee on behalf of the little band here do gladly embrace the opportunity thus afforded of intercommunication with the committee of your branch at bristol ours is a most noble causeone which must call into exercise the first graces of the christian character our pledge boldly asserts the great principle of love and confederacy with all of every clime color or condition inhumanity god is no respecter of persons and why should thore men who love and serve him wish any other guidance than his and that of his son our lord and saviour jesus crist love to god and love for man is the spirit or essence of the new testament and while we stand pledged for the latter let us not forget that wc cannot be true to that pledge unless we love god with our whole heart and ever prefer his will to our own pleasure we believe that it is only by having this spirit diffused within us by being thoroughly leavened with it that we can come to love our neighbor or fellowman as ourselves selfishness is a besetting sin of mankind so deep rooted as to require a total change of heart to remove it and until that change there is comparatively no safety in the hour of temptation united as we are in this grand and benevolent scheme we rejoice at the opportunity here afforded of imparting our feelings to kindred spirits across the water may we be enabled often to encourage and instruct one another to stir up each other by way of remembrance into a more holy zeal we sec the wicked united and closely banded together for evil and christians standing apart doubting and distrusting one another for fear of invalidating some peculiar tenet ah shame on them where is that charity the chief of all virtues which paul so ex toleth in the twentyeth chapter of his first epistle to the corinthians weare all entitled to our views in these minor matters but let us uot be accused as the jews were formerly of tithing mint and annis and cumminarid leaving the weightier matters of the law as judgment and mercy rather let us give the weightier matters their place and not forget the others let us unite closely firmly vigorously in this great work of philanthropy and in that spirit of love and harm my which the gospel inculcates march onto victory our hearts were gladdened with the good tidings of your success in europe in the present day thanks be to god the good of every country seem to be united and a blow struck at the root of the corrupt tree in one country causes the far distant branches in another to tremble we unite with you in the belief that our pledge binds us to exert ourselves in behalf of the oppressed and enslaved as well as to throw off the yoke of military establishments we believe that our country is at last awakening to the importance of the abolition movement to the weight of the curse and the enormous ioiquity of the sys tem the south united in that one interest the maintenance of their peculiar institution have long ruled the land aided by the blindness of party prejudices they nominate their own men to the first posts in the nation certain that they can find a sufficient number that will prefer the aggrandisement of their party to any other consideration these men actuated by the idea of choosing the better of two evils or of defeating their political opponentsshow that their love of party and their defeat in minor matters in politics is of more importance to them than the compromise of their principlesof more importance than assisting and abbelting slavery by placing its minions at the bead of our government there is not the least doubt that an overwhelming majority stand convinced in their own hearts as to the justice of the abolition of slavery mar thejr be brought from under this old dominion and to act independently and pointedly towards the cause of immediate abolition our country is undoubtedly swaken ing fromt its lethargy let it awake from its dumber arise and shake it

decide whether wet can consistently vote for military chieftains or slaveholders let us have your views on these important subjects and how far the clause for the abolition of all restrictions upon international correspondence and friendly intercourse requires the maintenance of the principles of free trade you can look with unprejudiced eyes on these subjects and we would be glad to have a clear exposition of your views the question of cheap postage is being mooted in our land and our government seems convinced of its utility so that we soon expect farther reductions please send us a copy of your petition on the subject of arbitration and honor our letter with an early answer in the assurance of love weare your fellow leaguers on behalf of the springport branch league of universal brotherhood b b howland secy corresponding com the overthrow of slavery it is argued hy some that christianity will eventually overthrow and root out slavery from the united states this may be true but it is certain that slavery will never be rooted out by a christianity which sanctions it and which attempts to sustain it by the bible how is it possible that the professed christians who regard slavery as being in strict accordance with both the old and new testament can believe they possess a christianity which will overthrow and root out a system which that very christianity sanctions who believes that christianity would ever have overthrown idolatry in the roman empire if christianity had tolerated and sanctioned idolatry and attempted to prove from the scriptures that idolatry was right there is no christianity in the world that sanctions slavery that will ever put it down it is a contradiction in terms we might as well say fire will freeze you or ice warm you the sentiment possesses nothing of philosophy or sound reason because it looks to a powerless cause for an important result we do not say christianity is powerless but we say any sentiment religion morals or any thing else which exercises all its powers in upholding and defending a sentiment system or practice is not pulling it down but propping and building it up it is clear that if the christian principle of the whole country should be simultaneously elevated so as to regard and acknowledge slaveholding a sin in the sight of god such a christianity would root out slavery but it can never be overthrown

publishes the recent letter of henry clay on slavery and colonization taking no exceptions to any of its inhuman suggestions and atrocious views lie christian observatory for april with its seven editors nehemiah adams e n kirk e beecher c and backed up by lr w ouds prof stuait and the other theological oracles at andover is so delighted at the apjiearance of the letter op this distinguished and influential statesman as to exclaim slaveholding that huge and inert inass ofopression re at last decidedly tottering to its fall at last forsooth it takes henry clay to give slavery a staggering blow and the way in which he does it is by remaining an incorrigible slaveholder himselfby denying the right of the slaves in kentucky to their freedom at any time as inherentby projecting a scheme of emancipation and expatriation as wicked delusive and tyrannical in principle and design as was ever concocted in anv pit with or without a bottom the observatory admits that it may be true that his scheme is impracticable and that it only illustrates the rigorous spirit of slaveholding but it gives no opinion on that point so much lor these evangelical organs which seem tobe organically incapable of the least moral discrimination whenever the case of the slave population is brought up for consideration the observer has no vision and the observatory has seven men on the lookout who are stone blind but the observatory makes one concession slaveholding is oppressionand oppression is hateful to god and cwel to man itis then to be put into the category of sins in the abandonment of which tfiere should be nodelay very well now what w hould the observatory say to a scheme for the abolition of idolatry in india advocated on the same principles and plan as are embodied in the letter ol mr clay in reference to the abolition of slavery in kentucky we pause for a reply lturalor lin posture exposed i hare appeared about tw o months since in the liberator a statement headed beware of new orleansand signed john caliis and harlotte caliis its purport was that the fiid john and charlotte shipped in may the first as cook and the second as stewardess on board tbe schooner comet at baltimore john frisbv master bound for tampico and new orleans that on tbe arrival of the vessel at the latter port they were arrested by the proper authorities aud alter the usual preliminaries placed in the chain gang chained together where they continued for some mouths that in march the man john caliiswas recognised dy lieutenant carpenter of the united staies navy under whom he had served on the pacific station in the frigate constitution in and that through the efloits ofthis gentleman j both caliis and his wife were released and permitted to return to the north it is further slated that the inability of the parties to liquidate their jail fees led to some delay but thev at length shipped on board a vessel which made a voyage to europe and returned to now orleans where alter being deprived ofa their wages to satisfy their jail fees they ojtauied a passage for boston this whole story is no doubt a fabrication here is no lieutenant in the u s n bv the name of carpenter but we learn from capt carpenter who is no oouht reteired to thaiht knows no man by the name of caliisthat he was not in new orleans in march i but at that time was stationed at norfolk j that he was not in the constitution in and that when he served on board that vesel there was no such person as caliis among her people the man who has taken this name has probably been in new orleans and nerved under capt carpenter peihaps in the constitution under a different name hut further than that we do not believe lus story to contain a word of truth it was first told m boston where as there was nothing improbable in it it obtained credit and the narrator some money he then came to new york and met with the same sucees he also pretends to be in possession of s largo a mouut of property in ibia city which he was desirous that some careful friend should sell lor hm and reinvest the proceda such i roperiy we find does not exist and calhs who felt at this office ins address both at his i sidonee and at a store where he had procured work is not to be found he is not known at either of those places we do not itiute therefore to denounce him ts an iinoaior and state our reasons for thinking so aud the maiu points ofth story he tells that the public may m on us guardanti tsavery standard the north star rochester march aments on gertit talthi addrcaa it will be remembered that mr smifb referred us in last weeks paper to this ad dreaa for ins news respecting the constitutionality of slavery and rmualljr aaid to us dispose of these and if it shall the be necessary you shall have more to us the address is quite unsatisfactory and unsound about what a government ought to be so far as relates to a crime like slavery there is no difference of opinion between us that it is the duty of a government to piotect the rights and liberties of its subjects there is do question and that that government which fails to do this is extremely guilty there is equal agreement what a government ought to do is one thing but not the thing germane toi the question at issue between mr smith and ourselves thtt government ought to be just merciful holy is granted the question is not however wbat a government ought to be or to do but what the government of the united stales is authorized to be and to do by the constitution of the united states the two questioss should be kept separate that tbe simplest may undemand as blending them only leads to confusion it is because we hold civil government to be solemnly bound to protect the weak against ihe strong the oppressed against the oppressor the few against the many and to secure the humblest subject in the full possession of his rights of person and of property that we utterly abhor and repudiate this government and the constitution as a dark and damning conspiracy against all the purposes of government both its framers and administrators were and have been until now little better than a band of pirates we would make clean work of both the government and the constitution and not amend or force a new construction upon either contradicted by the whole history of the nation but would abolish both and reconstruct a constitution and a government which shall better answer the ends of justice to think ot g od government in a lnion wtihj slaveholders and under a constitution framed by slaveholders the practical operation of which for sixty years has been to strengthen sustain and spread slavery does seem to us delusive we are not for mending old clothes with new cloth or putting new wine into old bottles but for starting afresh under ja new and higher light than out piratical fathers saw and form a constitution and government which shall be so clear and explicit that no doubt can be entertained as to its minutest purposes that this cannot be truthfully affirmed of our present constitution we need not insist upon at this time even our friend smith virtually admits that it would be dangerous to leave the question of the slaves redemption to be decided in the light of the constitution the old tattered parchment receives no great deference from him after all disdaining it altogether he says whatever may be said oj the lawfulness of slavery government must abolish it if it have a c under which it cannot abolish slavery then it must override the constitution and abolish slavery but ichether under or over ihe constitution it must abolish slavery we like this for its wholesouled devotion to a glorious object it is revolutionary and looks as much like the fanaticism of wendell phillips and william lloyd garrison as if it had been cast in their mould in plain terms mr smiih is for the abolition of slavery whetheri in accordance with or in violation of the constitution and while the declaration is worthy of his noble heart we cannot think such of his head the doctrine laid down in this declaration runs through the whole address and gives it a vigor and warmth from beginning to end we shall therefore express a few thoughts upon it it will be seen that the doctrine in question makes the government superior to and independent of the constitution which is the very charter of the government and without which the government is nothing better than a lawless mob acting without any other or higher authority than its own convictions or impulses as to what is right or wrong if this doctrine be sound it is a mere farce to have a written constitution at all for if the government can override and violate its constitution in one point it may do so in all there is no limit or safety or certainty if it can abolish slavery in violation of the constitution because it conflicts with the motal sentiments of the majority the same may be done in other cases for the same reason all the safeguards of that instrument providing for its own interpretation and its own amendment are worthless and needless if this doctrine be true and government will merely bethe voice of an evershifting majority be that j good or evil among the causes which have convulsed and revolutionized europe during the past year none has been more prominent or effective than the want and tational desire of the people for constitutional government not an unwritten but a written constitution accurately defining the powers of government but these revolutions and constitutions would be a mere mockery if government has a character independent of and powers superior to the constitution creating it in the light of such doctrine constitu lions are impotent and useless and not worth the trouble of making them to say nothing of the blood and treasure expended in their j support we bold tins doctrine to be radically unsound and although brought forward to promote a noble object its tendency immoral we say to our triend smith and to all others who sympathize with bis views on this subject if you profess to hold to the constitution maintain its provisions if vou cannot in accordance with your conscience perform its requirements or submit to its limitations then we say it in your plsin duty to come out from it forsake it repudiate it abandon it do anything rather than teem tobe in harmony with an inatiument which you would set aside and destroy do not for the sake of honesty and truth solemnly swear to protect and defend an instrument which it mi your firm and settled purpose to disregard and violate in any one particular such a couise would unsettle all confidence invert all the principles of trust snd reliance which bind society together aid leave mankind to all the honors of anarchy and all the contu ioa of babel we bold in respect to this as the a pottle held of old in res poet to soother constitution they that be under the law are booed to do tbe things contained in tboj law warepudiate the lawand the things contained in it while friend smith holds to the law hot makes h subject to tbe understanding of right but sayj mr smith civil government is to protect rights and that it might as wellbe openly repudiating its faneuocts and destroying its very existence as to be giving countenance to searches after authorities for destroying rights laws which interpiet define secure rights government is to respect snd laws which mis tskiogly yet honestly aim at ibis end it is oot to despise bat laws which axe enacted to destroy rights it should trample under foot for to say nothing worse of them they area gross insult upon it inasmuch as they area shameless attempt to torn it from good to evil and from its just and heavenintended uses to uses of a diametrically opposite char acter here again the argument goes to the extent of assuming that civil government in this country has a separate existence irom the constitution and as if the constitution were not the supreme law of the land and that the government can consistently overthrow the constitution whenever it shall think proper to do so in answer to this statement it is enough to say that the government of tbe united states n limited in its powers and action by the constitution and that beyond those limits it cannot go by any pretext whatever and that the supreme court the appointed agent to decide the meaning of that instrument has only to decide a law tobe unconstitutional and it is null and void it may indeed be said that the supreme court of tbe united states has no right to legalize what is unjust and in derogation or against human freedom but the answer is that that is legal in this countrv which is constitutional and that the supreme court has no conscience above the constitution ot the united states and certainly no power to set that instrument aside either by declaring it to be null and void or wrest it from its true intent and meaning by a class of rules unknown and unsustained by a single precedent in this country as to what mr smith says of determining the meaning of the constitution by its letter alone and disregarding as utterly worthless the intentions of the framers of that instrument it may require consideration when he gives us some fixed and settled legal rules sustaining his views on this point such rules may exist but we have not yet seen them and until we do we shall continue to understand the constitution not only in the light of its letter but in view of its history the meaning attached to it by its framers the men who adopted it and the circumstances in which it was adopted we have not read law very extensively but so far as we have read we have found many rules of interpretation favoring this mode of understanding the constitution of the united states and none against it though there may be such it can scarcely be necessary after what we have already said to spend much time upon the following extraordinary declaration of mrsmith respecting the constitution in which he declares that it is drawn up with the intelligent and steadfast purpose of having it serve and be forever fully and gloriously identified with the cause of liberty republicanism and equal rights must of necessity be shut against the claims and pretensions of slavery that it was drawn upwith the purpose of serving the cause oi the white mans liberty is true but that it wa meant to serve the cause of the black mant liberty is false that a constitution so drawn must necessarily he shut against the claims of slavery is an error we are not deeply skilled in the science of human language and use language in the sense in whie it is generally used rather than scientifically and we do know that liberty republicanism and equal rights words constantly or the lips of this nation are deemed to b no more hostile to negro slavery than the same words when used by the greeks we supposed to be against the enslavement of the helots ours is not the business of a lexicographer but to receive the idea meant tobe conveyed by the language of those who use it and condemn or approve accordingly in the letter of mr smith which we published last week he assumes that the material thing for us to prove in order to establish the wrongfulness of voting and acting under the united states constitution is that the federal government has no right to abolish slavery under that insttumeßt with all deference we must say we see no such necessity laid upon us we might for arguments sake grant all that mr smith claims as to the power of the federal government to abolish slavery under the constitution and yet hold as we certainly do hold that it is wrong to vote and take office under the constitution it is not enough that a man can demonstrate that his plan will abolish slavery to satisfy us that his plan is the right and besi one lo he adopted slavery might be abolished by the aid of a foreign arm but shall we therefore invoke that aid we might to feed the hungry and clothe the naked break into the house of mr smith and steal tbe wherewithal to do these things bat the question of the rightfulness of such conduct would be still open if there is one christian principle more firmly fixed in our heart than another it is this that it is wrong to do evil that good may come and if there is ooe heresy more to be guarded against gn another it is the doctrine that the end justifies the means we say therefore that it ia not incumbent upon us to show that by a forced and latitudinaiian construction of the constitution congress may not abolish slavery in all the slaveholding states in order to establish the doctrine which we lay down and justify the course w hich we feel bound to pursue in regard to voting under the constitution of tbe united states it is enough for us to know that the constitution requires of those who are parties to it to return tbe fugitive slave to the house of bondage and to shoot down the slave if be rises to gain kis freedom to justify us in repudiating and forever casting from us as a covenant with american constitution of course those who regard ffie constitution in tbe light that mr smith does are bound by tbeir convictions of duty to pursue sa opposite course aod we candidly coo fees that could we see tbe comtiieuoa as they do we should not be alow is using tbs ballot box against tbe system of slavery or urging others to do eo but we heve leamdemegh of tbe dements of metal power to know that man is lame impotent and won than weak when bu aeasee to regard unclear convictions of tel understanding in mrom ptfoh anything mo matter how desirable that thing may be we shall tbetefcre continue to denounce tbe constitution aad government of tbe united states ss s most foul sod bloody conspiracy against tbe rights of three millions of enslaved and imbruted men for such is tbe conviction of our conscience in respect to both tbe constitution and tbe government down with both for it is not fit that either should exist n tbe florence settlement we published last week s letter from henry bibb ia opposition to this settlement this week we publish two others in its favor and request all interested to read both sides as to mr bibb however be mty err in regard to the motives of the projectors of this settlement he ought to be received as a disinterested witness he hai no interest to serve and although mr myers may be perfectly correct in bis statements it ia not to be forgotten that be ia a deeply interested party and it cannot bat be expected that he will give quite as flattering accounts of the prospects of tbe settlement as facts will bear him out in doing if not a little more so we with many others for a long time supposed that tbe florence lands belonged to gerrit smith and that mr myers and others were merely acting as benefactors under him in getting these lands settled and should have supposed so until now had not the letter of mr smith published some weeks ago undeceived us it now appears that this landis owned by a company of persons who wishing to raise the price of their lands and to increase their own wealth use mr myers to attract colored people in that direction in this view mr myers is to be iegarded and what lie has to say must be regarded in the light of what a man may be expected to say while acting as the agent of a company of land speculators we are far from saying that persons purchasing lands and settling them under the superintendence of mr myers may not dowell but merely counsel them to act in the matter just as they woulddo in any other mere business transaction f d iff constant attendance upon our sick family the past week must be our apology if apology be needed for the small amount of editorial matter in this

malignant type he is now but slowly recovering f d american civilizationtreatment of the colored people in the it states what can there be more attracting to a stranger wbat can make a more lasting and frequently serious impression on a reflecting mind than the conduct of children this should be a subject of everyday attention we should be never too serious too industrious too indulgent nor too religious to attend to this important department of domestic dutyattention to the manners and morals of our children as the deportment of individuals is a characteristic evidence of their breeding so is the conduct of children generally observed as an evidence of the character of their parents or the family in which they are being brought up and though it may be admitted that contrary to every desire example and precept children have been known to depart from every prescribed restriction and violate every domestic regulation but there is nothing more common in american communities thanan open and flagrant violation of the most common civility and every rule of good breeding and propriety remarkable indeed would be the circumstances did history furnish the records of the ancients in ary quarter of the world whose chiidten had been so indifferent to precept so insensible to good breeding and propriety as to have reviled abused and ridiculed strangers or any person passing in ttie streets or along tbe public highways vile and uncivilized would have been considered such a people although in a heathen age they may have lived savage and incapable of self government would we consider them to have been since the demeanor of the minor would be taken as an evidence of the ability of the major part of the population to rule and govern or enforce authority when indeed the arm of the law or those in authority whether in a government or family capacity become so impotent as to lose control over those under their power then is it full time that such regulations were abolished and the combinations that established them abandoned as uselessyea worthless and trifling as a remarkable instance of ihe wickedness of a certain nation holy writ informs us of a number of children who mocked the jewish prophet by a simple reference to his bald head which on his age the character of elijah we shall not here consider neither doe the circumstance appear tobe recorded on account of the goodness or righteousness of the prophet because as goodmen as he had been and did subsequently receive much worse treatment personally with far less evil consequences resulting to the miscreants daniel was cast into the den ot lionsthe three hebrew children into a fiery j furnacest stephen stoned to deaih and paul beheaded the latter circumstances appear to have been recorded as the evidence

incessantly under all and every circumstance whether bond oi freeamong stnners and saints under the iufluence of church and state law and gos pelno none who have suffered the unsparing relentless unmitigating overbearing heavendaring and goddefying insult and persecution of the american colored people whether north or south and this tirade of infamy appears to be fostered specifically by all classes of whites a number of honorable and most excellent exceptions which it would be a gross injustice not to make to be found in every community but we say distinctly that these are by far the smallest number of such communities not a place is there in the united states of america whether city town village or hamlet in which a colored person resides or has ever been or may go that they are not continually subject to the abuse more or less of the whitesif not adults the children faithfully keep up the persecution and though at times this abuse may not be corporeal or physical yet it is at all times an abuse of the feelings which in itself is a blasting outrage on humanity and insufferable to the better senses of man and womanhood there is no place too high nor none so lowno occupation so respectable nor none too dignifiedno calling too sacred nor none so eminent but what may emanate from those who fill them or their children those infamous attacks and overbearing insults to colored people do colored men or women pass a workshop or factory should their eye casually be turned toward the establishment instantly is there a dozen of abusive insulting and frequently obscene epithets hurled after them continuing at times as long as the ear is within the reach of sound should they perchance be passing a schoolhouse whether a common school or academy and tho pupils out of the house such colored men or women if observed by them immediately become the subject of attack the sport and toy of those schoolboys and girls so long as they continue within sight and hearing of them are they passing a company of white men and women ten chances to one though their appearance may betray one into the impression that they are ladies and gentlemen if there is not a sneer ox snigger with characteristic accompanying remarks full in ones face regardless of their feelings or sense of the pitiable vulgarity practised upon them does a colored female entei a store and in many instances the salesmen will look at each other and snigger and ridicule before they come forward to attend to her intended purchase merchants lawyers judges honorable members of legislatures and members of congress all have been and ate continually criminating themselves in the vulgar and heathenish outrage of torturing colored people with abusive epithets and uncivilized mean and despicable treatment either by word or act especially should they pass them in a thronged thorough j fareerter a church exhibition public assemblage stagecoachrailroad car or the salooncabin of a vessel or steamboat though we have made the necessary and some very excellent exceptions to these declarations yet we mean and strictly desire it to be understood that among all and every class of american white society these onti ragesfor such they areare commonwhat ever the character or however genteel and respectable the colored persona tow ards whom they are perpetrated frequently atone and brickbat accompany the abuse and this too without the least provocation and for no other cause than the fact of their being a degraded and submissive people and consequently arising from ages of servitude and subjection slow and diffident at resentment the american people are remarkable for their readiness and aptitude in the persecution of those weaker in numbers and means than themselves and it might be thooght by this time they had satiated their most rora eious gluttony by outrages upon their colored inhabitants both bond and free but it ap pears that the bitter cup of their fearful ini  quity is not yet full great god and when shall it reach the brim hard may ji appear indeed at a superficial view to see american thus bearing record against his countrymen especially in a journal that is more extensively read in europe than any other american newspaper but be that jas it may we are determined to bear faithful witness against the enormities daily perpetrated against an outraged people of whom we are a member even from the doors and windows of private bouses sources from w hence good breeding at least might be expected to emanate those from whose names and standing in community better

parties have manfully stepped forth and boldly and freely spoken out against these impositions ably defending the eaoae of oppressed humanity hot these are few comparatively and itst they be charged with fanaticism may only speak out when aooe aggravated outrage is committed auch as to call forth the indignation of public censure it is the colored people who daily witneae and experience these moral stabs and civil assassinations perpetrated in so quiet and mild a manner eompatatively that they are not the subject of public attention and only become so when the outrage is of such a nature as to become the subject of legal complaint when to be which it must be recognized by the law as a penal offence did the colored people or their children anywhere m the world exhibit such continued evidences of moral baseness it would be charged against them as the strongest proof of their insusceptibility of an elevated civilization can americans as such lay claim civilization until these outrages cease in the north the south may laugh to scorn the opposition that hails from this direction if there were justification in sending forth two she bears to slay two score and upwards of

head heis an aliopathist but to use the phrase of a brother md has little faith in physic nor will any one be surprised at this who has had even very limited opportunities of discovering the guesswotk unscientific and contradictory character of medical practice he believes more in the curative powers of nature than in the curative properties of physic if the following motto which appears on the cover of the book may be understood to be an expression of his sentiments nature is ever busy by the silent operation of her own ibices endeavonng to cure disease her medicines are air warmth food water and sleep their use is directed by instinct and that man is most worthy the name of physician who most reveres its unerring laws the journal is written in a popular style technical terms with which most medical men are wont to puzzle and mistily their readers are generally avoided and the subject of disease and its remedy is as it ought to be brought down to the common comprehension if space permitted i might give along extract from this book readers would doubtless find such extract both interesting and instructive as it is must content myself with a paragraph or two from the leading article who shall guard the shep herds the universal acceptance of the present enervating and degrading system of education both physical and mental with the lamentable determination of our people to mumc all the follies of ihe jaded circles of foreign fashion to the utter exclusion of almost every rational pursuit will we fear effectually prevent the present generation from attaining that knowledge of the laws of general nature and their influence on living bodies ever to comprehend that medicine is given to uor the action of those laws in curing disease they will continue to look to the drug that they swallow as capable by virtue ofns own specific power to add or subtract what may be needful or redundant m their systems least of all will they discover those frequent functional derangements brought on by the operation of the mind sympathetic derangements indeed whether from functional or oiganic cause must ever remain a sealed book to them for such troths require thepossession of accurate medical knowledge thus circumstanced it becomes us to endeavor to check the progress of quackery by patiently explaining wab the aid of some simple illustrations from nature the healthy exercise of the functions snd a well cboeen example of their derangement with the mode of recovery when medicine or regimeo has favored a natural law in removing the disease this course

also good graxing land the farms j joining ua cleared land realise from twenty t five to fifty dollar per the oldeet inhabitants of the town aay that florence is a healthy town they send their produce to rome which is a good market i slated tot the colored citizens of jtica and throughout the different sections of the country that they would have to work bard the two first years on then farm and in tbeir lumber business the association was in favor of forming a village so a to get up an enterprising spirit and to do so we put the price of village lots three dollars each one quarter of an acre the association has forwarded to you from time to time publications containing accounts of their proceedings which you might have published if you had chosen they find no fault with you you would not suffer yourself sir to be found so mean and so low a many other persons professing to be public servants of the people the nature of f douglass is too noble to consent to do such dirty work my eight yean of acquaintance with you having had the honor of being at the first convention which you attended in the city of new york with the noblehearted charles l remond the friend ol the slave from that period to the present i have marked your public career your object is not to destroy the influence of goodmen believe it to be immaterial to you whether a man has been educated in a common school or has graduated at a college or whether he is educated at all provided he be honest i would say friend douglass the association appointed you out of respect and appointed you being a man of integrity as well as otheis namely samuel r ward henry hincks j w loquen wh topp h r johnson as inspectors of the public works as disinterested persons that you might inspect the books and render an account to the public of our transactions if the lord spares me a week from today shall make florence my headquarters yours truly s myers new bedford march frederick douglass i became a sub scriher to the north star when it was first established i was induced to do so because its prospectus met my views i shall continue to take it as long as it continues to attack slavery in all its forms and aims to hasten the day of emancipation i believe there are various means by which the bondmanb liberation may be brought about and the condition of the nominally free colored people materially bettered it becomes you and me and all others who feel for the oppressed with whom we are identified to use all moral energies to wipe out the foul stain of american slavery though our means are various let our aims be the same let us not fall out by the way as did the israelites in the deseit lest our selfish dissensions bring down upon us like sufferings in looking over the north star of dec d i saw a communication headed new settlement i read it with deep interest and u once entered into the spirit of the communication i was glad to see such an enterprise as the florence association started as announced in that communication i was also glad to see your name with the names of many other leading colored men of this country associated with the enterprise as approvers of it i was not acquainted with several of these gentlemen except by reputation their names were sufficient to secure for the florence enterprise my confidence in the north siar of march th i was surprised and sorry to st a letter of yours in which you request your name to be erased as one ol the inspectors of public works as desiring to have nothing more to do with the enterptise and this in consequence of reports that have been put in circulation i wish you had told us what those reports were now friend douglass i believe the flor ence enterprise to be sound inside and out thoroughly antislavery in its spirit and tendency and so do i believe the gift of three thousand deeds to the colored inhabitants of the state of new is a great antislavery act characteristic of that noble man cierrit smith it will long be cherished m the hearts of the colored people of this country and particularly by those living in the s late of new york you will see that persons living in other states could not participate in that rich gift though they rejoiced at it when the florence enterprise waa started by our friend stephen myers and others put before the public under such favorable auspice many very respectable colored people living in the surrounding states were induced to make purchases they knew that if they went to the smith lands they must purchase them do ot pretend to be well acquainted with the geography of the state of n ew york but in looking over the map of that state i see that florence and oneida county ire j situated in thecentaal part of the slate while i franklin and essex are in the northeastern j part franklin extending lo canada on the j north flankiin and essex counties appear to be comparatively isolated thinly populated and out of the great highway and facility for francporting product or person to and from the slit difficult according to the map before me of the state ot new york in franklin couuty contained inhabitants and essex county contained since the number ha no doubt m creased nor is these any doubt that the ao i true of oneida county according to the use map oneida county near the centre of the state both the fro canal and railroad pass through this county facilities tor the tranaportion of produce or persons are superior it is a populous county in it contained a population of wort than double the number contained both in franklin and eaten counties then look at ha large

eoomy ate the most valuablethat they are preferable to those who with to purchase our friend stephen myers informed us that germ smith had given to several coiered people lands in florence that he was one of those persons he feh desirous of doing something to better the condition of his people accordingly himself and several other gentlemen grantees of the smith land in florence agreed to put their lands together other lands were purchased from germ smiths agent by mr myers in behalf of this company of gentlemen this company i now propose to establish a settlement at florence for the purpose of farming dealing in lumber manufacturing potaab and practising the various trades and thus raising themselves in public estimation if mr myers has purchased these lands and met his contracts and i believe he hasin testimony of which mr gerrit smith informed me in a note that be had received a letter from mr myers stating that he mr myers had deposited in bank to the credit of the florence land purchased of his mr smiths agent why should those who aie not disposed to favor the florence enterprise throw obstacles in its way it seems to me something more than mere suspicion l nauthenticated reports are required to justify such a course and yet these are all that it would seem can be put forth by those who are unfriendly to the florence enter prise it is said that the country is a wilderness that its settlement will be attended with difficulties that colored people are not accustomed to hardships c c our forefathers have made this country once a wilderness a delightful home for

good cause of the elevation and improvement of our people leven tilman fron our own correspondent london march the subject now universally talked of hereto the exclusion of almost every other topic is the dangerous war which has suddenly sprung up in india on the confines of the punjaub without taking the trouble to investigate the origin ot the war which however is far more just than many we have previously waged in the east we are all thoroughly surprised at finding such a formidably or gnnized force in a quarter in which we fondly imagined we had put an end to the possibility of such an organization more ihaii this we are complaining loudly and bitterly tfc at the strategical combinations for which sik h commanders are no remarkable have no parallel in the operations of our own army

these murm uringshave been brought to a climax by receiving accounts of a battle which candor compels one to say was a close one fought between british and sikh forces near the river jhehara almost on the spot on which more than ivro thousand years ago alexander the great with his macedonians overthrew porus the indian king civilization for there is a civil ization even in war on that occasion triump bed in the recent conflict its advantages vvire by no means so apparent the enemy wee strongly posted with a jungle in front report numbered them at sixty thousand the british did not teach the ground on which the engagement afterwards lock place until the afternoon exhausted by a long and toils ome march so much so that their commander gave up all thoughts of an immediate attack and drew up his men with the intention of allowing the night to intervene before doing so tins determination was a wise one as he knew nothing of the enemys position lying concealed as they did by a thick jungle as his various regiments were taking up their cantonments a heavy fire from a battery which had been unobserved was directed upon one of theirs a few of the shots falling near the commanderinchief this showed that he was within the range of the sikh guns and to a man of ordinary temperament would have proved a sufficient intimation of the propriety of retiring beyond that distance lord gough however look an extraordinary view of the case and suddenly thought it incumbent upon his honor and that of the troops under him to make an instantaneous attack his officers at first remonstratedthey did sono longer when he threatened any who raised a dissentient voice with arrest he did athing uuheard of in the history of military science and necessarily attended with the most disastrous consequencesmade a ernes march in ihe presence and under they very guns uf ibe enemy as one regiment after another deployed to take up their position battery after battery of sikh guns hitherto unobserved opened a destructive fire and w hen the attack was finally ordered the utmost disarray and confusion prevailedartil lery filing at nothinglarge masses of men advancing to attack small bodies who retreated unresistingly while the most inefficient forces were directed against those positions which the sikhs occupied with overwhelming numbers and were accordingly repulsed a ith awful slaughter meantime the commanderinchief was nowhere to be found instead of directing hit foiees there be wae fighting like a demon in the midst of a jungle combinations there were none it was simply a haadtofcttd struggle in which ultimately notwithstanding ike odds the british animal hang the ttroagen get the better of it the sight teas however witnessed which had not hays sntmmtd for many yearna regiment of british dragoons panic struck lushing acmes the field with the sikhs at their heels disarranging and overthrowing their owe arttllety of which several pieces consequently fell into the hands of the enemy the result of a bailie to which we lost men and nearly officers killed was that that evening urn enemy encamped four miles farther from oer front nearer the river he did not abandon he leistrrely retired farther into his post iran itis said the sikh vms was greater but this matters but little tbe upshot of all this is that serious dissatisfaction has been created at home lord gough has been recalled and sir charles james napier the late com maoderiucbief of the army of soode started yesterday by the overland route to take bis place tbe fear is that lord gough with his characteristic wrougheadednees will have all but irreparably ruined affairs before he arrives s p q r mr calhouns addeess does not seem to meet with much favor even among the supporters of the peculiar institution the columbus ga enquirer says in looking over it we find nothing new or striking nothing but a dull insipid and tasteless rehash ol what has been said and urged for twenty years prist without a solitary suggestion as to what the south shall do in any conceivable emergency we are told of our wrongs but pointed to no remedy the whole matter so far as it has gone is but little bettef than childrens play our representatives were expected and are still expected to meet and repel every aggression that may be made upon our rights not in irresponsible conclaves but as the

noncomformist the country gentleman of the revolution a country gentleman who witnessed the revolution was probably in the receipt of about the fourth part of the rent which his acres now yield to his posterity he was therefore as compared with his posterity a poor man and was generally under the necessity of residing with little interruption on his estate to travel on the continent to maintain an establishment in london or even to visit london frequently were pleasures in which only the great proprietors could indulge it may be confidently affirmed that of the squires whose names were in king charless commissions of peace of lieutenancy not one in twelve went to town once in five years or had ever in his life wandered so far as paris many lords of manors had received an education differing little from that of their menial servants the heir of an estate often passed his boyhood and youth at the seat of his family with no better tutors than grooms and gamekeepers and scarce attained learning enough to sign his name to a mittimus if he went to school and to college he generally returned before he was twenty to the seclusion of the old hall and there unless his mind were very happily constituted by nature soon forgot his academical pursuits in rural business and pleasures his chief serious employment was the care of his property he examined samples of grain handled pigs and on market days made bargains over a tankard with drovers and hop merchants his chief pleasures were commonly derived from field sports and from an unrefined sensuality his language and pronunciation were such as we should now expect to hear only from the most ignorant clowns his oaths coarse jests and scurrilous terms of abuse were uttered with the broadest accent of his province it was easy to discern from the first words which he spoke whether he came from somersetshire or yorkshire he trouble i himself little about decorating his abode and if he attempted decoration seldom produced anything but deformity the litter of a farmyard gathered under the windows of his bedchamber and the cabbages and gooseberry bushes grew close to his hall door his table was loaded with coarse plenty and guests were cordially welcome to it but as the habit of drinking to excess was general in the class to which he belonged and as bis fortune did not enable him to intoxicate large assemblies daily with claret or canary strong beer was the ordinary beverage the quantity of beer consumed in those days was indeed enormous for beer then was to the middle and lower classes not only all that beer now is but all that wine tea and ardent spirits now are it was only at great houses or on great occasions that foreign drink was placed on the board the ladies of the house whose business it had commonly beento cook the repast retired as soon the dishes had been devoured and left the gentlemen to their ale and tobacco the coarse jollity of the afternoon was often prolonged till the revellers were laid under the tablelt was very seldom that the country gentleman caught glimpses of the great world and what he saw of it tended rather to confuse than to enlighten his understanding his opinions respecting religion government foreign countries and formei times having been derived not from study from observation or from conversation with enlightened companions but from such traditions as were current in his own small circle were the opinions of a child he adhered to them however with the obstinacy which is generally found in ignorant men accustomed to be fed with flattery his animosities were numerous and hitter he hated frenchmen and italians scotchmen and irishmen baptists and presbyterians independents and baptists quakers and jews towards london and londoners lie felt an aversion which more than once produced important political effects his wife and daughter were in tastes and acquirements below a housekeeper or a stillroom inaid of the present day they stitched and spun brewed gooseberry wine cured marigolds nnd made the crust for the venison pasty from this description it might be supposed that the english esquire of the seventeenth century did not materially differ from a rustic miller or alehouse keeper of our time there are however some important parts of his character still to he noted which will greatly modify this estimate unlettered as he was and unpolished he was still in some important points of a gentleman he was a member of a proud and powerful aristocracy and was dstinguished by many both of good and of the bad qualities which belong to aristocrats his family pride was beyond that of a talbot ora howard he knew the genealogies and coats of arms of all his neighbours and could tell which of them had assumed supporters without any r ght and which of them were so unfortunate as to he greatgrandsons of aldermen he was a magistrate and as such administered gratuitously to those who dwelt around him a rude patriarchal justice which in spite of innumerable blunders and of occasional acts of tyranny was yet better than no justice at all he was an officer of the trainbands and his military dignity though it might move the mirth of gallants who had served a campaign in flanders raised his character in his own eyes and in the eyes of his neighbours nor indeed was his soldiership justly a subject of derision jn every county there were elderly gentlemen who had seen service which was no childs plav one had been knighted by charles the first after the battle of edgehill another still wore a patch over the scar which he had received at nassby a third had defended his old house till fairfax had blown m the door with a petard the presence of these old cavaliers with their old swords and holsters and with their old stones about goring and lunsford gave to the musters of militia an earnest and warlike aspect which would otherwise have been wanting even those country gentlemen who were tooyoung to have themselves exchanged blows with the cuirassiera of the parliament had from childhood been surrounded by the traces of recent war tod fed with stories of the martial exploits of their fathers and uncles thus the character of the english esquire of the seventeenth century was compounded of two elements which weare not accustomed to find united his ignorance and uncouthness his low tastes and gross phrases would in our time be considered as indicating a nature and a breeding thoroughly plebeian yet be wasessentially a patrician and had in large measure both the virtues and the vices which flourish anong men set from their birth in high places and accustomed to authority to observance and to selfrespect it is not easy for a generation which is accustomed to find chivalrous sentiments only in company with liberal studies and polished manners to imagine to itself a man with the deportment the vocabulary and the accent of a carter yet punctilious on matters of genealogy and precedence and yet ready to risk his life rather than see a stain cast on the honour of his house it is only however by thus joining together things seldom or never found together in our own experience that we can form a just idea of that rustic aristocracy which constituted the main strength of the armies of charles the first and which long supported with strange fidelity the interest of his descendants the gross uneducated untravelled country gentleman was commonly a tory but though devotedly attached to hereditary monarchy he had no partiality for courtiers and ministers he thought not without reason that whitehall was filled with the most corrupt of mankind that of the great sums which the house of commons had voted to the crown since the restoration part had been embezzled by cunning politicians and part squandered on buffoons and foreign courtezans his stout english heart swelled with indignation at the thought that the government of his country should be subject to french dictation being himself generally an old cavalier or the son of an old cavalier he reflected with bitter resentment on the i ingratitude with which the stuarts had j requited their best friends those who heard him grumble at the neglect with which he was treated and at the profusion with which wealth was lavished on the bastards of nell gwynn and madam carwell would have supposed him ripe for rebellion but all this ill humour lasted only till the throne was really in danger it was precisely when those whom the sovereign had loaded with wealth and honour shrank from his i side that the country gentlemen so i surly and mutinous in the season of his prosperity rallied round him in a body thus after murmuring twenty years at the misgovernment of charles the second they came to his rescue in his extremity when his own secretaries of state and lords of the treasury had deserted him and enabled him to gain a complete victory ever the opposition nor can there be any doubt that they would have shown equal loyalty to his brother james if james would even at the moment have refrained from outlawing their strongest feeling for there was one institution and one only which they prized even more than hereditary monarchy and that institution was the church of england their love of the church was not indeed the effect of study or meditation few among them could have given any reason drawn from scripture or ecclesiastical history for adhering to her doctrines her ritual and her polity nor were they as a class by any means strict observers of that code of morality which is common to all christian sects but the experience of many ages proves that men may be ready to fight to the death and to persecute without pity for a religion whose creed they do not understand and whose precepts they habitually disobeymacau lays history of england from the hartford republican little violeta true story for little children i love stories nowl always loved them and when a child was constantly teasing some one to tell me stories many an hour has my kind mother sat by my little couch endeavoring by storytelling to win me to sleep but my little eyes only opened wider and my heart bounded faster as i listened to those ower true tales the story i am about to tell you of little violet darker perhaps but as meek and humble as the sweet violets in your gardens is so strongly impressed on my imagination and fancy has so often pictured the scenes to my mind that i almost feel as if i had myself witnessed them a little more than sixty years since there lived in a small town not many miles from hartford a gentleman who held several slaves in unrighteous bondage one of them was little violet ten years old my mother and another little girl who lived near not having many playmates thought much of the company of violet in their sports she was so kind to them and tried so much to amuse and please them although three years the oldest it was but seldom she could be spared from work one day however each year was given her for play and very happy indeed were the three children when general training day came and the old people all left them to amuse themselves as they pleased on one of those days as they were playing beneath two shady trees near my grandfathers dwelling some meu came riding towards themthey hailed exchanged a few words and passed on as soon as they were gone poor violet began to cry and said lu hide me those men will certainly steal me oh do hide me i shall be carried off and sold againand she cried as if her heart would break so my mother ran about and finding an old empty chest violet was soon shut in and the two children piled bedclothes on it undoubtedly she suffered for the want of air but he children as violet told them ran out to play again aod very soon the men came back and asked where their black playmate was they would not answer till the men threatened to whip them and so frightened them that they went and showed where poor violet was concealed the inhuman monsters then took her out and without heeding the cries of violet or the beseeching weeping children fiutmcd bar on one of be boraeo and carried her off after
