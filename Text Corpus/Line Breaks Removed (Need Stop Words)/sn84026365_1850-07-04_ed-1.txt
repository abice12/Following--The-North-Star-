abolition of slavery in new england by henry ward beecher the slavery in new england never was the slavery of the south the slavery of the south in our day adopts the roman civil law as the basis of its code this law is briefly explained and the fact of its adoption with some modifications toward severity rather than lenity in the southern states is stated by the court of south caroli na a master made a devise to trustees for the benefit of his slave betsey and her children devise held tobe yoid per cun the condition of slaves in this country is analogous to that of the ancient greeks and romans and not that of the feudal times they are considered not as persons but as things they can be sold or transferred as goods or persona estate they are held to be pro nullis pro inor tuis by the civil law slaves could not take property by decent or purchase and i apprehend this to be the law of this countrydess rep iv south carolina as quoted by judge jay to whose writings and to strouds sketches of the laws relating to slavery i am chiefly indebted for the legal references of this article now new england never held a slave on the basis of the roman civil law but under a law which was expressly enacted for the benefit of the slave and for the ultimate destruction of slavery viz the hebrew law of sla very as early as the following law was passed by the general court of massachusetts it is ordered by this court and the authority thereof that there shall never be any bond slavery villenage or captivity among us unless it be lawful captives taken in just war such as willingly sell themselves or or are sold to us and such shall have the liberties and christian usage which the law of god established in israel concerning such persons mortally require the roman civil code and the hebrew code are not only different but the difference is such that the one will make slavery utter and fatal and the other will alleviate it make it less and less valuable to the master and certainly abolish it under the appearance of regulating it connecticut seems to have had the largest number of slaves of any new england stateln when maine and massachusetts had none new hampshire vermont rhode island connecticut what was slavery then in connecticut judge tapping reeve says the law as heretofore practiced in this state respecting slaves must now be uninteresting i will however lest the slavery which prevailed in this state should be forgotton mention somethings that show that slavery here was very far from being of the absolute rigid kind the master had no control over the life of his slave if he killed him he was liable to the same punishment as if he killed a freeman the master as was liable to be sued by the slave in an action for beating or wounding or for immoderate chastisement as he would be if he had thus treated an apprentice a slave was capable of holding property in character of devise or legatee if the master should take away such property his slave would be entitled to an action against him by his prochein ami next friend from the whole we see that slaves had the same right of life and property as apprentices and that the difference betwixt them was this an apprentice is a servant for time and the slave is a servant for life how utterly different this slavery was from that of the south judge buffin of north carolina shows when speaking on this very point this viz slavery has indeed been assimilated at the bar to the other domestic relations and arguments drawn from the well established principles which confer and restrain authority of the parent over the child the tutor even the pupil the master over th apprentice have been pressed on vol no us the court does not recognize the application there is no likeness between the cases they are in opposition to each other and there is an impassable gulf between them the difference is that which exists between freedom and slavery and a greater could not be imagined the very effect of the hebrew law of slavery was so to direct the masters attention to his fives comfort and religious education that ere he was aware of it the slave stood in his view so surrounded with the rights of man and sanctious of religion tha he could not regard him as much less than an equal fellow and it is historically true that the brief trial of the hebrew law of slavery in new england produced the same effect there judge parsons of mass saysthe treatmeni of slaves was in general mild and humane and they suffered hardships nol greater than hired servants and in the same case he says that a discontented slave was worth little to his master insomuch that he sometimes colluded with the slave and allowed him to sue for his liberty that he might get rid of him and the burden of his support the winchendon vs hatfield mass rep and if the south that perpetually refers to the old testament to justify her system of slavery will consent to take that hebrew law of slavery in exchange for her roman civil law for one i should regard the work of liberty as begun and calmly wait for time to complete what god through moses designed the utter extirpation of slavery but the worst feature of this slanderous charge of the journal ol commerce against the whole north is that they kept their slaves until they were found to be unprofitable and then sold them to the south there cannot be an untruth more utter than this nor more insulting to new eng land slavery was abolished in vermont july after the revolution some attempts were made to transport out of the state negroes and mulattoes and sell them in open violation of the laws but in the general assembly passed an act making it penal to ioo to sell a colored man the same to be paid to a person sought tobe sold together with the cost of suit c slavery was formally abolished in massachusetts by the adoption of the constitution in the first article of which declares that all men are born free and equal after that date this clause was by the courts regarded as settling the question of slavery the unexpected decision of the courts made it impossible for slaves tobe sold in anticipation of it new hampshire abolished slavery by the adoption of its constitution in and connecticut in the same manner at a later date but it is principally to new york astate with which the editor of the journal of commerce surely ought to be well acquainted that we wish to direct attention in there were slaves in the state of new york ten years after the number was diminishing in ten years but in the act of gradual emancipation was passed declaring all children born thereafter to be free males when coming tq the age of and females at it is hardly possible to conceive more humane and vigilant enactments to preventany of these slaves being sold to the south a fine of was the penalty and the freedom of the slave was the result of an attempt to sell him out of the state although masters were allowed to travel with their slaves yet under severe fanes they were obliged to return them or under oath to make proof that unavoidable accident prevented the returning that some might have been smuggled off we do not deny though we have no evidence of itin we believe another act was passed declaring all slaves to be free in and on july th of that year the act took effect and every slave nearly ten thousand was manumitted without compensation to their owners it is high time for men to be held to responsibility who defile history by declaring that the north got rid of slavery at a profit and for a profit and we reply to southern demands for northern help in this matter we demand no losses of you which we did not encounter ourselves let it be shown by whoever can that the increasing intelligence of the people in respect to a practice which the then civilized world tolerated and the growing perception that slavery could not be enforced without a violation of religion and humanity were not the true causes of its disconinu ance in new england and new york no system of slavery in this land can be profitable which does not put the slave under a regimen which denies him the rights of manhood the north on the basis of the hebrew slavery law lound it out it refused to go further and sacrifice its religious scruples the south on the basis of the roman civil law imbibed its inhuman spirit put on the screws and forced the system into its present legal attitude with a written code more infamous than the unwritten law of any pirates deck this is the very historical difference between the north and the south her religion made the north unwilling to grow richer by holding on to a system with all its growing requisitions and so she turned to her granite and to the frozen seas where fish swarm and to the loom and the right of no sex truth is of no cr anvil the south generous upon impulse but impatient of the restraints of longcontinued rigid principle chose the other alternative drove the slaves into the field and grew rich on their toil and debasemement emancipator fy republican richmond va may as i was conversing with some southerners in washington upon freesoil they expressed a desire that i shoulj go south and see slavey as it exists there and i would come back freed of ail free soil notions one from florida was particularly anxious that i should go home with him and he would show me a tame alligator nine feet long that he fed on terrapins and deaa niggers never costs me anything to bury a dead nigger said hei resolved to go as far south as this place to see if there existed so much difference between the practice and heory of slavery as i sailed forth his morning to see the place almost he first thing that met my view was a arge house surrounded by a very high brick wall upon asking the first passer by what it was he informed me it was a nigger jail where traders confined their slaves preparatory to taking them south he very politely offered to conduct me through it which i gladly accepted i have here heretofore supposed that the term slaves in chains as used in the newspapers vyas a figure of speech used comparatively but here they were chained together sitting round on benches in the most filthy and loathsome place i ever saw i questioned one too why he was chained he said he had been sold to go south and he wanted to see his wife again before we went and had ran away to go back to his old masters for that purpose my heart was too full to question any of the others in the female department there was a very pretty white woman with two cnildren by close inspection it might be seen that she had a little african blood in her veins apparently not over one tenth but the children did not show the least trace of it i expressed my surprise at this to my conductor as i had supposed slavery to be eon ed to the african race when i was informed there was no limit of blood in this state so long as the mother is a slave the offspring is also no rnattei of what color i have learned that there are numerous slaves in this city as white as their masters my next move was to attend a slave auction the slaves of all colors from sooty black to perfect white were brought in and seated on benches here they were subjected to the most particular examination it was curious to seethe manner of the speculators in examining their teeth they would order them to open their mouth then press back their lips with their two thumbs just as a jockey would a horse on a window sill lay a large pile of manacles some were constructed of alarge rod of iron with handcuffs on each side so as to form a row the first lot soid was the white woman and her children that i before spoke of the auctioneer extolled her qualities by representing her to be a first rate seamstress stc she was struck down at the lackey of the place himself a slave then lead up a man about unharness yourself old boy says he the man trembling like a leaf all the while strips himself with the assistance of the lackey in full view of the street and of female slaves the lackey asks him what he is shaking for as he is not going to be hurt the auctioneer announces no scars on his back of any consequence and the sale proceeds sold at next conies a little girl of about half white then two twin brothers of sold to different masters one i was told was a southern trader so on to the end of the sale when the gentlemen were thanked for their attention and attendance requested tomorrow when they would be shown something nice during the sale my attention was call to the door by a string of slaves going past chained together probably on their way to some southern plantation altogether this was the most heartsickening sight i ever saw i involuntarily exclaimed is it possible that this is permitted in our own native country the country i loved so welland whose institutions i have exultingly pointed to as an example for the world i am confident that the most effective way for abolitionists to gain converts to their cause is to send northerners as far south as this place and let them attend one of these slave auctions hard indeed must be the heart of one who could look upon such a scene and not blush for his countrys shame i remonstrated with some of the inhabitants for permitting such a thing among them they all have their bible and christianity at their tongues end and arc ready to point out passages to justify and show that it is a god ordained institution if this is christianity i replied dont call me a christian icpthe blue hens chicken says president taylor we

prevailed many confessed that heir expectations were more than realized and their feelings enlisted in the objects of the meeting far beyond any thing they had formed an idea of before attending thus i conceive there is nothing but encouragement in prospect if we all adhere to the great principles of right so clearly impressed on the minds of many able advocates it appears to me none could have attended through that meeting whose spirits were not rewarded anc hearts enlarged towards the whole human family while all sectarian distinctions must have dwindled into mere insignificance for the

tribune of monday says its last advices from vv ashington are adverse to the passage of the omnibus bill it was the intention of the friends of the measure to have got through with al the amendments on tuesday last bu this was found to be impossible auc nearly the whole of this week will be used up in the accustomed way nearly all the amendments have come from southern senators and although they have suceeeded with several they still want morewhether they can getthem remains to be seen opinions are as contradictory as ever in regard to the prospect of the fina passage of the bill it is evident however that its chances have not improvei for a few days past and that its more ardent mends feel an unexpressed fear that it must fail even in the senate it is suspended by a hair its fate rests with those who are counted as doubtful the tribune learns that messrs berrien underwood morton and pearce are not certain for the bill while the loss of any two of them would inevitably defeat itin the house if the bill ever gets there its oponents feel sure of nailing it to the table as soon as a vote can be obtained intelligent southern men frankly confess that they cannot claim with the least confidence the vote of a single northern whig butin the lace of this fact we see the journal of commerce and its locofoco allies constantly predicting that it will pas the housewe feel entire confidence that they are mistaken meantime the patience of the public is well nigh exhausted and it is not surprising that it should be congress convened nearly seven months ago and yet scarcely work enough has been done to justify the expense of a months session this difficulty arises from no doubt in regard to the wish and determination of a large majority of the people upon the subject of slavery there is not a man in congress who can or will deny that a vast majority of the people are opposed to its extension and the struggle to pass a bill that comes far short of this and which allows slaveholders to experiment bfor a number of yearsupon the prac icability of planting it in new mexico has impeded all legislation upon other great and suffering interests and actually threatens to block the wheels of governmenthow much more consistent with the ordinary mode of legislation how much more economical and just would have been the prompt admission of california when her application was presented however pure may be the motives of some of those who advocate the settlement of incongruous questions in one bill the fact is not and cannot be disguised that a majority of those who are responsible for this great waste of time and treasure are hostile to freedom california has repudiated slavery and that is the secret of their opposition to her admission it is time that such expensive folly should be abandoned even should this bill pass tomorrow does not this long delay and the endless number of amendments offered show that nothing like a majority are really in favor of its passage far better then to abandon il at once and begin the transaction of business in the accustomed manner try every issue upon its own merits and the verdict will be much more likely to receive the sanction of the tribunal before which all the acts of our public servants are reviewed rynders and prof stuart rynders the renowned apostle of the new york mob defender of the faith sic is in trouble having been accused of the vulgar offence ofgambling merely because he won a few paltry dollars from a man less skilful than himself and left his family to suffer the consequences by being turned penniless into the street we suggest that this is a case which appeals strongly to the sympathy and sense of justice of prof stuart we cannot helieve that he will permit his associate in the work of demolishing the abolitionists to sink under the denunciations of the fanatics for an act nowhere expressly condemned in the new testament and which was virtually approved by the saints of the old dispensation who often settled important questions by casting lots which we take it was a practice as indentrcal with modern gambling as patriarchal and jewish sorvitude were like the slavery of the south the learned professor we are sure would find it as easy a task to frame a scriptural de fence of rynders as he did to accomplish the same thing for webster and since moses has begun the good work of defending our modern prophets profits he should show no partiality surely isaiah is as worthy of a seat on the soft cushion ofßiblical exegesis as daniel for he has been neither less zealous

irony more terrible we regretted in reading it that it should be marred by a spirit so narrow and a purpose so unbecoming the occasion good haters of a certain class will find food enough for their hatred in bentons speech the effect of the speech was bad mr clay embraced an occasion toa letterhis good taste in doing it we must condemn while we question the morality of the actof a prive citizen seeking to convict mr benton of inconsistency this led to the angry passage which is thus reported mr benton followed inreply to mr clay reading as his text several passages from the speech made by the senator from kentucky on the th of february last in which he declared the admission of california to be a measure standing by itself and demanding immediate action he mr benton hoped the senator when accusing the minority with having all aiong delayed the settlement of that question would deduct at least the time during which he himself acted with those who still contended for a distinct consideration for california mr b proceeded then to retort brck the lecture which he conceived so gratuitously given by mr clay as to the waste of time mr clay denied that he had attempted to lecture the senate the office of lecturer to be successful required two qualifications the ability on the part of the lecturer to impart instruction and the capacity of the lectured to receive instructionln this case both the qualifications were wanting he was in favor of the admission of california and if it had depended on him alone she would have been admitted long agohe professed to be a practical man and it was well known that he had yielded his own predilec tic and wishes because tie became satisfied that the speediest way of bringing california in would be in combina i tiou with other measures mr houston submitted some remarks in defence of the title of texas declaring that she knew her rights and was prepared to assert defend and maintain them at any cost mr benton made some observations denying as had been suggested by mr clay that during last summer in missouri he had expressed himself against the admission of california mr in apology for having made the suggestion read a letter froma gentleman named reed at independence missouri evidently to mr foote in which the writer says that mr benton in conversation with him on the subject said she was not fit tobe admitted and that the executive looking to that end was a coward policy and that california should be treated as other new states had been in times past he only read this letter in vindication of himself he did not know the writer or vouch ifor his accuracy the senator would know however whether it was true or not mr benton denied the right of the senator to arraign him thus in the senate by reading a letter and calling upon him to say whether it was true or not but the senator would not get off in that way he had nothing to do with the senators informant but ashe has produced the letter here and published it and thus made it a part of the parliamentary history of the country he held him responsible as its author he pronounced it his clays letter and as his letter he branded itas an infamous calumny from beginning to end loud calls to order mr clayas to the senators imputations l hurl them back with unutterable scorn and indignation and suggest to him to put in his casket of other calumnies which herecries of order and the rapping of the vice presidents gavil interrupted the re marks mr webster expressed his regret at such occurrences in the senate and administered a well worded rebuke to both for himself he would not sit in the senate and witness such scenes mr hale said if the rebtrke just given was to be considered as just and its suggestions to be followed in the practise of the future he must beg that some rule be established by which it might be understood how old a senator must be to entitle him to ememp tion from having letters read against him laughter

whose slimy track must be attentively watched made a speech which is thus reported in the exclusive despatch of the boston times mr webster addressed the senate he observed that on the th of march last he declared that there was not a toot of territory belonging to the united states the character of which as free or slave territory was not already fixed by some irrepealable jaw he bad not seen or heard anything since that time to charge his views upon the subjectthat being his view of the question he had very cheerfully voted against the wilmot proviso for the purpose of excluding slavery from the territories he had now no more apprehension of the introduction of slavery into the territories under consideration than he had of its introduction into massachusetts he was now called upon to vote for an amendment providing that when those territories shall come here as states they shall be admitted either with or without slavery if he voted against that amendment it would leave him open to the suspicion of desiring to do that by another process which he refused to do by the wilmot proviso he designed then to vote for the amendment for the same reason as he voted against the proviso he voted against that because he thought all such resolutions wholly uselessbecause they gave offence and dissatisfaction and as he desfred to avoid all dissatisfaction therefore he would not vote for the amendment pending which would have no effect one way or the other and yet give satisfaction he also submitted some remarks in favor of the general features of the pending bill expressing his conviction of the importance of securing its passage when he looked around him and saw the course of gentlemen from his own section of the country acting as he well knew they did conscientiously and honestly he was well aware of the extent of the responsibility which he assumed in differing from them so widely this had naturally led him to reconsider and reexamine his own position rejudge his own judgment and aferhaving performed that work he was quite unable to change his first wellsettled hle referred to the satisfaction which his course had given rise to in some quarters and to the charges of inconsistency which had been made declaring his readiness if any one here was disposed to undertake the task of proving such inconsistency to vindicate the consistency of his newburyport letter or his speech of the th of march with his recorded acts and declarations of the past he declared his object to be peace and reconciliation he did not desire to make a case for the north or for the south it was not to continue a useless and distracting controversy he was against agitators of both north and southagainst local tests he was an american and knew no country but americano locality in america that is not my country his hearts sentiment and judgment demanded that he should pursue such a course as shall promote the good harmony and union of the whole country and he would do so god willing to the end of the chapter great applause in the gallery immediately checked by the chair mr norris said he should vote for the amendment though he thought it useless and unnecessary mr seward of new york opposed it but could not vote against it because he had paired off with his colleague mr dickinson just think of two senators from free states parting off at this crisis an on such a question in the house mr bayly of va chairman of the ways and means moved to make the appropriation bills the special order for next monday the house refused to suspend the rules to allow him to offer his resolution mr stephens ofga also failed to get the rules suspended on a notice to adjourn on the th of august mr doty and mr wentworth triedto get the frules suspended so as to instruct the

out of california was withdrawn mr jefferson davis offered an amendment repealing all laws usages and customs preexisting in the territories in regard to abating or obstructing the full enjoyment of the rights of persons or property of citizens of the united states as recognized or guarantied by the constitution and laws of the united states a long debate ensued in the course of which all the slaveholders held that the mexican local law against slavery was superseded by the constitution no vote was taken the house was engaged upon a proposition for a committee to investigate certain alleged misappropriations of money by the secretary of the treasury the house passed a resolve asking the secretary for information on the subject icp williams the slave dealer and maryland overseer boasts that he has cleared thirty thousand dollars within the last six months by his traffic inhuman flesh such lam informed and believe was his remark within a few days pastcor true dm from the national era fugitive slaveletter of daniel webster the latin poet tells us that the descent to the wicked place is easy we are more pained than surprised therefore to find the great massachusetts senator taking another step downward it seems that certain obsolete politicians and clergymen in the town of newburyport have seen fit in imitation of a similar class in boston and andover to address him a letter of congratulation to this letter he has published a very appropriate and we doubt not very satisfactory reply consisting merely ofa grave argument in support of the legal moral and religious obligation of slavecatch ing on the part of lawabiding citizens and bibleloving christians of the free states it is a literary monstrosity which will make the fortune of the antiquarian who shall hereafter bring it to light when christian slaveholding shall have become as difficult of comprehension as christian cannibalism if there is as we may well question any considerable amount of state pride manly independence or bonest patroitism in those citizens of massachusetts whom daniel webster addresses they will rise from the per usul of this letter sslfreproached and covered wiih shame at the consideration that they volunteered their approbation of the course of its author the man upon whom massachu gus has bestowed her highest honors and richest gifts is seen in this letter vilifying her character contemptuously denouncing her laws ridiculing her cherished principles and making her love of freedom and her interest in the welfare of humanity a cause of reproach and derision the old commonwealth is betrayed by our own trusted and favorite representative he who should have been the first to defend he deliberately takes sides with her enemies we know not how far forbearance may be carried in this case by his insulted constituency but of one thing weare quite certain not even john c calhoun aim si idolized as he was by south carolina could have called in question the legislation of his state on the subject of colored seamen as webster has that of massachusetts in relation to fugitives and retained his plglce as one of her senators we can now only call attention to a single paragraph in this letter which we have read withindignant astonishment after what he seems to regard as a very unfavorable contrast of his own state with pennsylvania representing the former as a snivelling hypocritical symathiser with the reclaimed fugitive slaves which the latter very willingly sends back to bondage he says masachuseits tears fa l abundantly for pennsylvania sufferings but which sufferings pennsylvania herself knows little or nothing of no people are more opposed to slavery than the people ef pennsylvania we knpw especially that that great and respectable part of her population the friends have borne their testimony against it from the first yet they create no excitement they seek not to overthrow or undermine the constitution of their country they know that firmness steadiness of principle a just moderation and unconquerable perseverance are the virtues the practice of which is most likely to correct whatever is wrong in the constitution of the social system no doubt there are sometimes to be found friends subject to the frailty of desiring to become conspicuous or to the influence of a false sentimentality or borne away into an atmosphere flickering between light and darkness by the puffs of the transcendental philosophy but that is not a malady of the great body they remain of sound and disposing minds and memories i am misled by authority which ought not to mislead if it be not tiue that great body approves the sentiments to which i have given utterance on thefioor of the senate whai were those entimeoto which the society of friends are said to approve let us look at them my friend mr butler says the massachusetts senator has a bill on the subject of delivering up fugitive slaves now before the senate with some amendments to it which i propose to suppoit with all its provisions to the fullest extent this bill provides that the judges of the courts some seventeen thousand postmasters and all government officers collectors c shall be tribunals for the delivery without appeal of anybody who is sworn by anybody anywhere to be a fugitive from slavery whether the said officials of government reside in the state where the fugitive is found or in that from which he has said to have escaped it is sufficient that they are anywhere officers of government thus as horace mann has well said mr butler or mr mason therefore may send the postmaster of his own city or village into massachusetts with an agent or attorney who brings his affidavit from south carolina or virgina in his pocket the agent or attorney may arrest anybody at any time carrying him before his accomplice go through with the judicial forms and hujry him to the south the officer after his judical functions are discharged turned bailiff protecting the prey and speeding the flight the bill denies the right of trial by jury to the person suspected of being a fugitive the amendments of which daniel webster speaks and which he avows himself ready to support provide ist that all who knowingly obstructed or hinder the claimant or litigant or any person assisting him in securing fugitive slaves or shall aid or assist in their escape after arrestor shall harbor such fugitives after notice that thev are claimed as slaves shall be fined one thousand dollars one half whereof shall be to the use of the informer and shall also be imprisoned for the term of twelvemonths and d that in no trial or bearing shall the testimony of the alleged fugitive be admitted in evidence these are the sentiments embodied in legal forms which

battery a month since has called forth an exipndpd notice from the london times the whole of which we copy in another column of this weeks paper it is not a matter of slight encouragement to the oppressed and persecuted black man in this country to be able to quote against his oppressors and persecutors authority as influential and respectable as that of the london times that paper is perhaps the most wealthy and popular journal in the world and it may be said to represent fully the national feeling of england it is thoroughly english even in its faults and its lemarks on the subject of american prejudice against colored people may therefore be considered a fair embodiment of the national sentiment of course there is a class oi american people who are too ignorant and inflated to receive much profit or instruction from anything emanating from an english source this class is composed of the dupes of political demagogues whose patriotism is only manifested in bitter invectives against the mother country and yet there is not a scamp among them all who is not proud of being able to trace his ancestry to england and who does not boast of his english and saxon blood while he is engaged in villifving the land of his fathers but setting aside this class of persons there are those in our land whose breadth of intellect and common sense make them open to the reception of right views and feelings although they may come from a source as humble as the london times to these persons we commend the article to which we have referred it will show them that the malevolent feelings entertained by the americans towards the colored people are unknown and unsvmpathized with by the entire british nation and that the americans asa people stand infamously alone in the maintenance of a

soon be utterly and forever abolished but unhappily for the american bondman the clergy of this country and especially those of the episcopal church tako little or no interest in the question of

attention to palmers patent limb which is generally believed to be the bes substitute for the natural leg now extant as the following report sets forth the peculiar merits of this invention we copy it entiie f d report on prof palmers artificia legthe committee on science and the arts constituted by the franklin institute of the state of pennsylvania for the promotion of the mechanic arts to whom was referred for examination an artificial leg invented by benjamin franklin palmer report that the peculiarities of this invention consist in first an ingenious arrangement of springs and cords in the inside of the limb by which when the wearer is in the erect position the limb is extended and the foot flexed so as to present a natural appearance second by a second arrangement of cords and springs in the inside of the limb the foot and toes are gradually and easily extended when the heel is placed in contact with the ground inconsequene of this arrangement a limping gait and the unpleaseit noise made by the sudden stroke of the call of the foot upon the ground in walking which is so obvious in the ordinary leg is avoided third by a peculiar arrangement of the knee joint it is rendered little liable to wear and all lateral or rotary motion is prevented it is hardly necessary to remark that any such motion is undesirable in an artificial leg as it renders its support unstable the pressure of the artificial leg is made uniformly upon the surface of the sides of the stump and not upon the end by which arrangement the danger of ulceration and infla mation ot the flaps covering the end of the bone is in a great measure avoided the committee have seen the artificial leg worn by the inventor himself it is light well shaped easily adjusted ard of a surface readily kept clean the shape of the leg is such as to represent exactly when clothed its natural fellow he is enabled by means of his invention to walk without a cane in such a manner as readily to deceive one not acquainted with the facts of the case all the natural movements of the limb except motion laterally which is undesirable are beatifully executed he can throw either leg over the other and can mount aheight of five inches with either leg indifferently without assistance in conclusion the committee would remark hat lire artificial leg of mr palmer is superior to any that has yet come under their notice it is light strong beautifully shaped apparently very durable selfacting in a greater degree than any ihing they have ever met with easy and natural in its motion and possessing apparently all the qualities desirable or attainable in such an in invention thej committee would recommend the award to the inventor of scotts legacy medal and premium to the most deserving accompanied with and also to the committee on exhibitions to award him the first premium for his model exhibited in the late exhibition by order of the committee wm hamilton actuary messrs b f palmer

more at length hereafter i trust not altogether without the desired effect western new york like other sections of the country is still suffering from the devastating effects of die free soil movement very many of the hitherto staunch friends of our cause mistaking that buffalo jackolan tern for the lighthouse nr haven of immediate en ancipation embarked on the frail craft of availability aid being polluted by soulless politicians they were soon wrecked upon the rocks of expediency and now disappointed expectations together with false pride does much towards rendering them indifferent to the cause yet the dissenination of the truths of antislavery in times past has been instrumental in securing an agitation which has settled down and is sf settling down upon many honest hearts iito an implacable hatred of slavery and a item determination to resist the innovations the slave power i was much pleased wttli vhe articles in your two last numbers on colonization and your triumphant refutation of the deliverance of that serpentbrood of slanderers whom hotae greeley in his magnanimity and toleration for negrohatred was pleased to denominate the good men who glory in slavery the tribune is evidently aping the blackhearted daniel webster who while he has no plan to offer for the emancipation of the slave no word of sympathy for the millions who sigh night and day for deliverance is willing to second a proposition that any of his southern masters may offer and vote for the appropriation of millions of the public money for the purpose of expatriating free colored people whose inalienable right to remain and be the recipient of justice even should the lvghest evidences of enterprise which the tribune demands should be wanted which by he way is altogether incompatible with centuries of degradation and oppression is more unquestionable than is the most hoaryheaded rumdrinking licentious palefaced villains who clamor for their expatriation tf he colored people of this country have one foe more to be feared than another and against which a ceaseless warfare should be waged it may be seen in the hellish features of the colonization movement professing to be based on the principle of philanthropy it insinuates itself into the hearts of the unsuspecting that it may bias their judgment and poison their minds by the mountain lie that thelawsof nature are in opposition to the existence of the two classes in harmony and concord in a common country but in fact the essence of their movement the moving spring of their organization can be found in their deadly hate to the free colored people and the desire to render slave property more secure by removing the free colored people from the couutry that their unjust policy may be carried out they refuse the colored people justice in the land of their birth tiey have no sympathy for the cruelties jperpetrajed against the slave nor for the outrage inflicted upoff the free colored people they are willing to have them mobbed disfranchised and prosecuted that they may be able to sustain the monstrous falsehood that such a state of things is in accordance with fixed laws rather than protest against them as the result of a sentiment acquired by a ceaseless repetition of wrong yours for impartial justice victor june  frienh douglass there appears to me to be a palpable inconsistency in our moral percepticns as well as in our legal distinctions o the different phases and circumstances under which the hellish abomination human slavery presents itself at this time all civilized governments ours with the rest confess to consider the african slave trade as one of the blackest of crimes and punish it with the heaviest penalties when perpetrated upon the benighted african on his own shores in a state of perfect barbarism where the ties of kindred affection can have but a feeble existence and whose physical circumstances could hardly be considered worse when torn from kindred and home and doomed to servitude even among the half civilized but we have a government capable of perceiving a broad difference between the slave trade upon the two sides of theatlantic cn the one side we cannot purchase a captiveeven of a captive in whose hands death might be his certain doom but for our buying himand put him aboard a ship as a slave without violating one of the most sacred laws of christendom and incurring a heavy penalty but we may go to our capitol and undereye and within the hearing of our rulers and legislators buy even of our own rulers a human being not in a state of barbarian ignorance and savage customs but a youngman or young woman of istelligeree and refined sensibilities who may have a companion and beloved children to whom they may be as much endeared as the purchaser to his wife and childrentear him or her from an affectionate companion and loving children who perhaps are also to be separated from each other drag them away to a pen or a ship hold for a florida or louisiana marker perhaps never more to behold his heartbroken companion and bereaved children or to know their destination i say all this can be and often is done under the sanction of our benign laws which secure equal rights to alli w palmer antislavery in missouri the benton war in missouri appears to havo taken a strong antislavery turn the st louis union which was recently recommended at the st louis benton county convention as the true democratic organ of the state talks in the folowing strain and for what purpose is this sacrifice tobe made alas we blush with shame to say it that the institution of slavery shall be more firmly established that is to say some traffickers in human flesh and blood threaten the perpetuity of this union except they are permitted to have their own way and cravenhearted politicians succumb to their demands for the sake not of peace and harmony but of ephemeral popularity come what will we are opposed to such a compromise it is unrighteous it is unwise it is impracticable the great increase of the english race i n america living undr the influence of institutions which though republican still bear the impress of the english laws from which they have derived their spirit and much of their form has by all our liberal jurists statesmen and philosophers been deemed an event fraught with beneficial consequences to the whole great anglosaxon family it has been thought that we should derive advantage from the varied experience to which our race and their peculiar institutions would be thus subjectedthat from america we might receive useful lessons while we on the other hand might perhaps be able to reply this obligation by beneficial suggestions to our brethren both with respect to their institutions and their political and social relations and conduct these suggestions mutually imparted it has been thought would be useful lessons which could not otherwise be learnt now there are two peculiarities in american institutions as compared with those of england which are daily producing effects upon the general mind of americawhich to the people of america generally are evidently unknown but which painfully affect the mind of every class of englishmenand we believe that by openly but in a kind and friendly spirit expressing our opinions and describing our feelings upon these subjects we are really rendering great and neighborly service not only to our transatlantic brethren but to the whole commnnity of civilized nations the twopeculiarities gf which we speak are slavery and the great and growing weakness of the generalfederal government of the united states both these causes are at this moment producing startling effects upon the social and national character of the american peopleessentially deteriorating it in fact and lowering it also in the estimation not only of all thoughtful and right minded men but also of that general public which is composed of the several nations making together the civilized community of mankind the effects produced by these apparently unconnected causes have a remarkable and combined affinity and similitude the social influence of the institution of slavery produces a state of feeling among the various classes of american citizens which induces them to seize upon the opportunity afforded them by the weakness of their national government to make aggressive inroads upon neighboring nations he who becomes accustomed to brave the displeasure of mankind upon one subject soon learns to be careless of public opinion on others he who forgets the great dictates of humanity because of a difference of color will not long pay deference to the rules of justice and light in his dealing with others who speak a different language and form part of aforeign thouugh friendly people it behooves the statesmen and philosophers of ameiica to look well to these consequences if the evil continue the people of america will soon be like the ishmaelites of oldtheir hands will be against every man and the hands of every man will be against them and great though they be powerful wealthy acute and bravethe right will prevail the united civilized world battling for justice and humanity will be in vincibleand we may live to see the great federal republic falling to pieces under the combined influence of hostile aggression internal weakness resulting irom internal discord and the sense of injustice in the cause they are sustaining on the present occasion however we desire in confine our attention and remarks to the existing state of mind among the citizens of the united states with respect to people of color our general estimate of the american national character and morality must be formed upon a consideration of many different particulars but we cannot avoid believing that the circumstances to which weare about to allude must form a most important item in the account little incidents courriig injprivate life otten afford evidence respecting national habits and feeling far more important and convincing than legislative enactments a paragraph extracted from a new york newspaper into our columns yesterday contains evidence which is in our own opinion of this description for although some of the southern states have in their legislation respecting negroes outraged every feeling of common sense common justice and benevolence the state of new york has made laws on the subject dictated as well by right feeling as by prudence and justice these wise laws do not howeyer really represent the sentiments of the people of new york with respect to the negroesif the story told by the newspaper and the comments of the writer on it fairly m w gibbs represent the popular creed and feeling weare convinced from the tone of this story as told by the indignant relator that the public to whom that story is addressed can have no conception of the effect produced by it upon the whole english people not merely upon abolitionist writers and speakersnot merely upon subscribers to the antislavery so cietybut upon every human being not american in this country man woman and child who may hear it read and can understand its import the effect will be one of unbounded indignation disgust and astonish ment mr douglass a negro gentleman sometime since complained of the treatment he had experienced from citizens of the united states because of his color this proceeding on his part is thus described by an american writer in the new york globefred erick douglass the impudent negro who has of late taken on himself the privilege of abusing our country its patriots and constitution without having that chastisement he so richly merited at the hands of our republicans who would not condescend to notiee his blasphemy and negroism had the audacity yesterday morning to walk down broadway the principal promenade of our city with two white women resting on his arms it however appears that spite of the dreadful and blashpemous conduct thus imputed to mr douglrss the mildness and wonderful selfcontrol of the whole american population produced the marvellous effect above described the citizens though deeply moved took no notice of the blasphemy and negroism but there are limits to human patience bad as may be the making a just complaint by a negro against a white man black atrocity can go lurther although white imagination oan hardly in american phrase realize the atrocity what is this abominable offence walking with two white women down broadway the patience of the citizens their almost superhuman forbearance i at length gave way and the mode of proceeding consequent upon this venial succumbing of white virtue is eminently characteristic and is indeed a touching evidence of the delicacy and refinement of the highmind ed white man even in the very fury and paroxysm of his passion several citizens who noticed this disgraceful scene viz of the quiet unoffending negro walking with two white women who willingly walked with him followed the impudent scamp to the battery the negro was supposed to commit the additional offence of laughing thereupon a white gentleman stepped up to the white ladies and politely requested them to retire and leave their ebony companion and place themselves under the protection of a white gentleman standing near by the women obeyed and the indignant and insulted white gentleman to us the person really insulted was the black gentleman administered a dessing to the negro so severe it appears that he will not readily forget it maddened justice exclaims the white editor forgets the dictates of law in a case of this kind andpersonally we see no reason why it should nota few days since we published a letter in which an englishman described a case of stillmore atrocious wrong done to a poor respectable negro who was forcibly seized by aband of armed men in the streets of cincinnati during bioad day and carried off to a slave state this violence though producing to the individual more frightful evil than from the london times of june that of the insulted citizen of new york is less significant of the popular feeling we may suppose that the negro seized and carried to kentucky was a runaway and the property of the person who pursued him and that the desire to obtain his property may have incited the owner to this deed of violence but the feeling which led to the assault on mr douglass was a geneial ungovernable sense of insult pervading a whole population at the sight of a negro man walking upon equal and familiar terms with white women that the women were consenting to this intimacy is clear that their being so was in the opinion of the white gentlemen of new york no justification for mr douglass is also evident that such familiarity and equality could lead to no dangerous or mischievous consequences in the city or state of new york eveiy one must admit who knows the relative numbers of the white and black population of the state in fact blind unreasoning antipathy was the cause of the outrage and deemed by americans a sufficient excuse for it we in england who happily have never been subjected to influences which could lend us to a state of mind so unjust or likely to lead to acts thus flagrantly opposed to the dictates of justice and benevolence can hardly find words that sufficiently expresss our astonishment as well as sorrow on witnessing so strange a distortion of the moral vision among a people justly celebrated for their sagacity and for the fervor of their piety we marvel indeed to see the dictates of a religion which ihey as well as ourselves belieye and obey utterly forgotten when this wild and senseless antipathy into play and we arejrresistibly impelled to ask what command of morality or religon can be deemed sacred by these people when those which result from the first principles of their faith which are among the most imperative of those enforced by their laws and sanctioned by the first precepts of their morality are thus scouted and contemptuously neglected and opposed the extraordinary increase of the wealth population and territory of the united slates has raised her to the condition of a firstrate power among the nations of the world she has also suddenly become smitten with a loveof conquest and we have now to learn whether she will allow this passion to domineer over all sense of right whether a lust of dominionshe will forget the dictates of justice law and reason or whether in obedience to the advice of the greatest of her sons she will return to the wise precepts of his peaceful policy and seek to be renowned for truth wisdom honesty and benevolence from the national era the black law of south carolina the subject of the imprisonment of colored seamen in the port of charleston has been brought before the attention of the english government by a recent suit in the thameg police court on the gart of the steward of a british bark for his wages paymert of which the master of the bark refused on the ground that he had paid the expenses of the steward for two months in the common jail at charleston the master stated that the steward a respectable british subject was taken out of his vessel by the constables of charleston and dragged to the jail from whence he would have been sold as a slave had not he the master paid sioo expenses lord palmerston on being questioned in respeci to the matter in parliament stated that in her majestys government had directed the british minister at washington to remonstrate against the imprisonment of british seamen and the violation of the rritish flag but that mr buchanan had verbally replied that the federal government could not induce the legislature of souih catolina to repeal the law and if pressed on the ground of the treaty of under which all subjects and citizens of the two countries were to be permitted freely to enter freely reside in and freely quit the territories of each would be compelled to put an end to that treaty by giving the twelve months notice required for that purpose his lordship said that it had then been deemed unadvisable to press the matter to such an extremity the outrage was spoken of by the member who called lord ps attention to itas a scandalous violation of the principles which regulated the intercourse of civilized nations lord palmerston said that the law grew out of the unfortunate institution of slavery and it was quite unnecessary for him to express the opinion which all who heard him must entertain with respect to it the matter will not we think end here a case similar to the one under consideration was brought to the attentionof lotd aberdeen when foreign minister and from the correspondence which followed it was understood that in future the personal freedom of british subjects secured by the treaty of would be respected in american ports in the case of two colored british subjects from the bahamas who were thus seized and imprisoned some years ago their jail fees not being paid they were sold as slaves a formal demand for them was made by the british government one of them was found and restored the other could not be discov ered the london antislavery reporter of theist ultimate calls upon the british press and puhlic to demand from government immediate measures to prevent future outrages of this kind we do not say the editors intend that this case shall pass over lightly it is too important to be shuffled out o sight to suit the convenience of any parties and the question must receive a definitiveanswer whether the colored population belonging to this country and its various dependencies are to be treated as felons and slaves in any ports of the united states and whether the british government is unable or unwilling to protect them when going thither on their lawful business as massachusetts and the free states generally have a stake in this controversy in common with great britain we shall look with some degree of interest for its result j g w letter from gerrit smith who can help loving gerrit smith in an important sense it matters nothing whether we agree with him in mere modes or meas utes we are free to acknowledge that herein we differ and we confess to an occasional momentary alienation by reason of the undue severity of his language touching these points of difference but just reading the letter which follows all else is forgotten the spirit which dictated this belongs only toa good manbut it needs not this to establish that fact a personal acquaintance had long since settled it beyond allhuman controversy his very looksnot a safe guide in casesare a sure index of the character both of his mind and his heart we should want no better argument with which to disarm his foes than to present the man not perhaps in public on a subject of allabsorbing interest in which the deepest prejudices of men are stirred though histone and temper even here are admirably but we would present him in private in the social circle and every foe would at once be converted to a friend now when we hear professors of religion as occasionally we do call mr smith an infidel and a because forsooth he has troubled some churches of the devil and because failing to induce ministers of the gospel to follow their divine master and preach deliverance to the captive he has essayed to do so himself on the sabbath day we are strongly tempted to say to them what now we will just whisper in their ears gentlemen god never gave you capacity to comprehend

commit themselves fully openly and heartily in their newspapers and meetings and nominations to the doctrine that civil government is bound to prohibit the sale of intoxicating drinks and resolved further that so jong as they dobe long to such parties there is little probability that civil government will permanently pro urohibit such sale this resolution was smartly debated and very eloquently advocated by mr smith it passed on the evening of the first day of the session and mr smith returned to peterboro ihe majority was decisive on the next morning after mr smith and others of his friends had left a motion was made by abner bates lreasurer of the society to revise and rescind the above resolution after a very long debate the resolution was rescinded and a substitute adoptedthe reasons

to become the allies of the slave power in enslaving those who have quietly departed from the southern prisonhouse we will consider such enactment a highhanded usurpation of power and a daring effort

virginia ln october last we published a review of wa smiths proslavery address by s m jannev for which he was presented by the grand jury on the pretence that it was calculated to incite colored persons to make insurrection and rebellion that presentment not being sustained by the court another was made in november charging him with maintaining the doctrine that masters had no right of property in theirslaves this presentment has also been quashed by the court in the present month and we shall give next week s m janneys defence submitted to the court national era io foote of mississippi stated in the us senate the other day that he would never think of supporting the clay compromise were he not satisfied that slavery could and would be extended into new mexico under its

far therlndependent democrat from the national antislavery staudard fugitive slave case the journal of commerce copies the following report of a recent trial from the indiana state journal of the th instant announcing it with a triumphant declaration of the constitution and laws vindicated the decision it will be seen was based upon that in the prigg case which established the monstrous doctrine that slave law is the paramount law all over the united states that the slaveholder has under the constitution the right to seize his fugitive slave wherevei he can find him and that he need not unless he choose give any evidence that the man so seized is a slave and if he does choose to give such evidence his own oath to the fact is sufficient this is law in this republic and it exceeds in its tyrannical spirit any claim ever yet set up in the worst of despotisms in any age for it leaves utterly un protectedso far as the law is concerned the personal liberty of the citizen and the unknown and the humble may at any time no matter what the hue of their complexion be claimed as slaves and reduced without the hope or possibility of redemption to the condition of slaves for life it is this state of things for which the journal of commerce is striving and for which mr vebster retainers all over the country are thanking him for aiding to produce important decisionthe suit of john norris of broome county kentucky vs leander b newton e b crocker and seven others for the recovery of damages for aiding and abetting the escape of slaves after more than a weeks investigation before the circuit court of the united states was determined on wednesday last in favor of the plaintiff a verdict of two thousand eight hundred and fiftysix dollars was given by the jury against the defendants as the value of the slaves and other damages the suit has elicited considerable interest and was decided mainly under a decision of the supreme court of the united states in the case of prigg where the court takes the ground that the owner of a slave has the right under the constitution and act of congress to capture his property in a free state and take it thence without going before a state court and obtaining a certificate on this trial it was proved that four negroes claimed by norris were captured in the state of michigan they had absconded from their master in boone countykentucky in octobet that he immediately on the next morning after their escape went in pursuit of them he proved by two or three witnesses that he was their owner and had been for a number of years after searching for his negroes between one and two months he abandoned the pursuit he traced them as far as laurel in franklin county but could then obtain no further information as to the rout they had taken last fall he received information that they had fled to michigan and settled in a neighborhood in cass county where it is estimated by witnesses that about one thousand negroes reside he took some five or six persons with him and in the night captured his negroes in michigan and immediately proceded on his journey homeward to kentucky after i passing through south bend and at a distance of axnile and a half from the town norris and his party stoped on the roadside for refreshments while there a party came from south bend accompanied by the dep ity sheriff of the county and make an arrest under a writ of habeas corpus norris and his party returned with the negroes to south bend and trial was had before the judge of the probate court of st joseph county norris made a return on the writ of habeas corpus under oath stating that the negroes were his property and that he was taking them to tiia residence in boone county whence they had escaped the truth of theis return was admitted by crocker who appeared in behalf of the negres but who fiiad a demurrer claiming the liberation of the on the ground that they had been captured in michigan and there was no certificate of the sight ofownership having been proved in that state the judge deciding that this was necessaryliberated the negroes norris anticipating thisdecisionhad procured a writ to take the negroes from the clerk of the circuit court and as soon as the decision was pronounced attempted to take them when a scene of great confusion ensued the kentucky party were armed with pistols and bowieknives and the crowd wiih canes and clubs after considerable excitement the negroes were taken to the jail of the county by the sheriff for safe keeping several criminal suits were then instituted against the kentucky party which it was alledged by the plaintiffs counsel were for the purpose of aiding in the ultimate rescue of the negroes the negroes were demanded of the sheriff by norris but he was refused possession as in the mean time a second writ of habeas corpus had been issued on which the negroes were in the end discharged norris not appearing on the second trial the first trial was had on friday afternoon and the negroes were finally liberated on the next monday morning during the time intervening it was in evidence that from seventyfive to two hundred negroes from michigan were present in south bend armed with guns and clubs and a number of them finally escorted the negroes out of town when they were discharged judge mclean in giving his charge to the jury said that the decision ofthe judge on the first trial on the writ of corpus was incorrect under a decisidff of the supreme court of the united states in the case above referred to that the writ of habeas corpus was proper and was at all times allowable but the question under it in this case was the right of ownership that being admitted the slaves should have been remanded into the custody of norris the judge said he had dissented from this decision of the supreme court of the united states when it was given but he was now bound to carry it out on the part of the defence a plea was set up that norris had given his negroes liberty to come across the river at the time of their escape but this was not proven to the satisfaction of the jury had this been the case norrie could not have the advantage of the act of congress and the decision of the supreme court in their capture messrs liston and smith acquitted themselves with much credit on the part of the plaintiff and messrs jernegan and marshall made a most able defence mr smith spoke between six and seven hours in the closing speech under this decison we can see no reasons why the citizens of the south should complain of injustice being done them while in pursuit of their fugitive slaves at least sofar as indiana is concerned the law as it exists will soon be understood under a few more decisions liki the present and all future difficulty will he avoided we have no boubt that much of the excitement was occasioned on the part of many of the citizens ol south bend in consequence of either misapprehending the true nature of the case or the law under which they weie acting all citizens occording to the decision of the judge are bound to know rhe law and great pains will hereafter no doubt be taken not to become

pittsburgh to give utterance to the opinion of the people in favor of the unconditional admission of california and against any extension ofslavery james robb presided the meeting was eloquently addressed by george mason and dr f j le moyne the committee through their chairman john a wills reported a series of very spirited resolutions which were adopted we subjoin a few of them resolved that when we see the wheels of the general government arrested by the proslavery propagandists of the south california refused admission into the union dissolution of the union threatened on the floor of congressthen we see traitors in the ranks of both the great political parties of the country hatching delusive projects of compromise whieh while they give nothtng substantial to the cause ot freedom surrender everything to slaveryand when we know that slavery is bounded by no lines of physical geography and that it has been and is now profitably employed in mining asin other branches of industry we are not to be deluded by the deceptive suggestion that the wilmot proviso is unnecessarythat slavery will never enter the new territoriesthat the south is merely contending for an abstract right which it has no disposition to exercise and that therefore in the spirit of compromise we should forbear the exercise of a wellestablished constitutional right resolved that a crisis in the fate of the whig and democrat parties at the north has at length arrived when they must either dissolve their alliance with the slave power or the laboring men of the country as sensible men seeking to piomote their own interests not less than to advance the great cause of humanity will be obliged to withdraw from all political connection with them in syracuse new york the citizens without distinction of party lately assembled intown meeting the mayor assisted by eight vice presidents presided the albany atlas says of it the meeting held at syracuse on tuesday evening to speak on behalfof the admission of california as a single question resented to have been one of the largest and most exciting ever held in that city the officers were among the most intelligent and influential citizens and the meeting was almost entirely composed of ihat poition of that communitymen who think and reason and do not fear to speak we call attention to the preamble and resolutions and to the character of the body from which they emanate they speak the language of the men of all parties the expression of the unanimous sentiment of a community which in the centre of the state surroundedjby a large agricultural population remote from all influences of interest or passion which might pervert soberjudgement on this subject may be taken as a fair type and representative of the best portion of the people of the northern states they demand that legislation shall return to its accustomed channels and that demagogues shall cease to obstruct it they demand the admission of california and reject the idea of coupling its destiny with other questions they declare that in view of the aggressions and menaces of the slave power they feel called upon to declare their uncompromising hostility to the passage of any laws which shall not contain a provision forever forbidding the extension of slavery therein a public meeting without distinction of party was lately held in montgomery county pennsylvania joshua place presided james jacobs was appointed secretary the meeting passed unanimous resolutions armum them the following resolved ihat the representative of whatever grade who proves false to his god and his country in the hour of peril and time of need upon the great question of human freedom will be a libel upon the name of man and the benedict arnold of the age resolved that we feel deeply grateful to freedoms noble representatives for their manly dignified and heroic efforts to preserve inviolate the glorious sentiments of the declaration of independence and to maintain unsullied the honor and integrity of our country the admiration of the present age awaits them the blessings of the future will keep their memories green in the hearts of its children resolved that california having complied with the terms prescribed by the constitution it is the duty of congress to immediately provide for her admission with her present boundaries separated from all other questions national era new mexico a free statewhile the american congress has been wrangling about california and new mexico the people of the latter following the example of the former have met in

the sagacity and wisdom of the course of policy pursued and recommended by gen taylor touching the territories acquired from mexico in his message to congress of jan st he briefly states the condition

meeting for two days and to sell whatever articles the friends may send in on the first day in the afternoon sept d there will be a festival for children consisting of songs and dances on that evening there will be addresses on the character of howard and his labors we trust there will be a general gathering of the friends of prison reform and that something may be accomplished for the cause

all this asked a man of his friend at the unrolling of the mummy i think it must have been rather binding at the time was the reply and reminds me of the mysterious rapping of the present day boston post col bentons speech we publish today the cosing portion of col bentons great speech against the compromise bill we would gladly give our readers the whole of it want of room however must be our apology for omitting the first part that which we publish relates mainly to the question of slavery as affected by the compromise and a most complete dissection of that bill of abominations itis full of that massiveness of thought and that accuracy of historical and geographical information which distinguish the speeches of the missouri senator abovfl his cotemporaries it will long live among the ablest spiciest and most unswearable oratorical efforts of the present age its blows fall upon clay and ilia committee of thirteen with a ponderous power that is absolutely annihilating it shows the scheme to be a violation of all parliamentary practice illegal and unconsti tutional the most valuable part of the speech however is the part we publish relating to the texas boundary and slavery mr benton shows conclusively that the compromise bill actually surrenders square miles of the free territory of new mexico to slavery that is if gives up a territory larger than all ihe new england states to texas and at the same time pays our sable sister of the lone star ten or twelve millions for condescending to accept the gift this is a direct and positive extension ofslavery this then is the compromisethe direct surrender to slavery to free territory larger than new englandthe payment often or twelve millions to speculators in texas bondsthe virtual abolition of freedom in the rest of new mexico and utahthe making ot all the free states hunting grounds for the slavecatchers the keeping california out of the union till all these schemes are perfected and this is the grand panacea which is to still forever the tempest of agitation and settle the great question of the age so it concoctors tell ns and the country so apparently they believe no messrs compromisers we tell you the thing can never be done by any such means the spirit of freedom and inquiry that is envoked can be laid by no such bastard specific the eyes of of the people are upon you their words have gone to you and will go again in tones that shall reverberate from the atlantic to the pacific the vast question which now shakes this republic cannot be settled by any action of any men in congress or out unless it be in a way which secures the free territory of the nation against the curse of human bondage your compromise may pass but insteadof settling it will excite the sea of agitation to a tempest whose fury shall bury you and your agreement with hell together but on this point of the tendency of this bill now before ihe senate and now sought to be endorsed by the freemen of new hampshire we ask every honest man to read carefully the remarks of the missouri senator they ate the words of a man who knows wkereof he speakswho has lived his whole life long in the midst of slaveryhe is himself a slaveholder but still a haier of the system whose evils no one better understands we ask the people of new hampshire to mark the men from the free states who desert the noble standard of old bullion

itelihu burritt our country is the world our countrymen are all mankind anona short time ago the friends of peace called a meeting at the park street church for the purpose of appointing delegates to attend the worlds convention on the banks of the rhyne in consequence of the inclemency of the weather and the unbusiness like manner in which the meeting was advertised there were but few persons present but the distinguished gentlemen who were called upon to address that audience might have consoled themselves with the reflection that what their assembly lucked in number it made up in talent learning influence and moral worth gov briggs occupied the chair the venerable dr sharp invoked the divine blessing rev a estone delivered an able and interesting address and was followed by the hon amasa walker and oth ers the chief object of attraction at this meeting was elihu burritt the learned blacksmith he sat on the first seat opposite the pulpit witn his hack towards the audience his head resting on his hand and his eyes clos most of the time during the delivery of the speeches thomas drewjr immortalized as burritts blower and striker at the forge hot anvil of reform was busy with pensil and paper in one of the side pews the hearers waited peaceably but impatiently for mr burritt to take the rostrum and when it was announced that he would speak every countenanpe became radiant with joyful anticipation mr burritt arose in a quiet unpretending manner and modestly responded to the invitation to speak he stood on the topstair of the pulpit and at first seemed to shirink hack bashfully from the gaze of the upturned faces before him although he is no coward i have no doubt his heart beat as though it would batter a breach through its tenement when he first unsealed his lips in the presence of that assembly in fact the contour of his face and the tones of his voice are the telltales which publish lack of self conceit mr burritt is now in the meridian of his manhood but his premature baldness is his apology for wearing a wig he has a towering forehead but owing to the large development of the perceptive faculties it appears to retreat in the region of causality whilst in reality it does not i think his eyes are blue when they do not blaze his face indicates perseverance that will not falter and integrity that will not disappoint he speaks slowly distinctly and forcibly without ever uttering a foolish thing he has a peculiarity of tone which is unreportable but which tells with thrilling effect on the hearts of his hearers when he enters earnestly into the subject he discusses all who have heard him must acknowledge that his matter is fill of thought as an egg is of meathe employs facts and statistics in his speeches and editorials but they have the varied beauty of the rainbow and the golden glow of sunlight when viewed through the prism of his rich imag ination the following extract from the london edition of the little volume entitled sparks from the anvil will give the reader an idea of mr burritts style of writing in an article on temperance he alludes to the history of a distinguished statesman who had been snatched as a brand from the liquid burningand he was found with all the resuscitated vigor of his talents exhuming as it were his fellow beings who like him had been buried before they were dead massachusetts welcomed him back to her embrace with emotions of maternal joy and invited the returning pleiad to resume his rank among the stars of her crown the doors of her halls and churches were thrown open to the newlyreturn ing prodigal and many were touched to life and salvation at the burning eloquence which fell from his lips sister states heard of this new luther intemperance and he obeyed their call he stood up in their cities like paul in the midst of mars hill and with an eloquence approaching inspiration set forth the strange doctrine of total abstinence that man unfortunately was led astray by friends in human form but a band of washingtonians persuaded him to sign the pledge once more and this time it was an unviolated policy of ipsurance against the fires of destruction he concluded that graphic sketch in the following words that man is again a giant and he is broad look out for him like samson he is feeling for the pillars of the temple of bacchus and he will erelong revenge the loss ofhis locks by a mighty overthrow of that doomed edi fice it affords the writer no small degree of pleasure to lift up the curtain which hangs between the past and present and look back to the time when the now eminent champion of peace first put on his paper cap and leather apron and made the forge blaze and the hammer ring he did not dream then that he one day would beat swords into ploughshares and spears into pruning hooks his friends did not at that time give him credit for any striking manifestations of genius to use his own words he was a plodding patient persevering lad gathering by the process ot accretion which builds the antheap particle by particle thought by thought fact by fact in this way he worked and studied night by night for years with blistered hands and brightening hope at lessons which have made him shine a star of the first magnitude in the firmament of fame in the summer of governor everett of massachusetts in an address to an association of mechanics in boston took occasion to mention that a blacksmith of that state had by his unaided industry made himself acquainted with fifty lajiguagesl prior to this announcement mr burritt had lived in obscurity and the fame of his acquirements did not extend beyond the smoke of his workshop when mr nelson called on mr b at worcester he found him at his anvil when told what the governor had reported respecting him he modestly replied that the governor had done him more than justice it wa truehe said that he could read about fifty languages but he had not studied them all critically yankee curiosity had induced him to look at the latin grammar became interested in it and persevered and finally acquired a thorough knowledge of that language hethen studied the greek with equal care an acquaintance with these languages had enabled him to read with equal facility the italian the french the spanish the portuguese the russian to which he was then devoting his odd moments he said was the most difficult of any he had undertaken he went to worcester to secure the advantages of an antiquarian library to which the trustees allowed him free access he spent eight hours at the forge eight hours in the library and the remaining eight hours of each day in recreation and rest after he had studied hebrew and made himself acquainted with its cognate languages the syraic chaldaic arabic samaritan ethiopic c he turned his attention to the languagespr europe and studied french spanish italian and german under native teachers he then pursued the portuguese flemish danish swedish norwegian icelandic welsh gselic celtic c it is somewhat remarkable that aman who has devoted so much of his time to the acqujsition of languages that he is a living portable polyglott should have such mightv mathematical powers figures tumble from his penlike seeds from a sack when the string is untwined from its throat there are but few men of past or present times that can excel him in description take the following graphic sketch of the iron horse as a specimen of his skill in that department of literature i love to see one ofthese creatures with sinews of brass and muscles of iron strut forth from his smoky table and saluting the long train of cars with a dozen sonorous puffs from his iron nostrils fall back gently into his harness there he stands champing and foaming upon the iron track his great heart a furnace of glowing coals his lymphatic blood is boiling in his veins the strength of a thousand horses is nerving his sinewshe pants to be gone he would snake st peters across the desert of sahara if he could be fairly hitched to it but there is a little sobereyed tobacco chewing man in the saddle who holds him in with one finger and can fake away his breath in a moment should he grow restive or vicious lam always deeply interested in this man for begrimed as he may be with coal diluted in oil and steam i regard him as the genius of the whole machinery as the physical mind of that huge steam horse mr burritt believes that god has made of one blood all the nations of the earth and he aims to unite them by the frateiual chain of he looks upon war as an inexcusable evil and labors manfully for its extirpation he would dismantle the arsenal disband the army spike the cannon and reforge the cutlass he would take our ships of war and lade them down to the waters edge with food and covering for human beings the ballast should be round clams or the real quahaugs heavy as cast iron and capital for roasting then he would build along up filling every square inch with wellcured provisions he would have a hogshead of bacon mounted in every porthole each of which should discharge fifty hams a minute when the ship was brought into action and the staterooms should be filled with well made garments and the taut cordage and the long tapering spars should be festooned with boys jackets and trowsers then when there should be no more room for another codfish or herring or sprig of catnip he would run up the white flag of peace he would throw as many hams into the city in twentyfour hours as there were bomshelis and cannon balls thrown intokeil by the besieging armies he would barricade the low narrow streets with loaves of bread would throw up a breastwork clear round the marketplace of barrels of flour pork and beef and in the middle raise a stack of salmon and codfish as large as a small methodist meetinghouse with a steeple to it and a bell in the steeple and the bell shall ring to all the city bells and the city bells should ring to all the people to come to market and buy provisions without money and without price and white flags should everywhere wave m the breeze on the vanes of steeples on mastheads on flagtones along the embattled walls on the ends of willow sticks borne by the romping laughing trooping children all the bloodcolored drapery of war should bow and blush before the stainless standard of peace and generations of anglosaxons should remember with mutual felicitations the conquest of the white flag or the storming of quebec mr burritt has made his mark upon this agea mark which ime will not erase his society is coirted by the great men of europe aid america he quietly suggests a worlds convention and senators members of parliament baronets and crowned heads hearken to his counsels he is the same great and good man whether in the smithy talking with fhe hardhanded nailers or in the magnificent forum pleading for peace in tie presence of the dignitaries of the land he has no idea that he is a great man and would not believe it if competent judges were to give him a printed certificate to prove the fact he is a bachelor nota fussy squeamish nervouslyfastidi ous bachelor but a generous social freeandeasy unostentatious bachelor who ought to have been married long ago although he is just the right age to become a married man now his paper needs no notice from my humble pen it is widely circulated and speaks for itself the press in his hand is like the hammer in the hand of thor the thundergod he strives to smite off the clanking manacles from the uplifted hands of the bleeding slave and to strike down the monster that wades in blood and to build up the temple of universal peace and to weld the world in an unbroken band of eternal brotherhood he sees a spirit of selfishness abroad that would rob earth of its flowers and heaven of its lights disinherit the angels uncrown the almighty and sit upon the throne of the universe so he has unfurled the white banner and is now leading the crusaders of a good cause to a battle where no blood will be shed but where that evil selfish spirit will be subdued and peace shall triumph crayon league bazaar in london mr burritt had just time to inform us by last mail that he had a pleasent voyage across the ocean and arrived in london in time to open the grand league of brotherhood bazaar it had commenced with eclat mrs richard cobden presided at one stall and mrs milner gibson also took part it its management the stalls are described by the london morning advertiser as being extreemly rich in articles of general use and tasteful beatuyone unique feature was a table of beautiful fossils one thousand tickets of admission were sold the first day and about one thousand dollars worth of articles disposed ofwe hope to present our readers with a full report next week mr burritt will now also be able to greet the citizen circle weeldy in propria persona christian citizen texas and new mexico by the congressional journal it will be seen that the president sent a message to the senate on monday in reply to thecal of that body for information whether any orders had been issued to any military officers at santa fe to hold possession against the authority of texas or in any way to embarrass the exercise of her jurisdiction over that country the president says that no such orders have been given he also states that information has been received that the commissioner of texas has proceeded to santa fe with a view of organizing counties in that district under the authority of texas this territory he sayswas actually acquired by the united states from mexico and has since been actually held by the united states and in his opinion ought so to remain until the boundary of texas is settled by some competent authority meanwhile he thinks there is no reason for seriously apprehending that texas will practically interfere with the possession of the u s this latter conclusion of the message may be founded on good cabinet logic for aught we know but we confess it is beyond our comprehension we do not see how that texas can exercise jurisdiction organize counties and do other sovereign acts within the territory without any hindrance or molestation from the authorities and not thereby practically interfere with the possession of the united states we fear that there is a settled purpose to let texas consummate her usurpation over new mexico and thus afford another triumph to slavery by extending that atrocious system over a large territory now free mass spy another plot the following letter from the washington correspondent of the journal of commerce who whatever else may be said of him says the massachusetts spy is usually well informed foreshadows another buccaneering expedition in the western archipelago washington june the united states have become through the force of circumstances the arbiter of the future destiny of cuba and of st domingo the condition of the latter islandtwothirds of it now under the control of the spanish population and the other third constituting the haitien government and the relentless warfare carried on between the two communitiesis now such that the government of the united statesby interferencemust decide the future political condition of the island if our people be suffered to take any part in the conflict it will be on the side of the european race and against the black government there is every reason to believe that something is going on in reference to this matter and that an expedition from the united states will at no distant day strengthen the resources of the dominicans what this government is to do in the event that the island should be brought under the subjection either of spain or of american adventurers will become a serious question i do not suppose that the u s will undertake to bully the black emperor faustin ithough some tendency that way may have been supposed to exist but if by resources which may bjifcur citizens be furnished to the dominicans they shall subject the blacks to their dominion and perhaps to domestic slavery and if the american and spanish masters of the island ask for annexation to the union and for a territorial or colonial government or for protection against spainor france or englandor all threeit will create a new and darklooking questionand it will arise in time to take the place of the present slavery conflict in congress should it be fortunately settled another letter from mr webster the intelligencer of wednesday morning publishes a threecolumn letter from daniel
