slavery in the exhibition of will doubtless give rise to a number of demonstrations on various subjects and divers partiessocial political and religious it has been proposed by our excellent contemporary the morning ad vcrtitv that there shall be one on the subject of slaverya proposition which commends itself to every rightminded man in the kingdom not that the yankees can charge us at all with indifference on the subject our emancipation act and all our subsequent proceedings forbid such a conclusion but least they should think that our horror ot slavery diminishes and that at length we have come to regard their offence as comparatively trival or at any rate as not being under all cir cumstancesinconsistent with the christian profession it is proper from time to time to jog their memory to suppose that the antislavery spirit of england is abated is quite a mistake although we admit at the same time that due allowance must be made for their darkness on the score of defective education and the onesided view they get of the subject from those to whom they look up for instruction and guidance it is remarkable to what an extent men high in the christian world and otherwise blearsighted intelligent calm and candid have on this subject been blinded by local prejudice party feeling and defective moral training at this moment we can call to mind no case in which the conduct of a body of ministers has been so utterly reprehensible as that of the american clergy in their iniquitous yielding to that public opinion which it should have been the great object of their pulpit and pastoral labors to correct and elevate our contemporary cites a striking and wellknown instance of this early in the present century the general assembly of the presbyterian j church declared slavery a sin and slaveholders as sinners mansteal j ers perpetrators of the highest kind of theft while in they came toa compromise with them by resolving that this assembly do not think it tit for the edification of the church to take any action on the subject of slavery it is surely something new in the history of the presbyterian church to come to a resolution not to rebuke iniquity the rev dr cox of brooklyn who was present on the occasion is reported to have said thank god our vesuvius is capped for the next three years let those who are i in alliance with slaveholding christians think ot that as slavery however is so obviously opposed both to the letter and spirit of the bible it cannot be wondered at that so many of the wise and good should regard the epithet slaveholding christians as a contradiction in terms but it is not so regarded in america men who have every claim to be considered as at least conscientious may be found defending it even from the book of god for example the rev moses stuait dd a man of high intellectual attainments and great influence and who may in fact be considered as holding a first place amongst the biblical critics of his own country has actually attempted to justify the ti affic in the bodies of men and women from the pages of the inspired volume evenwe blush to write itthe infamous fugitive slave bill has received his sanction and its cruel authors have been honored with his applause now if slavey had no other ill effect than this melancholy perveraiou of the moral rectitude of such a mao it would deserve the scornful and indignant execration of all man kind but the presbyterian church and dr moses stuart unfortunately by no means stand alone in this matter dr parker of philadelphia is reported by dr pennington to have said ina recent sermon that there were no evils in slavery but such as were inseparable from any other i elation in life now if these terms have the same signification from that doctorss lips as they have from those of other men we are utterly at a loss to reconcile such a statement with decency for to go no further dr stnythe au irishman by birth but for many years a slaveholder and christian minister at charleston south carolina is said in the north star i frederick douglass ealtvr ill proprietor vol iv no marrying slaves always to omit the words whom god hath joined let noman put asunder in fact the marriage of slaves is the merest farce imaginable inasmuch as they are torn asunder and parted for life at the merest caprice of their owners and that with as litte compunction as beasts of burden are separated it is merely licenced concubinage is this an evil irseparable from any other condition tn life the thought inspires indignant disgust here is a christian minister a professed expounder of the gospel of troth and justice love and mercy performing a solemn ceremony rather should we say a cruel mock erywhich he knows his divine master pronounced as a union for life with the fact before him that at any moment and perhaps after years and tender offspring have endeared it this compact may be broken on the auction block and the parties severed to meet on earth no more well may infidels scoff and mock at such a religion this stigma however i not to be fixed on any individual minister in particular for as our contemporary asserts synods and assemblies of divines have declared that the marriage lie between slaves is not binding why then enact the solemn and tantalizing farce of performing the mocking ceremony the poor slave instead of the feelings of hope and happiness which are naturally associated with such an event must look round on the uncertainty of his affairs and be stung with the reflection ah if i mind not i what lam about or if his pecuniary necessities press my master will sell me away to the south and my wifel shall see her no more forever let the husbands of england place themselves in this position and ask themselves how they can reconcile this with christianity would not the moral consciousness of an intelligent pagan revolt at it the churches of america are the main bulwark of slavery were they to come out and do their duty the aspect of affairs would soon be changed and the national banner would speedily cease to be stained with the blood of millions lest the reader should think we overestimate the case we shall state the facts from the calculation of an american clergyman slaves the methodists hold presbyterians old and new bool baptists campbellites baptists j episcopalians jollier denominations  toial owned by ministers ol gospel and member of protestant churches valuing each slave at an average of dollars or here is a capital of invested by a christian people ill the bodies and souls of men now to the practical point are the men by whom religion and morality are thus outraged to be received on the same footing as a clarkson and a willberlorce and those who have imbibed their spirit and act upon their principles the case is thus powerfully put by that zealous and eloquent advocate of the natural and inalienable rights of the sons of hamfrederick douglass these men wield the blood clotted cowskin during the week fill the pulpit on saturday and claim to be disciples of the meek and lowly jesus the man who robs me of my earnings at the end of each week meets me asa class leader on sunday morning to show me the way to life and salvation he who sells my sisters for the basest purposes stands lorth as the advocate of purity and he who proclaims the religious duty of perusing the bible denies me the right to read the name of the god that made me the warm defender of the sacredness of the family relation is the same who scatters whole families sundering husbands and w ives parents and children sisters and brothers leaving the hut vacant and the hearth desolate but happiy the north is largely right on the question as is evidenced by the following powerful passage in a speech of the honorable joshua r giddmgs in the house of representatives on the the fugitive slave bill the honorable gentleman drew the following comparison between professor daniel webster the chief promoter of this measure sir i was about to make some comparisons but perhaps they maybe regarded as indelicate during last summer two distinguished gentlemen of the same name occupied much of tho public attention one was said to have committed murder and the other to have procured the passage of this law one was hanged for his crime the other for his efforts was taken into the executive cabinet one destroyed the life of an individual the other contributed his efforts for the passage of this law which must consign hundreds perhaps thousands tn  premature graves i sir cannot speak for others but for myself i would rather meet my final judge with the guilt of him who has gone to his account than of him who now sits in yonder cabinet if bis countrymen were not largely with the houorable member such language would not have been used and shall america thus testify for the rights of man and england remain silent and sympathize with the oppressor and regard him as a christian we pause lor a reply vititkrs to thb british muituh the tytel number of persons who visited thy british museum in was in in  in in  nod in  britith banner right is of no sex truth is of no color god is the father of us all and all men are brethren from the national era the mothers of greatness by l a hiss we often hear it remarked that great men have almoet universally been indebted to noble mothers for their distinction it has been mserted that every child before the age of seven is impressed with the essential elements of character that follow it through life and as mothers have the principal care and training of children under this se it hu been inftmtklf oetrtlf all of goodness and greatness inhuman character is due to maternal influence in pronouncing this no exaggeration would not undertake the power of the father over the destinies of his offspring as both the male and female harmoniously united in wedlock are essential to complete the complement of their respective characters so is the influence of both parents necessary to the true education of the young all things in the vegetable and animal kingdoms are distinguished into male and female and it were stupid to attempt an exaltation of the one above the other in power and influence but this may be said without disparagement that maternal imperfections aswell as maternal virtues have more to do with the fortune of the child than have those of the father i say this u so in the present condition of society nevertheless it should not be so and will not in a state of truer development now we seem to regard the woman as predestined to the exclusive care of her children during the first septennaid of life and the father is apt to regard them as annoyances or at least to excuse himself from all attention in their behalf until they are old enough to be worthy of his regard but if i mistake not the true system of inlantile development requires the united counsels and care of both parents for truly if there be a character peculiar to the male and also to the female and if they were designed to mutually influence each other that education is onesided which is conducted exclusively by the one or the other but not to dwell here i have said that in the present state of philosophy and society vastly more depends upon the errors and the virtues the mother than upon those of the father in the early development of children the influence of the mother extends back even for months anterior to the birth cf her offspring that they are highly susceptible to impressions communicated through the maternai mind during the embryonic period no longer admits of a doubt during this time the mother exercises supreme dominionex cept so far as the conduct of the husband may influence the mind of his wife this is her peculiar empire in which she reigns the almost absolute queen of individuals and of nations she has now the young mind exclusively under her control and if she understand the manner of imparting character to it she can by the exercise of her own will bring into the world such a being as she pleases if she would give birth to a josephine or a howard a timor or a nero she cando so by a simple and silent exercise of her will if she has an enemy she hates this hatred can be made doubly strong in her offspring it was probably in view of these considerations that plato laid down the rule that education must commence previous to the birth of the child in the parents themselves but mere assertion is of little account though it has often been repeated that greatness is chiefly indebted to noble mothers still the mere assertion is of little worth let us glance into the history of greatness and see how the proposition is sustained by facts in consequence of the mea gre character of almost all biographies the facts concerning the characters of the parents are not always given the biographer is too often inclined to claim overmuch for his hero and consequently it is an object to make as brilliant a contrast as possible between the position in which he originated and that which he attained by his individual efforts with the early english biographers who partook the spirit of the times and were aristocratic in feeling we find an effort to conceal the meanness of their heroes origins and to find in tbeir ancestors at least the distinction of gentlemen but in our democratic times it is rather an object to trace the lives of the great to ao humble origin but even our recent biographers seem destitute of the science of greatnessthat is they do not appreciate the value of all the circumstances under which a great man came into the world and was educated and consequently that minutia of facts touching the mental constitutions acquirements virtues vices and general habits of parentsis not given by which the causes and consequences can be linked together and valuable information obtained concerning the formation of human character the first examples i shall cite are those in which tbe peculiar character of the distinguished personages seem to have originated directly in a singular mental constitution of the mothersome of the cases will also show that the mental exercises of the materna parent even previous to birth must have done much in giving character tc the offspring among the earliest in time as well jti highest in renown on the page of modern biography stands the name oi lord bacon it is said that his fame may be chiefly attributed to the attention of his excellent mother who in rochester n y thursday april stilled into hit youthful mind th rudiments of science and early awakened his speculative curiosity it would doubtless be easy to say nearly as much of any mother of a distinguished personage but other facts that may be given are by no means common his mother was born in and in isfid when twentytwo years of age she made an accurate and highly celebrated translation from the itlhan of twentyfive sermons on the abtfuse doctrine of predestination andjelectiun the mind of lady barn eteen ctfmwy atfra bfea philosophy to have induced her to undertake the translation of such a work this is also seen in the fact that subsequently when the controversy between papacy and the church of england ran high she translated the work of bishop jewell entitled an apology for the church of england from the latin in which it was written in order to bring it within the understanding of the common people this also was a scholarly performance for it received the praise of the best scholars of the time and the hearty thanks of the author to whom she sent a copy accompanied by an epistle in greek with such a mother is it surprising that sir francis was endowed with those high mental qualities which enabled him to depose aristotle from the throne on which he had reigned for two thousand years over the realms of philosophy is it astonishing that lord bacon achieved a revolution in human thought and became the great head of modern progress from this brilliant source of modern speculative philosophy let us recur to another centre of power more familiar to the masses of mankind if not more distinguished for his genius reference is now made to john wesley who in connection with a younger brother was the father of methodism who was the mother of these brothers that struck cut a new path in which millions have since travelled to the land of spirits we find she was the wife of a clergyman who was strict in his attendance on the sittings of the convocations during his absence she conceived the full jdeaofher responsibility to her large family ah there was no sabbath afternoon service at epwortb where she lived jhe prayed in her family read a sermon and engaged in religious conversation some of the more pious parishioners accidentally called in on these occasions and they were not excluded about this time she procured a work that greatly enkindled her ardor for good works her little audience soon numbered forty and fifty to whom she prayed read from the book that had so justly awakened her attention to divine things and finally her house was not able to contain the multitude that waited upon her ministrations the invasion of the duties of the sterner sex and thu palpable violation of the injunction of st paul excited the jealousy and indignation of some of the deacons oi the parish and the aftuir to her husband in no very pleasant terms he was thus induced to write to her objecting to her conduct as it looked particular because of her sex and also because he was in a public station which rendered it necessary that he should do nothing to excite the public censure and he recommended that some man read in his stead in her reply she thanked him for his plainness of speech and as to its locking particular she said i grant it does and so does everything that is serious or that may in any way advance the glory of god or the salvation of souls if it be performed out of the pulpit or in the way of common conversation because in our corrupt age the utmost care and diligence have been used to banish all discourse of god or spiritual concerns out of society as if religion were never to appear out of the closet and we were tobe ashamed of nothing so much as of confessing ourselves to be christians as to the objection on account of her sex she said she was a woman it was true and though be was the rightful lord of tbe family yet she was the mistress and during bis absence she thought her children were committed to her under a trust from the great lord of all families of heaven and earth how should she newer to him if she failed as to bringing censure upou him she said for myself value no censure on this account i have long since shaken hands with the world and i heartily wish had never given them more reason to speak against me whereupon mrs wesley deeming her obligations to hei lord of heaven superior to those to hei martial lord continued her religioui ministrations to the hungry and thirst souls of epworth finally matter waxed worse and worse and the curate of the parish became alarmed foi the cause of decency good manners aod religion remonstrated most energetically with mr wetle having him seif been worsed in an interview witl the priestess of epworth mr wesley thereupon addressed his rebellion wife a second letter communicating bii decided disapprobation to ibis shi did not reply for some days thinkinj it best to take time tor deliberation if so important a negotiation at lengtl she wrote her answer and after stating the good that had been done ii the meetings and her persuasion as t her duty to continue them she said if you do afier all think fit to dissolve this assembly do not tell me tha you detire me to do it for that willno satisfy my conscience hut send m your positive command in such full am express terms as may absolve me fron guilt and punishment for neglecting this opportunity of doing gooc when you and i shall appear before the sreat and awful tribunal of our lord esus christ heroic woman she believed it her duty to submit to the commands of her temporal lord but there must be no lack of explicitness in thb terms of the command they must be such as would leave her no discretion in dissolving a meeting she regarded as of great value to the souls of epworth in this case she did not re awaited his positive command so that she might be acquitted before the great tribunal doubtless mr wesley at this time began to fear that his wife was right and an alarm began to seize him lest he should be a defaulter in her presence before the judgment seat of the universe here we see the potency of superior mental power ruling the minds of others sicntly yet effectually mrs wesley violated no duty to her husband even though that husband was entitled to the supreme command she merely set forth in good sound language her own views as to her obligations to god and the ouls of the people and threw upon hima responsibility under which he trembled he chose rather to let her take her own course than risk the consequences which this powerful weman indicated but this is not the only instance in which mrs wesley was true to her own convictions and personal consequence she was an honest outspoken woman and not timid in expressing her own convictions as to al questions whether religious or political the dispute arose among the people whether the prince of orange was entitled to the throne of the realm in this she differed with mr wesley who told her that he never would again cohabit with her until she should change her opinion but her opinions were her own individual property of which she could not divest herself and her honesty forced her to declare the tact accordingly true to his threat he took bis saddlebags and a crust of bread mounted his gray mare and rode away leaving her and her large family for twelve months when the death of the king released him from his vow the heroic john wesley the founder of the largest protestant sect was the first birth after the reunion of his parents if the influence of this separation so chastened the spirits of his parents as to impress the son with his noble character then fortunate was the temporary disagreement how much of the father of methodism can be traced to the character of his mother we see in her the spirit of inquiry the lofty tone of independence and the mental power calculated to govern which distinguished her illustrious son in his writings do we not observe one distinguishing feature of methodism john wesley was born in the next example i shall cite bears equally strong upon the proposition in handto wit that those faculties of tha head and those sentiments of the heart which are in active exercise immediately preceding and subsequent to the birth of a child are transmitted in predominant power the reader must not be told that this case also bears most forcibly upon the main idea of this pa perto wit the relation of noble mothers to noble sons a heavenly spirit is before us weare now to contemplate the angelic purity and excellence ol that queenly benefactress elizabeth fry she was born in and was descended froma long line of quakers of her mother the biographer remarks mrs gurney mother ofelizabeth was a woman of excellent abilities and of considerable attainments as well of much personal beauty she was disposed to scientific and literary pursuits and singularly delighted in the charms and beauties of nature imbuing her children almost in infancy with tastes that remained with them through life but not to depend upon the mere statement of the biographer let me quote a passage from the diary of this excellent mother in which her true spirit appears the following bears date april in the morning eu deavor at first waking to bring the mind into a silent waiting and worship preparatory to the active employment of the day when up visit the several apartments of the children and if leisure permit before breakfast read the scripturesif not it should not be afterwards neglected forgot not the kindest attention to my companion before parting for the day after walking with the little ones and endeavoring to enjoy each individually begin with the necessary instructions of cand r then attend to the kitchen and all family regulations and to the claims of the poor and thus she concluded the record of the day remember thrt these desultory remarks are de signedfirst to promote my duty to my maker secondly ray duty towards my husband aod children relations servants and poor neighbors the italics are my ownto mark the strength of those sympathies which so preeminently distinguished her illustrious daughter as evidenced not only in her philanthropic life her visits to the poor the outcast and imprisoned and invoking relief from the government but also as seen in the eloquent words of her own diary on the th of may when but seventeen years of age elisabeth make the following entry in her journal there is a sort of luxury in giving way to the feelings i love to feel for the sorrows of others to terms per alias littriihly ii advtice pour wine and oil into the wounds ol the afflicted there is a luxury in feeling the heart glow whether it be witk joy or sorrow i like to think of everything to look at mankind love to look through nature up to natures god have no more religion than that aod in the little have i am not the least devotional but when i admire the beauties of nature i cannot help thinking of the source from whence suh beauties flow i feel it a support ibelieve firmly hat all is governed for the best by an invisible rowermere rare i ob am rear tm evils of life so much i love to feelgood i do what i can to be kind to everybody i have many faults which i hope in time to overcome she became in subsequent life more devotional than she described herself al seventeen but a life actuated by the benevolent sentiments of the above passage is characterized by the purest devotion doing good is devotion to god for he is the infinite good another example of equal force illustrating the proposition in haod tt found in the motherhood of henry iv the noblest king that france ever had true charlemagne had laid the foundations of national glory louis xiv in more modern times by his conquests throw an awful air about the national standard and at a recent period the emperor napoleon astonished the world by his amazing achievements in the name of france but it was the fourth i henry who reigned and toiled for the elevation of the masses of his people as well as for the honor of their regal poweramong the nations of the earth he was an ardent patron of learning and by his own hand many agricultural and mechanical iinprovemeats were introduced he cultivated the grape and under his own exclusive patronage the silk worm was brought from the east and set to work for the french people the memory of this king was embalmed by voltaire in his master poem la hcnriade and who was the mother of the fourth henry she is known in history as jane queen of navarre this was then a small kingdom in the south of france but now it is incorporated in the republic jane married anthony of bourbon sdn of charles duke of vendome by whom she had henry vi this anthony was the first prince of the blood and entitled to the protectorate of charles ix during his minority but the queen mother and the guises wishing to get the power into their own hands endeavored to detach anthony from the protestant interest the influence of the pope and cardinals was obtained and the aspirants were successful as to him but they utterly failed to win jane and her children who were of still greater consequence the king of navarreher husband was thus enlisted against the prince of conde and the protestant cause whereupon the queen retired to pad eusa in berne and there kept her court soon after which the king died and comparative quiet was restored not long subsequent to this however the third civil war on account of religion broke out and jane the queen of navarre raised a considerable force and led them to rochelle taking with her henry her son and catherine her daughter from this place she wrote letters to the king the queenmother the duke of anjou and the cardinal bourbon advising them of their ruinous policy but asher advice was unheeded the war continued the prince of conde was slaia and the protestants were defeated at the battle of bassac on receiving the melancholy news the queen of navarre hastened to the protestant army and before the august assembly of nobles and soldiers she made a speech to inspire them with hope she pronounced an eulogiutn to the prince of conde and exhorted the living to imitate his example after stimulating the hearts and exciting the enthusiasm of the army and after addressing a few words to her son in private to stir up his spirits she retired to rochelle to rsise new succors in the meantime a commission was granted to torride governor of querni to summon the queen of navarre and the prince her son to quit the protestant cause and in case ofher refusalto invade the countries of berne foix and navarre of course the highspirited queen refused and her provinces were invaded terride took possession of all but navarre which he be seiged the earl of montgomery was sent against him and he was defeated and driven back and a treaty was made in which the rights of jane were guaranteed her dominions dedicated to the freedom of the protestant faith and she and her children acknowledged good cousins of the king her son married the kings sister and when she went to paris to arrange the nuptials the queenmother who could not endure her rival coospired with one rene skillful in missions to take her off accordingly he sola her poisoned perfumes which sickened her with a fever that terminaied her life in at years of age such was the mother of the great henry of frwxrr this head also we must clam the mother of napoleon she was a woman of surpassing beauty and exceeding vigor her husband was attached to paoli the defender of cor sician independence against the freach hie young and highspirited wife while pregnant with napoleon followed the patriot army on horseback across the mountains and resided awhile on the summit of mount of ro whole no tondo in the parish of kaoli just bo fore the period ofher confinement she wac cent beck to ajaccia seyscott he read with inters that his mothers good constitution and bold character of mind haring induced her to

victor upon temporary couch prepared for her accommodation and covered with en ancient piece of tapestry representing the heroee of the iliad enough for the motherhood of napoleon in these cases we see something of the e latent to which the thooghta feelings and passions of the raether while moulding the tenement of a soul stamps its destiny in life this is a j subject full of warning for all mothers and for all fathers to mothers that they may be trutbtul and pure and to fathers that they may assist their wives in all that is good and surround them with pleasant circumstancse the mother has alrao lathe power to predestine a soul to happiness or misery to virtue or vice to heaven or hell the example of sir philip sidney a also in point his mother possessed a lofty and ingenious spirit

the noble hampden and made a speech in his defence of which copies were sold in one day he was born in i may remark here that it is a noteworthy fact that while the biographer never has occasion to notice the stupidity ol a single mother of greatness ho has in almost all instances when the facts are known occasion to speak of the superiority of the mothers of his heroes but i cannot complete this paper without extending it to an unsuitable length and will close here for the present expecting to resume it and deduce other important considerations from biographical facts with some valuable

comparatively few instances can they be found these facts i regard as most valuable in the promotion of sound philosophy on this subject in the few cases i have cited there can be no doubt as to the

first to last he acted aa became an honorable highminded and courageous man well deserving the tribute whieh was paid him by lord john rusßel on the possession of these qualities he clearly bad no wish to snatch at power nor whan duty seemed to require it did he shtink from combating difficulties attendant on the attempt to form a cabinet while in his endeavors to do so manifested the caution

unreseuted he is not unappnsed that the country is in danger while he d precates ail idea of defence nothing is easier than the commonpiaces on which his rhetoric each modes of address moreover were calculated in certain quarters to attract applause the applause ot men who are boastful of a spurious liberalitymen to whom all creeds tie alike and who make conscience ol nothing that appertains to religioua endow mentmen who are prepared to take all they can get or to give all from the public purse they may have the power of besowingtuese men will cheer such sentiments as those ot ths able and eloquent lord of netherby but there is s mind in the country more enlightened more judicious and that better understands the teal wants of the time and the exigencies of the nation and to that mind the subject may be safely left of lord aberdeen little need be said hia speech in all iis main points was so identical with that of sir james graham that we have disburdened our columns by passing it over suffice it to aay that his ludship while conducting himself on the whole with proper dignity went a good deal out of his way in lecturing the house and the public on what he was pleased to call persecution his sentiments on the mattet of papal ag gtession were very unsatisfactory and we must say unworthy of a statesman of his years services just pretensions and high position lord john russell it will be seen in s quiet modest and temperate way slated the facts yf the case rela tve to the resumption of the reins of government and manifested as in the circumstances was meet no exultation it appears to have been with him very much a matter of indifference what turn the matter might take although he would be either less or more than a man were he to be unmoved by the event since he must fee it a compliment to himself and a ttibute to the comparative strength of his position however weak that position may be deemed it is stronger thsn that of any of his rivals b truth be has walked over the course e aoe he had strictly speaking no rivalno oorapetitor hia opponents may thwart but they cannot displace him oi by vexatious proceedings dexterous manoeuvres and un prinoipled combination they may as they have already done displace but they cannot succeed him that point is now settled the circumstances lord john is placed in are ofa nature to repress anything like elation sinee his restoration leaves all the facts on wbijch be grounded his resignation untouched ha has no pledge of support from his own liberal friends he has nothing to look for from the protectionists and genuine torries tha peeluea will yield him only a conditional support and the roman catholics are in no impact appeasedtheir bitterness on the contrary is daily gathering intensity he has still to compete with the difficulties ot the papal bill and it is just possible that he may sustain some humiliation in being compelled further to emesculste it and may give tha vatican striumph by withdrawing tboae provisions whieh refer to scotland and irelandfor this step while it would humble himself would have all the effect of a tiiumph to the papal church and in truth make his small bui still less and render what remains scarcely worth contending about or even the labor of framing it into enactment then there is the incometax after all that has bean said in an out of the house mote especially out the unanimous avowal of displeasure msde by the public and the invective or the press will lord john have the hardihood again to briog forward that moa seie unimproved either as to its character or jta duration if so be may rest assured it will minister but little to his popelsiity and his consequent power with the country the qeeeuoo of questions with the british people it the money qaeation then there it the precious budget with its miserable distributions and preposterous provisions is that to be persevered in or is the whole thing to be recast lord john may rest assured the public will not eat their words apologise for their maledictions and look with complacency on that which from the first they hare viewed with scorn no theit mindr will not change will the mind of the government if not then all things will continue as they were and the issue will be universal dissatisfaction distrust and contempt there is another peculiarity in the case which should not be lost sight of lord john must be aware that never was there a crisis so complicated and so protracted respecting a government that excited so little sympathy in the country his lordships historical readings will supply him with examples from the history of george more especially from the earlier parts of it the movement the agitation the excitement the solicitude ias all been confined to the palace and to downingstreet the public have been keen observers of passing events but there has been no very deep anxiety felt and no public manifestations whatever there never was an instance uf so much tumult and agitation at the centre of society combined with so much calm and dignified reserve throughout ihe circumference the silence which has pervaded the whole of this mighty kingdom has been the most significant and full of instruction to the premier it is in vain he looks to the metropolis even to his own constituencies to bristol to birmingham to man chesterliverpool to edinburgh glasgow and the other great hives of humanity tor a single demonstration in hia favor even alter his lordships repealed mreret and after it was trumpeted abroad that lord stanley was in the act of forming a protectionist mtniatry all remained still the unconcern amounted to something like apathy there was no sympathy whatever with the defunct cabinetnri a vrcrd of either pity or protest on their behalf rarely indeed has there been such a manifestation of indifference and such a perfect disregard to the heads of parties and possible combination british banner march we have recently passed through a ministerial crisis as everybody knows of extraordinary length and severity we have been assured by every actor in that most complicated and inconclusive drama that the obstacle to the formation of a strong compact and efficient government was to be found not in the clamor for protection to agriculture nor in the signal miscariage of the ministerial budget nor yet in the illtimed opposition to parliamentary reform but wholly solely and entiiely in the irreconcilable difference ol opinion on the question of papal aggression this was a matter of principle on both sides which no anxiety for the public serviceno expediency however manifestno calls of patriotism however urgent could induce them to compromise armed to the teeth in stubborn and unbending consistency and fortified with his letter to mr howard sir james graham was not to be moved while firm in conscious rectitude and determined to perform his duty faithfully to an insulied crown and an outraged nation lord john russell relied on his letter to the bishop ot durham and was equally inexorable it was a spectacle enough to convince the veriest skeptic of political morality and public principle tosee our premier consent again to undertake the government of the country with the very identical cabinet which he had himself dissolved as incompetent only ten days beforeready to endure any given number of minorities and to run the gauntlet through any species of pailiamentary misadventure rather than betray ihose hopes which he had induced the protestant people of england to repose in him as their champion well the sacrifice has heen made the ministry has been reconstructed in the full strength of its original weakness and parliament and the country naturally look with anxiety to the performance of those pledges for the sake of of which so much inestimable time and invaluable support have been so freely and cheerfully sacrificed how those pledgesfor the sake of which the affairs of this great empire are now intrusted to s government which cannot calculate on a majority in either house of parliament and which has only retained office for the purpose of carrying out the wishes of the people with regard to ihe roman catholic questionhave been redeemed our readers will learn from the speeches delivered by sir george grey and lord john russell in the house of commons it is actually determined to atrike out of the bill which gave so poor and iasdeqate an expression to the public feeling the second clause which renders invalid all deeds executed under the prohibited style and title and the third clause by which all property left or conveyed to persons bearing these illegal titles is forfeited to the crown the bill will therefore be reduced to its first clause imposing a penalty of loo for the assumption of an ecclesiastical title taken from any place in the united kingdom to be aued for by the attorney general the effect of the measure is therefore this lt is unlawful for dr wiseman to cal himself archbishop of westminster and for dr mhale to call himself archbishop of tuam and the goveinment may if it please that is to say if it is disposed to creste a violent disturbance and roost pernicious agitation among the irish roman catholicspros ecute the only party who systematically so offends but it is quite lawful for these persons to coovey or receive property under these illegal titles and all donations or bequests made to or for the yurpose of supporting or endowing these dignities with parliament declaies to be illegal and void will be perfectly void to all intents and purposes we can understand though we do not approve the view of sir james graham and lord aberdeen and can even admit that there was much in it which any statesman intrusted with the responsibilities of office would be willing to be persuaded to adopt we can understand though we do not adopt the policy of lord stanley and can readily admit that for a party which places all its hopes on the result of the next dissolution of parliament to conciliate immediate popularity by atrong declaratory resolutions and to keep alive public interest by the investigations of an interminable commmittee would be a skillful and farsighted stroke of policy but a course of action like that of lord john russell which begins by placing itself at the head of popular enthusiasm and raising it to the highest pitch only to disappoint it by a most inadequate measurewhich makes that inadequate measure the means of perpetuating the weakness of the government and then emasculates that inadequate measure till it becomes as little acceptable to protestant as to romanistsuch policy as this we do not pretend to understand with respect to the budget changes are promised but of their preoise character no intimation has been made london times match bth arrival of the franklin at new york the steamship franklin from havre oth inst arrived at new york about oclock p m satuiday with

oor passage from bssaterre in st kitts to christianstadt in santa cm occupied thirty hours santa crns is one of the most interesting islands of the western world the estates are divided from each other by rows of cocoa nut tree the valleys are well cultivated and covered with luxuriant cane fields the roads are excellent and he landscape everywhere sweet and lovely it exceeds inquiet beauty almost every spot that we could name it is not yet fully the abode of lib ertybut we trust that it soon will be and that the people emancipated from every remnant of boodage will rejoice as free men on the soil that gave them birth santa crus is a colony of denmark and together with the island of st thomas and st john it under the tule of governorgeneral stanaen who gave us a hearty and hospitableweteome invited us to his table and gave us liberty undei bis own hand to visit and inspect th public institutions the records of these islands are kept with scrupulous exactness and their statistics are exceedingly minute the free people of santa crux are the late slaves and still unfree are total there reside in the town o chiistiaustadt which is the seat of government persons in frederickstadt  in the country and on the estates the ptoclamation of freedom to tht slave population is dated rd july ant recites as follows all unfree in the danish west indi islands are from today emancipated o tti mute negro retain for thrs month from date the oe of the hoae provision ground of which they have hitherto been possessed labor is in future to be paid for bj agreement but allowance is to cease the maintenance of old and infirn wheare not able to work is until further determination to be furnished by the late owners the terms of this proclamation ao plain snd unequivocal which bestow unconditional freedom on the slave have since been repealed and resolutions or decrees of a stringent character substituted which leave the predial laborers in a state of bondage they cannot change their masters or place of abode oftenei thar once in the year and their employments not at all the wages they receive are very small and regulated by law their daily tasks are prescribed and they are restricted in locomotion a chief part of the freedom that remains is the permission once in the year when the annual contracts of service expire to give notice to leave their masters but in this case they must find employment elsewhere or buy a passport to leave the land of their birth and quit the island this state of things being only hope deferred not realized makes sick the heart of thoae wheare subject to it and many discontents are the consequence which manifest themaelrej in the prison records for what is termed insubordination and we are sorry to say in occasional acis of incendiarism the authors of which are unknown we attended several of the courts or what we should term the peiiy sessions and paid more than one visit to the principal public prison this prison is among the best constructed in the west indies and contained at the time of our visit forty convictßtwentyseven men and thirteen women there are fiftytwo spacious eels in one long airy coiridor the piison ers men and women were at work in the town under a guard each of them wearing a thick and heavy iron ring on the neck a badge of slavery that ought not to he tolerated thd commitment book was kepi in danish and contained auch records of offences and punishments as the following for leaving the estate fourteen days im piisonment and labor disorderly conducton the estate twelve lashes and two months imprisonment impertinence to the owner two months imprisonment frequent desertion of service a female four months imprisonment stealing canes three months imprisonment there were also many commitments for refusing to work with the record detained till further orders no owner of an estate can inflict corporal punishment on the laborers the police magistrates hold courts in different parts of the island and in chrbtiansiadt these take place three times a week in all cases connected with field labor the sentence i summary and the convict is sent to prison thre is a court of appeal but the laborers seldom resort to it the chief magistrate of police spoke well of the peasantry and expressed hia belief that the present intermediate system would soon give way to unconditional freedom as at first proclaimed a similar statement was made by a colonel of artillery who sat near us when we dined at the governors table we heaitly wish this righteous and oeneficial result having been introduced by the governor to a few of the principal planters we received invitations to make a tour of the island and to visit some of the eaatea which we were glad to accept as without such permission we could dot have ventured inio a single cabin many of the houses of the unfree are much better in appearance than those of the old slave villages in our own colonies they ate generally built of stone shingled over with wood and being ananged in rows have an appearance of respectability and comfort the arangs ments within of some of the beat of them are pretty good the people who inhabit these dwellings have a downcast and timid look very different from that of the laboiers of our own colonies their masters with very few exceptions were evidently unwilling that we should enter into any conversation with them on their circumstances which we could have done freely if left to ourselves as the negro dutch dialect once common to the island has almost disappeared and english is commonly spoken this is also the language of the pulpit and the schools in passing through the country and among the estates we saw numerous large groups of men and women working in the fields under a driver exactly as it was in the days of sla verywith this difference only that no driver can use a whip such of the laborors as we met in the corners of fields or at the gates by the readside or driving cattle on the road seemed naif afraid to converse with ua lest they should be detected but we learned from some of them what they thought ol their present condition which we found lobe unsatisfactory to them during two days of the week out of the seven they are partially disenhralled the saturday market is a time to many of them of joy and freedom and the sabbath brings with it to most the blessings of teat and public worship itis a gratifying sight to witness as we did numerous bands repairing from the estates on the first day of the week to iheir respective places of public worship habited io their holiday dresses the women bearing parasols which seem quite a common appendage and some of the men more favored by their masters than the rest riding on horseback with perhaps a boy or a girl and sometimes a woman taking hold of the horses tail for the benefit of a kindly and social drag we only needed to believe that they were teally free to rejoice in aueb a spectacle the sabbath achoolt are well attended by both children and adults the day schools not quite so well as during ths latter period of slavery when masters were compelled io send all children of a certain aget the district school the government centralize overlooks and directs every movement of the common people it judged education to be a benefit to the state and has not omitted to make some provision for it there are eight public district schools for the gratuitous education of tbs young and two lancasterian schools in frederickstadt the whole of which are supported at an annual cost from to there ire also in ths island two danish schoos and fourteen private schools the total of hildten of all cissea under instruction is tbs children of the peasantry who eeetve education are meetly confioej toi hose of a very early age and this is given daring a very limited period of tbe day we consder he schools in santa cruz to bein all respects much less satisfactory than inmost of the british colonies the lutheran church has its ministers who preach in the danish language and the english and american episcopalians have a minister in cbristiaustadt the great body of the com tnun peole attended the moravian chapels the roman catholics have a handsome edi hoe in the capital the planters i santa ciuz contains sugar estates whi h snake an avesage aunual amount of sugar of hogsheads each it has thirty cattle or stock estates chiefly in pasture the number of resident proprietors is sixty s seven of nonresidents twentyseven the absentee proprietors pay a duty to the govern tnent of five per

the import duty levied in denmark is on augar from santa cruz eightynine cents per cwt on foreign sugars one tlollat lortycenu these differences with twenty cents on the bound duties making in all p about s per cwt give an advantage to the colonists in tbe home market and euablo them to pay more easily the heavy colonial taxation to which they are subject in no part u the west indies that we visited are the augar estates in genera so handsome and complete as in santa cruz and nowhere is a better cummodity produced the value of property is much reduced owing to tbe tjge price ot sugar in europe from tne suspense in which the plsateis remain ss to the period ol complete emancipation we visaed two estates adjoining each other that came into the bauds of the present proprietors ss a mortgage on a bond of eight years ago the sum of was otiered lor them and retused the present market value is believed not to exceed inone part of the island an arrangement was pointed out to us by which the coal of pro during sugar had been much lessened a planter possessing large capital and having several properties ot his own or leased to hnn so tar improved the works on one ot the estates as to make them sufficient fur the manufacture of the canes grown on the whole ot course there are many planters whose meaus do not enable them thus to economize supervision aud labor the operation of

colony n justice be dune to the people the ctup ol ttje first year of transition from slavery to cumpaiauve freedom was hogsheads ot fifteen cwt each which at t sieiling per hogshead as the nett price

produced uudei unlavoiable circumstances in a year ot transition aud change bat the average produce of the colony is hogsheads so that present aud future profits may be estimated as much higher yv cannot but think that the planters of santa cruz are in general doing well aud we hope that a bngnter and better day is dawning un the peasantry whilst we are confident that then condition is greatly unpioved since a partial emancipation has been cun erred upon them we see plainly that they are yet in a state ol serfage and only nominally free itis true that no puuishments can be summarily mflcied by owners or overseers and that wages are pard lor labor performed the children ate or are required to be sent to school tor a limited peiiud and the sick and i aged may have their wants moderately supplied but the people have no power to change then masters or occupation at pleasures and they are compelled to work ingangs in t j e field where the women are more in number than the men they are watched over and stimulated to labor by dn v r s who construe what they call a hard wod into impertinencea gr ate offence und er any form of slaveryand for which the ffender is not unfrequently harassed by an appeal to the magistrate these things are deeply trying to human nature infuse discontent and ate unsafe to the body politic it was our intention to have annexed the regulations to which the former slaves are i subjected but we find them too long for inser non they would we think throw little light on the condition of the peasanly beyond that already given the statistics of the colony show a large decrease in the export of sugar as compared with the early part of the present century and a great falling off of the laboring population arising from the ex cess of deaths over births during the period of slavery african slavetrade the documents communicated by the president to the senate on the th of december in relation to the traffio in slaves in brazil under the american flag have been made public we give a buef statement of the origin of the troubles and the result of the investigations instituted at rio janeiro the information was transmitted to the united states government by the american minister at rio mr tod from whose statement it appears that the infamous traffic is still carried on to a great extent not jess than negtoss have been imported into brazil

review of the rev dr lords eer mon in favor of the american human game law mr thompson arrived in lockport from rochester by way of buffalo and the niagara friu the afternoon of the previous day and in the evening addroased the young mens association he lectured on the subject of british india to one of the largest and most respectable audiences ever assembled on a similar occasion the convention assembled at a mand being called to order mr price formerly of connecticut and a warm friend of the american antislavery society was appointed piesident several gentlemen vice presidents and mr a l spalding and others secretaries mr s s foster then delivered a clear and effective speech on the present position and aspects of the antislavery cause and the duties devolving on the friends of emancipation at the present cusis he was followed by mrs foster who moved the appointment of a finance committee to obtain funds in aid of the american society the appointment was opposed by a member of the convention on the ground that he and others did not consider that the american society was the best antislavery organization for the overthrow of slavery in this country this brought up mr thompson who after expressing the pleasure he felt at being present proceeded to review the proceedings of the american antislavery society from its formation in down to the present time sixteen years ago it was his honor to be appointed the unpaid agent of that society he had watched iis course through the long interval that had elapsed since his first connection with it and was prepared to affirm that no society had ever more faithfully acted up to its original constitution or more faithfully redeemed the pledges with which it begun ns work where he left it in there he bad found it in all around were strewed the wrecks of other organizations that in rivalry competition or opposition and hostility had come into existence but there stood the american societyits piinciples the same its doctrine the sameits measures the same its great and gloiious object still the same with the same broad catholic unsectarian worldwide platformand thank god with many of the same men and women upon it with whom it had been his honor and his glory to suffer in years past nobly had it fulfille the promise of its infancy and he mr thompson believed it was the organization ordained to rid araeiica and the world of the institution of slaveiy then the object ol sickening contemplation cannot said he conceive of an abolitionist who is not whether he calls himself one or not a part and parcel of the american antislavery society foi that society embodies in its constitution and creed whatever makes abolitionism as well might a man say i am a presbyterian or a baptist or an episcopalian or a methodist but lam not a christian what is a baptist without christianity and what is a liberty party man or a free soiler oi a seward whig without the soul and sentiments of an american society abolitionist if an honest abolitionist at allif worthy ot the nameif he be doing anything on right principles to advance the overthrow of slaveryhe must of necessity be an abolitionist of the american antislavery society type as well might one say ill be a man but i will have but one arm or one eye or dispense with my heart my lungs or my brain assay ill be an abolitionist and be less than what the coustitutioo of the american antislavery society requires him to be tell me what less you desire to be in this cause than what that society would have you be and i will tell you precisely what you lack to ceme up to the standard of a genuine and perfect abolitionist it is well for us on an occasion like this to look st the mighty gigantic and sublime works we have set before us if we would outgrow our own dwarfish dimensions and narrow and sectarian prejudices we should spend our time in surveying the stupendous objects we are seeking to achieve there is nothing little about this cause

pertinent observations and was followed by mr foster who submitted a resolution declaring the work of the abolitionists to bethe rectification of public sentiment rather than the building up of political patties he was succeeded by the rev w johnson who took a different view of the subject mrs foster and others took part in the discussion which was of a desultory character the further

national coaveatioa gentlemen saw in the north star a call emanating from you for a national convention of colored freeman to assemble ia buffalo in september next for this the great body of our people throughout the country ate unprepared the subject that must necessarily be brought before them being of such magnitude that it abooid have been kept before their minds at least one year previous to the year of meeting but in cases of emergency something sbuuld be done as speedily as possible aod you will readily concede that this should enlist the best informed snd most mature and prudentminded men among us there are no people who ever have succeeded in any great undertaking without the counsel and deliberation first of the intelligent of that people and in order to effect anything we must pursue the very same course whatever may be our notions ofmass meetings and conventions of the people should such m meeting take place certain i am that it would only be a national convention in name representing a part of ohio a small part of michigan and a few persons from the extreme western part of new york but nothing more since having just returned from the east where i have spent the winter i can safely say that in that quarter they are entfrely unprepared for it and will not concur but knowing you gentlemen by reputation and personally and believing that you would do nothing that would not promote the welfare of the people i would say that unless a special gathering of the most intelligent among our best men could be had which must be admitted is next to impossible any other attempt must prove an entire failure will you gentlemen be so generous as to withold any aiguinent at present in favor of a national convention until each of you shall reeeive a

acknowledgment to several friends for their liberal contributions and their sincere thanks foi the patronage received during the fair the association aware that a number of fairs had been held during the winter entered upon their duty as gleaners in the field and but for the important object for which they weie laboring might have expected to reap the gleaneis scanty harvest but the object being one in which every friend of humanity should engage they fell encouraged to believe that although a more convenient season might have been selected yet in consequence of the object they would receive agood share of public patronage and they are happy to state that their expectations have been realized notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather which attended them during the fait the gross receipts of the fair were seven hundred dollars thirtyone cents expenses four hundred and eight dollars six cents balance placed in the hands of the committee of thirteen two hundred and ninty two dollars twentyfive cents it would have afforded the association great pleasure to have placed in the hands of the committee double the amount presented to assist them in carrying out their praiseworthy object but the very heavy expenses ot the fair would not enable them to do more they hope though small the sum it will be successful in assisting some poor bondman or bondwoman to escape

such indignities as the virtue and pride of civilized women resents and resists even at the peril of life she repelled the advances of the bestial monster yielding neither to threats or disgusting importunities when he felled her to the earth an outrage too abhorrent for mentionan outrage that stirs to unappeasable indignation evety manly and sympathetic feeling in the human breast was then

incompliance with their swum duty protested against the illegality of the act all were eager for the iosiaui and signal punishment of the worse than murdeier accordingly he was borne to a tree chained to it and surrounded with light and other wood it is worthy of remaik that the slaves present evinced commendable abhorrence of the crime and the criminal and assisted with alacrity in his punishment we will not dwell upon the horrors of the monsteis death scene nor do we deem it necessary to utter a word extenuaiive of the violation of law which the punishment involved it was a lawless act but who will say it was not jusi who will urge that they under the same cilcumstances would have acted in a different manner never have we been and we trust never shall we be the abettor of mobs or the advocate of mob law in the instance under consideration however we have no censures to indulge but in simple justice we would observe that those who participated in burning the negro in pom of

in pulling down everything erected by those who have gone before if you have read the debates of the constitutional convention and if you have you would be a curiosity in these parts you will have seen the destructive radicalism of the leaders of the locofoco party in this state had they succeeded they would have given us a constitution whose defeat would have been certain this was only prevented by the votes of a few moderate men of their own party and who for their independence have been denounced without measure our new senator never having filled the sounding trump of fame demands some notice at out hands he was born at west springfield mass oct ad and removed to ohio in the fall of settling in the county of ashtabula in he wttpt to the state of newyork  l snrino of alter his return he still continued to teach and at the shme time pursued his law studies in the office of elisha whittlesey until he was admitted to the bar in he formed a copartnership with mr giddings wh eh continued until in the same fall he was elected to the senate of ohio and there signalized himself bv a report and speech against the annexation of texas he was nominated by the whigs for the senate but was defeated by tho silver grays of that day on the ground that he was too much of an antislavery man in he triumphed over all opposition and was again returned to the senate where he made a most cogent speech against the iniquitous black laws to long a disgrace to our statutebook at the expiration of his term he refused to serve again and was elected judge borne two years since which office he fills with ability and dignity lam informed that heis for land kefoim in favor of homestead exemption and will i have no doubt be lound fighting shoulder to shoulder with those few philanthropists in the senate who are urging forwatd the firstnamed great measure upon the question of the odious fugitive law he is all we could desire but here i prefer he should speak far himself and give you a part of a speech made by him last fall at ravenna and which was published at the time in the ravenna star judge wade fairly electrified the audience by the earnestness and energy with which he denounced the fugitive law and all who had a part in inflicting it upon us he said he had always been a wingwas still a whigbut there were consideiations which rose far above parly and party influences and he for one was prepared to unite with any men or any party in opposition to this law he condemned in the strongest terms w higs and democrats who aided in the passage of the law by their votes or by dodging rebuked with energy and spirit both fillmore and crittenden and visited daniel webster with the most withering denunciations he said the law bristling like a porcupine with pains and penalties was the most in famous enactment known to the statute books of this country arid such as even the corrupt governments of the old world could not pass without driving their people to revolution fot himself regardless of fines and imprisonment if called upen he would grant to the fugitive slave the writ of habeas corpus the cause of freedom has no firmer friend in ohio than b f

barbadaes antislavery society held on the lh of january the following resolutions with reference to the fugitive slave law were adopted i that in the opinion of this committee the maintenance of slavery is repugnant to the divine law unjust to the slaves held in bondage dangerous to the community in which the system is upheld and demoralizing the parties claiming pioperty in their fellowmen that the legislation of ihe united states government on the question of slavery and the horrors perpetrated under the protection of that legislation demand the indignant and unqualified reprobation ol the civilized world that the fugitive slate bill recently enacted by the united stales government by which the condition of the slaves and freecolored people in all ihe stales is rendered intolerablethe lives of theone placed at the mercy of reckless men and the liberty of he other subject to the captice of prejudiced and covetous menhunters is such an outrage upon humanity and violation of every moral obligation as cannot fail to drawdown the just indignation of christian men in all parts of the world tint the colored population of the united states free and slave are entitled lo the lively sympathy and solace of the friends of freedom everywhere and that it is the earnest desire of this committee that the efforts making to obtain the repeal of the iniquitous fugitive slave bill may soon be crowned with success that the committee hope not only for the repeal of this law but for the abolition of the disgraceful and unjust practice which obtains in the slave states of confining in prison natives of this and other countries arriving therein on account of the accident of complexion and of all the enactments by which the abominible institution is main tained that with the view of demonstrating our sympathy and solace with the colored population of the united stales public meetings be held in the city nod such of the rural parishes as may be practicable

northern cities who run at the sound of a southerners footstep for fear of bing unable to prove their freedom there cannot be a doubt and to this circumstance is owiug the etroneous impression which

secretary emeline bastien letter from geo thompson rochester march mt dear garrison though never so briefly must write you from tins beautiful city would you were by my eide instead of being five hundred miles away all circumstances considered have been more successful here than in any other place came with the most serious apprehensions ofa disturbance but prepared to abide tbs worst that might happen the advertiser a daily paper of politics has tor some time been exhib ing a degree of superhuman depravity and sanguinary malevolence which i have never seen exceeded even in the city of new york its series of venomous attacks continued down to yos tsrday as witness the enclosed but mark the result an audience of more than a thousand as respectable and intelligent persons as i ever addressed in my life assembled in the beautiful and spacious building called corinthian hall to listen to a lecture from me on british reform the hour was three and all here admit that such an audience at that time of day was equal to twice that number in the evening my reception on rising was respectful and no more with the exception of the cheers given me by the friends of tbe antislavery cause i felt that i had to contend with prejudice and suspicion i craved and obtained permission to depart from the usual course and to oner some remarks personal to myself q how did tbe scowl of suspicion give place to the smile of satistaction and confidence how rapidly the frostwork melted before a simple and unvarnished statement of my real opinions principles and designs how the cheers from being faint and few became long loud and universal never in my existence did i behold more candor and magnanimity displayed than was shown by the noble citizens of rochester yesterday indeed they ecmed delighted to be convinced of the utter and wilful falsehood of tae state menu with which they have been flooded for weeks the intimition that i hoped to be able to address them again and again was received with peal upon peal of applause my lecture concluded i was for half an hour prevented from putting on my overcoat by the hands stretched forth to grasp mine and many were the confessions of those who embraced me most warmly that they had come prepared to have the prejudices which existed against me in their own minds justified and confirmed own it was a severe trial to my fortitude to hear tbe reception given me for which have to thank the laborious calumniator who had been so jong forging from the materials ol a diseased mind the lies which he thought would be sufficient to destroy me how great is the humiliation of the advertiser for in addition to vituperation and slander he was prophetic and when forced to draw back from direct incentives to violence augured that i should be treated with silent contempt but lo the audience though each paid an admission fee was tbe larges ever known at such a time ol meeting and for its characteryou will see from tbe account of the rochester daily democrat which i send you that a more respectable and intelligent audience than that which assembled there yesterday has seldom been convened while to add to the falsification of the oracle it was tbe most enthusiastic audience have appeared before since it was my honorand privilege to sit by you in cochi tuate hall boston who would not be on tbe side of truth right and justice when such are the triumphs which may be won in their cause my progress thus lar has been truly gratifying to the abolitionists of tbe state of new york i tender my warmest thinks for their unbounded hospitality to tbe latest day i live shall bear upon my heart the recollection of their goodness they have not been simply kindthey have been trusting and fraternal what can the politi ciaas of this country be thinking about rare not tbe thousands who have hard me gladlywho have greeted my sentiments with vociferous cheersamer icans are they not citisens are they not of as much worth as an equal number of other inhabitants of these states are not their opinions as much entitled to respect at the opinions ol others o if could reach the statesmen of america would warn them u tine against despising tba men and women who have engaged in d intern in ating the principles of christianity upon the subject of slavery i hare just seen the advertiser of today and send you a copy not one word of yesterdays lecture i have written amidst much interruption and must new close adieu my dear friend try and join me at syracuse on my return from the west i will endeavor to write to you more frequently our antislavery convention commences to morrow morning everywhere and to the end yours unalterably geo thompson the world motes on so thought we as returning just now from the funeral of a friend we fell once more into the current of busy life the world knows nothing of our loss the world cares nothing for our grief the world is full of life and motion it cannot atay for death the very hearse as it moved slowly through the streets was jostled by the stage the wagon the pleasure carriage in their impatient haste the funeral procession crossing the great thoroughfare was broken to lei pass the vehicles of trade and men hurrying to business the world moves on he seemed to be worth something to the world a man nf nnhu form and mienthey must have marked him on the street these many years aman of wise counsels of high integrity of large benevolencethey must have prized him in the intercourse of life do they know that he is dead do they care that he is dead why do not they pause to think of it in the country village the death of such a man would throw a gloom over every dwelling labor would stand still and all the population would come as mourners to his grave and then go home sadly to feel his loss here the family circle a tew tried friends a few brethren of the church have gathered at his funeral but even tbe neighbors are not ther and there is no diminution of the moving throng in tbe street the scriptures are read words of comfort are spokeu prayer is offered but all amid the din of carts and bells and cries and the tramp of hurrying feet sounding up through the windows and when we come out theie is no sign of change no gloom upon the houses no solemn stillness in the air no shock or scar on the worlds brow but did not the world feel that shock the stroke that laid him low in his prime was like the feeling of an oak then the forest resounds the neighboring trees sway to and fro with the concussion and winds rush in to fill the chasm but in this great dense forest of life there is hardly a sensation as one and another alls the vine that clung to the oak is trailed an the ground and the young saplings quiver a few surrounding trees bow their heads to the blattbut straigthway errect them againand the forest seems as thick and sturdy as ever even the executive head of the nation falls almost without a shock the wheels of government pause but for a moment a new set of hands are summoned to the vacant posts and everything moves on as before man dies but the world moves on life hurries on we feel it at this moment when inclination would dispose us to quiet meditation on the loss of a friend but parish press and pulpit demand that we shall work and work we must while life lasts it is well that this is so life has a present interest its value does not lie simply in its relation to death and the future while we must feel the pressure of the world to come if we would ennoble life to its just aim and while we should be uplifted and borne along by the infinite and tbe eternal yet we cannot live in heaven before our time nor should we be always preparing to die as our distinctive and absorbing occupation we are living men and are placed iu this world to live life is an earnest work and as the world moves on we wust move with it and seek to guide its energy and its progress to high and holy ends our savior prayed not that his disciples should be taken out ot the world but that they should be kept from the evil and while in the world they must finish the work he has given them to do for this the thought of death and the frequent and vivid contemplation of the future will give hem faith and diligence and patience but life must not wait for death the world moves on it must move on although men die yet the world feels its losses though it does not stop to notice them every good man taken out of it is a loss the church will feel tbe loss the world will feel the loss of the good man we have buried today for a while at least some interests will not do so well without him his prayers will be a want his charities will be a want his counsels will be a want his example will be a want not only in his immediate circle but also in tbe everwidening i circles that swell out from that that till lost on the remotest shores of time though the tide of life by its mighty pressure overbears a single death yet that death makes a ripple on its surface disturbs discolors perhaps divides the stream the good mans death is felt till others take hia place and fulfil bis work neither does the world move on without him whom it has lost his memory lives his influence lives his work follows him and these all are added to the grand sum of influences that are shaping this worlds character and destiny the world is made up not merely of those at anyone moment upon its stage but of all he past interblendiog with their thoughts and feelings and acts and giving its impress to the present and its course lo the future man is not born into this world merely to die out of it ii he lives to any purpose he still lives here after death the world moves on as if without him yet it moves on by and through his influence with what a sanctity does this invest our bis there is perversion often in tbe wellmeant counsel live each day as if it were your last rather live each day as it you were to last knowing that what you do and are will last when you are gone we are to live and not to die daily and living rightly we shall be always ready to die death shall then bring to us a twofold life a life of purity and bliss in heaven and a life of influence and power still on earth the friend we this day buried ie not dead they carried him away to the quiet village which was his summer retreat and there they laid him in the bare and stiffened earth the city knows not his resting place but soon the fresh grass will spring and flowers will bloom and trees will blossom in that lone churchyard and so will virtue truth and holiness spring up the richer from his grave thus will th actions of the just rime sweet end blossom in the duel we lately heard an address to children commended because the speaker talked to them not as if he thought they were at once to die but as if he expected them to live and to accomplish some thing in life so should we in the high christian sense live while we may and die when god calls us in life or death discharging the duty of the hour this was the high moral significance of that strange answer of christ to him who would go home and bury his fathers let the dead bury their dead follow thou me thu arta living man and hast the work of life to do the world moves on and my cause must not be retarded nor thy salvation hindored by offices of respect and kindness to the dead or by unavailing grief while the battle rpjzes fighting mn must not stop to pick up tbw slain the world moves on the forces of steam and electricity new drive its wheels faster and faster all things fly yet the world and all that it contains shall have an end its marts shall be deserted its bustle and clamor shall cease and all be silent as the grave but in this world moving on with it isa kingdom that shall have no end that kingdom hastens to its glorious consummation though men die christss cause moves on how grand has beeu its march since first apostles suffered and martyrs died and they that are of this kingdom shall live and reign with it when time and earth shall cease to move lndependent eight thousand christians sentenced to death tho following is a letter from mr t burbyer to the rev d griffith mauritius oct dear sirmy present object in writting is to inform you of the news from madagascar and the events that have lately occured at tenanarivo you know that the prince rakooln tahindry radama son of the queen ranavolo and heir presumptive to the throne of ankovas has become the powerful protector ofthe christians under persecution at imirena in june last made a voyage to the coast of madagascar on some affairs which required my presence and took advantage of the opportauity to obtain intelligence of the christians at tenanarivo i returned a fortnight ago from this voyage in the frigate castor commodore c rynil the information i obtained through letters from imirena is as followseight thousand christians being assembled together one even in different places engaged in religious exercises were all arrested and condemned to death eighteen of them had already been executed when all the rest found the means of escape fled to the palace of the prince and implored his protection the prince toook them under his care the fact having come to the knowledge ofthe queen she ordered her grand marshal and first minister rainiharo to convey her orders to the prince her son to surrender all these christians for execution the grand marshal proceeded to intimate this to the prince who refused to obey it declaring that the christians were under his protection and that if any one had the hardihood to force his palace with a view to their seizure he would put him instantly to death high words then took place between the prince and the grand marshal the latter intimating to the former that he was acting in open rebellion to the queen hia mother the prince becoming impatient and having strong motives for resentment against the grand marshal drew his sword and aimed a blow at his head it struck him on one side of tho head and cut off one of his ears tbe generals present came to the rescue ofthe grand marshal as the prince was about to put an end to bira when the queen heard of what had taken place she quashed the whole affair fearing a revolution at imirena for she knows that all the ankova youth are partisans of the prince and that he is beloved by all the people and the army the christians are now insafety and assemble themselves together in the evening the government shutting its eyes upon everything rainiharo trembles bofore the prince the young prince who has completed his st year and who has been brought up by general ratsihambe his governor promises to establish his throne as it was under the late king radama his father he has been several times at the prayer meetings of the christians and makes every effort to comfort them god be praised the cause of christ is not lost in madagascar and we shall shortly see this spiritual harvest produce abundant fruit to tbe divine glory i have sent the report of my voyage to the missionary society through the medium of my pastor mr le brun and have also written to the rev j j freeman on the subject had not the pleasure of meeting mr freeman here he having left the very day of my arrival which i much regret he will probably receive my report and letter in london i hope through the divine goodness to make another voyage to madagascar it has become very difficult to get access to the porta of the queen since in she drove away all tbe foreign merchants and put an end to all trade with the country we can only hope therefore the way will be opened as soon as tbe prince her son shall ascend the throne after bis mothers deathperthshire dvriiser tcj the following resolutiona were adopted at the recent convention o the western new york antislavery society held in corinthien hell resolved that in the person of the taest abased degraded mutilated and dejected slave in our land we recognize a man and a brother a being made in tbe image of god to whom weare bound by all the ties of human brotherhood and by all the obligations of a common paternity resolved that the right of everyman to his own body is derived irom god and that this right is rendered selfevident in the facts of human nature and is no more to be annihilated by human laws than are the unalterable purposes of god himself resolved that they who teach obedience to the fugitive slave lawwhile they admit that the law is unjust cruel and disgraceful prove themselves destitute ot moral principle if not of moral sense and they are to be ranked with the hardened and obdurate creatures who for a few paltry dollars will perform the disgusting office of slave catcher to the slaveholder resolved that freedom of speech the palladium of libertythe shield of tho weakthe hope of the oppressed and the terror of tyrants is in the language of daniel webster in his better days a homebred righta fireside privilege the loss of which is the first condition of the enslavement of a free people resolved that in the recent efforts of the advertiser newspaper to subject the exejpiee of this right to the peril of moltvlblence we see another evidence of the allcontrolling power of slavery and the utter worthlessness of names as indicating the character of men and of parties since while professing to be a democratic journal contending for the largest liberty the advertiser would subject freedom of speech to more galling bonds and perils than any that environ that most sacred right in the most despotic countries on the globe resolved that the most indignant and telling rebuke which could be administered to that profligate sheet for its base and scurrilous attacks upon the eloquent and philanthropic thompson has already been administered by the orderly decorous and cordial reception which that distinguished gentleman has received at the hands of our most respectable citizens within the walls of corinthian hall resolved that we commend the good sense and the good disposition of the laboring men of this city which led to treat with disdain and contempt the dastardly appeals of the editor of the advertiser and that we thank them for rolling hack the odium upon the recreant editor in question which had been cunningly and malignantly prepared for themselves resolved that we do not onlv approve but that we do most warmly applaud the conduct of the noble men who rescued in a peaceful manner shadrnck simms and so far from regarding them as mobocrats are we that we look upon them as the conservatori of law and order in boston against the great national mob headed by millard fillmore resolved that american slavery necessarily involves the crimes of theft robbery and murder and that it oughl to be immediately and unconditionally abolished resolved that there are no highet laws than these thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart anc thy neighbor as thyself resolved that we regard tie fugitive slave law of the las congress aa conspiracy against the liberties ol our country which ought to be resistec at all property and life by all who love god and revere the memories of our revolutionary fathers switzerlandthe refugee question the federal council of switzerland has in consequence of the repeated remonstrance of the german powers just abolished the absolute obligation imposed in july on the various cantons to receive political refugees it has moreover maintained the decrees relative to the expulsion or transmission of refugees into the interior these resolutions are communicated to the cantons by proclamation dated berne the th ult this document explains that after the events of and switzerland was obliged from its position and from the duties of humanity to receive a vast number of fugitives of different nations and to take measures for distributing them among the cantons but the time has now arrived at which the cantons can be relieved of this burden and allowed their old privilege of dealing as they please with refugees it says moreover that the french government has offered to convey to england or america refugees who may not be able to return to their own countries under these circumstances it observes that the cantons many make free use of the right of expelling refugees without subjecting themselves to the charge of severity in july the number of refugees under the general control of the confederation was but by pardons expulsions and voluntary departures it has been reduced to  the swiss journals state that a sanguinary conflict had just taken place at matten in the district of interlacken between the troops and a band of insurgent in the
