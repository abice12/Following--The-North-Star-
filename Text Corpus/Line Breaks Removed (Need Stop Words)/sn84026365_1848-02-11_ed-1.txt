henry clay and african colonization we have given a sketch of the pro ceedings of the american colonization society at its late annual meeting ami of the speech ofllenry clay delivered cor the occasion as reported by tho washington correspondent of the now york journal of commerce though the representatives hall was obtained tor the meeting and an immense throng tilled every part of it it is frankly acknowledged by the reporter that it was not owing to the slightest interest lelt either in the society or its object but simple a desire to hear mr c lay he suvs nobodv seciued to care a button for the civilization of africa no one cared about mr clay as president of the colonization society the colonization cause bad little to do with this crowded auditory it was a philanthropic masquerade it appears that the arch kentucky compromiser and the haughty despiser of the colored race why with his brow of brass and adamantine heart should he not hate those whom he has so brutally despoiled was received with an enthusiasm closely bordering on insanity the cheers were deafening and multitudinous it is a melancholy illustration of the deep moral degradation of tho american people generally had they who joined in these profligate outbursts had any moral v ision or any fear t god or regard for man in their hearts instead of giving mr clay their shouts of approbation they would have listened to his despicable and inhuman speech with feelings of indignation and horror they would have seen in him the enemy of bis country and bis race they would lave substituted groans for cheers and tlie strongest e mdeiunation for the loudest praise his eloquent sorcery would have had no power over them but a judicial blindness wan upon them so that tliev could discern nothing t he wav of peace they know not ant there is no judgment in their goings what though mr clay is a ilavcholdei and one of the strongest props ot tin accursed slave system what though h has due more than any other inun it the nation t crush aud manacle uu in olft ni rare what though u reguri to three millions of people at the south he has atimlv joined to take from then every right to place them utterly beyond the protection of the law to forci them to live without marriage to deprive them of all mental and mora culture to reduce them as near to tin level of the brute creation as possible to place them und r the lash of tin sinvedrivers devoid of all feelings o humanity to make them marketahl commodities along with cattle anc swine what though he scouts the doctrine f the declaration of independence that all men are born equal ant endowed with an inalienable right it libertyand also the doctrine of thr new testament that god hath inadt of om iiinoti all nations of menthe north star what though he is conspiring for tbej banishment of the free colored inhabitant to benighted on the ground that they haie no right to remain here and that they can never be elevated in tho lnited states all this but adds to the jkipular enthusiasm at bis presence this wholesale and unmitigated villany only increases his popu  larity he is that same old coon v j lie is harry of the west he is the eloquent orator the distinguished statesman the bright particular star of the country alas for the man alas for the people in the new york herald is a much more full report of the mr clays speech than in the journal of commerce when mr clay rose he was received with nine times nine which were repeated indeed we never j heard a speake greeted by such tre meridous applause and although it was evident that at leant half of those present were there merely for fun the contagion seemed infectious and all screamed outa w elcome at the top of their voices l t us sce how well he is entitled to such applause of the colonization society he says i far was it from the intention of the gentlemen who founded the society to j deprive any of their property to place i it in any danger or affect it in any aeveree whatever exactly so their object was to expatriate those whose presence wits disagreeable to them and to give increased security and value to slave property of this no candid man who has studied the doctrines and measures of the society can entertain a doubt we did not stop says mr clay to enquire whether slavery was right or wrong trueand for the allsuffi cient reason that if they had done so they might peradventure have been found guilty of the meanest kind of robbery and of the most cruel oppression they shunned that inquiry because they knew that their hands were stained with blood and that their gold and silver were cankered but there w r as no need of stopping to settle that question what is selfevident cannot be doubtful the witness was in the breast of every one of these baseconspir atois against the peace and liberty of those who haying been delivered from the prisonhouse of slavery are struggling to reach a more elevated position and not in vain we merely considered the fact continues mr clay that black peot pie could not live in a state of equality i with w hite people and upon that fact we acted why can they not so live pipb ihrn th

locks ami dark complexion oumot alter natures claim sdi is mac differ ilit aftortiuii dwells in black and white the same the real truth is mr clay and his expatriating associates found in the land all prevalent and all powerful a vulgar unnatural malevolent fero cions prejudice against the free colored not against the slave population and instead of rebuking it as a daring impeachment of the wisdom and goodness of god and a flagrant libel upon mans nature they avowed themselves to he animated by itjustified and advocated it as a natural instinctexcited it w here it was latent and created it where it it did not existand proclaimed the impossibility of the colored people being either free or happy while they remained in this christian country reiterating the falsehood upon all occasions and inducing almost every pulpit and press in the land to reecho it they produced a highly malignant state of mind towards the objects of their pseudo benevolence and left nothing undone to make them a wretched and degraded class in every state in the union especially at the south j it is as sound and sensible a proposition to say that fat people cannot live i with lean or that tall people cannot i live with short people in a state of equality as that persons of opposite complexion cannot do so the con trust is not greater and in fuct not more unpleasant iu one case than in the other all nature difkieuce makes ail natures peace it mr clay is offended at the sight ofa black skin why does he keep slaves around himon his plantation in his kitchen and even in his parlor why has he during the thirtvonc years of hi support of the colonization society not emancipated a single slave in order i to procure for him liberty and equality iu liberia and to get rid of a nuisancer if tho practice of slaveholding had not vulgarized his iniud and destroyed his moral sense he would readily perceive ibis simple truthl hut every man is entitled to be treated as a man whatever may be his bulk height or complexion and that the rights of all are equalbut we cannot find room this week for all that we have written iu review of this prejudice exciting nau bating speech j from ilir libentur livrouusv ismdked i j as precious a specimen of pharisaical hypocrisy and priestly insolence as flic age lias presented may be found on our last page copied from the vermont chronicle into the new england f puritan with comments the longi faced editors of these devout papers discovered by its date to the grief of their pious souls that the letter of inquiry addressed by mr palfrey to mr winthrop iu regard to the course the latter would pursue as speaker of the house of representatives respecting slavery and liewar was written on right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren the holjr sabbath alias the first day of the week vigilant watchmen upon the walls of cant without a moments delay they hare sounded the alarm as though a giant enemy ofj god had made his appearance and committed the worst cnmc in the long category of human transgressions as though everything sacred in heaven iand precious on earth was now in imminent peril as though all christenj dom should be roused to prevent the j repetition of an act so flagrant are there not six days on which a man may j write letters the insolence of all this is seen in the factfirst that there is no scriptural authority whatever either for designating or observing the first day of the week as a sabbath secondly that mr palfrey is not a believer in the lioliness of any day as above another but honors every dayconsequently lie has done nothing which he regards as inconsistent with christianity and thirdly that conceding all that the puritan and chronicle claim on the score of sanctity for the first day of the week the conduct of mr palfrey was worthy of the day and as erm mendable as were the acts of jesus in healing the sick on the sabbath which excited such a clamor among those pattern knaves the jewish scribes and pharisees it is law ful to do well on the sabbath said jesus meeting his malicious accusers on their own ground and if a sheep falling on that day into a pit may without any breach of the commandment be lifted out then it cannot be wrong to aid a suffering man the object of mr palfrey in writing his letter to mr winthrop was to stop the effusion of blood in mexico and to extricate as far as practicable three millions of iiis countrymen who had fallen into the pit of slavery avliat could be more beneficent and holy or more pleasing in the sight of godi now r we verily believe that it is be j cause lie had this good object in view j and is in sympathy with the antislaver movement that the editors of the puritan and chronicle have singled him out as one deserving of special reprobation no marvel that accused by such hypocrites jesus looked round on them with anger holy indignation being grieved for the hardness of their heaits if mr palfrey had signalized himself by his hostility to the humane and reformatory spirit of the age neither the puritan nor chronicle would have taken any notice of any letter he might have written on the j lords day s providing it had no reference to the cause of suffering humanity but he has had slaves bequeathed to him and refused to hold them in bondage he broke every yoke and let the oppressed go free not only without extorting a farthing by way of compensation but at much pecuniary sacrifice in addition to the market value of the slaves he exerted himself greatly to prevent that dire catastrophe the annexation of texas he has refused tobe a vassal of the cottonocracy of boston and in spite of their machinations was chosen as an antislavery whig representative to congress from populous middlesex he voted against the whig candidate for speaker mr winthrop on principle and thus showed himself to be free from the bondage of party and true to his own independent and conscientious opinions of duty cost what they might though a prodigious outcry has been raised against him for that vote he has heard it calmly and met it unshrinkingly it is for reasons like these and not because they are careful cither for the fourth or any other commandment in itself that the editors of the puritan and chronicle have pounced upon him and are now trying to injure his religious character for an act which whether tried by the jew ish or christian standard is worthy of the highest commendation there is one fact which h c wright and the editor of the christian world have overlooked in their animadversions on this pharisaical attack on mr palfrey it is that the reply of jur ff in throp was also written on sunday but of this fact the puritan and chronicle find it convenient to discard all knowledge the sin of mr winthrop was the same in kind and extent as that committed by mr palfrey but for the former there is not a breath of censure aud the reader is left to infer that mri w wrote his reply on monday while for the latter strong condemnation is meted out as if he alone was in the transgression a fact like this shows the hypocrisy of the puritan and chronicle in its strongest light conceivable mr winthrop is an aristocratic conservative voted supplies for the war prevented any antislavery pledge being given at the springfield whig convention has no sympathy for the slave is the choice of south carolina for i speaker of the house and the pet oi the boston cottonocracyand therefore the chronicle and puritan have nc charge to bring against him of sabbath breaking nb here

supposing every man be his occupation what it may were to have his mind highly cultivated it would render him uneasy in his lot nothing can be wider from the truth a single word will explain it j and that is that as you raise men towards equality in intellect and education you bring them nearer actual equalityand the distinctions of property and occupation will sink away to nothing was washington

nations on the face of the earth are it is supposed denmark and the united states the government of one is a despotism and that of the other is opposite republicanism and yet the inhabitants of these two countries are probably the t best contented of any in the world an educated mind has so many resources within itself that it has not to depend upon outward circumstances for happiness a man with a cultivated intellect would feel neither disgrace nor uneasiness to have you find him at the anvil nor would you if you had a mind rightly educated respect him any the less i well recollect calling in

intellectual and moraland above all denuded of that liberty which is the right of every human being breathing the vital air w e ask you to pause and reflect on this unseemly and wicked state of things emancipate yourself from that bondage of custom or prejudice or interest under which you may be laboring contemplate the horrors of the slave system with an open and candid mind realize as far as you can an adequate conception of the realities of this evil ascertain in what way you stand connected with it and looking at that connection in the light of a final reckoning decide at once whether slavery is in future to count upon you as friends or foes our religion teaches that god is the father of us all and that freedom is the sacred birthright of all his children we therefore protest against any member of this family robbing any other of this inalienable gilt and call upon all who have escaped the horrors of bondage to break these fetters and let the oppressed go free it grieves us to learn that not a few of you who professedly recognize the christian religion as the rule of life are actually identified with the slave system of your country living in the very midst of it surrounded by those whom i god has endowed with tbs same gifts as yourselves and who you cannot deny are brothers and sisters of that great family to which you belong they arc kept in boudage for your sakes they are deprived of intellectual inoral and religious culture that they may the better serve your selfish purposes there is no necessity impelling vou to hold longer over them the rod of the oppressor you may if you choose wash your hands at once clean of this evil do not imagine that because you have been born and educated in the midst of slavery that you are guiltless or at least comparatively innocent however much these unhappy circumstances may have tended to blunt your moral sensibilities or to mitigate your guilt w hen you lived if it were possible so to live in ignorance of your criminality be assured that now when your attention has been called to the sinfulness of yoor position that if you have left in your breasts one single vestige of that moral perception which distinguishes our nature so long os you stand in any degree identified with slja very that you are unmitigated transgressors of the immutable laws of gods moral government we urge you once more humbly tore view the principles of the christian jre ligion ponder well that great commandment which includes all others love the lord thy god with all thy i heart and thy neighbor as thyself i learn again the spirit of that golden maxim do onto others as ye would rjthey should do unto you are you i willing to change conditions with those t i who are held in bondage by yon or for you arc you willing to

not to sjbnit than that you should deceive the work and your ownselves by attempting t do what never can be doneserve botl god and mammon we would affectionately warn you against attempting to defend your position by appeals to the supposed practices of old testament times the bible is only an open book to those w ho read it with honest hearts to all others its instructions arc sealed up if your desire in reading is to find an apology for slavery you will not leave your task disappointed but if your simple desire is to know the truth and obey it then the truth shall make yours ives a well as your bondsmen free bear il in mind that our controversy is not with the slavery of bygone times but with that slavery which exists at this moment in your own land let it b tried on its own merits the only legitimate christian mode of settling thi matter is to judge of it by its fruits shut yourpildes then till you havt analyzed the slave system till yoi have as thoroughly as possible become acquainted with its character ant then open the sacred volume submi slavery to its tribunal and t ii us if i conics forth justified or condemned there are in your c untry a large class who not being actually involvec in the slave system imagine thal they occupy a neutral position and are therefore tree from the charge of supporting slavery to such we would say between right and wrong there is no neutral ground he who is not with us is against us is the language of one who always spoke the truth if you are not protesting against slavery if you have not repudiated the fellowship ofthose who live by its existence then according to the statement of j sus you are not with us but with those who are against us there can he no greater or wore fatal error than toimagino thal slavery depends lor its existence upon the holders of slaves it could not exist a year if left solely to depend upon them for support they are the mere executors of the religious sentiment of your country on this matter and would be powerless under a correct public opinion your proslavery churches are the bulwarks of slavery they are giving their mighty influence to perpetuate the present state of things they have refrained from declaring the criminality of man attempting to hold property in his fellow mannay they defend such a state of things as perfectly consistent with the precepts and spirit of christianity they have received into their most intimate fellowship the slaveholders of your land and thus endorsed the whole system as good they are not with us but against us the church has in every age and in every country been the most powerful regulator of public sentiment inasmuch as it deals with the religious feelings of the people but the church is made up of its individual members sa its influence is the combination of theirs il your influence then has been thrown into the common stock of any church where slavery and its supporters are not the subjects of separation and unqualified condemnation are you free from the charge of perpetuating this evil and prolonging its horrors we would remind you that onr guilt in connection with any system of iniquity can only be measured by the amount of influence we possess the more reputedly good men and women are the more dangerous do they become when they sanction that which is evil slavery reaps a greater harvest from the silcuce of such than from the efforts of all the slaveholders iu your land let your churches give forth un unqualified condemnation of this system let your ministers fearlessly declare from their pulpits its true character and slavery with its attendant evils will speedily disappear hut if they persist in perpetuating this fearful delusion iniquity will wax stronger and stronger till those virtues which are the only guarantee of your countrys preservation shall be blted out we would say take decided action let your creed be no compromise with slaveryno communion with slaveholders if the church to which you belong will not stand forth in vindication of the rights of your colored countrymen then be faithful to your religion lome out of her my people that ye partake i not of her sins and that ye

freemen are continually getting worse off or emigrating nut of the slave states into new free states not as the enterprising adventurer goes from new england because he wants more room hut because his

would consume lhe amount of additional energy comfort and happiuess is but poorly indicated even by these figures in the present age slavery can compete successfully with free labor only under rare circumstances the population must be sparse perhaps not exceeding fifty persons to the square mile hut in the nice labor and minute division of employment in the economy and the improved methods of cultivation consequent on a dense population slavery ceases to he profitable the slave will not pay for rearing it must he on a soil extraordinarily fertile which the barbarous tillage of the slave cannot exhaust some of the richlands of georgia alabama louisiana and mississippi are of this character then it must have the monopoly ot some favorite staple which cannot be produced elsewhere a combination of those three conditions may render slavery profitable even at this day yet by no means so profitable as the work of the free man mr rutledge was not far from right in when he contended that in direct taxation a slave should pay but onethird as much as a freeman his labor being only of onethird the value of a freemans j i to be continued speech or wendell phillips at the sixteenth annual meeting of the massachusetts aniislartry society held in fan cuil hall boston thursday evening jan i wendell phillips came upon the platform j amidst the warmest greeting of the audience ii w ith which the ample ball was now well filled i on the table by his side lay partly opened the ponderous roll which contained the adi dress of the women of scotland to the wo men of america on the subject of slavery with its forty thousand signatures i mr phillips commenced with a reference j to this admirable address so powerfully recommended to us and in a few eloquent words acknowledged the effective aid which the antislavery cause has always received from women from a womans lips he saidi the abolitionists of the old world first heard the doctrine and learned the lesson ot immediate i emancipation their voices have ever been dear and true in animating to the conflict and in pointing out the way these same women we have here tonight forty thousand strong i they come and urge us not to cease in our contest with slavery the blessing of god be upon them forty thousand name closed lira prisons of massachusetts at the latimer tim so that the slaveholder should not use them to hold his flying victim forty thousand multiplied by ten shall yet send massachusetts swinging clear from that constellation jof despots of which she now is one and as oconnell the friend of every sect sex creed color and clime the ocean of whose i philanthropy knew no shore oneesaidthat he would e a proud man who should be able to say to the women of england parliament has done your biddingso shall massachusetts yet joyfully do the bidding of the noble and christian women on her soil who demand of ht to cease from all partnership in the iniquity of slaveholding cheers i do you ask why we do not trust parties and plans and churches and compromises but wish to rase all out and begin anew j vve answer every thing that man could do united to the constitution has been done to what effect let the gloom of slavocraey as it steals over our countrys horizon answer we do not distrust the union and political j parties because they have failed once but because against slavery they have always failed let irn explain in an anecdote of henry clay on the stump when some vote of lus had i offended his neighbors an old friend took him t hy the hand and said harry ive voted for you always till now im done forever i neighbor said clav do you own a rifle the best in kentuck suppose it should once miss fire what should you do pick the flint and trv again thats it my boy said clay clapping him on the shoulder do so with your friend jack the flint and try him again that now was pood sense our cae is jest the reverse weve got a rifle that always misse aie we to stand picking the flint forever cheers seventy year alli astedthe hoes of two generations cheated how long shall we w ait how long to earn the reputation of patient men moderate men men of sound common sense the fox turned back from the lions cave when he saw the tracks all inward and none returned wise boast into the vast house of slaveholding despotism the long procession of hopes pnd promise church plans and cunning compromise

all these point what has john p hale raid nothing that j hundreds of whigs have net already said over and over again nothing that john van bu reo and silas wright have not said before him here mr phillips read from the letter j of mr llale accepting the domination of the liberty party mr hate does not aay that he goes for the immediate termination of slavery ah thatj little word immediate what an amount of meaning it has and how potent is it to show the real character of a mans opposition to an evil which he is combating ido hot blame mr hate for not taking ground for immediate emancipation be has a right to his opinions all me can ask of a man is that be shall be true to his own views and convictions j mr hale did not seek a nomination from the lilerty partythat nomination was his misfortune not his fault he was sought out by the liberty party they neither asked him w hat lie believed or what be would do touching slavery liberty party began by j scouting llic okl plan of questioning a man first and nominating him afterwards in this instance they have improved upon itpropos ing to nominate first and quest ion afterwards but ended in nominating and then not questioning at all at the buffalo convention liberty party stood up balancing between two candidates for their nomination on one side john p hale on the other gerrit smith and whatever may be said of the nineteen political propositions which are enough to sink gerrit smiths political hopes beyond recovery every one knows him foi an outspoken abolitionist going the w hole length for immediate emancipation yet upon him liberty party turned its backrepudiated him and why because he was not an available candidate and took up john p hale the indepcnent democrat never known as an abolitionist because it was hoped he would be available and save some and what has followed the liberty party candidate sits silent in the senate house on the subject of slavery and leaves it for joshua r giddings the whig too rile for bible politics to touch to make the first direct move which has been made in congress this year against slavery i said today toa liberty party man that john p hale had i as yet made no war on slavery and he replied mr h had not yet found an opportunity i told him knew a man named giddings who made his opportunity cheers i repeat i find no fault with john p hale when tried by his own standard measured by his own yardstick he is an honest man enough for what i know but when put forth as an antislavery maa to represent the antislavery mind and conscience of this people i will hold him to a strict antislavery account mr president we hold ourselves a grand inquest for freedom inspectorsgeneral may i say of antislavery for old massachusetts by the right which some years of study and experience in thri matter give us we make this claim we mean to hold ourselves free from all contamination of slavery we mean to give it no countenance and support and we mean to see it abolished before we close our eyes in death if we can loud and continued cheering over all political scheming over all antislavery apostacy overall hypocrisy and pretence will we hold ourselves vigilant if we can help it no man shall go about in an antislavery garment without the antislavery heart in his bosom liberty party may work for her own ends she may join what others she pleases to accomplish those ends she may go for a homestead to the w hite man and land for everybody c c but she shant by putting on antislavery as a cloak swallow up the enthusiasm of the honest abolitionists of the north she shant deceive sir those scottish women whose names are enrolled there turning to the table those forty thousand women are the tenth legion of which the roman saying was defeat was impossiblethe tenth legion was in the field and they shall not be deceived by any false pretences i thought last night as i listened to the eloquent appeals and remonstrances of william w brown how powerless are the men of bostonwealthy and powerful though they behow utterly powerless they are to protect that man here in their ow n city there is not in all massachusetts the power which can save wra w brown from his masters grasp should he come and demand him here a voice yes there is yes there are in massachusetts scoooo beating hearts which if they would utter the word disso lition would bo omnipotent to shelter to protect to save him but that word is to eome not by mustering parties or choosing cunningly available candidates but by massachusetts coming np as of old and breaking her chains in faneoil ilall treason some will cry the powers that be are ordained of god the powers of god are the powers that shall bethis i hold to bethe true doctrine and this ought to be the reading of the text great

last head of the hydra was destroyed if tempted by immediate ease they left the keystone of the arch unplaced let us no longer dream life away in turning proudly over the page of their historybut close the book and gird ourselves for the struggle till with clear brow in the face of christendom we can ask what our fathers left us to do have wc not done it the atonement which their only sin

phillips took his scat the north star rochester february editorial correspondence lynx mass feb my dear nell ln accordance with my promise i will now commence to keep yourself and the naders of the north star informed of my irovements during my absence from my post at rochester i very much regret the necessity which just at this time requires me to be absent from my editorial duties for though the north star should grow brighter as the night grows older and darker i deem it of considerable importance that it appear bright at its very daw n at this time more than at any other period of our enterprise the star will be subject to unfriendly aswell as friendly criticism i however feel confident that with the friendly aid which surrounds you the paper will lack nothing of interest during my unavoidable absence my readers will also bear with me when they remember that one of the most essential things to a good paper it a good subscription list and tins it is no disparagement to our enterprise to say wc have yet for the north star one of the objects of my short tour is to obtain subscribers for the north star and especially to interest and enlist the energies of our colored fellow countrymen in the important duties of sustaining the paper it may now be said that the north star is the only permanently established periodical in the bands of the oppressed and enslaved of this land it is the grand instrumentality for i their improvement and elevation the necessity for its existence is pressing and imperative and the duty to sustain it ballimportant i shall try to impress this view on my brethren everywhere i have done so already with much good effect since i left rochester at present the subscription list of the north star exhibits the names of five white to one colored person and though this fact indicates n most gratifying interest in our enterprise by our white fneads it reveals a palpable deficiency of interest oasbe oar enlaced friends i am swam that

behalf of the food of the whole there an some who whale they if for with me on many points some of which i deem most important yet hare the candor to confess that the north star ia aa important means against slavery and hare the magnanimity to subscribe for the paper too wifi be glad to learn that my meeting on sunday j evening in troy was large aad spirited it was held in the coart house which was as densely crowded as last foil when yon attended a meeting at the same place in company with me the hall was much better lighted on this than on the former occasion and gore to the audience a life and brilliance quite impreo sire of all the bores in this boring world there arc lew more afflicting to me than to speak in a dimly lighted hall where one has literally to feel his way is the dark for his audience i may be singular in this aad h may be set down to a want of earnestness and devotion to the cause the confession however is out and care not to recall it beg antislavery friends who invite persons to lecture in their towns if they wish to hare a good impression made oo their townsmen to see that the house in which the lecture is to be given be well lighted mr henry highland garnet was present at the meeting and manifested a lively interest in its proceedings at the close of the lecture lie rose and in his usual frank and forcible maimer recommended the north star to the favorable consideration of the audience this unsolicited move i regard with pleasure as an important and significant step in the right direction on the part of this distinguished and highly esteemed gentleman i have long regarded mr garnet as being quite liberal in i his views and profoundly patriotic in his feel i mgs but considering his long and ardent attachment to the liberty party and his intimate connection with the orthodox church his manly of the north star i was as uuexpected and surprising as it was gratifying mr garnet was not ignorant of the character of the paper he knows its poi sition to be that of entire separation from our siaveholding government as well as a slaveholding church and coming to the support of the paper in the circumstance shows howevei much he regards sect and however highly he may regard party he esteems the holy cause of which the north star is the solemnly consecrated advocate to be dearer than either and to be promoted even though it should beat the expense of both sect and party i hope our enterprise will share his permanent sympathy and support and that he will feel perfectly free to use its columns as a means oi communicating with the public as well when he differs as when he agrees with the editor of the north star this paper is an organ for the oppressed in this land through which all may speak no matter how widely any party may differ from the other the editors deem themselves only humble individuals among the mass and only ask for their opinions the respectful hearing which they are ever willing to accord to those who may differ from them regarding the north star in this light see not why all may not unite in supporting it i on tuesday evening ist feb i lectured to a considerable audience in the town hall springfield mass but with very little apparent effect i have lectured in the same place j before but from some cause or other with lit tie satisfaction to myself or advantage to the cause i am inclined to think

sympathy i black man and is as deeply interested in oui cause as though his own soul had beer pierced with the iron of slavery aftei shaking my hand with a grip peculiar to anti i slavery men mr brown said that for man years he had been standing by the great set of american bondmen and anxiously watch i jing for some true men to rise above its dark i level possessing the energy of head and bear i j to demand freedom for their whole people f and congratulated myself and the cause tha he now saw such men rising in all directions the result of which he knew m jst be um i downfall of slavery mr

since i last wrote nothing of interest has transpired antislavery seems to be at a low ebb in this j county at least if present appearances are n test of the reality w cannot get up a meeting of any considerable number here nevertheless the true and real friends of the slave stand firmly to their integity of such there are many here voters and nonvoters i but few of the latter and many of the former and strange and paradoxical as it may appear though the friends of the cause are many the cause itself suffers much there is as you know quite s libera feeling in this community but the troth of the matter ia that every man is such a real slave to his own business that he has not time to devote to the suffering slave to man another influence appears to bear against the cause of antislavery in this region the mississippi valley and its connecting rivers are but the train of communication or the great telegraphic medium which binds pittsburgh now oilcans and st lotiis together in interest merchants here being interested in trade vessels and shipping houses there families here being intermarried and consanguineously allied to families there until they have although in themselves essentially three become but one they doubtless now look upon themselves as one in three hence the absence of antislavery action in pittsburgh and alleghany cothe legislature of pennsylvania although not as yet sufficiently enlightened to recommend an alteration of the constitution so as to amend the odious third clause are beginning to exhibit germs of civilization by talking about the death penalty sic but while this is going on faithful to the biddings of the south some one of their number has introduced a bill to prohibit a pantingfugitive from settling in pennsylvania the scheme now freely and openly discussed concerning the incorporation of mexico with the united states is a project the most frightful and monstrous within the pale of human conception and even dr bailey of the era and some others who call themselves abolitionists favor and contend for a consummation of this project they argue that it will facilitate the overthrow of american slavery and forsooth bring the mexicans under a more settled and stable government but what are the facts in the esse buta glance will suffice to show the fallacy and duplicity of this whole nefarious scheme mexico is peopled by ten millions of inhabitants but fifteen hundred thousand or three twentieths of whom are whites the test sev enteentwentieths or seven and a half millions are indians and mixed eolorsfrom the black to the fairest quadroon aeeording to the christian usages laws and customs of this free republic no colored personthat is to say black mulatto or indianis eligible to the privileges secured to and enjoyed hy the whites such being the case should this highhanded project succeed while it might in reality speed the overthrow of slavery as such in the south yet in doing so would i bring with it degradation and servility to near ty eight millions of freemen heretofore enjoying the rights and privileges of a free aad equal people common to all of whatever origin while but one and a half million would retain those rights enjoyed in common heretofore by all and this is whst we sre asked to subscribe to how superlatively devilish is this whole scheme nay rather than this ist mil mexico

under the nam of benevolent philanthropic and religious forgetting that aa a great whole the name men who control the political destinies of the nation and give us slaveholding presidents and slaveholding cabinets and slaveholding warsarc the very same men who control not only the ecclesiastical and commercial relations of the north and the south but give character to those institutions which bare been looked upon as ind tpensablc to the welfare of the rising generation they seem to forget that man who false in one relation of life is untrustworthy is every other and while they admit that the vilest slaveholders and the most barbarous slavedrivers have emanated from northern sunday schools they insist that those are but exceptions to the general rule the american sunday school union is slaveholding in its character and influence as i propose to show to the entire satisfaction of every honest mind first the children who attend those schools are as a general thing not taught that slavery is a sin and those passages ol scripture which bear upon the subject are so construed and w rested from their true meaning as may be seen by reference to the union questionbooks as not to condemn the perpetrator of this horrible crime or if they are in some instances taught to regard slavery as sinful they are at the same tune taught both by precept and example that slaveholders art yiot sinnir hut good christian brethren to be fellowshipped by ministersuperintendent sund ivsrhool teacher and scholar hence the crime is transformed into an eril which if they i in after life choose to endure they may w ith out losing their christian character and reputa tion secondly the books published by the union and which compose the sundayschool libraries to a great extent embracing several

and have nothing but what their masters choose to give them they are obliged to work very hard and sometimes their masters use them cruelly beat them and starve them and kill them for they have nobody

occurred dy n few days since at n loco foci i meeting a wyoming county on this oecw non prejudice task the shape of a resolution and manifested itself as follows i resolved that we mpeetfutty suggest to the colored gentlemen who are setting j themselves up as editors lecturers reformer and public tesebers and arrogantly and impudently presuming to instruct us f j the propriety of repairing to the land of tbeir fathers as there is now a door open and a pressing call and there sympathize with their own kin and labor to raise them from their present heathen and brutish degradation to a level at least with southern slaves albany journal is it possible to conceive of a more perfect and speaking illustration of the influence of the patriarchal institution upon the feel inga and heart of the northern states than j these few words present it is difficult to know whether to admire most the supercilious insolence the despicable heart leanness the canting hypocrisy or the utter irrationality of this delectable production in these respects it iks few equals and no superior in the eutirp history of proslavery sentiment in this or in any other country do the colored gentlemen who are netting themselves up as editors lecturers ac exercise any undue influence over the free will and free action of these locofoco gentlemen that they are led to oflfer this resolution do ihcv use anv force to make them attend their teachings or lectures or to make them read their publications or on what other ground do these redoubtable reaolulionists claim to have any right to interfere with the free action of their fellowcitizens taking a very commonsense view of the subject one might imagine that this matter at least might with all safety beleft to the discernment of the public if these colored gentlemen choose to lecture and write and there arc any who wish to attend their lectures or to read their publications itis utterly impossible to conceive if there were no reasons other than the alleged w hy a locofoco or any other meeting should take upon itself the gratuitous icsjvonsibiliiy of suggesting a different course jf it ccilt be shown that the color of the skin afreets the qualities of the heart and as a necessary consequence the teachings of the lecturer and the writings of the editor there would then lie a good and sufficient reason for getting rid of these colored gentlemen by all fair means if possible and if it is show n that the color does affect the heart in the deeper i it douu less must do so also in the lighter shades and this will bring us to the unavoidable inici nee that the man who has the fairest face must also have the purest heart how very desirable is it in some respects that such wc e the casealbeit how very convenient it would be we should then know er all professions pretences and protestai ons notwithstanding what and what manner ol udi they were with whom w e met without going through the tedious and somewhat doubtful process of acquiring this knowledge on acquaintance if the qualities of the heart in all cases corresponded with the shade of the skin we should at once see through everything in the shape of hypocrisy and fraud and possibly the faces of the gentlemen who framed this resolution would be seen to be not of the whitest there is another suggestion which might be offered as an appendix to the above resolution without which it appears exceedingly partial and incomplete and of which the board of education and all whose duty it is to see that schools are supplied with properly qualified teachers must at once see the propriety it is thisthat the precise shade of complexion which qualifies a man the oracle has not yet spoken on the subject of women to be a teacher ought to be very clearly stated as a very slight mistake might be fatal to the morals of the rising race perhaps also as j these locofoco gentlemen may have some conscientious opinion as to the precise height or genera appearance of the teacher or lecturer or editor it might be well to draw up a short set of rules comprising all necessary particulars it might be stated that they shall not be over or under a certain height that they must not have red hair or a crooked nose or a long chin or perhajis it might be belter still that the whole matter should goat once into the hands of congress and that the united wisdom of the senate should forthwith set to work and divide the entire country anew into states and counties and have a law passed that each slate and county should be occupied by only one class of inhabitants for instance there might be redhair i oun ty in fair slate crookednose county in crooked state sixfoot county in tall state ac every man would then know exactly where to find bis proper location and we should not be annoyed with the continual travelling to and fro by railroads and that constant unbelting of families which ate now so prevalent and by which intelligence and brotherly feeling amongst men arc so rapidly diffused to the great danger and detriment of all patriarchal institutions j low peaceful and happy people might then l c many of the causes of quarrel with which we are now troubled would be removed no one would te heard saying to his neighbor how homely you are how crooked you are as all who lived together would be hmrelv and crooked alike the fashions too those perpetual iroublers of civilized life would all be regulated as sensible lueu say they ought to be by nature the thm would remain thin without padding the pale w ould remain pale without paint and the beardless would be saved the trouble and expense of buying themselves false whtakers the story of the fox that lost his tail would be reenacted but this tune with better success for every one would have the same blemish or beauty as his neighbor and any one making his appearance in any particular state who was not in the fcahton of that state would at once be detected to be out of hia place and would of j fc i the derision and con tamely which his unwonted appearance deserved a very utopia this would be for the kco gentlemen who framed the resold tioa above quoted wid not the legislature

are withal exceedingly philanthropic and benevolent they are anxious that colored gentlemen should sympathize with their own kin and labor to raise them from their present heathen and brutish degradation to a level at least with southern slaves what philanthropy w hat heavenly charity what godlike benevolence what a beautiful expression of true christian sentiment is in these words how

making tham too an j gelic for residence in this lower world if there are any such they will doubtless be anxious to acquire knowledge let it come from what source it may they will not ask whether a black man or a white mana tallman or a short man is to be their teacher however unenlightened they may be in other respects they will not choose to confess that they arc ignorant of the very simple fact that thoughts are neither black nor white nor tall nor short but that there arc only two kinds of thoughtsthe true uic false come now gentlemen iocofocos of wyoming county confess that you were

right of every man to worship god according to the dictates of his own conscience is inherent inalienable selfevident yet it is notorious that in all states excepting louisiana there arc laws enforcing the religious observance of the firsi day of the week as the sabbath and punishing as criminals such s attempt to pursue their usual avocations on that dayavocations which even sabbatarians recognize as innocent and laudable on all other days it is true some exceptions are made to the rigorous operation of these laws in favor of the seventh day baptists jews and others who keep the seventh day of the week as the sabbath but this freedom is granted in condescension to the scruples of particular sects as a privilege and not recognized as a natural right jor those and the number is large and steadily increasing who believe that the sabbath was exclusively a jewish institution a shadow ol good things to come w hich vanished eighteen hundred years ago before the light of the christiau dispensation and therefore that it constitutes no part of christianity there is no exenn non from the penalty oj the law but should they venture to labor even for bread oil that duv or be

liranisni and the spirit of chriatiantiy believing that the efforts of this sabbath union ought to be baffled by at least a corresponding energy on the port of the friends of civil and religious liberty that the sabbath according to the jewish scriptures was given tothe ehildnn of israel and to no other people as a sign t between them and god and terminated with all the other mosaic rituals belonging to the tnihistmfion of decth written and tngrann j on stones on the introduction of ac mmts j tration of the ipirit and the substitution ofa better covenant which was established upon better promises that christianity knows nothing of a holyday but only of a holy life the jossessioo of a spirit which works no ill to any one and is the fulfilling of the law that the worship of god docs not pertain to any particular dayis not a special isolated performance and cannot come by obser vationbut is purely spiritual m its nature and comprehended iu a cheerful obedience to the will of the father so lar as it is made known that the distinction made between nered and secular acts by the advocates of sabbath keepingthe sacred being the strict performance t f religious observances and the secular such as undoing heavy burdens letting the oppressed go free reclaiming the drunkard i laboring in the field or the workshop public travelling transporting the united states mail is a distinction not liased upon reason or christianity but calculated to lower the tone of individual and public morality and to depress the immutable standard of moral obliga tiops that the sabbath as now recognisd and enforced is one of the main pillars of priestcraft and superstition and the stronguold of a merely ceremonial religion that in the hands of a sabbat rang clergy it is a mighty obstacle in the way of all the reforms of the agesuch as antislavery peace temperance purity human brotherhood c sic and rendered adamantine in its aspect towards bleeding humanity whose cause must not be pleaded but whose cries must be stifled on its sacred occurrence and believing especially that all penal laws respecting the religious observance of any day as the sabbath are despotic and antichristian and ought to be immediately abrogated that the interference of the state in matters of religious faith and outward observances is not only unwarrantablebut a usurpation not to be tolerated that they who are for subjecting to pains and penalties all who do not construe the scriptures in their light in regard to a religious observance arc actuated by a mistaken or malevolent spirit which is utterly at variancy wilh the spirit of christ which in various ages has resorted to the dungeon the rack the gallows and the stake for the accomplishment of its purpose and which ought to be boldly confronted and rebuked we the undersigned therefore invite all who agree with us essentially is these views of the sabbath question to meet in convention in the city of boston on thursday and friday the d and th of march next to confer together and to decide upon such measures for the dissemination of light and knowledge on this subject as may be deemed expedient in publishing this call for au antisabbath conventionwe desire to be clearly understood we have no objection either to the first or the seventh day of the week as a day if rest from bodily toil both for man and beast on the contrary siuh rest is not only desirable but indisprnsible neither man nor beast can long endure unmitigated labor but we do not believe that it is in harmony with the will of god or the physical nature of man that mankind should be doomed to hard and wasting toil six days out of seven to obtain a bare subsistance reduced to such a pitiable condition the rest of one day in the week is indeed grateful and must be regarded as a blessing but it is wholly inadequate to repair the physical injury or the moral degradation consequent on such protracted labor it is notin accordance with the law of life that our race should be thus worked and only thus partially relieved from suffering and a premature death they need more and must have more instead of less rest and it is only for them tobe enlightened and reclaimed to put away those things which now cause them to grind in the prisonliouse of toil namely idolatry priestcraft sectarianism slavery war intemperance licentiousness monopoly and the likein short to live in peace obey the eternal law of being strive for each other s welfare and glorifiv god in their bodies ami spirits w hich are hisami they will secure the rest not only of one day in seven but ofa verv large portion of their earthly existence to them shall be granted the mastery over every day and every hour of time as against want and affliction for the earth shall be filled with abundance for all nor do we deny the right of any number of persons to oliserve a particular day of the week as holy time by such religious rites and ceremonies as they may deem acceptable to god to their ow n master they stand or fall in regard to all such matters it is for everv one to be fully persuaded in his ow n mind and to obey the promptings of his own conscience conceding to others the hberty he claims for himself the sole and distinct ireue that we make is this we maintain that the seventhday sabbath was exclusively jewish iu its origin and design that no holiness in any sense at taches to the first day of the w eek more than to any other and that the attempt to compel the observance of any day s thesahlath especially by penal enactments w unauthorized by scripture or reason and a shameful art of imposture and tyranny we claim for ourselves and for all mankind the right to worship god according to the dictates of our own conscience this right inherent and inalienable is cloven down in the united states and we call upon all who desire to preserve civil and religious liberty to rally for its rescue by that infallible test of consciocs rectitude which jesus gave to his disciples whatsoever a would that inen should do to you do ve even so to them let those whp sah batize on the first day of the week vroeas vatd at present they constitute the maori

meeting at the bridge a mile or more from the town i live in abody of armed inen the road turns suddenly as you approach the spot from the south and is skirted on either side by deep swamps i did not see them consequently until i cainc directly upon them where have you been was the abrupt question put to me by the cap tain without offering the usual saluta tion i have been hunting i replied along the banks of the river and upby the old hermitage hid you see or meet any one continued my questioner no man else saying a word j no onego home instantly he said imperatively and keep up the main road dont cross over by the swamp or the old ford two nearer footpaths to the j town skirling heavily timbered land i cannot recollect now whether i had heard before of an insurrection i had i not certainly thought much about it if at all but i knew instantly why these armed citizens were at the bridge the low compressed yet clear voice of the captain the silence of his men their audible breathing as they waited for my replies to his questions their military order with sentries in advance told me all and i experienced a dread which chilled me through and the deepening shade of the forest under which i had so often whistled merrily served now to add to the gloom of the hour i asked no more questions with quickened pace i pushed up the main road and was not long in reaching my fathers house i wished to ito know the worst and to help in meeting it i found all alarm at home guns j were stacked in the passage and men were there ready to use them two friends were in the parlor informing the household of the place of rendezvous for the women and children and the signal which was to he given if the i town should he fired or an attack be made upon it by the negroes i inquired and learned here the cause and extent of the danger that morning a negro had informed his master of the plot and had represented to him that it reached plantations an hundred miles off and embraced the thickest negro settlements in the state the first step taken mas to arrest tile leaders named some thirty in number by the informer the second to inform town and county of the impending danger armed patrols were started out in every direction every avenue to the towoi was guarded and every hous in it made a sort of military flirt the apprehension was that the plantation negroes would rise ant sweep all before them with fire and sword and the white strength was prepared in all its force to meet this contingency the master if he be kind to his bondmen is apt to believe that they will never turn ngninst him we hear planters say i would arm my slaves whenever this subject is broached this is a strong expression and to be received with grains of allowance as the sequel will illustrate yet hoy like i felt as it no soul in our yard could strike a blow against one of the family and in this temper i went to the servants quarters not one of them i was out a strange event aud not a neighbors domestic was in a still stranger circumstance they were silent as the grave even momma privileged to say and do what she pleased and who would be heard amid the laughter and tongueclatter of the j rest had nothing to tell me aked a few questions they were simply an  swered it was evident that the servants were frightened they knew not what they feared hut they were spelli bound by an undefined dread of evil to them and harm tons indeed this was the case w ith the blacks generally iand while the excitement lasted the i pat sol did not arrest one slave away i from his quarters an honest irishman i remarked at the time it was hard to t tell which were most frightened the whites or the negroes the proposed reroll u rffards territory was an extended otoe it em biteed a region haring over forty thousand male slave but the plot was poorly arranged and it was clear that those who planned it knew little of nothing of the power they had to meet and master for six months the leaders of it had been brooding over theii design and two days before its consummation they were in prison and virtually doomed as felons thru seizure arrested the insurrection without bloodshed but not without a sacrifice of lift that was demanded bj society and the law and made thirtect of the negroes arrested were declared guilty and hung they bad according to all notions then a fair trial lawyers defended them and did theii best an impartial and intelligent jun determined their fate and by the voic of man not of grid this number of human beings was legally sent out o existence the leader of the insurrection isaac i kicw well he was heat man to a family intimate with mine implicit confidence was placed in him not only by his master but by the minister of the church and everybody wh knew him the boys called him uncle isaac and the severest patro would take his word and let him go hit way lie was some forty yiars old when h first planned the revolt his physica development was fine he was muscular and active the very man a sculptor would select for a model and yet with all his great strength he was kirn and affectionate and simple as a woman he was never tired of doing for others in intellect he was richly giftedno negro in the place couh compare with him for clearheadednesi and nobleness of will he was born t make a figure and with equal advantages would have been among the firs in any throng he had character r tha concentration of religious moral ant mental strength which when possesset by high or low gives man power ovei his fellows and imparts life to his act and name his superiority was shown on th trial it was necessary to prove tha he was the leader and counsel wert about taking this step i am th man said isaac there was no hesi in his manner no treniulousnes in i voice the words sounded naturally but so clear and distinct thai the court and audience knew it was so and that it could not have been otliar wisc an effort was made to persuade hin to have counsel his young masters pressed the point the court urged him slaveholders were anxious for it not only because they could not help liking his bearing but because they wished to still every voice of censure far or near by having a fair trial for ill but he was resolute he made set speeches played no part olear above all and with the authori ative tone of truth he replied i am the man and am not afaid or ashamed to confess it sentence of death was passed upon him and twelve others the next step before the last was to ascertain all the negroes who had entered into the plot isaac had managed this part wisely kept his own counsel and besides his brother as was supposed no one knew who had agreed to nelp him at home or from a distance the testimony was abundanl that he had the promise of such help his declaration to the colored informer the bonfire of the town will raise forty thousand armed men for us was given in idence he admitted the fact but no ingenuity no promises no threats could induce or force him to reveal a single name you have me he said not one othei shall you get if i can prevent it the only pain i feel is that my life alont is not to be taken if these pointing to his fellow captives w r ere safe i should die triumphantly the anxiety on this point naturally was very deep and when the usual expedients had failed the following scheme was hit upon isaac loved his minister as everybody did who worshipped at his altar and the minister reciprocated heartily that love isaac will not resist himhe will get out oi isaac all we want to knowthis was the general belief and acting upon ita committee visited the pastor an explanation took place and the good rnan readily consented to do all he ould he went to the cell the slave ielon and the man of god confronted each other i come isaac said the latter to ind out from you everything about this vicked insurrection and youmas er hastily interrupted isaac you ome for no such purpose you may lave been overpersuaded to do so or mthinkingly have given your consent lut will you who first taught me religion who made me to know that my fesus suffered and died in truthwill ou tell me to betray confidence sa redly entrusted to me and thus sacri ice others lives because my life is tole forfeited cau you persuade me is a sufferer and strugglcr for freedom o turn traitor to the very men who rere to help me oh master let me ove you and rising as if uncertain f the influence of his appeal to his ull stature and looking his minister di ectly ia the face he added with otnniandiug majesty you know ae i wish the r erg language of isaac he slave could be used i wish i ouldnrepeat the tale as i heard the old uinistcr tell it so minute yet so nat iral so particular in detail yet so life ike the jail its inner cell the look tnd bearing of isaac his calmness his greatness of soul it was touching in he extreme i have known sternest lavehoiders to weep like children as hey would listen to the story but can only narrate it as remember it n briefest outline the old divine coo inued i could not proceed i looked at sane uiy eye foil before his i could ot forget his rebuke acknowledged iy sin for the first time in my maniste ial life i had done a mean a bane ct and standing by the side of a hawed felon i foil myself to be ike rimiual a long rifonre ensued the imnis i  ter was ia hopes that isaac would bread it he did not he made several ef fist to do so b toiled recoverto from his shock at length and reverting in h a own mind to the horrors whicl the revolt would have occasionedhe resumed the conversation thus but base yoars was a wicket plot and if you had succeeded yot would have made the very streets rut blood how could you think of thishow consent to kill your old mistress how dream of slaying me am mine master isaac quickly responded i lore old master and mistress love you and yours i would die t bless you any time master i wouit hurt no human being no living thing but you taught me that god was th god of black as well as whitethat h was no respecter of personsthat ii his eye all were alike equaland thtt there was no religion unless we love him and our neighbor and did tint others as we would they should do unti us master i was a slave my wifi and children were slaves if equa with others before gt d they should b equal among men i saw my younj masters learning holding what thej made and making what they could but master my tace could make nothing hold nothing what they did thej did for others not for themselves an they had to do it whether they wishe it or not for they were slaves master this is not loving our neighbor oii doing to others as we would have then do to us i knew there was and coul be no help for me for wife or children for my iace except we were all free and as the whites would not let this b so and as god told me he could onlj help those who helped themselves preached freedom to the slaves and bit jthem strike for it like men master we were betrayed but i tell you now if we had succeeded i should hav slain old master and mistress and yoi first to show my people that i coul sacrifice iny love as i ordered them t sacrifice their hates to have justice justice for themjustice for minejus tice for all i should have been mis i erable and wretched for life i coulc not kill any human creature without be i ing so but master god herepoint ing with his chained hand to his heart told me then as he tells me now that i was right i dont know how it was continued the old minister but i was overpowered isaac mastered me it wai not that his reasoning was conclusive that i could have answered easily bul my conduct had been so base and his honesty was so transparent his look sc earnest and sincere his voice so commanding that i forgot everything in sympathy for him he was a hero and bore himself like one without knowing it i knew by that instinct which ever accompanies goodness that the slavefelons conscience was unstained by crime even in thought anc grasping him by the hand without scarce knowing what i was going tc do i said isac let us pray and prayed long prayed earnestly i did not stop to think of my words my heart poured itself out and i was re lieved i and what i asked was the character of your prayer what it ought to have been energetically replied the old divine i prayed to god as our common father i acknowledged that he would do justice that it was hard for us poor mortals to say who was right and who wrong ion earth that the very best were sinners and those deemed the worst by us might be regarded the best by him i prayed for isaac i prayed god to forgive him if wrong to forgive the whites if he was right to forgive and bless all i was choked with tears i caught hold of isaacs hand and pressed it warmly received his warm i pressure in return and with a joy is never experienced before or since heard his earnest solemn amen as i closed we stood together for some time in silence isaac w r as deeply moved i saw it by the working of his frame and the muscle of his face and his eye for the first time teardrops stood on his eyelids but stilling every emotion be began as calmly as if he were going to rest master i shall die in peace andi give you a dying mans blessing i shall see you no more on earth give my love to old master and mistress andfor a moment he faltered but with concentrated energy choked down instantly his deepest emotion as he continued more solemnly that i ever heard mortal speak and master if you love me if you love jesus lead my wife and children as you have led me toheaven god forever bless you master we parted i saw him no more i could not see him hung or pray for him as requested to do by others at the last dying hour i had been with him long for lour hotirs we were together in his narrow noisome cell how indcllibly are the events which occurred in them impressed upon my memory oh slavery slavery the citizens outside awaited anxiously the good ministers egress from the jail and when he appeared crowded round him to know the result he looked like one jaded with a long journey he was worn down it is uselessit is uselesslet him die ini peace was all be said and seeing that he was deeply moved and taking it for granted that he had been engaged in devotional exercises with the dying silence pervaded the group and he was allowed to depart is peace and never in public or in a mixed audience would that minister refer to isaac or the hours b spent with him no other effort to elicit information from the leader was made and none who promised him help were discovered through him the deathday came a mighty crowd gathered to witness the sad event to which in that place it was to be devoted and the military with gleaming sword and bright bayonets stood under the gallows to guard against escape or difficulty six felons were upon the gallowsit could hold no more d isaac was first on the list be men said he when one of the number showed some timidity and dielike men l give you an example then pbejr wy brother that brother stood nest farm isaac gazed intently upon the crowdsome thought he was i looking for his wile and childrenand i j then spoke his farewell to his young masters a few words passed between him and hts brother when saying an dibly ih die a freemanhe sprmne up as high as he could and fell heari lr as the knotted rope cheeked his fidl instantly bis ftaine was con raised and in its muscular action his feet neared the plank on which he bad stood look mg as if he thought to regain it his brother turning his face to his comrades deliberately put his hand upon his side and leaning forward held i the body clear with his elbow as he said let us die like him the authorities perceiving that the i terrors tf the law would be lost andi none of the good they anticipated be secured among the blacks especially ii who filled up the outer circle of the dense crowds if this lofty heroism were witnessed they proceeded rapidly j with the execution and in a few moi meats isaac and his brother and their felon comrades were asleep to gether the bodies of the blacks after dangling in the air the usual time as if in mockery of heaven and earth were cut down coffined and carted away to their burialplace this was an out ofitheway old field with a stagnant lagoon on three sides of it and a barren sandwaste covered with a sparse growth of short pines on the other beneath the shade of one of these pines which skirted the field and not far off from the felons graves a colored woman and a cluster of little ones might have been seen i these were isaacs wife and children they stood where the were until all save one white man had departed he made a signal and they approached the burial spot he pointed to a par j ticular spot and left none know save our father how long the widowed one and the fatherless remained there or what were their emotions but next morning a rough stake was found driven into the earth beneath which isaac lay and ere the next sabbath dawned a pile of stones with an np right memorial was placed at the head of his grave how these stones were obtainedfor none like them were tobe seen within thirty or forty miles no one could say though all knew i cho put them there the rude me j morial still stands the grave of isaac is yet known and that widowed one while she livedfor she too has de partedkept the lone burialspot free from weeds and covered it with the wild rose as if the spirit which once had animated the cold clay beneath loved a robe of beauty and sweetness as not the least remarkable feature in isaacs conduct was the course he pursued towards his family we cannot close without referring to it he was an exemplary husband and a wise aswell as kind father his wife was not superior intellectually but she was affectionate and he so moulded her character as to make her worthy of him his children were wellbehaved and remarkable for their polite inan ners his very household gave evidence of this every thing was in order the furniture was neat in all the arrangements he had an intelligent eye to comfort and taste he had awatch and some tolerable scripture engravings and his little garden was well stocked with the best vegetables i the best fruit and the rarest flowers of the plot isaacs wife knew nothing he had evidently thought of his failure and committed no women and as few married men as he could he meant let what might happen to him that his partner should suffer no harm this was evident enough from his conduct for the first thing he did after his arrest was to desire an interview with his old master this was denied him not that the old gentlemen was i cruel or angryfor he loved isaac but hecase as he said he could not stand it the next thing was to send for his young master lie came and to hiai he said massa thomas i have sent to you to say that my wife does not know anything about the insurrection or any of my actions i wanted to see old master to beg him not to sell or separate her and the children i must get you to do that and massa thomas when your father dies i want you to promise that you will help them the young man promised and we rejoice to say his word was kept and then isaac thei felon blessed him never again until his last hour when conversing with his minister did he refer to his family and the only message he sent them was a torn bible with this sentence rudely writ down on one of the leaves we shall live again and be together so deep was his affection for his family j and so careful was he to ward off every suspicion of danger from them i met last summer the slaveholder an intelligent and humane mailwho commanded the military the day isaac was hung ireferred to the scene he spoke of it as one of the most moving that he had ever and to my surprise though very much to my gratification remarked i never knew what true heroism was until i saw isaac manifest it upon his seizure trial and death i felt my inferority to him every way and i never think of him without ranking him among the best and bravest men that ever lived the record below tells of his crime and be

slave in kentucky of imposing stature well knit muscles and the countenance of one of natures noblemen at the age of eighteen he had so far won the confidence of his master that he not only consented to sell him the right and title to his freedom but gave him his own time to earn the money with a general pass from his master henry made his way to the kanawha salt works celebrated as the place where senator ewing of ohio chopped out his education with his axe and there too did henry boyd chop out his liberty by performing double labor he got double wages in the daytime he swung hi axe upon the wood and for half the night he tended tho boiling salt kettles sleeping the other half by their side after having accumulated a suilicienl sum he returned to his master and paiti it over for his freedom he next applied himself to learn the trade of a carpenter and joiner such was his readiness to acquire the use of tools that he soon qualified himselfto receive the wages of a journeyman in kentucky prejudice does not forbid master mechanics to teach colored men their trades he now resolved to quit the dominions of slavery and try his fortunes ina free state and accordingly directed his steps to the city of cincinnati the journey reduced his purse to the last quarter of a dollar but with hi tools on his back and a set of muscles that well knew how to use them he entered the city with a light heart little did he dream of the reception he was to meet there was work enough to he dune in his line but no masterworkman would employ a nigger day alter day did henry boyd olfer his services from shop to shop but as often was he repelled generally with insult and ouct with a kick at last he found the shop of an englishman too recently arrived to understand the grand peculiarity of american feeling this man put a plane in his hand and asked him to make proof of his skill this is in had order said boyd and with that he gave the instrument certain nice professional knocks with his hammer till he brought it to suit his practised eye enough said the englishman i see you can use tools boyd however proceeded to dress a board ina very able and workmanlike manner while the journeymen from a long line of benches gathered round with looks that bespoke a deep personal interet in the matter you inay go to work said the master of the shop right glad to employ so good a workman the words had no sooner left his mouth than his american journeymen unbuttoning their aprons called as one man for the settlement of their wages what what said the amazed englishman what does this mean it means that we will not work with a nigger replied the journeyman but he is a firstrate workman but we wontt stay in the same shop with a nig jger we are not in the habit of working with niggers then i will build a shanty outside and he shall work in that no no we wont work for at boss who employs niggers pay us i up and well be off the poor master of the shop turned with a despairing look to boyd you see how it is my friend my workmen will all leave me i am sorry for it but i cant hire you even at this repulse cur adventurer did not despair there might still be mechanics in the outskirts of the city who had too few journeymen to lie bound by their prejudices his quarter oi a dollar had long since diapjh uixd but by carrying a travellers trunk or turning his hand to any chance job he contrived to exist till he had made application to every carpenter and joiner in the city and its suburbs yof one wowm employ him by this time the iron of prejudice more galling than anything he bad ever knows of slavery bad entered bis soul ha walked down on tho river bank below tho cay nd throwing himtrlf upon the ground gave way to an agony of despair he had found himself tho

prostrated in ah jeef and slavish serrdlty stronger ones are made the enemies and depredators of society and it is only the highest class of moral heroes that come off like gold from the furnace of this class however was henry boyd recovering from hi dejection he surveyed the brawny muscle that strung hi herculean limbs a new design rushed into hi mind and new rcsolur tiou filled his heart he sprang upon his feet and walked firmly and rapidly towards the city doubtless with aspirations that might have fitted the words of the poet tfiv spirit fxnrrrsnrscr fct me share tan die ik heart and rasft eve the first object which attracted hw eagle eye on reaching the city was one of the huge river boats jaden with igiron drawn up to the landing the captain of the craft was just inquiring of the merchant who owned its contents for a hand to assist in unloading it i uni the very fellow for you said boyd stripping offhis coat rolling up his sleeves and laying hold of the work yes sure enoughthat is the very fellow for you said the merchant the resolution and nlncritv ot boyd interested him exceedingly and during the foor or five days whilst a flotilla of boats w ere discharging their cargoes i pigiron with unaccustomed despatch he became familiar with his history with the exception of all that pertained to his trade which boyd thought proper to keep to himself in consequence our adventurer next found himself promoted to the portership of the merchants store a post which he filled to great satisfaction he had a hand and a head for everything and an occasion was not long wanting to prove it a joiner was engaged to erect acounter but failing by a drunken irol lic the merchant was disappointed and vexed rather in passion than iu earnest he turned to his faithful porter i here henry you can do almost anything why cant you do this job perhaps i could sir if i had my tools and the stuff was the reply your tools exclaimed the merchant in surprise for till now he knew nothing of his trade boyd explained that hehad learned the trade of a carpenter and joiner and had no objection to try the job the merchant handed him the money and told him to make as good a counter as he could ihe work was done with such promptitude judgment and finish that his employer broke oft a contract for the erection of a largo frame warehouse which he was about closing with the same mechanic wlm had disappointed him in the matter of i the counter and gave the job to henry the money was furnished and boyd was left to procure the materials and boss the job at his ow n discretion this he found no difficulty in doing and what is remarkable among the numerous journeymen whom he employed were some of the very men who took off their aprons at his appearance in the englishmans shop the merchant was so pleased with his new warehouse that lie proceeded to set up the intelligent builder in the exercise of his trade in the city thus henry boyd found himself raised at once almost beyond the reach of the prejudice which had wellnigh crushed him he built houses and accumulated property white journeymen and apprentices were glad to be in his employment and to sit at his table ho is now n wealthy mechanic living in his own house in cincinnati and his enemies who have tried to supplant him have as good reason as his friends to kuow that he is aman of sound judgment and a most vigorous intellect w ithout having received a days schooling in his life henry boyd is wellread in history has an extensive and accurate knowledge of geography is an excellent arithmetician is well
