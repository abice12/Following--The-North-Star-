chairman i rise merely to offer u resolution to be added to those al rcetdy boforo the within a tew days i have had the intelligence of the deathof a colored friend and coadjutor on the other side of the atlanticone of the earliest advocates of the antislavery cause in the old world upon the principles of immediate emanci pationone who labored for the freedom of the west india slave long before our own attention had been called to the condition of our own fettered countrymen he was truly a most estimable man and he won for himself the love admiration and gratitude of alarge circle of the friends of human freedom and progress he is now dead hut though dead the glorious example which he gave in behalf of human rightsof the workingmen of great britainof the cause of teeto talisrn of peace and especially of the slavewill never lose its efficacy so long as goodness and virtue can be remembered allude mr chairman to the death of john murray of scotland the life the soul of the antislavery movement actfbss the atlantic has always been in scotland and hadit not been for scotish antislavery indomitable quenchless and persevering i the end the antislavery of england probably would have faltered in the conflict and must unquestionably have failed to effect the redemption of tlie west india slaves but the little band of scotish abolitionists always stood ready to rekindle the torch of emancipation expiring in other parts to grapple with and triumphantly overcome all testacies to success and to make every needful sacrifice and of all men in scotland who were first and tbremorst to maintain abolition principles in an uncompromising and intrepid spirit john murray was ever conspicuous will read the following resolution as a tribute to his memory which the convention i doubt not will delight to pass in honor of his virtues whereas intelligence has been received of the death of one of the earliest most faithful and intrepid most exr einplary and selfsacrificing advocates of the slave in the old world john mr kray of bow ling bay scotland therefore resolved that this convention do express to the surviving family and friends in particular and to the world at large us deep sensibility in view of his decease its large appreciation of bis mdelatigable labors in the cause of the west indian and american slave its graceful remembrance of the cordial support he at all times gave to the american antislavery society and of he warm hospital ty he extended to all ihe delegates of that society who have horn time to time visited scotland the memory of the just is blessed an honest man is the noblest work of god voted that a copy of this preamble and resolution be sent to the family of this philanthropist by the secretary o f this convention duly authenticated by the signatures of its officers there are friends here mr chairi man who have been on the other side of thd atlantic who knew john murray intimately who have partaken of hi hospitality and byjcommunion with him were greatly strengthened in the work of delivering the american bond manwho can fully endorse all that i the north star hare said with regard to him and to pay a more fitting tribute of reaped to hi memory perhaps in the course of the evening my friend frederick doug j lasa will take an opportunity to perform this mark of respect the question being taken upon the resolution it was unanimously adopted rev samuel j mat of syracuse n y was next introduced to the convention ho spoke as follows i feel it is good to be in boston how good it is no one hut a son oi boston who has been exiled from the state ot his birth and early affections for ye art can fully realize it is good to be in this j hall and for one feel that there is not a place upon the earth which throngs with associations more qui ening to be toreiwofliberty than faneuii hall applause it is regarded in every part of oar country as the cradle of liberty here the noblest sentiments in behalf of freedom and humanity have been uttered here the deepest purposes in behalf of freedom and humanity have been brought into being and resolved upon would to god j that there were nothing any less honorable to it to be spoken these wlls have resounded to sentiments ot a far different character in this hall words i have been uttered which as was wellj said at the time of tbeir delivery ought to have blistered the lips of an american but let it pass blessed be god i we live in a free country where even the abettors of error may be heard j where even the atheist may speak his thought and the man who would tram pie his fellowman in the dust and convert him into his property may make i defence of his abomination if he can fori there can be no fear of error in a country like this where the press and speech are free yes we believe j most fully that if truth and error have but a chance to grapple error would be overthrown and conquered i the recollections that crowd upon j my mind as i stand upon this spot after an absence of many yearsat least they seem to me many yearsand recollect the advance that has been made in the cause of the oppressed and downtrodden are peculiarly gratifying well do i remember when this hall was closed against the advocates of human liberty well do i remember the time in when fifteen hundred of the most wealthy men ft thisgnty signed a for the opening of this hall to the delivery of sentiment antagonistic in their tone to sentiments uttdted bythose who are only pleading that the j great principles of the declaration of our independence might be carried out in the conduct of the i say fifteen hundred gentlemm ofthis city petitioned for the opening of this hall that an opposition might manifested to the advocacy of human freedom thereby waking up against us a spirit of violence that had well nigh bathed our native soil with our own blood but sir these days have past and we now recall the unpleasant remembrance only to rejoice fit it as evidence of the progress which has been made in the glorious cause we have espoused look at our country nownot by any means what she ought to be not by any means at the high pinnacle of prosperity that our hearts in the confidence in the american people foretold it would reachstill when wei contrast the present with the past how gratifying the transition almost everywhere north of mason and dixons line and in some places even south of it sentiments execrated in times past even in this hall qmy be uttered without let or hindrance or molestation from any one can we not be grateful for the progress that has been made during the last twenty years though we may naturally feel that comparatively little has been done considering the length of time that has elapsed but i rejoice to stand in this hall to j night rejoice to see such an assembly here notwithstanding the numerous demands that have been made on i the attention of those interested in the various religious associations of our country they hate still been found disposed to come to this place in preference to any other to listen to the sentiments that shall be uttered and to respond doubtless with unfeigned cordiality to the demands that may be made on them for higher efforts and more determined and earnest exertions in carrying on to a completion the work which has been so gloriously commenced those who have attended the previous meetings of this convention have heard living epistles from the south that must have spoken to your hearts as no written woras could have done calling on you if there be a spark of humanity in your souls to kindle it up anew until the fir shall be more intense than any that has yet burned within shall be in progress urging you onto efforts and exertions that are hourly needed to rid our country from such a curse as the institution of slavery if you have attended the meetings of this convention you have seen men and women children of god presenting every appearance of humanity on their persons telling the story of their escape from southern oppression escapes made not only at the risk of a still more cruel bondage but at the risk of their own lives never will the story be forgotten in our country or throughout the world of the maowhom i trust you will all be permitted to seewho that he might escape southern oppression consented to a living entombment he entered the box with the determination to be free or die and as he heard the nails driven in h fear was that death was to be his portion yd death come in preference to sievery and is there one m tbie bowse who hasa heart to feel that can look a man as henry box brown tm af rtcttt is ot to sextkc ih to or no ool hlgoo id this father of us all and all rtf ark brethren firm that he may not enjoy the rights of a roan in a country like ours i happened to be in the city of philadelphia i have told the story to the convention already but i will tell it againin the midst of the excitement that was caused by the arrival of a man in abox i measured it myselfthree feet one inch long two feet wide and two feet six inches deep in that box a roan was entombed for twentyseven hoars the box was placed in the express car in richmond va and subjected to all the rough treatment ordinarily given to boxes of merchandise for notwithstanding the admonition of this side upwith care the box was tumbled over hat he was on his head at one time nearly two hours as it seemed to him on his head and momentarily expecting that life would become extinct from the terrible pressure of blood that poured upon his brain twenty seven hours was this man subjected to this imminent peril but through the blessing of god such was j the intensity of the love of life and liberty in his bosom that it seemed to set at defiance the principles of physiology itself and to live without air that he might for one moment at least breathe i the air of liberty great applause i does not such a man deserve to be free r is there a man here that does not bid him welcome is there a heart here that can doubt that there must be in him not merely the heart and soul oi a deteriorated mana degraded inferior manbut the heart and soul of a nobleman not a nobleman sir but a nobleman who can doubt it sir i confess when i see such nobleness in a man of another hue from myself i almost wish i could change my complexion for his applause and hisses i have been hissed before great applause and a voice said in good company well might such aman in such a condition as that excite an intense interest in the city of philadelphia the gentleman to whom he was consigned spent the night previous to his aiwval sleepless his expectation wasyes h lelt it certain that instead of a living man he should find a corpse in the box coming to him and when he found it safely deposited in his house such was his excitement that for a while he dared not approach it but having gathered about him some friends to sympathise with him in his fknotion and sustain and strengthen him to foeet the worst he approatfted the box knocking on it with his knuckles exclaimed ls allright within and to bis unspeakable all right jgfeat sensation fbr while so great wa his agitation thdt he could hardly use the instruments that were necessary to relieve him fitom his imprisonment but when thg cover was removed a mana true mana noble man arose from the temporary coffin into a living lifea new life indeed unless there be base men enough in this part of the country to allow him to be recaptured to the living death from which he has escaped the moment he appeared the gentleman to whom he had been consigned as soon as he could give vent to his feelings exclaimed in a burst of emotion for he knew not what he said and yet mr president he said that which was wellnigh exactly trueyou are the greatest man in america laughter and applause certainly no man in america has done what henry box brown has done his escape will be remembered as long as the history of the struggles of humanity for her rights shall be remembered as soon as he was released having walked the room and stretched his limbs and filled his lungs for the first time with the air of liberty and gathered up into his soul a realizing sense of his deliverance the spirit of gratitude to god came over his heart and he burst out into an anthem that wili never be forgotten and was never sung more appropriately than then i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry frederick douglass mr chairman i never rise to speak in faneuii hall without a deep sense of my want of ability to do justice to the subject upon which i undertake to speak i can do a pretty good business some have said in the country school house jin western new york and elsewhere but when i come before the people of boston in faneuii hall i feel my exceeding weakness lam all the more embarrassed this evening because i have to speak to you in respect to a subject concerning which an apology seems to be demanded allude to the subject of the american colonization societya subject which has had a large measureof antislavery attention and been long since disposed of at the hands of wm l garrison the only apology that i can make for calling attention to it this evening is that it has had a sort of revival of late through the agency of a man whom presume a large portion ot this audience esteem and admire i allude to the honorable henry clay of ken j lucky applause though not a yankee you see i guessed correctly i have presumed rightly that you esteem and admire that gentleman now if you admire this man of course you would like to know all about him you would like of course to hear whatever can be said of him and said fairly j although a black man may presume to say it i mr clay has recently given to the world a letter purporting to advocate the emancipation of the slaves of kentucky tb hasbeen extensively published in new england aswell as other parfe of the united states and in almost nance where ft whig paper hm epoken of the letter it has dose terms of high approv rochester n y friday tune af the plan which mr clay proposes is one which seems to meet almost the universal assent of the whig party at the north and many religious papers have copied the artids and spoken in terms of high commendation of the humanity of the clearsightedness and philanthropy of henpr clay now my friends lam going to speak to you in a manner that unless yon allow your reason and not yjr prejudices to prevail will provoke from you demonstrations of disapprobation i beg of you then to hear me calmlywith out prejudice or opposition you it must be remembered have in your hands all power in this land i stand here not only in a minority hut identified with a ciastmprhom every body can insult with impunity surely the ambition for superiority must be great in honorable men indeed to induce them to insult a poor black man whom the basest fellow in the street can insult with impunity keep this in mind and hear what have to say with regard to mr clays letter and bis position as a slaveholder the letter of mr clay commences in a manner that gives promise to the reader that he shall find it a consistent straightforward antislavery document it commences by refuting with one or two strokes of the pen the vast cartloads of sophistry piled up by mr calhoun and others in favor of perpetual slavery he shows clearly that mr calhouns theory of slavery if admitted to be sound would enslave the whites as readily as it enslaves the blacks this would follow necessarily j glancing at the question of the natural inferiority of the colored man he says admitting a question he does not raiseadmitting that the whites of this country are superior to the blacks the fact devolves upon the former the duty of enlightening instructing and improving the condition of the latter these are noble sentiments worthy of the heart and head of a great and good man but how does mr clay propose to carry out this plan he goes on to stale that in carrying out his proposed plaivof gradual emancipation great care should be taken that the rights and interests of the slaveholder should not be jeopardied he proceeds to state that the utmost caution and prudence should guide the haodthat strikes down slavery in kentucky with reference to emancipation he affirms that it should not commence until the year the plan is that all children born of slave parents in kentucky after the year shaft be fsee aftqr arriving atbihe age of twentyfive he sets therefore the day of emancipation beyond the average length of he slaves life for a generation of slaves in the south dies out in seven years but how would he have these children of slave parents free not free to work for themselves not free on the soil that they have cultivated with tbeir hard hands that they have nourished with their best blood and toiled over and beautified and adorned but that then hey shall be let out under an agent of the state for three long years to raise one hundred and fifty dollars with which to pay the price of their own expatriation from their family and friends voices shame mr douglassl hear the cry of bhameyes it is a deep and damning shame he declares in that letter that not only shall these emancipated slaves work three years but that he mr clay will oppose any measure for emancipation without the expatriation of the emancipated slaves just look at the peculiar operation of this plan let us suppose that it is adopted and that in the year it commences all children born of slave parents are to be free in the year it is wellknown that all persons in the south have contracted marriages long before this period and have become parents some having children from one to four years of age henry clays plan is that when those persons arrive at the age of twentyeight those parents shall be torn away from their tender children and hurried off to liberia or somewhere else and that the children taken from these parents before they have become acquainted with the paternal relation shall remain another twenty sight years and when they have remained that period and have contracted matrimonial alliances and become fathers and mothers they too shall betaken from their children the slaveholders having kept them at work for twentyeight years and hurried off to j liberia but a darker baser feature than all these appears in this letter of mr clays it is thishe speaks of the loss which the slaveholder will be called mi to experience by the emancipation of his slaves but he says that even this trifling expenditure may be presented by leaving the slaveholder the right to sellto mortgageto transfer is slave property any time during the twentyfive years only look at henry clays generosity to the slaveholder of kentucky he has twenty five long years during which to watch the slave markets of new orleans of memphis of fitchburgh and other southern cities and to watch the prices af cotton wnd rice and tobacco on the other side of the atlantic and as the prices rise there in these articles he may expect a corresponding rise in the price of flesh in the slave markets and hen he can sell his slaves to the best fidi nnlißr thus it is that the glorious state oteeotuckyshall bemadftmkee md yftt her purse he made the heavier in consequence of it this is not laveiue hold inherjinjumnoß throw them off into the sotnhnpi mi statenand then hypoqpticeily heart of hsing e free stele while almost every slave born upon her soil remains a slave and this is the plen of the good henry clay whom you esteem and admire so much applause and hisses you that like to bias if you had the chain on your owe limbs and were peat ud in henry clays own quarter end baa free access to henry clays own mealtub i think would soon change your tune laughter i wart to my a word about the colonization society of which henry clay is president he is president of nothing else laughter that society is anok enemy of the colored people in this country almost every respectable man belongs to it either by direct membership or by affinity i meet with cokmizrtionists everywhere met with a number of them the other day on board the steamer ahda going from albany to new york i wish to state my experience on board of that steamer and as it is becoming a subject of newspaper remark it may not be out of place to give my version of the storyon tuesday last i took my passage onboard the steamer alida as i have stated to go from albany to new york i happened to have very contrary to american taste and american prejudices and customs in ray company a couple of friends from england persons who had not been ashamednor had they cause to be ashamed from any feeling that exists in that country against the colored manof being found on equal sjcial terms with him lin the city of london they happened now to be sojourning in this country and as if unaware of the prejudice existing in this country or if aware perfectly regardless of it they accompanied me on the steamer and shared of course my society or permitted me to share theirs on the passage to new york about noon i went into the cabin and inquired of one of the waiters if we could have dinner the answer was we could they had on a sign on each side of the captains office words to this effect meals can be received in the cabin at any hour during the day by application to the steward i made the application and expected of course that dinner would be forthcoming at the time appointed the bell rungand though i do not know as it was altogether wise and prudent i took a lady on each armfor my friends were white ladies you must knowand moved forward to the cabin the fact of their being white ladies will enqble you mote readily to understand the cause of ihe intensity bfohate displayed totifrrds me i went below forgetting all about my complexion the curl of my hair or the flatness of my nose oply remerober in g i had two elbpwsmd a stomach and was exceedingly huffgry laughter walked below as i have jsaid and took my seat at the table supposing that the table was the place where a man should eat i had been there but a very few moments before i observed a large number of american gentlemen rising up graduallyfor we are gradualists in this countryand moving off to another table on the other side but feeling i was there on my own responsibility and that those gentlemen could not eat dinner for me and i mart do it for myself i prefered to sit still unmoved by what was passing around me i had been there bat a few moments when a white manafter the order o american white men for i would say for your consolation that you ar e growing darker and darker every year the steward came up to me in a very curious manner and said you must jetupfrom that table laughter demanded by what authority he ordered me from the table wellj said he yer know the rule sir said i i know nothing of your rules ji know that the rule is that the passengers can recieve their meals at any hour of the day on applying to the steward says he now it is no use i for yer to talk yer must leave laughter but where is the ruler well said he yer cannot get dinner on any boat on this river ltoldhim i went up the river in the confidence and had token dinner and no remark had been made well said he what yer can do on the confidence yer cant do i onfehe alida laughter are y era going to gel up no sirsaid i wellmys be wilt have you upj so off be goes to the upper deck and brings down the captain mate clerk and two or three hands i sat still during tbs time of his absence but f finding they were mustering pretty strong and remembering had but one coat and not caring to have it torn and feeling i had borne a sufficient testimony against tbeir unrighteous treatment i arose from the table and walked to the other end of the cabin in company with my friends a scene then occurred which i shall never for j get not because of its impudence but because of its malignky a large number of american taffies aad gentlemen seated around the table on the j other side of the cabin the very moment we walked away gave three cheers for the eeptoia and applauded in the most uproarious manner the steward for having driven two ladies and one gentleman from the table and j deprived them of dinner ms giuiaw that is a act for europe mx douglas they drove us from the table and gavft three cheers for the captoie for driving us away i looked around on th islience there omblod t toeoa l eoqfo detect ooe km of gomrtrtto mageaiamtty on any free mdignauon mafttferted against tb outrage that had bm peril petrated upon me ssml my friends bui i not a look not a word not the sligbtert j expression of disapprobation in any ft part of the vessel now i have trav i elled in england ireland and scotland i mention this not by way of boast j but because i want to contrast the i freedom of our glorious country and it it is a glorious one after allwith that of other countries through which i have travelledby railroads in highway i and byways steamboats stage coacb es and every imagiaabiejuntl of vehicle i have stayed at some of the first n hotels in london liverpool edinburgh glasgow dublin and else whereand i must say to you good americans that i never in any of those cities or towns received the first i mark or heard the first word of disapprobation on account of the color of imy skin i may tell you that one of the ladies with me on the steamboat though not a believer in the right of women to speak in public was so ex i cited and so indignant at the outrage perpetrated that she went to the american captain and told him that i she had heard much of the country much of the gallantry of american j gentlemen that they would be w filing to rise from their seats to allow a lady to be seatedand she was very happy in having the opportunity of witnessing a manifestation of american gallantry j and american courtesy i do think i saw one neck hang when this rebuke was administered applause most of the passengers were of the j baser sort very much like some western men darkcomplexioned lean lank pinched up about the ugliest set lof men i ever saw iii my life laugh i ter i went to the steward about two hours after they had cleared off i the dinner table for those hungry wolfishlooking people laughter my dear triends if you had seen them i you would have agreed with me i then inquired of the steward if now after this hungry multitude had been fed wc could have a cup of coffee and a buiscuit said hewho are you if you are the servant of those ladies you shall have what you want i thought that was kind any how yes said i i am their most humble servant i great laughter well said he what are you walking about on deck with them for if you are their servant i told him they were very courteous to meputting him oftin that way hethen told me if i did not get out at the cabin he would split my head open he was rather a diminutive being and would not have been mouthful for any thing like a topijhyef man r pfause however seeing saxon blood was up i thoughts wouui move off bnt tapping him on the shoulder i told him i wftnted to give him a piece pf advice i am a passenger you are a servant and therefore you should always consult the wants of the passengers laughter he finally told me he was ready to give me my dinner in the capacity ot a servant but not otherwise this acknowledgment told the whole story of american prejudice there were two or three slaveholders on hoard ono was a lady from new orleans rather a darklooking personfor individuals from that quarter are dark except the blacks and they are getting lighter laughter this woman was perfectly horrified with my appearance and she said to gentlemen standing by that she was really afraid to be near me and that i would draw a bowieknife indeed she had like to have fainted i this woman i learned from good authj i ority owned three hundred slaves in i louisiana and yet she was afraid of a black man and expected every rno ment i would attempt to commit violence on her at the time she was affecting this horror of a negro she i was being waited on at the table by colored men it was waiter come here and waiter go there and there j j they were aetually cutting up the meat standing right over it quite near these white persons who really shouted when i was driven out this tells the whole story you have i no prejudice against blacksno more j than against any other colorhut it is r against the black man appearing as the t colored gentleman he is then a contradiction of your theory of natural inferiority in the colored race it was not in consequence of iny complexion that i was driven out of the cabin for i could have remained there as a servant hut being there as a gentleman j having paid my own passage and be i tng in company with intelligent refined persons was what awakened the ba tred and brought down upon me the in halting manifestations i have alluded to ll is because the american colont zrtion society cherishes and fosters this feeling of hatred against the black matt that lam opposed to it and lam especially disposed to speak out my opposition to this colonization scheme toi night because not only of the renewed interest excited to dm colonization scheme by the efforts of henry clay and others but because there is a lecturer in the shape of the rev mr mii j ler of new jersey noas in england soliciting funds for oar expatriation from this country and going shoot trying to organize aoociety and to create an impression in favor of removing osi from this country i would ask you my friends if this is not mean and impudent in the extreme for one clam of i americans to ask for the removal of j another dam i fed sir i have as modi right in this country as any other mne f feel that the black man in this land baa aa much right to stay m this land as the white mao consider toe matter in the mart of pdssessfea ra this country our connection with this countryis cortemporsneou with yoar jom imtm ra whole no i own from the bimw of he es tsteuce of tbit people n a people hf colored man hat had a place upon the american soil to ho sure he waa ami driven from hi home in purwiit of a greater liberty lhaa he enjoyed at homelike tlie pilgnm fathers but in the same year that the pilgrim were landing in this state slave were landing on the james river in virginia we feel on this score then that we have aa much i right here as any other class of people we have other claims to being regarded and treated as american citizens some of our number have fought and bled for this country and wo only ask to be treated as well as those who have iought against it we are lover of this country and we only ask to be treated as well as the haters of it wc are not only told by americans to go out of our native land to africa and there enjoy our freedomfor we must go there in order to enjor itbut irishmen newly landed onour soil who know nothing of our institutions norof the history of our country whose toil has not been mixed with the soil of the country as ours have the audacity to propose our removal froin this the land of our birth for my part i mean for one to stay in this country i have made up my mind to live among you i bad a kind offer when i was in england of a little house and lot and the free use of it on the banks of the river tvden i could easily have staid there if had sought for ease undisturbed onannoy ed by american aienistocmqy for itis an aristocracy of skin applause thosp passengers on board jfhe alida only got their dinners that dain virtue of color if their skins had hwn of my color they would have had tir fast all day whatever denunciation england may be entitled to on account of her i treatment of ireland and poor one thing can be said of her that noman in that country or in juv of her i dominions is treated as ly than aman ou account of his corny lotion could have lived there but when remembered this prejudice agrnt color as it is called and slavery ami saw the many wrongs inflicted on mjfpeople at the north that ought to be and put down i felt a disposition to lay aside ease to turn my back eti the kind offer of my friends and to retwn among youdeeming it more noble fo suffer along with my colored biethren and meet theseprejudices than to live at ease undisturbed on the other side of the atlantic had rather be here now encountering this feeling bearing my testimom against o settiftg ifat defiance than io remain m england undisturbed i kve made up my mind whftrever i go i shall goas a mao and not as a slave when go on board of your steamboats i shall always aim to be courteous and mild in my deportment towards all with whom i coine in contact at the same time firmly and constantly endeavoring to assert my equal right as a man and a brother but the colonization society says this prejudice can never be overcome that it is natural godftas implanted it some say so fliers declare that it can only be removed by removing the causethat is by removing us to liberia i know this is false from my own experience in this country i remember that but a few years ago upon the railroads from new bedford and salem and in all parts of massachusetts a most unrighteous and proscriptive rule prevailed by which colored men and women were subjected to ail manner of indignity in the use of those conveyances antislavery men however lifted up their testimony against this principle from year to year and from year to year he whose name can pot be mentioned without receiving around of applause wesdell phillfs applause went abroadposing this proscription in the light of justice vv hat is the result not a single railroad can be found in any part of massachusetts w litre a colored man intreated and esteemed in any other light than that of a man and a traveller prejudice has given way and must give away thl fact that it is giving way proves that this prejudice is not invincible the time was when it was expected tliat a colored man when he entered a church in boston would go into the jim crow pewand  believe such is the case now to alarge extent but then there were those who would defend the eastern but you can scarcely get a defender of this proscription in new england nowthe history of the repeal of the intermarriage law shown that tfca prejudice against color if not invincible the general manner in which while pgrsgp with colored persons shows thatthe prejudice against color is not invincible when i first came here i felt the greatest possible diffidence to sitting with whites i used to comeop from the shipyard where i worked pth my hands hardened with toil vnugh aad uncomely tad my fiove ieots awkward for was onanism ted with the rules of polhsnspm would shrink back and would not have taken oy meals with the whiles m they not pressed me to do so our president in his earlier intercourse with me taught see by example b abhorrence of this prejudice he he iin nr oreoesee stated to mdse who sit st the table with me they could have a separate one for themselves the time was when i walked through the streets of boston wae liable to insult if in company with a white person today f have named in com ptmj wiib mt wmmfrimfc icuuu iwiruwdtttt t i aim aox jm he first wprd from any quarter an account of tbt color of my skin i have not heard ft is alt fab thi talk about tfi invincibility of prejudice against color it any of you have ft and no doubfl hhdo of you hare i will tell you how to get ndoi it commenoe to do something to elevate and improve and enlighten the colored mm d vour prejudice will begin to vanish ihe more you try to make a man of the bhnt man the mote you will begin to think him a man mr d here related ananecdote of hi having visited several years ago the town of pittsfield for the purpose of lecturing he was invited to the house of a friend an aotialavery man but who was filled with the prejudice against color tins man allowed him to w alk to the place of the lecture without offering to take him into his carriage and theo left him after the afternoon meeting tocome home alone while standing there it came up to rain and the hon a proslavery man invited him into his house the children on seeing him cntei cried nigger nigger and fled and the whole family treated him with coldness determined to overcome it he complained of a hoarseness with which he was affected and uked mrsif she would be kind euough to give him a glass of cold water with a little sugar in it to relievohis cold mrbrought the articles and mr i thanked her lie said with a wimming heart and from that moment her coldness and formality were gone and he was invited f whenever he visited pittsfield again u make his stay at their house mr garrison desired to make a rental k with reference to the exclamation of the children on the approach of mr douglass there a nigger in the house and their precipuaie flight it was the same kind of feeling that was evinced on another occasion when mungo park the celebrated english traveller visited africa he found himself at a certain period in a village where the inhabitants had never seen a white person before on going into one of the huts the children who saw him enter exhibited great trepidation and ran out with all possible expedition crying the devil the devil great laughter mr douglass it is a poor rule that wont work both ways laughter and applause most people think their lord is like themselves a certain very pious man was horribly shocked by hearing an abolitionist say that the negro was made in the image of god the lord is in their image they seem to think aud the devil in the image of the black man laughter i desire to bear my testimony after hearing the eulogv pronounced by mr garrison with regard to our departed brother and colaborer john murray of scotland about three years ago had the pleasure of bidding that noble man farewell on the shores of scotland and i retnemlier well the deep interest he took m the antislavery questions of this country his last battle in behalf of the slave was with the f ee church of scotland and while he lived that church lor its alliance vitb slaveholders for receiving their money into its treasury and extending to them its fellowship in return obtained no repose he bore a noble testimony against it he had home a noble testimony against slavery before for the last twentyeight years john murray stood up in scotland the firm the untiring the devoted friend of the slave there are two or three colored perrons at least now in this hall who have shared his generous hospitality and received his lieaity godspeed in their endeavors to break down slavery and prejudice against color in this country by creating a public sentiment on that side of the atlantic that should react in favor of human liberty here i have no inure lo say respecting this goodman his consistent and irreproachable character is his best eulogy some one asked me lo sav a word about general worth i only know general worth by his acts in mexico and elsew here jin the service of this slaveholding and slave j trading government know why that question is put it i b cause one of youf city papers which does not rise to the dignity of being called a pai a sheet of the basest sort has said that my longue ought to becut out by ita roots because upon hearing ol the death of that man i made use of the re markit ir not stated in ahat connection i made it or where that another legalized murderer had gone to his account i say so yet loud cheering and some hisses i will not undertake to

waras a war against the lice statesas a war against freedom against the negro and against the interests of the workingmen of this country and as a means of extending that great evil and damning curse negro slavery immense applause why may not the oppressed say when an oppressor is dead either by disease or by the hand of the foeman on the battlefield that there is onethe less of his oppressors left on earth formy part i would not care if tomorrow i should hear of the death of every man who engaged in that bloody war in mexico and that every man had met the fate he went there to perpctraie

this moment to keep them in their chains when i consider their condition the history of the american people how they hared their bosoms to the storm of british artillery in order to nsist simply a threepenny tea tax audio assert their independence of the mother countryl say in view of these things i should welcome the intelligence uwiiorrowshould it come that ihe slaves had risen in the south and that the sable arms which had been engaged in beautifying and adorning tho south were engaged lit spreading death and devastation there marked sensation there isastate of war at the south at this

massachusetts would willingly follow that speech and venture a comparison w ith ii white man and educated though he bt vou ask us what we have done in the antislavery enterprise if we had done nothing else it is sufficient merit that we have taken frederick douglas from u maryland plantation and placed him on the platform of faneuil hall applause jod gave him h eloquence a coal from bia j own attar hat we at least can elaim that through oui efforts he ha an audience in massachusetts  have spent many yean in speaking on this question of slavery to my foltnwcttzen but if i had done nothing else hat to perform he humble office of being a ccanecting link between the electricity of mat eloquent spirit and the humanity and religion of christendom so that in its focus the broad pretensions of american religion and regard for liberty shall be shrivelled up and pa as awav i shall feel at least that i have not lind in vain it is the slave the fugitive slave from the j plantation whose tongue

suffocatingabout to dieand he knew if he died there was hardly one press from maine to georgia but would regard hisfoalh j with scorn that there was hardly a pulpit that would put up a petition in behall of himself or the swarming millions of his oppres j xed countrymen no matter the devotion and selfsacrifice they might evince yet he dared to die alone and unpitied for liberty applause he took ins life in his handlook ed in the faces of the w hite race around him saw m none the lines of sympathy or tear of pity and yet he shrank not we say in behalf of this man whom god created and whom lawabiding webster and winthrop swore should find no shelter on the soil of massachusetts we sav that they may make their little motions and pass their little laws jin washington but that faneuil hall

cheers now fnends we draw to the close of this convention it falls to my lot at this late hour to a say few dosing words to those who have come to listen to its deliberations you may have thought that

this meeting has been attended far more fully and respectably than any that has proceeded it ob the times b ive changed how much we were first addressed this evening by the rev samuel j j may of syracuse the time has been when that man went before the legislature of massachusetts to appeal against fhe recommendation of edward everett that he should not be made indictable by common law forspeaking his thoughts in boston edwaid everett if up for an office before the people would be glad now if litis same samuel j may would give him a clean bill of health laughter or if the abolitionists of massachusetts were to say amen to his nomination we have changed the lone of public sentiment greatly or rather events have changed it for us at any rate the fugitive slave selects massachusetts for his residence she is an asylum for the flying bondman to some extent put that down then to our credit what we want of you fellow citizens is to investigate the questions issue between us as abolitionists and the cburch of new erie land we have no fear of discussion we want the church tried by a jury of honest godfearing men the verdict we can prophesywill not fie brought in against tlie rights of mankind yes we will even be judged by the eventsee which side beats in the coming ten years no reputation however sanctified by the associations of the past can stand before the rising humanity of the people you uphold the name of henry clay applaud it to the echo whenever mentioned vou do rot overrate his talents whereis the man that can match him in eloquence where is hc man that could have swept the northits commerce agriculture manufactures into such a mass of admiring enthusiasm as henry flay what has made his life a wreck and ruined his political prospects he endeavored to hold the balance between the rising feeling of the north and the perpetualists of south carolina but he tailed and was driven lifce chaff before the onward progress of the american people there never was a greater triumph never did simple principle so set up and pull down powers as in these last ten years oh god has been among us the follies of our enemies that have sent these living epistles speaking lo us tonight among us have wrought the change christianity carried out in its true sense has done the work be true to it to our great enterprise redeem religion from the pollutions of those who undertake lo misrepresent it redeem liberty from the traitors who go up to washington to sacrifice it annually give us an echo from faneuil hail that shall arouse the people of the southern statesnot in the name of the humanity but of the law of massachusetts that ihese fugitive slaves are yur citizens never to be hooted from tbeu adopted soil cheers fellowcitizens whether you tike it or not wetneao to free ourselvesdean our consciences in this annual meeting and in the prosecution of this wdtk ln that dire tragm dv at alton where fell the only anglo saxi n martyr for the liberty of the press within the last two hundred yearsthe inob encouraged each other by askingwhat will they think of ns in boston that was hut a short time after otis had made his libation to slavery in this hallwhen sprague pointed to washington as that slaveholder as if washing tons great characteristic merit was that ol being a slaveholder hisses aud applause oh letamerican history say every thing ot washington hut that he bought his fellowmen and when she comes to that blot upon the otherwise almost spotless idol of our worship let hei place her baud on her lips and her lips in the dust applause it was on the platform in faneuil hall that an applauded allusion was made to the only blot on the character of washington it went forth from this hall as far west as the waters of the mississippi and the ruthles mob gathered to crimson those virgin waters with the noblest i blood thftt has ever mingled there they said to each other as they assembled what will they think of us in boston it was an infamous notoriety and companionship all the meetings which have been held in this hall since have not blotted that transaction out of the history of time but we will blot it out fellowcitizens we will let a voice go forth from the state house in the name of the enacted law of massachusetts that shall make the world forget that infamous companionship and it shall find too a warmer echo than the hanks of the mjrsis j sippi it will find an echo in every slave hut and heart at the south when breaking from this bloody sisterhood we welcome every i downtrodden bondman to the safe asylum of out soil that wherever the power of the old i commonwealths example is felt the slave ji mav feel her mercy too great cheering  at the adjourned meeting in the melodeon tuesday evening may tf mr quincy offer ed the following resolution resolved that it is our duty to agitate the j question of slavery till the soil of new england is pure enough to free every man who sets foot upon it and meanwhile we pledge ourselves to trample under foot any law which j allows lie slaveholder to hunt the fugitive slave through our borders and not only to make new england so far as in us lies an asylum for the oppressed but to proclaim the fact so loudly that the glad tidings may reach every slave hut of the south mr quincy supported the resolution in an l able speech of which the following is a very i imperfect report it seems to roe mr president that this resolution connected with the concluding words of myfriend mt brown just uttered in our ears forms a pregnant text for discussion at this convention particularly at this period of its proceedings during this week this city is thronged as was jerusalem of old when i some of the high festivals of the jewish j church were celebrated fiom all pans of new england from every portion of our palestine from dan to beershebs the high priema and levites come up as h were to the city of their god they have to come up here to strengtbeu each others hands to extend the hues and make strong the stakes of their sectarian tabernacles this city dunng this week is ciowde with the religion of new englandwith pastors and their docks with the honorable womenthe great judgesthe learned lawyerthe rabbis and the pharisees why have they thus assembled themselves together it is as they profess and as many of them doubtless think to do god acceptably aerates and ooujt together as to whai is tb bum manner v which sskfsilskuizfizie are resounding with the rshffip w words of doctor f dmajj calling on ckrisoaas to mm win i the heathen to recollect the destitute of their own bad aad to coma up to the belp of the lotdsgaiaat the toifhty aad the heart of mxnta u stirred aad the eyes of masbood are wet when they redact over the sufferings of the pagans by the banks of the gaages and russ ia the destitute portions of the country where the pksges abut little known and ytt mr president wu meet is a place though consecrated by eloquence rejected and despised by the religious of the land referring to the melodeon m which theodore parker preachesthe only place we can find m this city where we can assemble to be iteard in behalf of the slave why are we shut on of every church of every dcnominaiioa upon that peninub what do we see here men made in the image of god for whom christ died and men wbo in the day of judgement will be seen only in the light of heir souls snd not according to the color of their skins these immortal beings are here but how they are here after having threaded wildernesses and swam riven and after having fought with bloodhounds and escaped the rifles of american christians here they areone of them after haring been confined for many hours not in a dungeon but in a coffina living grave gladly endured all the agonies of suffocation of thirst and of starvation in hopes that he might peradventure escape from slaver and pass a remnant of his days in liberty here is a precious commentary on the christianity of new england are these men safe in the churches of boston would they be protected here the christianity of boston boasts of beingas it isa lawabid ing christianity and as weal know from the bloody butchery of last week a lawexecuting christianity if ellen craft were to fly for protection to tbe horns qf the altar of the old south chureh and if her master or tbe mat sball of the district should come armed with the warrant of the district judge to tear her from those horns and to take her back to the hell of an escaped slave would the pastor of lhat church plant himself before her and receive the blows of the slaveholder into his own bosom would not that church and the churches of every denomination in their aggregate capacity deliver up eilen craft to her pursuers if they came for her according to law what is such a christianity as that worth there is something ennobling in the fanaticism which leads the hindoo to prostrate hinuelf before the car of juggernaut under a mistaken sense of duty for there is selfsacri ficedeath incurred from a false sense of duty but what is the fanaticism of the american cburch which induces her to throw not het self but helpless bleeding victims under the car of our american juggernaut to be crushed to powder take wm w brown and william andi ellen craft and our friend who escaped in the box who will presently be introduced to youtake them and offer them up as sacrifices look with complacency upon their suffer j ings and then thank god that we are a law abiding people and that we are not as other men are lawbreakere because that which the j law bids us do we do and for the ieason that our fathers saw fit to make a wicked contract with the oppressor i abhor such a christianity as that it is not the christianity for me the god of such a reltgidfi is not my god the bible which teaches such a religion is not the book in which i read my duty sir can teach the teachers of such a religion i can better the instructions of such a bible mr president if you arise at daybreak you may go to the early prayer meeting this week and hear holy men wrestling with god for a blessing through the day and even until the midnight hour you will be pursued by the voices of prayer and exhortation but prayers and exhortations in which these brethren and sisters of ours have no partin which they are not lifted up to a throne of grace they are the pariahs of this land and the brahmins pass them by they may suffer lifelong servitude their flesh may be bared to the paddle and the lash their souls according to the doctrine of evangelical sects are going down daily into everlasting perdition for the want of the rtble that is denied them and yet the american clergy and american church are silent with here and there a rare exception men of massachusetts every thing you hear and see tonight is full of meaning pregnant with thought when you see these men and this woman stand before you remember that by the laws of this land which bind you as well as the inhabitants of south carolina they are slavesthe property of other men remember that they are denied the right to read of god of christ in that gospel about which so much is heard this holy week in this holy city remember that they ate condemned by the decision of the american people to longlife servitude in this world and to everlasting damnation in the world to come heavens sir what a people is this whata nation of atheists it almost seems mar vellous that the fire of heaven delaysthat weare not consumed as were sodom and gomorrah of old lor the crimes of this people again i ask you to remember that this is the condition to which your laws have reduced these victims and which laws you as americans sustain consider whether these laws which bind me and you to their support are legitimate lawslaws that will receive the sanction of the most high godfor no other laws are binding upon the children of god and in the light of these truths and iu the presence of these witnesses sw ear that no fugitive slave shall ever be taken from you and that your roof shall be a shelter your hearth a protection and that you will not rest until the slave escaping here is safe as when he lands upon the fast anchored isle and his fetters dtop from his limbs and he stands up aman let massachusetts become indeed a free statea state where all who inherit it all who ffy to it for protection shall be recog nizedm their humanity their rights as immortal beings acknowledged and treated as the brethren of men and the children god deserve u be treated

beating upon the cause of justiee sod freedom in which we are engaged this huge old earth of ours not less than life itself is made up of small particles the smallest incidents connected with j our antislavery experience am necessary toi the completeness of the whole let roe then give you a somewhat minute account of my tour of the past lortnight although the narration may seem somewhat tedious i will commence with thursday the twen tyfourth day of maya day memorable for the exhibition of american incivility rcde ness and brutality in eompany with two english ladies newly arrived in this country and with whom i became acquainted during my sojourn in england and who have since then taken a lively interest in the cause of emancipation and the elevation of the oppressed in this land took passage from albany for new york on the steamboat alida commanded by capt frederick w stone having paid first class fare we repaired to the saloon deckthe better to view and enjoy the vatied am magnificent scenery on this the most beautiful of all american rivers there were a large number of passengers on board and we were necessarily thrown at times inclose contactalthough we preferred in view of the savage looks with which we were regarded by them to avoid all conversation our party however was soon joined by the rev mr williams of cincinnatia presbyterian minister deeply interested in the antislavery cause and who desired to gain information respecting the condition of the free colored people mr williams proved to be a valuable accession to our circlebeing the only american on board who had learned to esteem a colored man as a man and a brother the forenoon passed off pleasantly my english friends were absorbed in contemplating the grandeur and beauty which everywhere rose around them though assailed with malignant frowns and fiendish grimaces from the american ladies and gentlemen it was pleasant to have the opportunity of pointing out to these strangers some of the splendid beauty of american scenery they had often rode and walked with me to see and enjoy sights curious in works of art as well as natural beauty while in their own land and had been to me devoted friends in a strange country and it afforded me great gratification to be able in a small measure to reciprocate the many attentions which they had so kindly extended to roe while in england jt was easy to see however that this very pleasure gave rise to bitter feelings of env and hatred among the white american pas sengerswho could not see with patience a colored gentleman enjoying society from which they jffre debarred in some cases by tbeir own waqt of refinement and good man uers a feverish excitement revealed itself among them in low and muttering accents of which of course i was much better informed than the kind friends with whom was in company a knowledge of this uncomfortable state of mind among the passengers so far from driving me from the side of my friends only served to increase my indifference to their selfimposed agonywell knowing that the malign spirit within them would only be appeased and not expelled by an opposite course we walked and talked together upon the saloon deck giving no heed to looks or remarks which might be lavished upon us my conduct was governed by what deemed was becoming a man without once i considering my color or the estimate which a j corrupt and slaveholding people bad set upon me and with the help of god my conduct shall always conform to this high principle as the best and ooly means to put to j shame and silence the mean and vulgar feelj ing so often misnamed prejudice against color all parties on board with evident difficulty j restrained their pentup wrath until noon day myaeif and friends had taken a very light breakfastand that at a very early hour in the morningand were therefore quite prepared for our dinner even before the usual time for dioing and agreeably to a notice on each side of the captains office that passengers can have meals served at ail hours by applying to the steward in the cabtn at the suggestion of my friends i went below in company with the rev mr williams and j ordered dinnerwhich was informed should j be ready soon went upon the upper deck j again and joined my friends assuring them j that dinner would be readj in a little while at half past twelve oclock the dinner bell sounded and as usual on american steamers with a now or never expression the passengers rushed to the cabin and to the tables in it not wishing to display an undue avidity myself and friends did not join the hun j gry looking throng until most of them had i reached the saloon and were comfortably seated upon entering the cabin we found a table comparatively unoccupiedonly three or four persons seated at ooe end of it the table was covered with empty dishes sod there was no food upon it mr williams was seated on ooe nde and the ladies on the other i was seated at the end of the table amoog the white passengers an ominous lence prevailed it was not the silence of secret thanksgiving to god for the many mercies sod blessings he had so bountifully bestowed upon them but the silence of a venomous reptile when about to coil itself about iu prey to crush and sting it to death or like that of a taco when carefully adjusting his iopn is the top of a tree with s view of strangling the unsuspecting traveler a fiery mahee rankled in their wicked hearts and they only waited for the signal to commence an assault upon myaeif aad friends this signal was soon gives the steward of the alida a white man stepped towards me and ordered me to leave the table i rammed my place aad saqam by what a lbor f he presumed thus iasah roe he lafemed me that he was the steward of the host and that i mast leave the table se k wes agaiaet the mlee of the host for nr tosh si the table is that cabin with white persona sddiog that knew that soak were the rules of the boat denied possessing this knowledge and requested la see the raise since ibad not seen any sorb role aaong the pnb j imbed rules of the boat perplexed by my resolute adherence to my the re monstrances of myself and friends against the cruel injustice and brutal indignity thus of feted us the steward left the cabin and ourselves seated as at first at the table duriog this time the few white passengers who had i seated themselves at our table arose amt left us in undisputed possession of it whether these had departed because we were at the t table or because the prospect of getting anything to eat seemed gloomy i know not but if any thing is to be learned from looks they arose in vindication of the native dignity of highborn american gentlemen silence continued at the other tables the servant had not yet arrived with his force to remove me j and all were waiting to see a brother man brutally dragged from the dinner table because god had given him a skin not colored like their own looked around over the multi j tude with a view to observe the tone of feeling among the passengers all was fire and fury i could not detect the slightest indignation at the outragebut all looked fiendishly happy in what was passing feeling assured that it would only afford the multitude pleasure to see my person bruised and my clothes torn off in the effort to drag me out jat the suggestion and entreaty of one of ray friends i left the table my friends were told that they could have their dinners and that they need not leave the tablethat i was he person they wished to remove but they nobly preferred fasting with the despised to feasting with the haughty as we left tiiei cabin at the command of the captain and the cierkwho had now returned with the stew ardthere were given several rounds of np plaus to ihe captain for what seemed to them a brilliant victory two gentlemen aad two ladies had been deprived of their din nerstruly a fitting occasion to be celebrated i about two hours after the dinner of ihe whites was over i went below and enquired of the steward if he would serve us w th dinner alone he answered in an angry tone that it was after dinner hour i reminded him that i had called upon him for dim erin due time and that it was too bad to put tisj off by saying that we were now too late hethen asked me if i were the servant of those ladies and said if snch were the case he j would prepare dinner and on no other terms i assured him in a rather provoking manner that i was the servant of those ladies but he refused to believe it so we got no dinner j that day and ate nothing from si clock in the itioming till eight oclock at night thus ended a bitter and malicious insult loa man solely because of the complexion with which god in his wisdom had seen fit to clothe him we eommend it as an apt commentary on american freedom manners and civilization let the fact be handed around at home and abroad as a fair sample of what the colored man has to encounter in his progress from degradation to respectability fh j the cabin of the alida j would hare been quite welcome as a servant the fact that was there as a gentlemena passengerpro voked the insult but we must pass by this for the present on fridayggg th of may i arrived in j philadelphia here the scene of constant insult and brutal treatment through which in company with my friends i had passed gave place to a warm and friendly reception this reception j and the interesting meetings which we had j the pleasure to address were full compensation for all the uncivil and cruel behavior exj perienced on the journey from albany to new york the meeting in philadelphia on fridayi evening was held in the st marys street church and was composed of a small company of the most intelligent and respectable part of the colored people of that city slightly mixed here and there with white persons aftei addressing the meeting about an hour and a half i gave place to dr elder who being called upon responded in a speech of singular beauty and power it was well adapted to the occasion and made a deep impression upon the assemblage before him he took up the subject of prejudice against color exposed its hollow pretences gave the american colonization society a powerful rebuke and concluded with an admirable exhortation j to faithfulness and persevere nee in the efforts making to attain our freedom and equality on the american soil the spell of eloquence was thrown over the charmed and delighted audience by this master spirit and i have noj doubt they went home with higher hopes and j aims than when they came together at the close of this meeting another wasj announced for the next evening to be held ui the brick wesley church this meeting was largely attended the intermediate ume on saturday was mainly spent in visaing the ladies connected with the womens association these ladies are devoting tbeir energies to improve j the condition and character of the oppressed at the north as well as to the freedom of the enslaved at tbe south they number only thirteen at preseat and i believe do not desire to enlarge llieir associationhaving seen the folly of imrgt hot inactive associations for promoting moral aed philanthropic objects these ladies share the confidence and esteem of the whole community and can at any time obtain the aid and assistance of large numbers when they lead the way in measures of immediate practical importance at present they are devoting theu mean to sustain the north star believing thst in thie way they can moot effectually aid the cause of freedom aad improvemsut to these ladies the north star has ah j rady been largely indebted for aroietance is rims of need it was ehieiy through them that a fair was held in philadelphia last winter in aid of the north star aad duj nag our recent visit to that city finding uut tfce peper was in great need they generously doomed thirtythree dollars for io relief expect in the eonrar of a few weeks to lay before our readers an appeal from these fed behalf of their contemplated fair to beheld thro winter it certainly worthy i wtab w ell to ihe colored people of this count j rr and i have io doubt that it will receive large share of encouragement os monday tth mav i was the spectator l and an actor with others in ar afforung i scene it was the opening of the oiivp emetery m vcoent of which has alrevdv

servjce is to be erected on the ground the cornerstone of which was laid wih all fh so em nittesof consecration hv rev win douglas while i felt highly gratified by the spirit tha j suggested nd the hands that executed tbi highly commendable work i was dw pained in view of the necessity which c m pellcd them to ihe measure that ece is found in the cruel and relentless h a j r manifested towards the colored man which pursues him not only while in being but to the very gates of eternity denying him a pectable grave being excluded from th cemeteries of the whites the colored p mpi have until lately been able to bury their dea in tbeir ow n church yards but this can no longer be done without great expense and they have therefore found it necessary to purchase the cemetery in question but i am happy to be assured by the proprietors thit while the colored dead may repose here the remains of no white person will be excluded there will be no distinctions tolerated in olive cemetery a noble example from which cur oppressor mav learn an in portant lesson byberryon monday evening heil a meeting iu the above place a heavy ram and muddy roads as well as u proslavm neighborhood prevented a large attendance at the meeting but the few present listened with attention though with no signs of appr batton antislavery is evidently a very unpopular cause in byberry and to he an abolitionist there in the true meaning of the word must require no small amount of true moral courage was of course heaittiy received and cheered by our anuslaverv friends robert purvis and henry bow manr di rom the inifktrtial citizen but the most extraordinary meeting ot the series attended was that at zion church on thursday evening the th that meeting was called and the house obtained by and fot j r garnet and myscli in connection with mr bibb by our arrangement mr b was first to speak and garnet and i to follow bibb having heard his remarks position and motives attacked on tuesday evening felt himself called upon to defend himself against mr douglass opposition and imputations immediately upon mr bs taking his seat i douglass arose claimed the floor and seemed determined to speak irrespective of the rights and wishes ot the callers ami holders of the meeting after declaring my public and open j resistance to mr douglass claims in the matter and after speaking out my own views by courtesy mr douglass was permitted to speak and in his speech lie opposed again the giving of the bible to the enslaved mr j garnet lose to speak afterwards and upon asking mr douglass a question though uot yielding the floor mr douglass after answering the question insisted upon having the floor for an extended reply mr garnet did not give up the floor knowing that ail laws of pailimentary usage and gentlemanly intercourse entitled him to the undistnrtmmj the floor and though mr douglass who had boasted that ho was no obscure man in the antislavery cause being well known in this country and in england must have known what mr garnetfc rights were he persisted in claiming the floor until midnight when the meeting broke up in confusion the meeting of w hich the above purports to be a description has not been before referred to by me in the columns of the north star a feeling of delicacy prevented m taking advantage of my position as editor to vindicate my course at a public meeting w here i had an opportunity to do so on the spot andi should not now reler to the matter but for the uncandid and onesided statement made by mr ward in the foregoing article i can scatcely concede how an honest titan witnessing the facts as they there transpired could pen such an article as the one in question it is a misrepresentation from beginning to end and duty to myself not less than to the cause demands at my hands a correct statement of the whole affair i attended the meeting on thursday evening the tenth of may just as i would attend any other antislavery meeting and although j mr garnet mr bibk and mr ward had been advertised to speak i did not suppow that the fact of hiicli an advertisement neee sarily excluded all others front participating in the deliberations of the meeting had i supposed so i would as readily have lieen found in a whig caucus as in such a meetinghav ing long since resolved to countenance no meetings of a pretended antislavery character where the right of speech is dented to the humblest advocate of the slave mr ward represents me as having at a previous meeting attacked the motives of mr biss id ny it ami so i declared at the very meeting mr ward ha undertaken to describe had he desired to represeat rue as i reprmmatej myself no man could have done it liettei but having a cause to serve he conveniently tor gets my statement and puts words in tnv mouth as men will often do when the wish is father to the thought mr wasp declares that i rose to speak irrespective of tie rights and wishes of the callers and holder of the meeting this statement ts totallv incorrect so far from rising in opposition to their wishes briefly requested th privilege to be heard and waited patiently on my legs for several minute and did not attempt to speak until informed by the chairman that u proceed with nay remarks would be in order this mr ward knows very well according to mr wards statement the reader would imagine that was treated iu the most courteous mavner by himaeif and mr gar met i coulees i never was treated more rudely the moment arose to reply to the misstatements and insinuations thrown outby mr biss impeaching my religious char aeter misrepresenting mf religious faith ota king me out an enemy to the bible and gif mg that aa a reason for my opposition to the impracticable scheme of sending bibles to tbe slave mr garnet rose and proposed to takeup a collection for defraying the expense ot the meetingremaining on his feet tbe while giving the audience to understand that they were now to witneas an engagement and that h waa dangerous to defer the collection until the skirmish was over at the close of ths collection i again rose to speak whereupon i was creamed down tv mr garnet who proposed to mg writ on ot which hei the author after singing about twelve reries i again rose to speak at the call of the meeting hut was again silenced by the superior vocal powers of mr aid who insisted that had no tight to speak in that meeting and went on with a long speech presenting the claims of the impartial citizen to the uppnrt of the colored people after which he and a number of others waned on the congregation with slips of paper and pencil ii hand to record thpir names and to receive their cash this continued until nearly half past ten oclock and before which time i iiad done nothing more than to ask the small privilege of speaking having secured their collection sung mr garnets song obtained ill the subscriber that they could hope to do md completed their speechesthe audience appearing tired out and desirous to depart ihc chairman very graciously informed me ihat i now would is allowed to speak va ling mvsclf of this opkrtunity i rose rid occupied the attention of the audience for it thirty minutesconcluding my retnatks submitting the question as to the corrects of my views watch resulted m a gencr i response on their pan of rightright nght then sat down when mr bibb ommeneed a reply but trom some cause or oilier the audienc appeared unwilling to i heat him whereupon mr garnet again look the floorthe fourth lime during the veiling at this point i was about leaving the houie it being near oclock but while in the act of so doing mr garnet ro jucsted me to answer a question to w hich responded yy hen in the middle of the sentence he insisted that had said enough and shouted with the wildest apparent excitement i have the floorl have the floorl have the floor jvrceiving thru mr garni had resolved to misrepresent me and by garbling mv sentence make me say the veiy opposite of what i intended lobe understood i insisted that inasmuch as i had been called bv name to answer the question and that as j lie luui man had allow ed me thus to lie called i right to answer on parliamentary as well ji morally groundswas indisputable i therefore held tnyright to the floor but icpeatedly declared not only my willingness inn my happiness to yield it at any moment her i should be allowed to

england was annually dry only threequarters oi an inch of having fallen at liverpool the smallest nuantiiy ever known there oloved fttisews of c r nnuti on a recent visit to this city there was marked difference between the appearance of thing at that and the same time one year ago then all seemed life gaiety and pfe sure recently in consequence of the prevalence of two loathsome and terrible epidemic the small pox and cholera gloom and sadness prevaded the whole city and were depicted on every countenance the malady prevailed to an alarming extent and yet not to the extent that reasonably might be expected considering the dense population of tire city which number within it proper bound eighty thousand souls the suburb included numbering one hundred and ten thoosand inhabitant the highest number of deaths by the cholera m any one day reported by the sanatory committee did not exceed fortyone which is but one to every two thousand inhabitants of the city proper and a fraction more than one to every three thousand of the whole population still the people wete much alarmed especially the colored people who probably died in greater proportion to their number than the white which may easily be accounted for by the sumptuous living as it is known that this class of citiaeus are among the most sumptuous livens in any community and were this not the case in this instance they being fewer in number and consequently more generally acquainted the intelligence of the death of one more readily reaches the whole hence the more general alarm among this class of citizens but the colored citizens of cincinnati are decidedly progressive they are advancing in the march of reform enterprise and elevation at present the schools are deficient there lieing no high school or one at which the l advanced branches of literature are taught and no good common school save one under the control of miss ann e loe an excellent amiable young colored lady at which the minor branches are taught to children yet we discovered a praiseworthy improvement in many j of the misses and former pupils of gilmers late high school the progres in music by several of the young ladies is beyond expectation and such as redounds to their reputation indeed the young girls in general are much in advance of the boys the latter appear to have no elevated conception t of their importance as prosjiective members of societytheir destiny as men and fathers or the place and station they should occupy as enterprising useful business members of the community a disposition on the part of some to swagger and boast dare and bravado is too apparent to escape rebuke and we should feel that we were derelict of duty did such conduct escape rebuke at our hands we again repeat that the young wome i in general are in advance of the young mea ini i the march of improvement and enterprise the young women without means and pai rents able to support them at home without work resort to trades as a means of livelihood i as noticed on a former occasion they are rnantuamakers milliners tailoresses dressmakers and various other kinds of respectable trades and employment while the young men in general resort to the pantries and cookhouses of steamboatsthe diningrooms of hotels and private houses we hare now am especial reference to that large class of young people coming up and those emerged into man and womanhood the reasonable exceptions always admitted there is a praiseworthy persevering industry about our cincinnati young females that we cannot forego complimenting let them perseveretheir example is well worthy of imitation by our young women everywhere get tradeswe tell our young people they must have trades they must be qualified to do business will not the young men of cincinnati as well as the young women arouse will not they awaken to a high sense of their duty and the obligations they owe to society in this respect posterity will hold you responsible for your present course your opportunities are gold enwhy not reap the rich fruit thereof among the citizens of age and maturity there are several splendid enterprise in successful operation there are several bathing j establishments extensively carried on all under the proprietorship of colored men there is a respectable share of the market trade carried on by colored men though there is noj colored butcher holding a shamble in the markets several of the gteengroceries or steamboat provision shops are kept by colored j men with whom many of the very first class steamers of the upper and lower trade deal and frequently make large bills which are cashed on representation aud receipted by the holders or frequently notes given which j are held by the recipients or traded off in the course of business carried on in good faith between the parties though frequently the fitst party is a slaveholder as many of those southern steamers by slaveholders and the clerks sons of slaveholdf ers this is frequently the case where the captain aud clerk are owners or part owner of the boats they command several confectionaries and handsome re i freshment saloons have been established during the last and current year all of which j promise w ell in business according to the season butler and oharras sycamore st the principal one of these is quite an elegant establishment at w hich all respectable persons are accommodated and where the whites do not refuse to trade because the proprietors are j colored the various other tradesmen such as carpenters cabinetmakers smiths shoemakers aud tailors we mentioned on another occasion but since our former visit to this city there has been another tailor and several shoemakers added to the number of that class of tradesmen and also a number of plaster

to get his house open for the first of august against the arrival of frederick douglass mr brisco deserves great credit for hisi energy and perseverance in this enterprise as well as mr willcox as both of them have added fifty per cent to the character of the spirit of the colored men in that place and such a house as mr b is building has long been wanted in that city as well as many others for

consisting of wm c nell m w gibbs d peck was then sent out who reported the preamble and first and fourth resolutions fol lowing whereas information has reached the united states ot an effort now being put forth in great britian by a rev miller to invoke the sympathy and aid of english philanthropists in behalf of the inhuman antirepublican and antichristian scheme of the americah colonization society and whereat said miller is aiming to effect that mission by the stupendous misrepresentation that we the colored citizens of the united states are manifesting our approbation of said scheme of expatriationtherefore  resolved that wedoas we ever have since its formation protest against the operations and influence at home or abroad of the american colonization society recognizing in its every feature the twin ally of the southern slave system and most prolific contributor to that spirit of caste which retards the elevation of the nominally free colored americans  resolved that with a similar spirit to that which actuated our fathers in to take a determined stand against the scheme lof the american colonization society we hereby soimnly pledge ourselves never to cooperate with them in their diabolical measures but to remain in the country that gave us birth  resolved that we can never separate ourselves from the three millions of our fellowmen in slavery but remain and aid as

friend at the last facetoface in teiview we had thou wilt recollect that our conversation was upon the subjects which i have chosen for a heading to this lettersub jects of such a public nature aed general in tetest that i have chosen to refer to them through the press why is it thoa asked that abolitionists are saying that free labor is cheaper than slavo labor and yet tell us that free labor products are higher than such products grown bys aves this question of thine was sog guested probably by a remark of mine that a stolen horse or watch may be sold at a lower price than the same article obtained honestly that slaves being originally stolen and the slaveholder having no other than a stolen right the avails of slave labor being consequently stolen property such property may be sold cheaper than the same property procured by paid labor give the southern planter the same opportunity in carrying on business by the system of free labor that he can have in a free statein other words let the entire state in which he may reside be one in which slavery is not toleratedand there is hardly a doubt but in the end of a series of years the free labor planter would be more prosperous than a planter starting with the same capital in an adjoining slave state we have only to compare ohio with kentucky new york with virginia and massachusetts with south carolina to be convinced of the fact i think this remark will apply to individuals as well as states it may consequently with some propriety be said that if slaveholders at the south would consent to emancipate their slaves without compensation to themselves the rise of their lands would very soon amply make up the apparent loss it will not be questioned that the products of a free state i such as grain cattle agricultural implements boots and shoes c c can be and are afforded cheaper than the same articles in a slave stale were theie uo more obstacles lo free labor to encounter in a slave state than in a free i statewages being the same ki boththy question would be a pertinent one but sucli not being the case and there being too great inconvenience and much expense in keeping free or paidlabor products unmixed both in ihe raw material and the manufactories there are verygood reasons why honestlyprocured articles may demand a higher price than those obtained dishonestly even when upon a general principle and in the long run free labor is cheaper than slave lalxtr if however i have failed satisfactorily to explain this seeming discrepancy there is no good reason for us to go with the multitude to do evil thou art aware my friendf that slavery could not exist to much extent were there no market for the avails of slave labor and as a matter of course that every one who partakes of slavegrown sugar and slavelabor cotton is accessary to the crime of slavery hast thou been made free from the bondage of sin and transgression and yet encouraging a system by which both soul and body are brought into bondage a system which is the greatest plaguespot and scourge of our nation a system the countenancing of which has wellnigh ruined our once highlyfavored society a system in which more crime and misery are involved than any ever before invented by man allow rue to ask thy serious attention to this subject was thy wife or my daughter in the prisonhouse of slavery we snould both feel a lively interest in this subject have we any authority either from scripture or friends principles to think of or remember those in bonds any the less because we are not nor any of out families are noi in bondage i for the diffusion of light and dissemination of truth upon this and every other subject that may propeily claim our attention thy friend l mabbett leave physic alone and the cholera will leave voc alone one of the commonest pieces of stupidity in civilized communities is the taking of physic for the purpose of keeping well in the alarm caused by the cholera this fatal folly is carried to intolerable excess people think they may fall sick or fancy that they are so already and rush to any and swallow the last nostrum which they have seen advertised ia ihe papers or which is paraded in some staring handbill along the streets who knows what amount of oils panaceas purges and other diabolic inventions not fit to pitched into a common sewer have been forced down the

whether prescribed by regular or irregular faculty keep clean be temperate and regular to your habits eat moderately of ordinary wholesome food and take no medicine because you think won had better or because some advertisement cries it up as a pi events live or becaase some good natured friend counsels it if you are sick or think so go to some doctor in whom you can confide nod follow his advice

reply win that be would pray if htn oon gregauon desired it but ha was very nut it would not rain until the wind shifted u wai in the latter end of that pinel who had been appointed sometime before medical superintendent of the bicetre the madhouse of paris urgently applied for permission from the authorities to abolish the use of the irons with which the lunatics were then loaded unsuccessful but resolved to gain his object he repeated his complaints with redoubled ardor before the commune of paris and demanded the reform of this barbarous system citizen replied one of the members of the commune tomorrow will pay you and bicetre a visit but wo to you if you deceive us and are concealing the enemies of the people amongst your madmen the member of the commune who spoke thus wascouthoe the next day he arrived at the bicetre couthon was himself perhaps as strange a sight as that which he had come to see deprived of the use of both his legs he was always carried about on mens shoulders and thus mounted and deformed he with a soft and feminine voice pronounced sentences of death for death was the only logic at that moment couthon wished to see and personally to question the lunatics one after another he was conducted to their quarter of the building but to all his questions he recieved but insults and sanguinary addresses and heard nothing amidst the confused cries and mad howling but the chilling clank of the chain reverberating through the disgustingly dirty and damp vaults soon fatigued by the monotony of the spectacle and the futility of his inquiries couthon turned round to pinel and said ah citizen are not you yourself mad to think of unchaining such animals citizen replied the other i am convinced that these lunatics have become so unmanageable solely because they are deprived of air and liberty and i venture to hope a great deal froma thoroughly different method well then do what you like with them give them up to you but i fear you will fall a victim to your pre sumption now master of his actions pinel commenced the next day his enterprise the real difficulties of which he had never for a moment disguised from himself he contemplated liberating about fifty madmen without danger to the more peaceable inmates he decided to unchain but twelve as a first ex perimentthe only precaution he judged necessary to adopt was to prepare an equal number of waistcoats those made of stout linen with long sleeves and fastened at the back by means of which it js easy to prevent a lunatic doing serious mischief the first whom pinel addressed was the oldest in this scene of misery he was an english captain his history was unknown and he had been com fined there for forty years he was considered the most fc dl his keepers even approacuu with caution for in a fit of violence he had struck one of the servants with his chains and killed him on the spot he was more harshly treated than the others and this severity and complete abandonment only tended still more to exasperate his naturally violent temper pinel entered his cell alone and addressed him calmly captain said he if i take offyour chains and give you liberty to walk up and down the yard will you promise rne to be reasonable and to injure no one will promise you but you are making game of me they are all too much afraid of mo even you your self no indeed im not afraidreplied pinel for i have six men outside to make you respect me but believe my word confide in me and be docile i intend to liberate you if you will put on this linen waistcoat in place of your heavy chains the captain willingly agreed to all they required of him only shrugging his shoulders and never uttering a word in a few minutes his irons were completely loosened and the doctor and his assistants retired leaving the door of his cell open several times be stood up but sank i down again he had been in a sitting posture for such a length of time that he had almost lost the use of his limbs however at the end of a quarter of an hour he succeeded in preserving his equilibrium and from the depth of his dark cell lie advanced tottering towards the door his first movement was to look up at the heavens and to j cry out in ecstacy how beautiful during the whole day he never ceased running up and down ihe stairs always exclaiming how beautiful how i delightful in the evening he return i ed of his own accord to his cell slept tranquilly on a good bed which had been provided for him in the meantime and during the following two years which he spent at the bicetre he never again had a violent fit he even made himself useful exercising a certain authority over the other lunatics governing them after his fashion and establishing himself as a kind of superintend ent neighbor in captivity was not less worthy of pity he was an old rench officer who had been in chains for the past thirty years having been b icted with one of those terrible re jhgious monomonins of we even i adaya such frequent example oi weak understanding and lively imagination he conceived himself destin iron tonne baptism of blood that is to say to kill his fellowcreature m order to save them from hell and to send them straight to heaven there to oojoy the felicuy of the bleued this horrible idea was the c u of hi committing a frightful crime he commenced hi homicidal mimion by plumr f heart of hi own child hewa declared inaane confined for life in the bieetre and had keen afflicted for yean with this revolt i madnee calmnese at length returned but without ream be cat on astone silent and itnmovaole resembling an emanciated spectre of remorse his limits were still loaded with the same irons as when first he was confined but which he had no longer strength to lift l they were left on him ns much from habit as from the remembrance of his crime his case was hopeless ur pinel had him carried to a bed in the infirmary his legs however were so stiff and contracted that all attempta to beud failed in this state he lived a few months longer and then died without being aware of his release the third presented a strong contrast he was a man in the prime of life with sparkling eyes his bearing haughty and gestures dramatic in hisjroutb he had been a literary character he was gentle witty and had a brilliant imagination he composed romances full of lore expressed in impassioned language he wrote unceasingly and in order to devote himself with greater ardor to his favorite compositions he ended by locking himself up in his room often passing the day without food and the night without sleep to complete all an unfortunate passion added to his excitement he fell in love with the daughter of one of his neighbors she however soon grew tired of the young author was inconstant to him and did not even allow him the consolation of a doubt during a whole year the anguish of the poor dreamer was the more bitter from concealmentat length one fine day he saw the absurdity of his despair and passing from one extreme to the other gave himself up to every kind of excess his reason fled and taken to the bicetre in a raging fit he remained confined lor twelve years in the dark cell where pinel found him flinging about his chains with violence this madrpan was more turbulent than dangerous and incapable of understanding the good intended to him it was necessary to employ force to loose his irons once he felt himself at liberty he commenced running round and round the courtyard until his breath failing he fell down quite exhausted this excitement continued for some weeks but unaccompanied by violence as formerly the kindness shown to him by the doctor and the especial interest lie took in this invalid soon restored him to reasonunfor tunately he was permitted to leave the asylum and return to the world then in such a state of agitation he joined the political factions of the day with all the vehemence of his passions and was beheaded on the bth thermidor pinel entered the fourth cell it was that of chevinge whose liberation was one of the most memorable events of that day chevinge had been a soldier of the french guard and had only one fault that of drunkenness but once the wine mounted into his head he grew quarrelsome violent and most dangerous from his prodigious strength frequent excesses caused his dismissal from his corps and he soon squandered his scanty resources at length shame and misery plunged him in despair and his mind became affected he imagined that he had become a general and fought all who did not acknowledge his rank it was at the termination ofa mad scene of this kind that he was brought to the bicetre in a state of fury he had been chained for ten years and with stronger fetters than his companions for he had often succeeded inbreaking his chains by the mere force of his hands once in particular when by this means he had obtained a few moments of liberty he defied all the keepers together to force him to return to his cell and only did so after compelling them to pass under his uplifted leg this inconceivable act of prowess he performed on the eight men w ho were trying to master him from henceforth his strength became a proverb at the bicetre by repeatedly visiting him pinel discovered that good dispositions lay hidden beneath violence of character constantly kept excited by cruel treatment on one occasion he promised to ameliorate his condition and this promise alone had greatly tranquilized him pinel now ventured to announce to him that he should no longer be forced to wear his chains and to prove that i have confidence in you added he and that i consider you to be a man capable of doing good you shall assist me in releasing those unfortunate individuals who do not possess their reason like you if you conduct yourself properly as i have cause to hope you will i shall then take you into my service and you shall not leave me never in the mind of man was there seen so sudden or complete a change the keepers themselves were forced to respect chevinge from his conduct no sooner was he uuchaioed than he became docile attentive watching every movement of pinel so as to execute his orders dexterously and promptly addressing words ol kindness and reason to those lunatics with whom he had been on a level but a tew hours previously but in whose presence he now felt the full dignity of liberty this man who had been unhumanized by his chains during the best years of his life and who doubtless would have dragged on this agonizing existence for a considerable length of time became at once a model of good conduct and gratitude frequently in those perilous times he saved pinel s life and one day amongst others rescued him from a band of ruffians who were dragging him off la lanieme an elector of fe during a threatened iamine he every morning left the bicetre and never returned without provisions which at that moment were unpurchaseable even for gold the remaider ofhis life was but line coiiuuueu ci of devotion to his lib erator next room to chevinge three unfortunate soldiers had in phnna fna fears without any one knowing the cause of this rigor they were gene j rally quiet and inoffensive speaking ony to each other and that in a language unintelligible to the rest of the prison era they had however been grant sd the only privilege which the seem d capable of appreciating that of be flf always together m the sane cell w hen they became aware of a change j their usual mode of treatment the inspected it te proceed from u amend emote and violoatly opposed the mp ji loosening of their irons when liberated thepr would not leave their prison ij either from grief or want of understanding these unhappv cretures were insensible to the liberty now offered to them i after them came singular person i age one of those men whose malady is the more difficult of cure from its be j ing a fixed idea occasioned by exit cessive pride he was an old elergy i man who thought himself christ his i exterior corresponded to the vanity of ibis belief bis gait was measured and solemn his smile sweet yet severe forbade the least familiarity everything f even to the arrangement of his hair j which hung down in long curls on each i side of his pale resigned and expressive countenance gave him a singular resemblance to the beautiful bead of our i saviour if they tried to perplex him i and said if thou art him whom thou pretendest in short if thou art god break thy chains and liberate thyself he immediately with pride and dignity replied in vain shait thou tempt tny lord the sublimity of human arrogance in derangement the life olf this man was a complete romance in which religious enthusiasm played the first part he had made pilgrimages on foot to cologne and home and had then embarked for america where among the savages he risked his life in the hope of converting them to the true faith but all these travels all these voyages had the melancholy effect of turning his j ruling idea into a monomania on his return to france he publicly announced himself as him whose gospel he had been preaching far and wide seized and brought before the archbishop of paris he was shut up in the bicetre asa lunatic his hands and feet were loaded with heavy irons and for twelve years he bore with singular patience this long martyrdom and thr incessant sarcasms to which he was exposed argument with such minds is useless they neither can nor will understand it pinel therefore never attempted to reason with him he unchained him in silence and loudly commanded that every one for the future should imitate his reserve and never address a single word to this poor lunatic this line of conduct which was rigorously observed produced an effect on this selfconceit ed man far more powerful than the irons and the dungeon he felt himself hum bled by this isolation this total abandonment in the full enjoyment of his liberty at length after much hesitation he began to mix with the other in validsfrom that time forward he visibly improved and in less than a year was sufficiently recovered to acknowledge the folly of his former ideas and to leave the bicetre fifty lunatics were in this manner released from their chains in the space o a few days amongstthem were individuals from every rank of life and from every country hence the great amelioration in the treatment of insane patients which until then had been looked on as impracticable or at leasi fraught with the utmost danger how chlhinalsakt made from the prisoner friend the
