argument of charles sumner esq against the constitutionality of separate colored schools in the case of sarah c roberts vs the city of boston before the supreme court of mass dec  continued vii the court will declare the bylaw of the school committee of boston making a discrimination of color among children of the public schools to be unconstitutional and illegal although there are no express words of prohibition in the constitution and laws it is hardly necessary to say anything in support of this proposition slavery was abolished in massachusetts by virtue of the declaration of rights in our constitution without any specific words of abolition in that instrument or in any subsequent legislation commonwealth vs aves pick r the same words which are potent to destroy slavery must be equally potent against any institution founded on inequality or caste the case of boston vs shaw metcalf to which reference has been alcady made where a bylaw of the city was set aside as unequal and unreasonable and therefore void affords another example of the power which  oow invoke the court to exercise but authorities are not needed the words of the constitution are plain and it will be the duty of the court to see that these are applied to the discrimination of color now in question la doing this the court might justly feel great delicacy if they were called upon to revise a law of the legislature but it is simply the action of a local committee that they are to overrule they may also be encouraged by the fact that if is only to the schools of boston that their decision can be applicable the other towns throughout the commonwealth have already voluntarily banished caste in removing it from the schools of boston the court will bring them into muchdesired harmony with the schools of other towns and with the whole system of public schools in massachusetts am unwilling to suppose that there can be any hesitation or doubt tn coming to this conclusion but if any should arise there is a rule of interpretation which may be our guide it is according to familiar practice that every interpretation is made always in favor of life or liberty so here the court should incline in favor of equality that sacred right which is the companion oi these other rights in proportion to the importance of this right will the court be solicitous to vindicate it and uphold it and in proportion to ihe opposition which it encountres from the predjudi ces of society will the court brace themselves iu this task it has been pointedly remarked by rousseau that it is precisely because the force of things tends always to destoy equality that the force of legislation ought always to tend to maintain it central social iiv chap in similar spirit and for the same reason the court should always tend to maintain it there are other matters not strictly belonging to the juridical aspect ol the case ana yet of importance to its clear comprehension upon which i shall touch briefly bofore l close it is sometimes said in extenuation of the present system in boston that the separation of the white aud black children waa originally made at the request of the colored parents this is substantially true it appears from the iatefeetiog letter ofdr belknap in reply to judge tuckers queries respecting slavery in massachusetts written tithe dose of the last century masi hint jcall w that at that tima n rtght is of no sextruth is of no color discrimination on account of color was made in the public schools of boston the same provision he says is made by the public for the education of the children of the blacks as for those of the whites in this town the committee who superintend tho free schools have given in charge to the schoolmasters to receive and instruct black children as well as white dr belknap adds however that he has not hoard of more than three or four who have taken advantage of this privilege though the number of blacks in boston prooably exceeded one thousand it is to he feared that the inhuman bigotry of castesad relic of the servitude from which they had just es capedwas at this time too strong to allow colored children a kindly welcome in the free schools and that from timidity and ignorance they shrank from taking their places on the same benches with the white children perhaps the prejudice against them was so inveterate that they could not venture to assert their rights it appears that in a petition was presented to the school committee from sixtysix colored persons praying for the establishment of a school for their benefit private munificence came to the aid of the city and the present system of separate schools was brought into be ing these facts are interesting in the history of the boston schools but they cannot in any way affect the rights of the colored people or the powers of the committee these rights and these powers stand on the constitution and laws of the commonwealth without adopting tho suggestion of jefferson that one generation cannot by legislation bind its successors all must agree that the assent of a few persons nearly a century agoat the time when their rights were imperfectly understood to an unconstitutional and illegal course cannot alter the constitution and the laws and bind their descendants forever in the thrall of caste nor can the committee derive from this assent or from any lapse of time powers in derogation of the constitution and of the rights of manit is clear that the sentiments of the colored people have now changed the present case and the deep interest which they manifest in it thronging the court to hang on this discussion attest the change with increasing knowledge they have learned to know their rights and to eel the degradation to which they have been doomed their present effort is the token of manly character which this court will cherish and respect tb spirit ot paul now revives in them even as when he said i am a roman citi zen but it is said that these separate schools are for the mutual benefit of children of both colors and ofthe public schools in similar spirit slavery is sometimes said to be for the mutual benefit of master and slave and of the country where it exists in one case there is a mistake as great as ir the ather this is clear nothing unjust nothing ungenerous can be for the benefit of any person or anything shortsighted mortals may hope to draw from some seeming selfish superiority or from a gratified vanity of class a permanent good but evenhanded justice rebukes these efforts and with certain power redresses the wrong the whites thernselesjare injured by the separation who can doubt this with the law as their monitor they are taught to regard a portion of the human family children of god created in his image coequal in his love asa separate and degraded classthy are taught practically to deny that grand revelation of christianitythe brotherhood ofmankind their hearts while yet tender with childhood are necessarily hardened by this conduct and their subsequent lives perhaps bear enduring testimony to this legalized uncharitablcness nursed in the sentiment of caste receiving it with the earliest food of knowledge they are unable to eradicate it from their natures and then weakly and impiously charge upon their heavenly father the prejudice which they have derived from an unchristian school and which they continue to embody and perpetuate in their institutions their characters are debased and they become less fit for the magnanimous duties ofa good citizen the helots of sparta were obliged to intoxicate themselves that they might teach to the children of their masters the deformity of intemperance in thus sacrificing one class to the other both were degradedthe imperious spartan and the abased helot but it is with a similar doubleedged injustice tout the school committee of boston have acted in sacrificing the colored children to the prejudice or fancied advantage of the while it is fit that a child should be taught to shun wickedness and as he is yet plastic to receive impressions to shun wicked men horace was right when speaking of a person morally wrong false and unjust he called him black saying hie niger wt buac ta ronunt cafto the boston committee adopt the warning but apply it not to those black in heart but only black in skin they forget the admonition addressei i to the prophet but the lord said onto samuel look not on hi countenance for the lord seelh not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh at ik wt i samuel chap v who can say that this dew net io jure the blacks theirs in its best estate is an unhappy lot shut out by a still lingering prejudice from many social advantages a despised class they feel this proscription from the public schools as a peculiar brand beyond this it deprives them of those healthful animating influences which would come from a participation in the studies of their white brethren it adds to their discouragements it widens their separation from the rest of the community and postpones that great day of reconciliation which is sure to come the whole system of public schools suffers also it is a narrow perception of their high aim which teaches that they are merely to furnish to all the scholars an equal amount in knowledge and that therefore provided all be taught it is of little consequence where and in what company it be done the law contemplated not only that they shall all be taught but that they shall be taught all together tney are not only to receive equal quantities ol knowledge but all are to receive it in the same way all are to approach together the same common fountain nor can there be any exclusive scource for any individual or any class the school is the little world in which the child is trained for the larger world of life it must therefore cherish and develop the virtues and the sympathies which are employed in the larger world and since according to our institutions all classes meet without distinction of color in the perfonnrnce of civil duties so should they all meet without distinction of color in the school beginning there those relations of equality which our constitution and laws promise to all as the state receives strength from the unity and solidarity of its citizens without distinction of class so tho school receives new strength from the unity and solidarity of all classes beneath its root in this way the poor the humble the neglected share not only the companionship of their more favored brethren but enjoy also the protection of their presence in drawing towards the school a more watchful superintendence a degraded or neglected class if left to themselves will become more degraded or neglected to him that hath shall be given and the world true to these words turns from the poor and outcast to the rich and fortunate it is the aim of our system of public schools by the blending of all classes to draw upon the whole school the attention which is too apt to be given only to the favored few and thus secure to the poor their portion of the fruitful sunshine but the colored children placed apart by themselves are deprived of this blessing nothing is more clear than that the welfare of classes as well as of individuals is promoted by mutual acquaintance the french and english or a long time regarded as natural enemies have at list from amort inti mats communion found themselves tobe natural friends prejudice is the child of ignorance it is sure to prevail where people do not know each other society and intercourse are means established by providence for human improvement they remove antipathies promote mutual adaptation and conciliation and establish relations of reciprocal regard whoso sets up barriers there thwarts the ways ol providence crosses the tendencies of human nature and directly interferes with the laws of god may it please your honors such are some of the the things which it has occured to me to say in this important cause i have occupied much ol vour time but i nave not yet exhausted the topics still which way soever we tt rn we are brought back to one single proposition the equality of men before the laic this stands as the mighty guardian of the rights of the colored children in this case it is the constant everpresent tutelary genius of this commonwealth frowning upon every privilege of birth upon every distinction of race upon every institution ofscaste you cannot slight it or avoid it you cannot restrain it it remains that you should welcome it do this and your words will be a charter and freehold of rejoicing toa race which has earned by much suffering a title to much regard your judgement will become a sacred landmark not in jurisprudence only but in the history of freedom giving precious encouragement to alt the weary and heavyladen wayfarers in this great cause massachusetts will then through you have a fresh title to regard and be once more as in times past an example to the whole land you have already banished slavery from this commonwealth i call upon you now to obliterate the last of its footprints and to banish the lad of the hateful spirits in its train thal can be reached by this court the law interfering to prohibit marriagei between blacks and whites has beei abolished by the legislature th railroads which imitating the bostoi schools placed colored people in i ear by themselves have been compelled under the influence of an awaden ed public sentiment to abandon thi regulation and to allow them to mingle with other travellers it is only recently that i have read that his excellency the present govenor of msssa chusetts food his seat in a car by th side of a negro it is in the cast schools of boston that the prejudice t color has sought its final legal refugt it is for you to drive it forth you will when yon rebuke end correct is rochester n y friday march dividual offences but it is a higher office far to rebuke and correct a vicious institution each individual is limited in his influence but an institution has the influence of numbers organized bylaw the charity of one man may counteract or remedy the uncharitableness of an established institution against it private benevolence is powerless it is a monster which mast be hunted down by the public and by it constituted authorities arid sucvljg the institution of caste m the rublfc schools of boston w hich now awaits its jnst condemnation from a just court the civilization of the age joins in this appeal it is well known that this prejudice of color is peculiar to our country you have not forgotten that two youth of african blood only recently gained the highest honors inthe college at paris and dined on the same day with the king of france the descendant of st louis at the palace ol the tuilleries and let me add if may refer to my own experience that in paris i have sat for weeks at the school of law on the same benches with colored persons listening like myself to the learned lectures of dt grando and of rossithe last is ths eminent minister who has unhappily fallen beneath the dagger of a roman assassin nor do i remember observing in the throng of sensitive young men by whom they were surrounded any feeling towards them except of companionship and respect in italy at the convent of pallazuola on the shores of the alban lake and on the site of the ancient alba longa i have seen for several days a native ot abyssinia only recently conducted from his torrid home and ignorant of the language that was spoken about him yet mingling with the franciscan friars whose guest and scholar he was in delightful and affectionate familial i ty in these examples may be discerned the christian spirit and finally it is this spirit that invoke where this prevais there is neither jew nor gentile greek nor barbarian bond nor free but all are alike it is from this that we derive new and solemn assurance of the equality of mankind as an ordinance of god the bodies of men may be unequal in beauty or strength these mortal clouks of flesh inay differ as do theg worldly garments theag inj tellectual faculties may varyfc do the opportunities of action and trie advantages of position but amidst all unessential differences there isanesj sential agreement and equality dives and lazarus were equal in the sight j of god they must be equal in the sight of all just institutions but this is not all the vaunted superiority of the white race imposes upon it corresponding duties the faculties with which they are endowed and the advantages which they possess are to be exercised for the good of all if the colored people are ignorant degraded and unhappy then should they be the especial objects of your care l from the abundance of your possessions you must seek to remedy their lot and this court which is as a parent to all the unfortunate children of the commonwealth will show ftsclf most truly parental when it reaches down and with the strong arm of the law elevates encourages and protects its colored fellowcitizens from tke liberator last autumn when president

immoderate desires except by a harbor capacious and tran quit which only statesmen then foresaw would be useful in the oriental commerce oi a far distant if not merely chimerical future a year ago california was merely a mill tary dependency of ou own and we wen celebrating with enthusiasm and unanimity its acquisition with its newly discoveied bu yet untold and untouched mineral wealth at the most auspicious of many and unparaller achievements today california is a state more populous than the least and richer than several othe greatest of our thirty states the sami california thus rich and populous is heri asking admission into the union and finds u debating the dissolution of the union itself no wonder if we are perplexed with ever changing embarrassments no wonder if ware appalled by everincreasing responsib lilies no wonder if we are bewildered b the everaugmenting magnitude and rapidit of national vicissitudes shall california be received for myself upon my individual judgmei and conscience i answer yes for mysel as an instructed representatives of one of th statesof that one even of the statei which is soonest and longest to he presse into commercial and political rivalry by th new commonwealth answer yes lt california come in everv new state whether she comes from the or from th west coming from whatever part of the cor tinent she may is always welcome bu california that comes from the clime wher the west dies away into the rising east caiifornia which bounds at once the ernpii and the continentcalifornia the youthfi queen of the pacific in her robes of freedom gorgeously inlaid with gold is doubl welcome and now i inquire first why shoul california be rejected t all the objections ar founded only in the circumstances of he coming and in the organic law which sh piesenls for our confirmation first california comes unceremoniously without a preliminary consent of congress and therefore by usurpation this allegation i think is not quite trueat lea not quite true in spirit california is nc here of her own pure volition we tor california violently from her place in th confederation of mexican states flhd stipulated by the treaty of guadalupe hidalgi that the territory should be admitted by state into the american union as speedily as po aible but the letter of the objection still hold california did come without a preliminar eonsent by congress to form a constitution but michigan and other states presente themselves in the same unauthorized way and congress waived the irregularity an sanctioned the usurpation california plead these precedents is not the plea sufficient but it has been said by the honorabli senator from south carolina mr calhou that the ordinance of secured to michigan the right to become a state when sh should have sixty thousand inhabitants ow jng to some neglect congress delayed to tak the census and this is said in palliation othe case of michigan but california ahas been seen had a treaty and congress instead of giving previous consent and instead of giving her the accustomed territoria government as they did to michigan failei to do either an thus practically refused both and so abandoned the new community unde most unpropitious circumstances to anarchy california then made a constitution for herself but not unnecessarily and presumptuously as michigan did she made a constitu tton for herself and came here under the lav the paramount law of selfpreservation thiok she stands justified indeed california is more than justified she was a colony a military colony a colonies especially military colonies are incongruous with our political system and the are equally open to corruption and exposer to oppression they are therefore not more unfortunate iu their own proper condition than fruitful in dangers to the parent democracy california then acted well and wisely in establishing selfgovernment she deserves not rebuke but praise and approba tion nor does this objection come with good grace from those who offer it if california were now content to receive only a territoria charter we could not agree to grant it without an inhibition of slavery which in that case being a federal act of federal authority would render the attitude of california as a territory even more offensive to those whe bow repel her than she is as a state with the same inhibition in the constitution of hei own voluntary choice the second objection is that california has assigned her own boundaries without the previous authority of congress but she was left to organize heiaelf without any boundaries fixed by previous law or by prescription she was obliged tbeiefore tc assume boundaries since without boundaries ahe must have remained unorganized a third objection is that california is too large answer first there is no common standard of the size of states california though greater than many is less than one of the states second califordta if too large may be divided with her own consent and that is all the security we have fur reducing the magnitude and averting the preponderance of texas thirdly the boundaries of california seem not at all unnatural the territory circumscribed is altogether contiguous and compact fourth the boundaries are convenient they embrace only inhibited portions of the country connected with the port of san francisco no one has pretended to offer boundaries more in hai moy with the physical outlines of the re gioo concerned or more convenient for civil admission but to dw closer to the question what shall bo the boandaritw of s new state concerns first the slate herself and california of course is content seeoodly adjacent potmnumues oregon does not complain of sod there is no o her adjacent ootmuuu t cma plin thirdly the other states in die p n th larger the pmcc states the smaii r wiu relative power in the senate r states now mrs are atlantic states ana sttu and aurelv they may wall indulge california in the largest liberty of boundaries thefouith objection to the admission of california is that no previous census had been taken and no laws prescribing the qualification of suffrage and the apporuontnen of representatives in convention existed i answer california was left to act ah tmtio she must begin sometime without s census and without such laws ths pilgrim fathers began in the same way on board the mayflower and since it ia objected that some of the electors of california may have been aliens i add that all the pilgrim fatheta were aliens and strangers to the commonwealth of plymouth again the objection may well be received if the constitution of california is satisfac toryfirst to herself and secondly to the united slates as regards the first of these not a murmur of discontent baa followed california to this pbce and as to ourselves we confine our inquiries about the constitution with a view to four things first the boundaries assumed and i have considered that point in this case already second that the domain in this state ia secured to ua and it ia admitted that this has been doneproperly done third that the constitution should be republican and not aristocratic or monarchical in this case the only objection is that the constitution inasmuch as it inhibits slavery is altogether too republican fourth that the representation claimed shall be just and equal no one i denies that the population of california is sufficient to demaod two representatives on the federal basis and secondly a new census is at hand and the error if there be one will be immediately corrected the fifth objection ia that california comes under executive influences first in her coming as a free state and second in her coming at all the first charge rests on suspicion onlyis peremptorily denied and the denial is not controverted by proofs dismiss it altogether the second is true to the extent that the present president advised the people of california that having been left without any civil government under the military government of the executive without any authority of law whatever the adoption of a constitution subject to the approval of congress would be regarded favoiably by the president only ft year ago it was complained that the exercise of the militsry power to maintain law and order in california was a feaiful innovation but now the wind has changed and blows even stronger from the opposite quarter may this republic never have a president commit a more serious or more dangerous usurpation of power than the act ol the present eminent chief magistrate in endeavoring to induce the legislative authorities to relieve him from the exercise of military power by establishing civil instituuons regulated by law in distant provinces rome would have been standing this day if she had had such generals and such magistrates but the objection whether true in part or even in the whole is immaterial the question is not what moved california to impress any particular feature on her constitution nor even what induced her to adopt a constitution at all but it is whether since she has adopted a constitution she shall be admitted into the union i have now reviewed all the objections raised against the admission of california ii is seen that they have no foundation in law of nature and of nations nor are they found in the constitution for it prescribes no four or manner of ptoceeding in the admission ol new stales but leaves the whole to the discretion of congress congress may admit new states the objections are all merel formal and technical they rest on precedent which have not always nor even generallj been observed but it is said that we ought now to establish a safe precedent for the future i anewei it is too late to beize this occasion for tha purpose the irregularity complained of being unfavorable the caution should have beer exercised first when texas was annexed second when we waged war against mexico third when we ratified the treaty of gauda lupe hidalgo again we may establish pie cedents at pleasure our successors will exercise their pleasure about lollowing them just as we have done in such caves third states nations and empires are apt to be peculiarly capricious nut only as to the time but even as to the manner of their being bou and as to their subsequent political changes they are not accustomed to conform to precedents california sprung from the bead othe nation not only complete in proportion and fully armed but ripe for affiliation with m members i proceed now to state my reasons for the opinion that california ought to be admitted the population of the united states consisti of natives of caucasian origin and exotics ol the same derivation the native mass rapidly assimilates to itself and absorbs the exotic and those therefore constitute one homogenous people the african race bond and free and the aborigines savage and civilized being incapable of such assimiliation and absorption remain distinct and owing to their peculiar condition constitute inferior masses and may be regarded as accidental if not disturbing political forces the ruling homogenous family was planted at first on the atlantic shore and following an obvious law it seems continually and rapidly spreading itself westward year by year subduing the wildernesses and the prairie and thus extending this gieat political community which as fast as it advances breaks into distinct states for municipal purposes only while the whole constitutes one entire compact nation well established rules of political arithmetic enable us to say that the aggregate population of the nation now is millions that yeais hence it wili be millions years hence millions years hence millions years hence millions years hence millions and years hence millions but the advance of population on the pacific will far exceed what occurred on the atlantic coast while emigration even here is outstripping the calculation on which these eati tidies are based there are silver and goldin the mountains and ravines of california the granite of new eugland is barren allowing due consideration to the increasing density of the population we are safe in assuming that long before this mass shall havv attained the maximum of numbers indicated the entire width of our potsessionfrom the atlantic to the pacific ocean will be covered by it and be brought into social maturity and complete political organization the question now arises shall this one great people have common origin s common language a common religion common sentiment interests sympathies snd hopes remaining one political state one nation one republic or shall it be broken in two conflicting snd probably hostile nations or republics there cannot ultimately be more than two for the habit of association is already formed as the interests of mutual intercourse are forming and the centtal portions if they cannot command aoceas to both oceans will not be obstructed in their approach to that one which offers the greatest facilities to their commerce shall the american people then be divided before deciding on this question let us consider our position our powsr and capabilities the world contains no seat of empire so magnificent as this which while it embraces all the varying climates of the temperate zone and w traversed by wide expanding lakes and long branching rivete offers supplies on the atlantic ahore to the overcrowded nations of europe while on the pacific coast it intersects the commerce of the indies the nation thus situated and enjoying crests mineral and agricultural tecources ms equalled if they are endowed also with moral energies adequate to the achievement of tr teat enter prises sod favored with ago veto r s dir must command jr r which slime ii nal empire j we may claim to have inherited physical and intellectaa vigor courage invention and enterprise and the systems of edoeation prevailing among us open to all the mores of human science and art the old world and the past were allotted by providence to the pupilage of mankind sorter the violence of human passion the new world and the future seems to have been appointed for the maturity of mankind with the develepment of self government opening to reason and judgement we have tried our mortal systems of democratic federal government with its complex yet harmonious and effective combinations of distinct local elective agencies lor the conduct of domestic affairs and its common central elective agencies for the regulation of internal interest and of intercourse with foreign natrons and we know that it is a system equally cohesive in its parts and capable of all desiring expansion and that it it is a system moreover perfectly adapted to secure domestic tranquility while it brings into action all the elements of national aggrandizement the atlantic states through their commercial social and political affinities and sympathies are steadily renovating the governments and the social constitutions of europe and of africa the pacific states must necessarily perform the same sublime and beneficent functions in asia if then the american people shall remain one individual nation the ripening civilization of the west after a separation growing wider fur years will in its circuit of the world meet again and mingle with the declining civilization of the east on our free soil anda new and more perfect civilization will arise to bless the earth under the sway of our owd cherished and beneficent democratic institutions we may then reasonably hope for greatness felicity and renown excelling any hitherto attained bv any nation if standing firmly on the continent we loose not our grasp on the shore of either ocean whether a destiny so magnificent would be only partially defeated or whether it would be altogether lost by a relaxation of that grasp it passes our wisdom to determinate and happily is not important to be determined it is enough if we agree that expectations so grand yet so reasonable and so just ought not to be in any degree disappointed and now it seems to me that the perpetual unity of our empire hangs on the decision of this dav and of this hour california is already a statea complete and fully appointed stateshe never again can be less than that she can never again be a province or a colony nor can she be made to shrink and shrive into the proportions of af federal dependent territory california then henceforth and forever must be what she it nowa state the question whether sh shall be one of the united states of america has depended on her and on us her election has been madeour consent alone remains suspended and that consent must be pronounced now or never i aay now or never nothing prevents it now but want ol agreement among ourselves our harmony cannot inciease while this question remain open we shall never agree to admit california unless we agree now nor will california abide delay i do not say that she contemplates independence but she does not anticipate rejection do yoti say that she can have no motive consider then her attitude if rejected she needs i capital a legislature and magistrates eh needs titles to that golden domain of oun within her borders good titles too and yoc must give them on your own terms or sh must take them without vour leave sh needs a mint a custom house wharves hospitals and institutions of learning she needs fortificationsroads and railroads she needs the protection of an army and i navy eithci your stars and stripes niusi wave over her ports and her fleets or slu must raise aloft a standard for herself sh needs at least to know whether you ar fiiends or enemies and anally she needi what no ameiican community can live without sovereignty and independenceeither i just and equal share of yours or and independence of her own will you say that california could not aggrandize herself by separation would i then be a mean ambition tb set up within fifty years on the pacific coast monuments liki those which we think years have beei well spent in establishing on the atlantii i coast will you say that california has nt ability to become independent she has thi same moral ability for enterprise that inherei in us and that ability implies command of ati physicel means she has advantages ofpo i sitton she is practically further removed fron you than england you cannot reach he by railioad or by unbroken steamboat navigation you can send no armies over the prairie the mountain and the desert nor acroei the remote and narrow isthmus without t foreign jurisdiction nor around the cape o storms you may send a navy there bu she has ooly to open her mines and she car reduce your marine and appropriate youi floating bulwarks to her own defence le her only seize your domain within her borders and your commerce in her port and sh will have at once revenue and credit ade qaate to all her necessities beside are wt so moderate and has the world become so jus that we have no rivals and no enemies to len their sympathies and aid to compass the dismemberment of our empire try not tht temper or the fidelity of california at leas not now not yet cherish her and indulg her till you have extended your settlement to her borders aud bound her fast by railroads canals and telegraphs to your interests unti her affinities of intercourse are established anc habits of loyalty are fixed and then she cat never be disengaged california would not go alone oregon s intimately allied to her and as yet so loose attached to us will go also and then ai least the entire pacific coast with the wea tern declivity of the sierra nevada would be lost it would not depend at all on us not even on tbe mere forbearance of california how far eastward the long line across the temperate zone should be drawn which should separate the republic of the pacific from the republic of tho atlantic terminus haa passed awsy with all the deities of the ancient pantheon but hie scepter remains commerce is the god of boundaries and nc man now living can foretell his ultimata de cree but it is insisted that the admission ol california shall be attended by a compromise of questions which have arisen out ol slavery i am opposed to any such compromise in any and all the forms in which it has been proposed first because while admitting the purity and the patroitism of all from whom it it is my misfortune to differ i think all legislative compromises essentially and radically wrong and indefensible they involve the surrender of the exercise of judgement and conscience on distinct and separate questions at distinct and separate times with the indispensable advantages it affords foi ascertaining truth they involve a relinquishment of tbe tight to reconsider in future the decisions of the present on question prematurely antioipated and they are an usurpation as to future questions of the province of future legislators sir it seems to me as if slavery had laid its paralysing hand upon myself tnl the blood were coursing leas fteely than it wonl through my veins when i endeavor to suppose that such a compromise has been effected and my utterance forever is arrested upon l the great questions social moral and political arising oat of a subject so important and as yet so incomprehensible what am to receive in this compromise freedom in california it is well it is e noble acquisition but what am i to give up as on equivalent a recognition of the claim to perpetuate slavery tn the district of colombia forbearance toward more stringent laws concerning the arrest of persons suspected of being slaves found in tbe free stales for ueaanoe from the provjeo of freedom in the chtneis of new tm foot of the pun of compromise ofierod demand less than two and most of them insist on ail of these conditions the equivalent then is some portion of liberty some portion of homan rights io one region for liberty in another region bot california brings gold and commerce as well as freedom i am then io surrender some portion of human freedom in the district of colombia in east california and new mexico for the mixed consideration of liberty gold and power of the pacific coast this view of legislative compromises is not new it has widely prevailed and many of the state constitution interdict the introduction of more than one subject into one bill submitted for legislative action sirlt was of such compromises that burke said in one of the loftiest bursts of even hiß majestic psrlimentary eloquence far fat from the commons of great britain be all manner or real vice but ten thousand timet further from them as far as from pole to pole be the whole tribe of apu rious affected counterfeit and hypocritical virtues these are the things which are ten thousand times mote at war with real duty than any vice known by its name and distinguished by ita proper character far far from ua be that false and affectad candor that is eternally in treaty with crime that half virtue which like the ambiguous animal that plays about in the twilight of a compromise between day and night is to a just mans eye an odious and disgusting thing there is no middle point my lords in which the commons of great biitain can meet tyranny and oppression but sir could overcome my repugnance to compromise in general i should object to this on the ground of the inequality and incongruity of the interests lo be compromised why sir according to the views i have submitted california ought to come in and must come in whether slavery stands or falls in the district of columbiawhether slavety stands or falls in new mexico and eastern californiaand even whether slavery stands oi falls in the slave statescalifornia ought to come in and must come in at all events it is an independent question what then are these questions arising out of slavery thus interposedbut collateral questions they are unnecessary and incongruous and therefore false issues not introduced designedly indeed to defend that great policy yet unavoidably tending to the end jfc but consent on my part to the compromise would be disingenuous and fraudulent it ii now avowed b the hon senator from south catolina mr calhoun that nothing will satisfy the slave states but a compromise that will convince them that they can remain in the union consistently with their honoi and safety and what arc the concession which will have the effect here they are in the words of the senator thenorth must do justice by concding to the south an equal right in the acquired territory and do her duty by causing the stipulations relative to fugitive slaves to b faithfully fulfilled cease the agitation of the slave question and provide for the insertion of a provision in the constitution by an amendment which will restore to the south in substance the power she possessed of protecting herself before the equilibrium betweer the sections was destroyed by the action o this government these terms amount to thisthat the fret states having already a majority of population aid majorities in both houses of congress shall concede to the stave states be mg in a minority in both the unequal advan lage of as equalitythat is we shall altei the constitution so as to convert the government from a national democracy controller bv a cnnstnutional majority of voices into i federal alliance in which the minority shal have a veto against the majority and thus t return to tha original articles of confedera tion i will not stop to protest against the injus lice and inexpediency of an innovation which if it were practicable would be so entire subversive of the principle of democratic in stitqtions it is enough to say that it is totally inpracticable the free states northern and western have acquiesced io the huq and nearly unbroken ascendancy of the slavi states under the constitution but the have honor and interests to preserve am there is nothing in the nature or in the char acier of the people to induce an expectaior that they loyal as they are are insensible u he duty of defending them but the scheme would still be impracticable if even this di ficulty were overcome what is proposed is a political equilibrium every political equilibrum requires a physica eqailibrum to rest upon and is valuelesi without it to constitute a physical equil ibrim between the slave states and the fret states required firstan equality of temtoryjoi some near approximation and thia is alread i lost but it requires much more than this it requires an equality in the number ofslave and freemen and this must be perpetual but the census of gives a slave basis ot only two millions and a half and a free basis of fourteen millions and a half the population on the slave basis increases in the ratio of per cent for ten years while that on the free basis advances at the rate of per cent the accelerating movement of the free population now complained of will occu i py the new territory with pioneers andi every day increase the difficulty of forcing and insinuating slavery into regions which freeman have pieoccupied and if this were possible the african slave trade ia prohibited and the domestic increase ia not sufficient to supply the new slave states which are expected to maintain the equil ibrunrr the theory of a new political equilibrium claima that it once existed and has been lost when lost and how it began to be lost in when preliminary arrangements were made to admit five new states in the northwest territory two years before the consti tion was finally adoptedthat is it began to be lost two years before it began to exist sib the equilibrium if restored would be lost more rapidly than it was before the progress of the free population ia to be accelerated by emigration from europe and asia while that of the slaves is to be cheeked and retarded by inevitable partial emancipation nothing says montesquieu reduces a manso low as alwsys to see freemen and yet uot be free persons in that condition are natural enemies of the state and their numbers would be dangerous if increased too high sir the fugitive alsve colonies in the free state in canada and liberia are the beat guarantees south corolina has for the perpetuity o slavery nor would success attend any of the details of the compromise and first i advert to the amendment of the law concerning fugitives from service or labor the constitution contains only a compact which rests tor its execution on the statunot content wiih this the slave states induced legislation by coo sress and the supreme court of the united tales have virtually decided that the whole subject ia within the provinee of congress and exclusive of state authority nay they have decided that slave are to be regarded not merely as persons to be claimed but ss property and chattels to be seized without any legal authority or claim whatever the compact ia thus subverted by the procurement of the slave states with what reason then can they expect the states ex gratia to reasaume the obligation from which they caused those statu to be diaehaiged i say then to the slave statu you are entitled to no more stringent law sod such adm would be useless the cause of the insufficiency of the present statute is not at all the leniency of its provisions it i a law that deprives the alleged refugee from a legal obligation pot assumed by him but imposed upon him by law enacted before he was born of the writ of habtas corpus and of any certain judical process of examination of he claim ret up by his pursuerand finally degrades him into a chat tie which may be seixed and earned away peaceably wherever found eveo ti though ewwwf the fight and resjxmai i bumee of a free citizen of the ctraunonweahh i in which he reekiee end of the united states i a law which denies to the citizen all the safe i guards of personal liberty to render lees possible the escape of i bondman we deem its principle therefore unjust unconstitutional and immoral and thua white patriotism wit bolds ita approbation the consciences of our people condemn it you will roy that these convictions of ours are disloyal grant it for arguments sake they are seven be ess honest and the law is to be exe cuied among us not among you not by us but by the federal authority has say government ever succeeded in changing the moral convictions of its subjects by force but these convictions imply no disloyalty we revere the constitution although we perceive this defect just as we acknowledge the splendor and power of the aun although ita surfact is tarnished with here and there an opaque spot your constitution and law converts hospitality to refugees from the most degrading oppression on earth into a crime but all mankind except you esteem that hospitality a virtue the right of extradilion of even fugitives from justice is not admitted by the law of nature and of nations but rests on voluntary compact only two conjlpßs found in diplomatic history admitted emmition of slaves here ia one of them it is found in a treaty made between alexander comnenus the greek emperor at constantinople and oleg king of russia in the year and ia in these words if a russian slave take flight from his master or if he shall be held under pretence of having beet bought hia master may pursue him and take him wheresoever be may be found and whosoever shall prevent his master from taking him shall be guilty of offending this treaty and shall be punished ac cordingly this was in the year of grace in what is called the dark ages and the contracting powers were despotisms and here is the other no person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof escaping into another shall in consequence ot any laws or regulations therein be discharged from such service or labor but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor is due this is from the constitution of the united states in and the parties were the republican states of this union the law of nations disavows such compacts the law of nations written on the hearts and consciences of freemen repudiates them armed powers conld not enforce them because there is no public conscience to sustain them i know that there are laws of various sorts that regulate the conduct of men there are constitutions and statutes laws mercantile and codes civil but when we are legislating for states especially when we are forming stales all these laws must be brot to the standard of the laws of god and must be tried by that standard and stand or fall by it it is of this principle that an eminent political philosopher of england burke said there is but one law for all namely that law which governs allthe law of our creatorthe law of humanity justice equity the law of nature and of nations sofar as any laws tortify this primeval law and give it more precision more energy more effect by then declarations such laws enter into the sanctuary and participate in the sacredness of its character but the man who quotes as precedents the abuses of tyrants and robbers pollutes the very fountains of justice destroys the foundations of all law and therefore removes the only safeguard against evil men whether governors or governed the guard which prevents governors from becoming tyrants and the governed from becoming rebels there was deep philosophy in the confession of an eminent english judge when he had condemned a young woman to death under the late sanguinary code of his country for her first petty theft she fell dead at his feet i seem to myself said he to have been pronouncing sentence not against the prisoner but against the law itself to conclude on this point we are not slaveholders we cannot in our judgment be either true christians or real freemen il we impose on another a chain that we deny all human power to fasten on ourselves you believe and think otherwise and doubtless with equal sincerity we judge you not and he alone who ordained the conscience of man and its laws of action can judge us do we then in this conflict demand of you an unreasonable thing in asking that since you will have property that can and will exercise human power to make ita escape you shall be your own police and that acting among ue as such you shall conform to principles indispensable to the security of admitted rights of freemen another feature in moat of the plans of compromise is a bill of peace for slavery in the district of columbia and this bill of peace we cannot grant we of the free states are equally with you of the slave states responsible for the existence of slavery in tliis districtthe field exclusively of our common legislation i regret that as yeti see but little reason to hope that a majority in favor of emancipation exists here the legislature of new yorkfrom whom with great deference i dissentseems willing to accept now the extinction of the slave trade and waive emancipation but we shall assume the whole responsibility if we stipulate not to exercise the power heieafter when s majority shall be obtained not will the plea with which you furnish us be of any avail if i could understand myself should never be able to explain to the direct understanding of the people whom i represent how it was that an absolute and express power to legislate in all cases over the district of columbia was embarrassed and defeated by an implied condition not to legislate for the abolition of slavery in that district sir i shall vote for that measure and am willing to appropriate any means to cany it into execution and if i shall he aked what i did to embellish the capitol of my country i will point to her freedtnen and say these are the monuments of my munificence if i was willing to advance a cause that i deemed sacred by disingenuous means i would advise you to adopt these measures of compromise which i have thus examined the echo is not quicker in its response than would be that loud and universal cry of repeal that would not die away until the habeas corpus was secured to the alleged fugitive from bondage and the symmetry of the free institutions of the capitol was perfected i apply the same observations to the proposition for i waiver of the proviso of freedom in territotial charters thus far you have only direct popular action in favor of that ordinance and there seems even to be a partial disposition to await the action of the people of the new territories as we have compulsorily waited for it in california but i must tell you nevertheless in all candor and in plainness that the spirit of the people in the free slates ia set upon a spring that rises with the pressure put upon it that spring if pressed too hard will give a recoil that will not leave here one servant who knew hia masters will and did it not you will say that this implies violence not at allit implies only peaceful lawful constitutional customary action i cannot too strongly express toy surprise that those who insist that the people of the sieve states oanaot be held back from remedies outside of lije constitution should so far misunderstand us of the free states as to suppose we would not exercise our constitutions rights to sustain the policy which we deem just and beneficent i object ia the next place le ike compromise of the boundary between texas and new mexico ttutt it a judicial question in ita nature or at team a question of legal right and title if it is to be compromised at all it due to the two panics to national dignity as well as to justice that it be kept separate from compromises proceeding on the vv ground of expediency and bo nuld by it elf alone i take ihia occasion to aa that do not in toad to disease the question which hu been raiaed by the honorable and distinguished senator from mace mr webeter but i am compelled to say that i have not the good fortune to concur with him in the opinions which he baa expressed in regard to the ad mimion of new states to be formed out of the slate of texas there are various qseat ions involved in that subject which i think this is not the time to decide and which i wiah to reserve for future consideration one is whether the article of annexation does really deprive congress of the right to express its voice in regard to the subdivision of the state of texas only say that to me it seems by no means so plain a question as the senator assumes and therefore wiih me it lemams a question for future considerationan open qosslion whether congress is not a party whose future nceessary to any division of texas mr websterwill the senator allow me to ask him one question mr sewardcertainly air mr webstersupposing congress to have the authority to fix the number of states and the time of election and apportionment ol representation die the question is whether if new states are formed out of texas tocome into this union there is not a solemn pledge by law that they have a right to come in as slave states mr sewardthe article ia in effect in i these words new states not exceeding fout in number may be framed out of the territory of texas with the consent of texas and shall be admitted into the union t with or without slavery if they shall choose mr webster if they chooso they may come in as slave states mr sewardl beg pardon of the hon senator but it is with or without slavery but pass the question as the volume is not at hand and i fear i shall trespass on the lime of the senate by waiting for it am moreover not unconstitutional i find no authority in the constitution of the u slates for the annexation of foteign states by resolution what i mean now especially to insist upon is that must have time to deliberate until the occasion actually anives before i consent to any division ot the state of texas so as to bring in any new state with a constitution maintaining slavery must have the point settled that the aiticle of annexation is compulsory upon me and also that itis constitutional mr footedid i not rightly understand the senator to say that he would have voted to admit california as a slave stave if she had voluntarily inserted such a provision in her constitution mr sewardyes sir under these extraordinary circumstances of conquest of a compact of abandonment of impossibility to give a territorial government of a constitution adopted by the people and of dismemberment of the empire if she was rejectedunder these circumstances i would have received california though she had come to my profound regret as a slave slate lam happy now mr president to understand that agree with the hon member from massachu i setts that it is not compulsory upon cong tess hereafter to admit four new slave states in texssthat they have reserved the right to decide whether any new state shall be formed there shall vote for admitting no more i slave states unless under circumstances ab i solutely controlling and compulsory and such f cannot now be foreseen mr websterthe senator does not uni demand me my proposition was that states hereafter made out of texas with her coni sent if they choose to come in slave states i have a right to do so mr seward my position is that they have not a right to cotne in if congress shall rei fuse its consent it is optional with both parties congress and texas mr w ebalerdoes the senator hold that i we may hereafter decide whether they shall be slave states or free slates mr sewardno sit but that congress may decide that there shall be no slates at ill formed out of texas t another objection arises out of the princi f pie on which the compromise rests that principle is a classification of the stales as i northern and southern stales as is express i ed by the hon senator from south carolina i mr calhoun but into slave states and free i stales as more directly expressed by the honorable senator from georgia mr berrien the argument is that the states are several i ly equal and that these two classes were equal at the first and that the constitution i was founded on that equilibrium that the states being equal and the classes of the states being equal in rights they are to kb i regarded as constituting an association in which each state and each of the classes of states respectively contribute in due proportion tbit the new territories are a common acquisition and that the people of these several states and classes of states have ani equal right to participate in respectively hat the right of the people of the slave slates to emigrate to the territories with their slaves as property is such a participation in their part inasmuch as the people of the free states emigrate into the same territories with their property and the argument deduces from this right the principle that if congress exclude slavery from any part of this new domain it would be only just to set off a portion of the domain some say south of and others south of which should be regarded at leaat aa open to slavery and to be organized into alave states argument ingenious and subtle declamation earnest and bold and persuasive gentle and winning as the voiee of the tut tie dove when it is heard in the land all aitke and all together have failed to convince me of the soundness of this principle of the proposed compromise or of any one of the propositions ou which it is attempted to be established how is the original equality of the states proved it testa on a syllogism as follows ah men are equal by the law of nature and of nations but states are only lawful aggregationa of individual men who individually are equal therefore states are equal in natural rights all this is just and sound but assuming the same premises to wit that all men are equal by the law of nature and of nations the right of property in slaves falls to the ground for one who is equal to another cannot be the owner df property in that other but you answer that the constitution recognizes property in slaves it would be sufficient then to reply that this constitutional recognition must be void because it is repugnant to the law of nature and of nations but i deny that the constitution recognizes property in man i submit on the other baud most respectfully that the constitution not merely does not affirm that principle but on the contrary altogether excludes it the constitution does not expressly affirm anything on the subject all that it contains is two incidental allusions to slaves these are first in the provision establishing a ratio of representation and taxation second in the provision relating to fugitives from labor in both cases the constitution designedly mentions slaves not as slaves much less as chatties but as persons that this recognition of them as persons was designed is historically known and i think never denied give only two of the manifold proofs john jay in the federalist aayn lei the case of the slaves be considered as it is in truth a peculiar one let the sempiomising expedient ot the constitution be mutually adopted which regards them as nhabiiantty but aa debased below the

lenestrial things could hfinsalf have been the property of his fellow lisa the right to nave a slave unphea the right in some one to make the slave that right must be eqoal and mutual and that would resolve society into a state of perpetual war but if we grant the original equality of the states sad grant also the constimtional recognition of slaves as property atm the argument we are considering fails because the states were not parties to the constitution as states it is the constitution of the people of the united btatee but even if the states continued as states they surrendered their equality as states and submitted themselves to the away of ibe numerical majority with qualities lions or checks first of the representation of stbs of slaves in the ratio of representation and taxation and secondly of the equal representation of slates in the senate the proposition of an established classification of states as slave slates and free stales as asserted by aome and into northern and southern as asserted by others seems to me purely imaginary and of course the supposed equilibria of those classes a mere conceit this must be so because when the constitution was adopted twelve of the thuteen states were slave states and so theie was no equtltbrim and so as to the classification ot states at northern states and southern stales it is the maintenance ot slavery by law in a state not parold of latitude that makes it a southern stale and the absence of this that makes it a northern state and so ail the states save one were southern states and there was no equilibrium but the conlitutioo was made not only for southern and northern states but for staves neither one nor the other but western states their coming in was f or seen and provided for it needs little argument to show that uta idea of a joint stock association or a copartnership as applicable even by its analogies to the united states is err neojs with all the consequence fancifully utuced from it the united states are a fical slate or organ zed society whose end is government for the secuiity welfare and happiness of all who live under its protection the iheoiy i am combating reduces the objects of government to the mere spoils of conquest on the contrary ot a theory so debasing the preamble of the constitution not only asserts the sovereignty to he not iu the slates but in the people but also promulgates the objects of the constitution we people of the united stale in ordsr to form a more perfect union establish justice ensure domestic tranquility provide ibr the common defense piomote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty do ordain and establish this constitution objects sublime and benevolent they exclude the very idea of conquesle to be either divided among states or even enjoyed by them for the purpose of securing not the blessings of liberty but the evils of slave ry theie is a novelty in the principle of this compromise which condemns it simultaneously with the establishment of the constitution virginia ceded her domain which then extended to the mississippi and was even eiaimed to extend to the pacific congress accepted it and unanimously devoted the domain to freedom hi the laqggiage from which the ordinance now so severely condemned was borrow five states have already been organised on mfe domain from irfl of which iu pursuance of that ordinance slavery is excluded how jjid it happen that this theory of the equality of ike state of the classification of states of the equih brim of the states of the tpf the states to common enjoyment of the cfomain pto an equitable and just partition between them was neuer promulgated nor even dluniml of by the slave states which unanimously consented to this ordinance r there is another aspect of the principle of compromise which deserve consideration it assumes that slavery if not the only insiitu tion is in a slave state at least the ruling institution and that this characteristic was lecognixed by the constitution but slavery is only one of many institutions there freedom is equally an institution there slavery is only a temporary accidental partial incongruua one freedom on the ontxary is a perpetual organic universal one in harmony with the constitution of the united states the slaveholder himself stands under the protection of the letter is common wtllsll the free citizens of the state but the principle of the compromise gives complete ascendancy in the slave states and in the constitution of the united states to the suboidinate accidental and incongruous institution over its antagonist to reduee this claim for slavery to an absurdity it ia only necessary to add that there are only twrj states in which slaves are s majority and net one in which the slaveholders ar g o i very disproportionate minority but there is yet another aspect ia which this principle must be examitied regards the domain only as a possession to be enjoyed either in common or by partition by the citizens of the old states it is true indeed that the national domain is ours true that it was aeqnired by the powers and wealth of the whole country but we hold nevertheless do arbitrary power over it we hold no arbiirs ry authority over anything whether aeqnired lawfully or by usurpation the cnastitutien regulates our stewardship the constitution devotes the domain to union to justice to defense to welfaie and liberty but there ie a higher law than the constitution which regulates our authority over the domain and devotes it to the same noble put pose the territory is a paitno inconsiderable partof the common heritage of mankind bestowed upon thme by the creator of the universe we are hia stewards and must so discharge our trust as to secure in the highest attainable degree their happiness how momentous that west is we may i earn jfiom the instructions of the founder of modern pbiiose phy no man can by caieuking a the fianta of kwadamm arut fimnuvn im f ptlt ttb aotobhothd but left totok we are an estate and are deliberating for the commonwealth juat aa our fathera deliberated in eatabliahing the inatitutiona we enjoy whatever superiority there ia in our condition and hopes over those of any other kingdom or estate is due to the fortunate circumstance that our ancestors did not leave things to take their chance but that they added amplitude and greatness to onr commonwealth by introducing such ordinances constitutions and cuatoms as were wise we in our time have aucceeded to the same responsibilities and we cannot approach the duty before us wisely or justly except we raise ouiselves to the great consideration of how we can most certainly sow greatness to our posterity and successors and nowthe simple bold and awful question which presents itself to us is this shall we who are founding institutions social and political fot countless millionsshall we who know by experience the wise and ihe just and are free to choose them and to reject the ereone oua and the unjustshad we establish humau bondage or permit it by our sufferance to be established sir our fathers would not have hesitated an hour they found slavery existing here and they left it only because they could not remove it there is not only no free state which would now establish it bnt there is no save slate whih if it had but the free alternative as we now have would have founded sltvery indeed our revolutionary predecessors had precisely the same question before them in establishing an organic law under which the states of ohio michigan illinois wisconsin and lowa have lince come into the union and they solemnly repudiated and excluded slavery from those states forever confess that the most alarming evidence of our degeneracy which has yei been given is found in the fact that we even debate such a question sir there is no chtistian nation that free to choose as we are would establish slavery i apeak on due consideration because britain france and mexico have abolished slavery and all other european states are preparing to abolish it as rapidly as they can we cannot establish slavery because there are certain elements of the security welfare and greatness of nations w hich we all admit or ought to admit and lequire as essential and these arethe security of natural rights the diffusion of knowledge and the freedom of industry slavery is incompatible with all of these and just in proportion to the extent that it prevails and controls in anv republican state just to that extent it subverts the principle of derouciacy and converts the state into an aristocracy or despotism i will not offend sensibilities by drawing my proof from the slave states existing among ourselves but i will draw them from the greatest of the european slave states the population of russia in europe in was of these were erfa the residue nobles clergy merchants c the liupenal government abandons the control over the attylhree and a half millions to their owners and the residue included in the aie thus a privileged class or aristocracy if ever the government inteifeies at all with the aetfs who are the only laboring population it is by edicts designed to abridge the opportunities of education and thus continue their debasement what was the origin of lhis system conquest in which the captivity of the conqured was made perpetual and hereditary this it seems to me is identical with american shveiy only at one and the same lime exaggerated by the greater disproportion between the privileged classes and the slaves in theii respective numbers and yet relieved of the unhappiesi featurs of american slave rytbe distinction of caste what but ibis renders russia at once the most arbitrary despotism aud the most barbarous state in europe and what is its effect but industry comparatively profitless and sedition not oc cassional and parmal but chronic and pervading tbe empire with massachusetts and lno among us shall we pass by their free and beneficent examples and select our institutions from the dominions of the czar cannot slop to debate jong with those who maintain that slavery is in itself practically economical and humane i might be content with saving that there are some axioms in political scince that a statesmen ora founder of states may adopt especially in tbe congress of the united states and that among these axioms are these that all men are created equal and have inalienable rights of life liberty and the choice of pursuits of happiness that knowledge promotes virtue and righteousness exahelh a nation that freedom is preferable to slavery and that democratic governments when they can be maintained by acquiescence without force are preferable to institutions exercising arbitrary and irrisponaible power it remains only to say on this part of the subject that slavery being incongruous and repugnant it dangerous to the safety of the state the conservative principle of the state is the security of the voluntary acqui esscoce of tbe people that acquiescence is obtained by universal suffrage which demands of course equality of knowledge and propeiiy as far as that is practically attainable without injustice or oppression this argument is sustained by our own experience there is no danger menacing the union there never has been any that would have menaced it had slavery had no shelter be neatu its protection if slavery confined as it now is threatens tbe invasion of the constitution how can we enlarge us boundaries and increase its influence with increasing the danger already existing whether then i regard merely the welfare tf the future inhabitants of the new territories nr the security and welfare of tbe whole people of the united stales or the welfare of the whole family of mankind cannot consent t o introduce slavery into any part of this continent which is now exempt from what seems to me to be so great an evil these are my reasons for declining to compromise the questions relating to slavery asa condition of the admission of california in acting upon an occasion so grave as this a respectful consideration is due to the arguments founded on extraneous considersions f senators wno eoonsel a course different from that which have preferred tbe first of these arguments is that congress has no power to legislate on the subject of slavery within the territories sir congress has power to admit new states and since congress may admit it follows that congress may reject new states the discretion of congress in admitting it absolute except that when admitted the stale must be republican state and must be a state that is it shall have the constitutional powers uf a state but the greater includes the less we may impose conditions not inconsistent with those fundamental powers boundaries are suck tbe reservation of tbe public domain is supb tbe right to dtvde is such the ordinance excluding slavery is such a condition tbe organization of territory is auxtiury or preliminary it is tbe inchoate initiative cl ef ad mission aud is performed under the clause gianuog the power necessary to execute tbe express powers of tbe constitution this power comes from tbe treaty making power also and think it is well traced to tbe power to make needful rules and regulations concerning tbe public domain but the power is here to be exectsed however derived and tbe right to regulate property to administer justice in regard to property is as anted in every territorial charter if we have power to legislate concerning property vt have concerning personal rights freedom is a personal light the constitution decs not sanction property in man and congress beiag tbe supreme legislature has tbe asae right in regard to property and rights ja territories that the states would have if igsniesd it is unused further that the inhibition is i have mfwt the less of abl and distinguished senators who go with us for the admission of california especially do i regret the separation from ua of the able and distinguished senator from missouri mr benton when what senator announced that he should not sustain the proviso of fieedom was induced to exclaim cur in timatrum cato sivsre veaieti an ideo tantum veneraa ut exies b it that distinguished senator is crowning alife of eminent public service by bringing the first state of the pacific into the union and grateful to him for that i freely leave to him to deteimine for himself what weight he will give to the cause of human freedom in his action on so gravo an occasion the argument is that the proviso ia unnecessary answer then there can be noerror in insisting upon it but why is it unnecessary it is said first by reason of the climate if this be so why do not the representatives of the slave states yield to the proviso they deny that climate prevents the introduction of slavery now i will leave nothing to contingency but in truth i think that argument is against the proposition is there any climate where slavery has not existed it has prevailed all over europe from sunny italy to bleak england and ia existing now stronger than in any other land in icebound russia but it will be replied that this is not african slavery rejoin that only makes the case the stronger if this vigorous saxon race of ours was reduced to slavery while it retained the courage of semibarbarism in its own high northern latitude what security does climate afford against the transplantation of the more gentle more docile and already enslaved and debased african to the genial cimr of newmexico and california sir there is no climate uncongenial to slavery it is true it is less productive than free labor in many northern countries but so it is les productive than free while labor in even tropical climates labor is hi quick demand in all new countries slave labor is cheaper than free labor and will go firat into new regions and wherever it goes it brings labor into dishonor and therefore free white labor avoids competition with it sir might rely on climate if i had not been born in a laud w here slavery existed and that land was all north of lheoth parallel of latitude and if i did not know the snuggle that it has cost and which is yet going on to get complete relief from the institution and its baleful couse quences but sir it is said that slavery ia prevented by the laws of god from entering into the territory from which we propose to inhibit it will look into that matter a little more closely i wish then with the utmost respect to ask senators whether the ordrnauce of was necessary or not that ordinance has been the subject of too many eulogiums to be now prortonneed a vague and tdle thing that ordinance carried the prohibition of slavery quite up to the th deg of north lal and yet we are now told that we can trust tbe laws of god without any ordinance to exclude slavery as far down as deg m unfortunately too the ordinance of began on the h parallel of north latitude so that there is no part of the territory which it covered in which slavery according to the present theory was not excluded by tbe law of god i know no better authority as to the laws of god on this subi ject than one from whom have already had j occasion to quote wiibsome freedom and it is the opinion of montesquieu that it is only j the indolence of mankind and not the climate which cause the introduction of slavery anywhere theie is no climate where slavery is necessary there is none where it cannot be established if the customs and laws permit  shall dwell only very briefly on the argument derived from the mexican laws the j proposition that these laws must remain in torce until altered by laws of our own is satisfaciory and so is the proposition that those mexican laws abolished and continue to prohibit slavery and still deem an enactment by ourselves wise and even necessary both of the propositions i have stated are denied with just as much confidence by southern statesmen and jurisis as they are affirmed by those of the free states the population of the new territories is rapidly becoming an american one to whom the mexican code w ill seem a foreign one entitled to little deference or obedience slavery has never obtained anywhere by express legislative authority but always by trampling down laws higher than any mere municipal lawsthe law of nature and ot nations there can beno oppression in upetadding the sanction of congress to the authority which is so weak and so vehemently questioned and there is some possibility if not a probability that the institution might obtain a foothold surreptitiously if it should not be absolutely forbidden by our own authority what is insisted upon therefore is not a mere abstraction or a mete sentiment as is contended by those who concur with us as to admitting california hut would waive the proviso and what is conclusive on the subject is that it is conceded on all hands that the effect of insisting on it prevents the extension of slavery into the region to which it is proposed to apply it again it is insisted that the diffusion of slavery does not increase its evils the argument seems to me merely specious and quite unsound and this brings me to the great and all absorbing argument that the union is in danger of being dissolved and that it can only be saved by compromise i do not overlook the fact that the entire delegation from the slave states although they differ in the dealtl of compromise proposed and perhaps also upon the exact circumstances of the crisis seem to concure in the momentous warning nor do doubt at all the patriotic devotion to the lnion which iaexpreased by those from whom thia warning proceeds and yet sir although these warnings have been uttered with impassioned solemnity in my hearing every dav for near three months my confidence in the union remains unshaken think they are to be received with no inconsiderabledialiuat because they are uttered under the influence of a controlling interest to lie secured a paramount object to be gainedand ibai is an equilibrium of power in the republic i think they are to be received with even more distrust because with the most profound respect they are uttered under an obviously high excitement nor is that excitement tin unnatural one it is a law of our nature that tbe passions disturb the reason and judgment just in proportion to the importance of the occasion and the consequent necessity for calmness and candor i think they are tobe distrusted because there is a diveisity ol opinion in regard to the natute and operation of this excitement the senators from some states say that it has brought all parties in that region into unanimity thesenatot from kentucky says that the danger lies in the violeuce of party spit it and refers us to the difficulties which attended the organization of the house of representatives sir in my humble judgment it ia not die fierce conflict of parties that we are seeing and bearing hut on the contrary it ia the agony of distracted parties a convulsion resulting from the too narrow foundations of both and of all pattiesloundatioos laid in compromises of natural justice and of human liberty a questiona moral question transcending the too narrow creeds of parties has arisen the public concience expand with it and the green withes of party asiio ciations give way and break and tall off root it no sir it not the state that ia dying of the fever of party spirit it ia merely a paialysia of parties premonitory of tbeir restoration with the new elements of health and vigor imbibed from that spirit of the age which ia so justly called progress nor ia the evil that of unlicensedirregular and tdrblem faction we are told that legislatures are in session burning like furnaces heating and inflaming the popper passions but those twenty legislatures are constitutional frwaeea they aw prorating their customary functions imparting healthful heart and vitality while within their constitutional jurisdiction if they rage beyond its limits the popular passions of this country are not at all think in danger of being inflamed to excess no sir let none of those fires be extinguished forever let them burn and biaie they are neither ominous meteors nor baleful comets but planets and bright and intense as their heat many be it is their native temperature and they must still obey the law which by attraction toward the center bolds them in their spheres i see nothing of that conflict between the southern nd the northern states or between their representative bodies which seems tobe on all aides of me assomed not a word of menacenot a word of anger aot an intemperate word hat been uttered in any northern legislature they firmly but calmly assert their convictions but at the same time they assert their unqualified purpose to submit to the common arbiter and for weal or wo abide the fortunes of the union what if there be leas of moderation in the legislatures of the south it only indicates on which aide the balance is inclining and that the decision of tbe government is netr at hand argue with those who say that there can be no peaceful dissolutionno dissolution of the union by tbe secession of states but that disunion dissolution happen when it may will and must be revolution i discover no omens of revolution the predictions of the political astrologers do not agree as to time or manner in which it is to occur according to the authority of the hon senator from alabama mr clemens the event has already happened and the union ia now in ruins according to the horoscope of the hon senator from mississippi mr foote it was to take place on aday already past according to the hon and distinguished senator from soulhcaro lina mr calhoun it ia not to be immediate but to be developed by time mr foote here interpesed and disowned the construction which had been put upon his remarks and made further explanations mr sewardl am very happy to have given the senator an opportunity to correct the erroneous impression which the remark which i have referred to had made nowthe hon senator will do me the justice to allow that am at liberty to subtract one prediction frem the political almanac and so the predictions lose so much of impoitance i see no omens of revolution what ate the omens to which our attention is directed see nothing but a broad difference of opinion here and the excitemen consequent upon it i have observed that revolutions which begin in that palace seldom gs beyond the palace walls and these affect only the dynasty whieh reigns there this revolution if i understand it began here in the senate chamber a year ago when the representatives irora southern states assembled here and addressed their constituents on what was called the aggiesaions of the northern slates no revolution was designed at that time and all that lias happened since ia the return to congiess of legislative resolutions which seem to me to be conventional responses to the address which emanated from the capital sir in any condition ot society there esn hano revolution without a cause an adequate causewhat cause exists here wears admitting a new state but there is nothing new in thatwe have already admitted seventeen before but it is said that the slave slates are in dinger of losing political power by the admission of the new slate well sir is there anything new in that the slave states have always been losing political power and they always will be while they j have any to lose at first twelve of the thirteen states were slave states now only fit teen of the thirty are slave states moreover the change is constitutionally made and the government was constructed so as to permit changes o the bolanceol power in i obedience to changes of the forces of the body politic danton used to say its all well while the people cry dauton and robespierre but woe for me if ever the people learn to say robespierre and danton that is all of it sir the people have been accustomed to say the south and north they ate beginning now to say the north and the south sir thgse who woud alarm us with the terrors of revolution have not well consideied the structure of this government and the or j ganization of its forces it is a democracy of property and ersons with a fair approximation toward universal education and operating by means of universal suffrage the constituent members of this democracy are the only person who could subvert it and they are not the citizens of a metropolis like paris or of a region subjected to the influences of a metropolis like france but they j are husbandmen dispersed over this broad l land on the mountain and on the plain and ion the prairie from the ocean to the rocky mountains and from the great lakes to the j gulf and this people are now while weare discussing their imaginary danger at peace and in their happy homes and as unconcerned and even as uninformed of their peril as they are of events occurring in tbe moon nor have the alarmists made due allowance in their calculations for the influence of conservative reactionstrong in any government and irresistible in a rural republic operating by universal suffrage that principle of reaction ia due to the force of habits of acquiescence and loyally among the people no ruau better understood this principle than machiaveul who has told us in regard to factions that no safe reliance can be placed in the force of nature and the bravery of words except it be corroborated by custom do the alarmists remember that this government has stood sixty years already without exacting one drop of blood that this government baa stood sixty years and treason is sn obsolete crime that day trust ia lar off when the fountains of popular contentment aflaail be broken upbut whenever it shall come it will bring forth a higher illustration than has ever yet been given of tbe excellence of the democratic system for then it will be seen how calmly how firmly how nobly a great people can act in preserving thru constitution when love of couptiy moveth example uteehelb company cora forteth emulation quickeneth and glory ex aitetk when the foanders of the new republic of tbe south come to draw over the face of this empire along or betweeo its parallels of latitude or longitude their ominous lines of to be broadly and deeply shaded with fraternal blood they may come to the discovery then if not before that tbe national and even the political connections of tbe region embraced forbids such a partition that us possible divisions are not northern and southern at all but eastern and western atlantic and pacific and that nature and commerce have allied indissolubly for weal and woe the secedera and those from whom they are to be separated that while they would rush into a pivij war to restore an imaginary equilibrium between the northern states and the southern states that anew equilibrium had taken ita place in which hi those states are pn the one side and the boundless west waa on the other sir when the founders of tbe new republic of the south come to trace those fearful tines they will indicate what portion of the continent are to be broken off from their connection with the atlatfftc through the st lawrence the hudson the delaware the potomac and the mississippiwbat portion of this people are to be dented the use of the lakes the railroads and tbe canals now constituting commoo and cuatgmary avenues of travel trade and social intercoursewbst families and kindred are to be separated and convened into eoemtee and what states are to be the aoenef of perpetual border warfare aggravated by interminable horror of inter miniwf iomfffotisn when thou portentous lines shall he drawn they will daadfoee what portion of tbs modlo ia to ratih tbs army and the navy and tbe flag of manj victories and on the other hind whai portion of this people is to be subjected u new and tuinous imposts direct taxes and forced loans and conscriptioos to maintain ao opposing army and opposing navy d the new and hateful banner of sedition then ihe projectors of the new republic ot the south will meet the questionand wyaa well prepare now to answer it what is all this forwhat intolerable wrongwhat unfi sternal injustice hav tendered these calamities unavoidable what gain will thii unnatural revolution bring to us the answer will be all thia is done to secure the institution of african slavery and then if not before the question will be discussedwhat is this institution ol slavery that it should cause these unparalleled sacrifices and these disastrous afflictions and this will be the answer when the spaniards few in number discovered the western indies and the adjacent continental america the needed labor to draw forth from its virgin stores some speedy return to the cupidity of the court and bankers of madrid they enslaved the indolent inoffensive and confiding patives who perished by thousands and even by millions under that new and unnatural bondage a humane ecclesiastic advised the substitution of africans reduced to captivity in their native wars and a pious princess adopted the suggestion ith a dispensation from the head of the church granted on the ground of the prescriptive right of the christian to enslave the heathen to effect his conversion the colonists ol north america innocent in their unconsciousness of wrong encouraged the slays traffic and thus the labor of subduing theii territory devolved chiefly upon the african race a happy conjunction brought on an awakening of tbe conscience of mankind tc the injustice of slavery simuhaneasly with the independence of the colonies massachusetts connecticut rhodeisland new hampshire vermont new york new jersey and pennsylvania welcomed and embraced the spirit of universal emancipation renouncing luxury they secured tnfluencr and empire but the states of ihe tsouthmis led by a new and profitable cultivation elected to maintain and perpetuate slavery and thus choosing luxury they lost power and empire when this answer shall be given it will appear that the question of dissolving the union is a complex question that it embraces the fearful issue whether the union shall stand and slavery under the steady peaceful action of moral social and political causei be removed by gradual voluntary effort and compensation or whether the union shall be dissolved and civil wats ensue bringing on violent but complete and immediate emancipation we are now arrived at that stage of our national progress when that crisis can be foreseen when we must foresee it it is directly before us its shadow is upon us it datkens the legislative halls the temples of worship and the home and the hearth every question political civil or ecclesiastical however foreign to the subjectslavery brings up slavery is an incident and the incident supplants the principal question we hear of nothing but slavery and we can talk of nothing but slavery and now it seems to me that all our difficulties embaraaaments and dangers arise not of unlawful perversions of ihe question of slavery as some suppose but out of the want of moral courage to meet this question of emancipation as we ought consequently we hear on one side demands absurd indeed but yet unceasing for an immediate and unconditional abolition of slavery as if any power except the people of the slave states could abolish it and as if they could be moved to abolish it by merely sounding the trumpet violently and proclaiming emancipation while the institution was interwoven with all their social and political interests constitutions and customs on the other hand our statesmen say that alvaery has always existed and for aught they know or can do tt always must exist god permitting it and he only can indicate the way to remove it as if the supreme creator after giving us the instructions of his providence ynd revelation for the illumination of our minds and consciences did not leave us in all human transactions with due invocations of his holy spirit to seek out hia will and execute it for ourselves here then is the point of my separation from both of theae parties i feel assured that slavery will give wayand must give way to the salutary instructions of economy and to the ripening influences ot humanity that emancipation is inevitable and is pearthat it mav be hastened or hindered and that whether it be peaceful or violent depends upon the government whether it be hastened or hinderedthat all measures which justify slavery ur extend it tend to the consummation of violence all that cheek its extension and abate its strength tend to its peaceful extirpation but i will adopt now none but lawful constitutional and peaceful means to secure even the erd and none auch can i or will i forego nor do know any important or responsible body that proposes to do inure than ihis no free slate claims to extend its legislation into a slave state none claims that congress shali usurp power to abolish slavery in the slave states none claims that any violent unconstitutional or unlawful measures shall be restored to and on the other hand if we offtr no scheme or plan for the adoption of the lave states with the assent and cooperation of congress it is only because the slave states are unwilling aa yet to receive auch suggestion or even to entertain the question of emancipation in any state but air i will take this occasion to say that while cannot agree with the hon senator from massachusetts in proposing to demote to remove the free colored population from the states and thus as it appears to me fortify slaverythere ia to reasonable limit to which i am not willing togo in applying the uational treasures to effect the peaceful voluntary removal of slavery itself have thus endeavored to show that there is not now and ia not likely to occur any adequate cause for revolution in regard to slavery but you reply that mvertiieless you roust have guarantees and tbe first one is for tbe surrender of fugitives from labor that guarantee you cannot have aa i have already shown because you cannot rollback the tide of social progress you must be content with what you have if you wage war against us you can at moot only conquer us and then all you can get will be a treaty and that you have already but you ioaiet on a guarantee against the abolition of slavery in tbe district of columbia or war well wben you ahall bave declared war against us wbat shall hinder ua from immediately decreeing that slavery ahall eeaae within tbe national capital you say that you will not submit to the exclusion of slaves from the new territories what wilt you gain by resistance liberty follows ihe sword although her away is one of peace and beneficence can you propagate slavery then by the sword you insist that you cannot submit to the freedom with which slavery ie diaeussed in the free states wilj wara war for slavery crush or even moderate that discussion no sir that discussion will net cease war would only inflame it to a greater heightb it is a part of the eternal oonflict betweeo truth sod errorbetween mind and physics fofee the conflict of man against the obstacles which oppose hit way to an ultimate and glorious destiny it will go on until yon sliall terminate in the only way in which any state or nation has terminated it by yielding to ityielding in yoor own time and in your own manner indeed but nevertheless yielding to the progress of tsftaaeip sou will do this sooner or later whaterei may be your opinion now bootee nation which wore prudent and humane and wise as yon sat have dons ao already smm slave statesh m reason ie tar that this inevitable change rill go too far or too fast for their safety or welfare itcanoot well go too fast or too far if the only alternative is a war of races bat itcanoot go fart slavery has a reliable and accommodating ally in a party in the free states which though it claims to be and doubtless is in many respects a party of progress finds iu eol security for its political porin the support and aid of slavery in tbs slave states of course i do not include in that party tboee who are now co operating in maintaining the cause of freedom against slavery i am not of this party of progress in the north which lends its support to slavery but it is only just and candid that i should be a witness to their fidelity to the interest of slavery sis very has moreover a more natural alliance with the aristocracy of the north and with the aristocracy of europe so long as slavery shall possess the cotton fields the sugar fields and the rice fields of the world so long will commerce and capital yield its toleration and sympathy emancipation is a democratic revolatioo it is capital that arrests all democratic rsvolutions it was capital that in a single year rolled back the tide of revolution on the use of the carpathian mountains across the danube and the rhine into the streets of paris it is capital that is rapidly rolling back the throne of napoleon into the chambers of the tniltortss slavery has a guarantee still stronger than these in the prejudices of caste and color wbieb induce eveu lar e majorities in all the free states to regard sympathy with the slave as ao act of unmanly humliatioo and self abasement although philosophy meekly expresses her distrust oi the asserted natural superiority of the white race and confidently denies that such a superiority if justly claimed could give a title to oppression there remains one more guarantee one that has seldom failed you aod will seldom fail you hereafter new states cling in ch eer reliance than the olde ones to the federal power the concentration of the slave power enables you for long periods to control the federal govern meot with the aid of the new stater i do noi know the sentiments of tue representatives oi california but my word for it if they should be admitted on this floor today against your most obstinate opposition they wouldon all questions really affecting your interests be found at your side with these allies and aids to break the force of emancipation there will be no disunion and no secession j do not say that there may no be disturbance though i do not apprehend even that absolute regularity and order in administration have not yet been established in any government and unbroken popular tranquility baa not yet been attained in even the most advanced cordition of human society the machi oery of our system is necessarily complex a pivot may fall out herea lever may be displaced theretut the machinery will soon recover its regularity and move on just as before with even better adaptation aod adjustment to overcome new obstructions there are many well disposed persons who are alarmed at the occurrence ot any such disturbance the future of a legislative body to organise is to their apprehension a feariul omen and an extra constitutional assemblage to consult upon public affairs is with them cause for desperation even senators speak of the union as if it exited only by consent and as it seems to be implied by the assent of tee legislatures of the states on the contrary the union was pot founded involuntary choice nor does it exist by voluntary consent a union was proposed to the colonies by frskklin and others in but uch was their aversion to an abridgment of their own importance respectively that it was rejected even under the pressure of a disastrous invasion by fraoce a union of choice was proposed to the colonies in but so strong was their oppositiouthat they went through the war of independence without having established more than a mere council of confederation but with independence came enlarged interests of agriculture absolutely new interests of manufactures interests of commerce of fisheries of navigation of a common domain common debts of common revenues and taxation of tbe admiuis tration of justice of public defense of public hoo or in short interests of common nationality and sovereignty interests which at last compelled the adoption of a more perfect uniona national government the genius talent and learning of hamilton of jat of madison surpassing perhaps the intellectual power ever excited before for the establishment of a government combined with the serene but mighty influence of w ashinqton were only sufficient to secure the reluctant adoption of the constitution that is now the object of all our affections and of the hopes of mankind no wonder that ths conflicts in which that constitution was born and the almost desponding solemnity of was ling ton in bis farewell address impressed his countrymen and mankind with a profound distrust of its perpetuity no wonder that while tbe murmurs of that day are yet ringing iu our ears we have cherished that distrust with pious reverence as a national and patriotic sentiment but it is time to prevent abases of that sentiment it is time to shako off t tat fear for fear is always weakness it is time to remember that government even when it arises by chance or accident and is administered capriciously and oppressively is ever tbe strongest of all human institutions surviving many social and ecclesiastical changes and consuls ons and that this government of ours has all the inherent strength common to governments and added to them is ths solidity aod

which we select the following beautiful and truthful para ghaphs christian times it is not easy to form an estimate of bacons religious character we are favored with so few and imperfect details of his private habits we have so little that tells us the true biography of the manhis feelings his usual deportment his private modes of action we are let so littfe into the interior arrangements of his life that we cannot easily pronounce on his personal character charity would lead us to hepe notwithstanding his fondness for preferment and the great error of his life that he may have exemplified in his private life the principles which he has so ably and so constantly inculcated on the subject of his religious opinions he has left us no room to doubt there is scarcely to be found in any language or in any writer so constant a reference to the great religious interest of man as in the writings of bacon there is no where to be found a more profound defence to the authority of the bible there is perhaps no where more caution displayed lest the profoundness variety compass and originality of investigation should lead the mind astray than in his investigations it was one of his recorded sentimentsone of the results of his investigations which he has expressed without hesitancy or qualification that a little philosophy inclineth a man to atheism but depth in philosophy bringeth mans minds about to religion for while the mind of man look eth upon second causes scattered it may sometimes rest in them and go no further but when it beholdeth the chain of them confederate and linked together it must deeds fly to providence and deity his belief he has left us in a wellwritten confession of his faith embracing the usual articles of the christian religion his prayers which are preserved breathe a spirit of true devotion in a style and form which are not surpassed by any compositions of that period in our language it would be easy to transcribe page after page of his recorded sentiments and we might trace at every step of his life his profound deference for the theology of the bible we do not believe that the christian religion depends for its evidence on the suffrage of any one philosopher or on the bright constellation of names which have expressed their profound regard for the truths of revelation still a christian cannot but look with deep interest on the fact that such men as bacon and boyle and newton bowed their mighty intellects to the authority of revelation came and brought all the rich and varied treasures of their profound investigation and laid them at the foot of the cross and spent their lives increasingly impressed with the belief that the god of nature is also the god of the bible while we do not claim that on their authority the scriptures should be accredited as the word of god we do claim that they should be allowed to rebuke the flippancy of youthful aad unfledged infidelity that they should be permitted to summon men to inquire before they pronounce we claim that their authority is sufficient to call on the youthful skeptic to pause and to suspect that possibly he may be wrong when i mighty minds like those have left their recorded assent to the truths of the i christian scheme it is not too much jto ask of minds of far lees power to sit down and inquire at least whether christianity may not have come from god when newton after having surveyed world on world and measured the heavens and placed himself for profound inquiry at the head of mankind sat down in the full maturity of his days and passed the vigor of his life and the serene evening of his honored age in the contemplation of the new testament when bacon after having rescued science from the accumulated darkness and rubbish of two thousand years after having given lessons to all mankind about the just mode of investigating nature and after having traversed the circle of the sciences and gained all that past generations had to teach and having carried forward the inquiry far into nature bowed at every step to the authorityof the bible when hale learned in the law not only believed christianity tobe true but adorned the christian profession by a most humble life when boerhave perfectly acquainted with the human frame and skilled in the healing art sat with the simplicity of a child at the feet of jesus christ when locke gave the testimony of his powerful mind to the truth of the christian religion when davy first of chemists came on this subject to the same results as the analyzerof light the inventer of fluxious and the demonstrator of the theory of gravitation as the author of the novum organum and the writer of the treatise on the human understanding when each science has thus contributed its founder its ornament and its head as a witness to the truth of the christian religion if is not too much to conclude it may be something different from priestcraft and imposture when we turn from these lights of menthese broad stars that spread their beams over all the firmament of science and seek after the wandering and dim luminaries of infidelitywhen we make a sober estimate of what the high priests of unbelief have done for the advancement of science and the welfare of mao we are struck with the prodigious advance we have made into chilly and tenebrated regions we have passed amid spirits of another order we wander in climes as remote almost from science as from christianity we should know where we are as readily by their superficial but pompous pretensions by dark but most confident scientific claims by erroneous wandering but most flippant demands in science as we do by their infuriated and bitter raging against the claims of the christian religion who are these men volney diderot dalembert

penetrating investigation of the works of nature in the spirit of such men science would stili have slumbered in the regions of eternal night and infidelity but for christian men might have swayed a sceptre as she desired over regions of profound and boundless shades of ignorance and crime when such have been the apostles and high priests ol unbeliefsuch the hosts which thej have mustered we feel that apart from all argument in th case we would rather accord with the sentiments of the great luminaries of mankind in science and that it is not unworthy of reason and elevated thought to suppose that true religion may be found where we have found every other valuable blessing for mankind and that the system attended every where with science refinement and art and that has shed light on the intellect and honor on the names of lock and boyle and bacon is the system with which god intended in hi pa ft ntpvt horrible scene in a creek church in jerusalem in curzons visit to the monasteries of the levant the following instance of gross deception and mummery on the part of the patriarchs of the greek church is related which was attended with the most tragic consequences mr curzon in company with ibrahim pasha at that time in full sway overall syria proceeded to church to seethe portent of the holy fire as soon as the great turk was comfortuble in the gallery which had been reserved for him the two patriarchs who once in the year condescended to act in the same piece performed the miracle and the church was instantly the scene of the most hideous tumult hundreds of the pilgrims from every quarter greek armenian copt and abyssi anianrushing pell mell to light their lamps with which all come provided at the holy flame just descended from heaven at the prayer of those reverend personages the two miracle mongers had not been above a minute in the holy sepulchre when the glimmering of the holy fire was seen or imagined to appear and surely bedlam never displayed such au unruly transport as was produced in the mob at that sight but though there always is great disturbance and serious accidents have often occurred the miracle of was followed by horrors on a scale wholly unaxampled and it is fortunate that for a scene so monstrous we have the complete and living evidence of an english gentleman soon you saw the lights increasing in all directions every one having lit his candle from the holy flame the chapels the galleries and every corner where a candle could possibly be displayed immediately appeared to bein a blaze the people in their frenzy pu the bunches of lighted tapers to their faces hand and breasts to purify themselves from their sins the patriarch was carried out of the sepulchre in triumph on the shoulders of the people he had deceived amid the cries and exclamations of joy which resounded from every nook of the immense pile of buildings as he appeared in a hunting state i supposed that he was ill but i found that it is the uniform custom on these occasions to feign insensibility that the pilgrims may imagine that he is overcome with the glory of the almighty from whose immediate presence they believe him to have returned in a short time the smoke of the con dles obscured everything in the place and i could see it rolling in great volumes out of the aperture at the top of the dome the smell was terrible and three unhappy wretches overcome by heat and bad air fell from the upper range of galleries and were dashed to pieces on the heads of the people below one poor armenian lady seventeen years of age died where shs sat of heat thirst and fatigue after a while when he had seen all that was to be seen ibrahim pasha got up and went away his numerous guards making a line for him by main force throuth the dense mass of people which filled the body of the church as the crowd was so immense w waited for a little whileand then set out all together to return to our convent i went first and my friends followed me the soldiers making way for us icross the church i got as far as the place where the virgin is said to have stood during the crucifixion when i law a number of people lying on one mother all about this part ofthe church and as far as i could see towards the cloor i made my way between them t well as i could till they were so thick that there was actually a great lieap of bodies upon which trod it then suddenly struck me that they were all dead i had not perceived this at first for i thought they were only very much fatigued with the ceremonies and had tain down to rest themselves tjiere but when i came to so great a heap of bodies i looked down at them and saw that sharp hard appearance of the face which is nover to be mistakenmany of them were quite black with suffocation and farther on were others all bloody and covered with the brains and entrails of those who bad been trodden to pieces by the crowd at this time there was no crowd in this part of the church butlittle farther on round the corner toward the great doer the people who were quite panicstruck continued to press forward and every one was doing the utmost to escape the guards outside frightened at the rush from within thought that the christians wished to attack them and the confusion soon grew into a battle the soldiers with their bayonets killed numbers of fainting wretches and the walls were spattered with blood and brains of men who had been felled like oxen with the buttends of the soldiers muskets every one struggled to defend himself or to get away and all who fell were immediately trampled to death by the rest so desperate and savage did the fight become that even the panic struck pilgrims appeared at last to have been more intent upon the destruction of each other than desirous to save themselves for my part as soon as i perceived the danger i had cried out to my companions to turn back which they had done but i myself was carried on by the press till l came near the door where all were fighting for their lives here seeing certain destruction before me i made every endeavor to get back an officer of the pashas who by his star was a colonel or bin bashee equally alarmed with myself was also trying to return he caught hold of my cloak or bournous and pulled me down on the body of an old man who was breathing out his last sigh as the officer was pressing me to the ground we wrestled together among the dying and the dead with the energy of despair i struggled with this man till pulled him down and happily got again upon my legs l afterwards found that he never rose againand scrambling oyer a pile of corpses i made my way back into the body of the church where i found my friends and we succeeded in reaching the sacristy of the catholics and thence the room which had been assigned to us by the monks the dead were lying in heaps even upon the stone of unction and i saw full four hundred wretched people dead and living heaped promiscuously one upon another in some places above five feet high ibrahim pasha had left the churchonly a few minutes before me and very narrowly escaped with his life he was so pressed upon by the crowd on all sides and it was said attacked by several of them that it was only by the greatest exertions ol his suite several ot whom were killed that he gained the outer court he fainted more than once in the struggle and was told that some of his attendants at last had to cut a way for him with their swords through the dense ranks of the frantic pilgrims he remained outside giving orders for the removal of the corpses and making his men drag out the bodies of those who appeared to be still alive from the heaps of the dead he sent word to us to remain in the convent till all the bodies had been removed and that when we could come out in safety he would again send to us we stayed in our room two hours before we ventured to make another attempt to escape from this scene oi horror and then walking close together with all our servants round us we made a bold push and got out oi the church by this time most of the bodies were removed but twenty or thirty were still lying in distorted attitudes at the foot of mount calvary and fragments of clothes turbans shoes and handkerchief clotted with blood and dirt were strewed all over the pavement in the court in the front of the church the sight was pitiablemothers weeping over their children the sons bending over the dead bodies of their fathersand one poor woman was clinging to the hand of her husband whose body was fearfully mangled most of the sufferers were pilgrims and strangers the pasha was greatly moved by the scene of woe and he again and again commanded his officers to give the poor people every assistance in their power and very many by his humane efforts were rescued from death i was much struck by the sight of two old men with white beards who had beeu seeking for each other among the dead they met as i was passing by and it was affecting to see them kiss and shake hands and congratulate each other on having escaped from death when the bodies were removed many were discovered standing upright quito dead and near the church door one of the soldiers was found thus standing with bis musket shouldered among the bodies which reached nearly as high as his head this was in a corner near the great door on the right side as you come in it seems that this door had been shut so that many who stood near it were suffocated in the crowd and when it was opened the rush was so great that numbers were thrown down and never rose gain being trampled to death by the press behind them the whole court before the entrance of the church was covered with bodies laid in rows by the pashas ordders so that their friends might find them and carry them away as we walked home we saw numbers of people carried out some dead and some horribly wounded and in a dying state for they had fought with their heavy silver inkstands and daggers fashionable manners
