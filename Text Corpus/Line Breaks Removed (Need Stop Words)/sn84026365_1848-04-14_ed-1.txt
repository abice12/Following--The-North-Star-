from parkers letter on slavery effects of slavery on law and politics i now call your attention to the influence of slavery on law and politics its local effects on the slave states in special its general effects on the politics of the union in the settlement of america only the people came over nobility and royalty did not migrate the people the taild instate of course brought the institutions and laws of their native laud these are the national la hits so to say but they brought alsop ditieal sentiments and ideas not represented bv the institutions or the laws sentiments and ideas hostile thereto and which could not be made reil in england but were destinedas are all such ideasto form institutions and make laws in their own image there are three such political ideas which have already found a theoretical expression and have more or less been made facts and become incarnate in list itutioiis ami laws these are first the idea that in virtue of his manhood each man has unalienable rights not derived from men or revocable thereby but derived only from god second that in respect to these bights all men are created equal third that the sole design of political government is to place every man in the entire possession of all ins unalienable rights the priesthood nobility royalty did not share these ideasnor the sentiments which led to them these ideas were of the people they must form a democracy the government oi all for all and by alla commonwealth with no privileged classa state without nobles or kingsa church without prelate or priest these ideas in becoming facts and founding political institutions to represent themselves modified also the an riont and c ommon law he laws of england said sir john bortescue in the lifieentli century the laws of england favor liberty in every ease let him who favors not liberty be judged impious anti cruel after the natimal and solemn expression of the above democratic ideas the laws must favor liberty yet more and new institutions come into being accordingly on the free states of the north where these ideas have always had the fullest practical exposition ever since the devolution there lias been a continual advance in legislation laws becoming more humane universal principles getting established and traditional exceptions becoming annulled in law the theory of these ideas so far as expressed in institutions and habit and m societythe practice thereof so liras thev have passed into actual life acre is a constant levelling upward the low are raisedthe slave the servant the nonfreeholder the lofty not degraded j u the constitutions of nearly all the free states it is distinctly stated that all men are created equal in rights und in all it is implied they all are advancing towards a realization of that ideaslowly but constantly they have lost none of the justice embodied in the common law of their ancestors hut gained new justice and embodied it ill their ow n forms this idea of the natural equality of all men in rights is inconsistent with slavery accordingly it is expressed in the constitution of hut one slave state virginia it is consistently rejected by the politicians of the south this difference of ideas must appear in all the liituutious of the north and south and produce continual and conflicting modifications of the common law of the north star england which they both inherit if theone idea adds justice thereto the other takes it away w among the institutions inherited from england were the trial by a jury of twelve men in all matters affecting liberty and life the presumption in favor oi life liberty and innocence the wight of every man under restraint to have a legal reason publicly s mnn for his confinement by a writ of habeas corpus the form of the latter is indeed modern but its substance old and of uncertain date these three have jong been regarded as the great safeguards of public justice and in the legislation of the free states remain undisturbed in their beneficent action extending to every person therein in the slave states the whole class of bondmen is in fact mainly deprived of them all i by the customs of england and her law while villanage obtained there the rule was that the child followed the condition of its father filita scquuur palran hence the issue of a free nitn though horn of a servile mother was always free in virtue of this maxim and the legal presumption in favor of liberty a presumption extending to all classes of men the child of a female slave which was born out of wedlock was of course free it j was possible the father was a free man the child gained nothing but existence from bis unknown father and the law would not make that a curse i he child of a slave father but born before the father was proved a slave retained his freedom forever if a freeman married a female slave she became free during the life ot her husband and the children of course were free the slave under certain circumstances could possess property acquired by devise by gift or other means it was so as a general rule through all the north of europe the more cruel maxims of the homan slavecode never prevailed with the teutonic race the have could make a contract with bis lord binding as that between peer and peer he could in bis own name bring an action against any one in some cases even against bis master he could in all cases and in his own name demand a trial by jury in a court of record to determine if he were born a slave or free to determine against him it was necessary not only to show in general that he was a slave but that he was the slave of someone person in special if it was simply shown that the man was a slave but was not shown to the jurys satisfact tion that he was the slave of the particular man who claimed hint the slave received his freedom at once as one derelict by bis master and if legally claimed by nobody he naturally belonged to himsell he could be a w itness in any court even when his master was an adverse party though not possessed of all the privileges of a citizen tcgalis homo not admitted to hold oflice or serve on a jury yet he could testify on oath even in criminal cases as any other man if a slave ran away and the master for oue year neglected to pursue him with public outcry and prosecution ol his claim the slave was tree by adverse possession oi himscli w bile he wasm hight and in actual possession ol freedom the master could not seize on his children or on his possessions he must legally possess the principal the substance before he could touch the subordinate and accident thereof did the slave flee to another borough or shire a jury of that place except incertain cases when the trial must take place in another county must not only convict him as a slave before the master could recover his body but must convict him of being the slave of that special claimant if the slave took orders in the church or became a monk lie was free from his master though this was an exception to the law in most catho olic countries if violence were offered to a female slave by her master she had redress as a free woman slaves had all the personal rights of freemen except in regard to their own respective masters and in some cases even then there was no hindrance to manumission in america the laws relating to slavery are in many respects more severe than the english laws since the norman conquest respecting villainsre gardant or in gross ilie childs condition follow that of the mother this american departure lruin the common law was early made by statute and the opposite maxiin the rule of the civil law extended over the slave states partus sajuihtr vent rein illegitimate children of female slaves were of course slaves forever though the father was free but for this alteration many thousands of men now slaves would have been free contrary to the old common law of england but in obedience to the roman code the american slave in law is regarded merely as a thing doomed as judge ruffin of north carolina sorrowfully declares to live without knowledge and without the cat parity to make anything his own and to toil that another may reap the fruits in one of the slave states trial by jury is allowed to him in uil capital cases sometimes with the concurrence of a grand jury sometimes without sometimes he is allowed to challenge the juror for cause tho not peremptorily but in south carolina virginia and louisiana the slave is not allowed a jury trial even when his life is in peril in otne other he has the protection of a jury when arraigned for inferior offences but in every slave state he may he beaten to right is of no sextruth is of no colorcod is the fatcier of us all and all we ar brethren the extent of thirtynine lashes wcl laid on without the verdict of a jury bui by the decision of a body of justices othe peace varying in number from twe to five in all cases he is fried by met who regard him only as a thing nevei by a jury of his peersnot even by i mixed jury of slaveholders and slaves some states have made humane provisions to guard against popular excitement removing the trial to anothci county now and then humane decisions are made in their favor by jusl men but these arc exceptional spots of humanity amidst the general gloom of the slave code there is some difference in the legislation of the several states justifying the remark lng age made in europe that the condition ol slaves was mildest in the northhard est iu the south since the slave is a tiling he is not allowed his oath sometimes lie may give legal evidence for or against another slave though without any form ol solemn affirmation there are laws in all the slave states designed to restrain the master from excessive cruelty still they afford but incomplete protection to the slave he cannot biing an action against the oppressor in his own name for as a thing he has no rights no slave free negro or mulatto to the fourth degree of descent is allowed to testify against a white man as if this were not enough in south c aroliua and louisiana if a slave is injured or killed when only one white person is present and the presumption of guilt fall on theone white man he is allowed by statute to clear or exculpate himself by his own oath this law is worse than the code of the romans whose history was written in the blood of vanquished nations the slave lias no legal right of self defence against his masters assault and battery the female none against brutal violation the law of georgia directs that if any slave shall presume tc strike any white man such slave shall for the first offence suffer such punishment as the justice or justices shall see tit not extending to life or limb and for the second offeuce suffer deat in south carolina on his owners account he is allowed to slrke even a white man and the offence is capita only when twice repeated in kentucky the penalty is less severe bui applied to free menjof color as well as slaves a slave cannot be a party to a civil suit indeed when his condition is dobtful he may apply to a court and the court authorize some man to act as guardian and bring an action iu the slaves behalf and have investigation made of his servitude but the burthen of proof remains on the slaves shouldersto show that he is free the presumption that he is a slave pre sit mpfio jtlalcc partis prevail in all the south except north carolina where the slavecode is perhaps more humane than elsewhere and is thus declared by statute in south carolina and georgia it shall always be presumed that every negro indian mulatto and mestiso is a slave no adverse possession of himself however long makes a negro tree or his offspring horn while he is in that state in mississippi every negro or mulatto not able to prove that he is free inay he sold by order of court asa slave forever if an applicant for freedom is cast in his suit the ccurt is fully empowered to inflict such punishment not extending to life and limbas they should think fit the guardians shall pay the costs and in south carolina double those costswith damages to the owner of the slave in virginia such a guardian if defeated in his application may he fined loo in such a trial in maryland the master is allowed to challenge peremptorily jurors how difficult to find a guardian willing to incur the risk how more than difficult to secure justice when a negro is wrongfully claimed as a slave yet notwithstanding the general spirit displayed by such legislation some decisions have been made in the southern states remarkable for the nicety of legal distinction and the exactness of their justice even to the slave since the slave is a tiling in many states a conditional contract which the master has solemnly made with a slave is not binding on the master even after the slave has fulfilled the contract in spirit and letter this is notoriously the law in south carolina and even in virginia a contract made with a spade or mule binds no manwith a slave no more the court cannot proceed to enforce a contract between master and slave even though the contract should be fully complied w ith on the part of the slave this is a departure from the common law of kog laud and oven from the customs of the saxons and germans the common law of england jealously defends the little property of the slave his pecultnm by the common law of villanage in england and germany he could acquire property as it was said above and could transmit it to his heirs something of the sort was allowed even at rome rut in all the slave states this is strictly forbidden a slave cannot hold property solemnly devised to him by testament even by that of his master this provision enforced by statute in virginia north caroliua south carolina georgia mississippi kentucky and tennessee and perhaps ail the slave states is more rigorous even than the black codes of the spanish and portuguese co lonies by the common law the marriage of a slave was sacred as that of a peer of the realm the customs of turkey regard it as inviolable even thfe roman code respected that and the common law by making marriage a sacra rochester n y friday april  iment rendered it perpetual neither bond nor free may be separated from the sacraments of the church said the decretal of gregory the marriages among slaves must not be hindered and though contracted against their masters will ought not on that account to be dissolved but in the american law the slave cannot contract marriage in north carolina no marriage is legal between whites and persons of color including in the latter term all descended from a negro to the fourth generation to he continued from the herald j mrs madison a slave dealer i the albany patriot contains a letter frnjp its w ashington correspondent relating certain facts concerning mrs madison and her slaves which have occasioned us more pain and shame than any other narrutive of horrors that has yet reached us from the pandemonium of southern slavery the facts are not at all without parallels familiar and frequent but the person implicated is one w horn it is terrible to regard with j the feelings which her conduct chal i lenges mrs madison is above eighty years of age the widow of one of our most honored presidents and herself we have been glad to believe worthy of all the love and reverence which it does the heart so much good to render to those in whom the most glorious associations of our country cen tre three years ago she sold an old slave who had been nurtured on mr madisons farm and had been his barber and dressingman for a quarter ofa century he was purchased by ai northern senator to save him from the cotton field and is now working out the price of his freedom with his own hands among other slaves the i writer says she owned a mothersoodd years of age and her daughter of fifteen about three months ago the old lady called this girl into the parlor one day nominally to bring her some water i but really to show her to a georgian as the colored people call the slave drivers the girl was quick on the scent and at a glance perceived that she was to be sold her mistress mrs madison agreed with the purchaser to send the unprotected child to the pump at a certain hour ou a day fixed upon when he could conveniently seize andi carry her off the gii embraced an early opportunity to retire behind the scenes find has not made her appearance on the stage since immediately after this event mrs madison either piqued a little at the loss of the daughter or from her necessities offered the mother for sale by great good luck she found a family in the city in want of a colored womanlike herself the price was paid to her mistress and she is now at work with the prospect of freedom sometime the reason assigned formis madisons conduct in these cases is that poverty and want forced it upon her mr madison it is said left a good estate including one hundred slaves mrs madison received a few years ago from congress for her husbands manuscripts and is now boring lor sioooo more for the balance of those same papers mrs madison is herself a mother by her first marj riage and no degree of want that she j could possibly suffer could tempt her if she has u heart to sell anothers child away into southern bondage it was unmothcrly it was unwomanly it i was brutal to barter away the maiden i virtue of that poor child and it would have disgiaced her w idowhood no more t to sell her husbands dead body to the i surgeons than his old barber to the souldriver his horse or dog would be treated w itb more tenderness by any washerwoman with an american heart in her than his bodyservant received from his wife out upon her it would degrade our manhood to re l spect her if she were our own mother can it be true mrs madison a dealer in human flesha broker of maidenhood we wish we had not heard it j from honitta jowual tiie influence of tract it is my conviction that more will have to be dune through the press than by any other means lecturing and preaching are great things but they are not the greatest i hey can do something which the press cannot do but the press can do much which they cannot do tracts can go evei vwhere tracts never blush i racts know no fear tracts never stammer tracts never stick fast tracts never lose their temper tracts never tire tracts never die tracts can be multiplied without end by the press tracts can travel at little expense they want nothing to eat they require no lodgings they run up and down like the angels of god blessing all giving to all and asking no gift in return you can print tracts of all sires on all subjects and in all languages and tracts can be read in ail places and at all hours and they caa talk to one aswell as a multitude and to a multitude as well as one they require no public room to tel their story in they can tell it in the kitchen or the shop the pahar or the closet in the railway carriage or in the omnibus on the broad highwar or in the footpath thro the fields and they dread no notsji or tumultuous interruption they take no note of scofls or jeers or taunts of noisy folly or malignant rage thej bear all things endure all things suffei all things and take harm from nothing they can talk even when the bi iso great as to drown all other voices and they stop w hen they are bid or a least when they have done they never continue talking after they have told their tale no one can betray them into hasty or random expressions and they wih wait mens time and suit themselves to mens occasions and conveniences they will break oft at any point and begin again at any moment where they broke off and though they will not alway s answer questions they w ill tell theii story twice or thrice or four times over if you wish them and they can be malic to speak on every subject and on every suhject they may he made to speak wisely and well they can in short be made the vehicles of all truth the teachers and reformers of all classes the regenerators and benefactors of all lands i want my friends to give this subject their attention i teel persuaded that the importance of the press as a means of spreading simple gospel truth and promoting simple christian piety is not yet fully understood or it it be properly understood the press has never vet been employed as it ought tobe in this great work luther w rote and published no less than eleven hundred works in a few years most of them small tracts or single sheets he published at one time from two to three hundred in a single year it was the multiplication of these tracts and hooks by the press and heir plentiful distribution among the multitudes that gave pow er to the reformers principles and shook the power of the popedom and worked so great a reformation it was chiefly by a plentiful supply of cheap tracts that wesley gained his influence with the masses of our countrymen and worked such happy wonders in our land it was chiefly by means of a plentiful supply of cheap tracts sold cheap or freely given away that the early quakers shook the nation and in spite of some excesses in their conduct and some mysteries and errors in their opinions almost frightened the priests and sectarians out of their w its it was chiefly by means of tracts that joseph livesey and some of his fellow workers roused the country on the subject of tcetotalism and gained for the principle such a firm and general lodging in the souls ot the community livesey did not lecture so much hut his tracts the fair expounders of his principles were always speaking live scy did not visit one place in a hundred but his tracts went everywhere livesey could speak only english hut his tracts were soon made to speak both welsh and german his tracts made others become lecturers and supplied the lecturers with truths and facts and arguments and it must be chiefly by tracts that the principles ofa pure and practical christianity must be spread through the w orld tracts have already done gootv without end and they may easily be nuhlc to do still greater good let tracts he freely and plentifully circulated and they will rouse the whole country they will shake the foundations of every corruption in the land and bring people in i multitudes from darkness to light from superstition and error and sin to the wisdom and purity and blessedness of the gospel of christ they will not only set people a thinking but a talking too they will raise up lecturers and help to qualify them tor their work they will bring about a reform w hich will bless all ages and spread purity i and freedom and peace through ail the countries of the earth frmn the pcim freeman little instrumentalities  reader did you ever go out among your neighbors to circulate autisla very petitions to distribute tracts orto solicit contributions for the slaves treasury and return weary sad and discouraged because success seemed not to attend your efforts was the contribution denied the tract received with indifference the petition ridiculed the argument and earnest remonstrance coldly heard did a halflormed  thought rise to your lips it is of no use to try did the sadness of your reflections on the apathy the selfishness j the hardheartcdiiess of those in w hose breasts you sought to awaken an interest for the slave weaken your faith in the power of truth then listen while we tell you of an incident which occurred in this city a few weeks since a young man came into the antislavery office and asked for some tracts entering into conversation with him w e found him deeply interested in our cause and w filing to give substantial evidence of ins love for it he informed us that his interest iu the suhject was first awakened by a visit ol two antislavery women to a store in market etrect where he was employed as a clerk their errand was to solicit d nat ions or the antislavery treasury their con versa ion attracted his attention and the tracts which they left were perused by himself and another clerk in the store and both of them be i came deeply interested in the cuus of the slave one of the partner in the firm also avowed himself an abolitionist we were not surprised at thi young mans aith in the efficacy of tract distribution or by hi generoo  ffcr to contribute and to collect mmey to pay for the publication of these little but mighty raiive of truth they who sowed the seed from which this good fruit has sprung perchance know nothing of the result of their labors it mav be that they account that day labor as lost and were at kmoe as weary sad disheartened a you have sometimes been yet their good seed sank in good soil and while they were giving their thought and their labors to othei efforts or perchance lamenting the dif cullies in their way it was tending outroots deep and wide and upbringing freshness and beauty reader will you remember this little incident when you are tempted to despond it may inspire a new resolution it may hear to your soul a gill ot strength for a new deed of love it may revive your drooping hope e whugu forth with anxious hearts bearing precious seed doubt not that ye shall come again rejoicing bringing sheaves with you character import vjit to a yopnii masan aged man may as an individual be eminently good or evil but his character is constantly losing its importance in reference to the world so far as the relations of life are concerned ihe is constantly either voluntarily or involuntarily detaching himself from all around him and becoming an isolated l being he reiiics from the bur the pulpit the senate chamber the cx change he withdraws from business aiid makes preparation to pass his houses and his lands into the hands ol others lie has no powers now to he cultivated in which the world feels any interest he has no passion to be rei strained from whose development the world would have anything to dread i he can form no plan stretching into future years on which the world would look with cither hope or fear he will indeed be respected if he is virtuous but he will hot be feared if he is wicked and whether the one or the other the weapon which he strikes in favor ol virtue or vice will be like that in the hand of the aged priam ti lum imbellc siik ktu we may love him as a father venerate him as a sage honor him for his past services or pity him on account of his i infirmities but we cease to rely on his arm in the defence of his country or his eloquent voice in favor of a i ight eaus cause and we cease to dread him as a foe not so however w ith a young man everything is passing into his hands the key of every warehouse of every hank and of every insurance office j every professors chair every deed and every bond and mortgage all the endowments of colleges and asylums our libraries our dwellings our farms our gardens all the offices of the town l ship and of the nation all the entcr prises of national improvement and all the plans of benevolence iruits ol many prayers and of thoughtful wis domall these things are soon to be committed to youngmen in effcry i

the frame is weak and j palsied if there is anything that will kindle up that eye with momentary brilliancy or inspirit that frame it is the expanding virtue of a s n and the feeling that the coming generation w ill j not be unworthy to receive a trust so dear to a departing chiistinn and patriot so the aged patriarch jacob when he was borne down under ai weight of years and he felt that he j was

innocent though confessedly of a dangerous tendency if the following anecdote will not convince the most obdurate mind of the perils which attend the indulgence of any of our appetites whether natural or acquired there is no force in illustration and argument is worse than idle we knew a youth at school in fact he was a friend of ours whose seat was at the end of the bench next the school house door so that when the door was opened he was screened from the sight of the school master taking advantage of this circumstance the sly rogue used to take a quiet nap every evening during the summer time when the dor was set ajar to admit of a circulation of fresh air it so happened that the master stalking about the room one hot afternoon espied the delinquent dozing away against all discipline and scholarly behavior our school master was not a member of the antiflagellation society of teachers and accordingly aroused ibe juvenile dreamer in a way comprthenobic only to those who have spent

the force of habit slavery and methodism an occurrence recently took pluce in charleston south carolina which displayed in a remarkable degree the arrogance and assumption of slaveholders the methodist book of church discipline from the days of wesley to the present time has contained a clause declaring slavery to lie a great evil v hen the methodist church in this country separated the southern branch endeavored to have the objectionable clause expunged but from motives of policy or the fear of assuming a position so contrary to the tirst principles of justice and sound reason it was suffered to remain a short time since a gentleman called at the methodist book depository in charleston and purchased a copy of the discipline which he showed to a person present requesting him to note the time and place of the purchase shortly after the keeper of the depository was summoned before the mayor on a charge of circulating an incendiary publication and to escape the penalties of the law which are fine and imprisonment or the penitentiary we do not remember which he in company with the methodist preachers stationed i in the city and the editors of frit southern christian advocate were obliged to give bonds that no more of the books should he circulated in charleston nor at the missionary stations established in various parts of the state for the religious instruction of slaves

expressed that bath may soon have anothei and similar visit for a county town the people of bath are decidedly candid aud liberal i have as aversion to addressing menon moral subjects in such towns they are generally dead to everything but sectarianism and politics and it i hard to reach them on any other subject our meeting this evening was interesting throughout prejudice against color was the subjct its immediate bearing on the question of equal rights in the new districi school made it a practical subject for the whole community to consider and gave point to the discussion the chairman of the school committee a liberalminded gentleman w as present during the whole series and though apparently much interested at the former meetings he apjiearcd much more wat the last one and if he docs not favor the admission of colored children into the districi school it will not be in consequence of any ja rsonal objection on his part the friends of human equality here will wait with much anxiety the decision of this question there are powerful influences operating against the rights of colored children the church aud pulpit as usual enlisted in the cause of popular oppression on the side of the strong against the weak the methodist ministci nf this place asked his neighbor indignantly ho you think would put myself on a level with a nigger how like his heavenly master huw meek how like

the broai bosom of the noble chesapeake it is me there by lumber merchants from baltimor anl philadelphia by whom it is bought an variously distributed between those two grea cities this river is now full of rafts cob as it is men are standing nearly waist dee in water collecting the lumber and forming i into rafts while some are being preparei others are moving off on their five days vov age to port deposit seven or eight hundrei rafu have already passed on their way wi should like to descend the river on one of them it must be a romantic voyage not quite s wild now perhaps as when louis philippe exking of the french in company with tw indians made the voyage in a canoe then has been some change in the scenes here a well as in his experience since that time civilization on one hand and the spirit of liberty on the other have left an indelide impression on bothbut to the rafts they are rudely constructed vessels without sails or paddles j and are completely at the mercy of the swifi rolling current except a broad oarby which the are steered for miles they float smoothly anc silently on the unruffled bosom of the tranquil i susquehannapassing through some of the wildest and grandest scenery in the country there is however some interruption of this smooth sailing the journey is not without its hardships and dangers and at titfcc require much energy and skill in order to its successful performance there are some uglv places in the streamwhirling rapids to be descended where the utmost care and activity is required to prevent the raft from being wrecked canawaga falls is talked of by these iuland j sailors in much the same strain as tarsi speak of the gulf stream it is said they are quite difficult of navigation and a safe descent over them is regarded as a bad job over with as there is no ascending the river the current being strong men that go down on the nifts from here return home from their southern journey by the way of philadelphia and new york these raftsmen we should judge are pretty wild boys many of them go down with jockets and only the prudent return w ith full ones and the fools among them though with full purses at the mouth of the river often find themselves moneyless on leaving new york it requires some intelligence and much virtue for persons in their situation to escape the skillful networks of the wicked almost everywhere set in large cities to entrap the i stranger there are a good many colored iversons engaged in the rafting business some i of whom arc men of the most praiseworthy industry and perseverance our friend e l platt to whom more than all others we arc indebted for active cooperation with our cause in bath is engaged in this business and makes n anuual voyage down this river and being a merchant withal he avails himself of the opportunity thus afforded of purchasing his summer supply of goods in philadelphia and new york it is a source of great encouragement and hope to see colored men entering into mercantile as well as other branches of respectable and profitable employments we say to every colored man not with the motive of iago get moacy in thy purseget money in thy purse white men can afford

methodist and disciples churches after the promise of both on the ground of infidelity i it was enough for them to know that i was amora suasion abolitionist to ensure opposition but the people of hanover at least agreat many of them desired to hear the subject of slavery discussed and were quite disappointed when the doors of these chris j tian churches were closed against me among these were many presbyterians who i at this crisis of the matter opened their house by for the largest and finest in the place and the slave despite ail the opposition of the con servaiives had two most

one time approaching the ba and talking over the rail to some visi tersagain seen taking a friendly cha with the lord chancellor on the woo sack and sharing a seat with him then now on one bench with a group o members about himand a few minutn after on another bench with an entirelj different group may be seen a plain j clumsy looking man both in drew and person about sixtyfive years o age with long face subjected to nervous twitching a nose inclined t turn up large and looking as if it hat been abruptly cut otf at the endhii hair coarse and thick and grizzly brown growing far down on his forehead am carelessly rubbed down as smoothly aj such hair will admit one shoulder t little depressed and a side way movement in walking i no sooner put my eye on him that i enquired of a gentleman standing near if that was lord brougham hati been standing at poets comer anc asked the same stranger if the structure about me was westminster abbey i could not have excited his surprise more certainly sir was his reply anc looked at me enquiringly or wonderfully as if doubting there could be an man living who stood in nerd ofthe information i askedthere is something so entirely sui generis in the appearance and manner of this learned lord as he is termed iu debate that no one who has seen punch andi other caricatures whose sketches showup the odd outlines of his lordshipt head and face could for one moment hesitate in selecting him out at first sight he speaks on almost every subject that conics upand his voice and manor are as peculiar as his appearance whilst speaking he has the habit of i pressing his elbows to his side and turn ing the palms of his hands upward suys what he has to say in rather a crackd and husky voice and keeps up a constant jerking and swaying his head and shrugging his shoulders and indicating by his general manner that the subject matter as well as the entire circle about him arc equally at his fingersendsseldom fails to raise a laugh in one quarter at the expense of another he is said to be almost incapable of letting an opportunity slip by unheeded which admits of a crack at some opponent among the numerous anecdotes of this nature related of him i will here state one illustrative of his temper and manner it occurred at the time mr webster was last in fngland and at a period when the then ministry stood in a tottering position and were expected every hour to throw up their hands and give place to others lord brougham accompanied mr webster one evening to the house of lords and placed him in rather a conspicuous position and wending his way among the members chatting to one and another and evidently letting them know that a distinguished visiter was present for those he spoke to would turn and take a look at our senator shortly after a member rose and asked the postponement of some resolutions which had been marked down for discussion that evening and in the course of his request expressed a hope that it would meet the approbation and assent of the learned lord whereupon lord nodded assent this done another similar request was made by another member in regard to another resolution j and also hoping it would meet the assent i ofthe learnedlord this drew from him a like assent with an extra nervj ous twitch of his nose and check and strange to say a third similar request followed with an equally special hope that it would also meet the assent of the learned lord whereupon his lordship rose and taking his peculiar ntti tude remarked that when he came down to the house that evening he did not i suppose that so much honor and personal distinction awaited himthat he had scarcely got his seat before one noble lord made a direct appeal to him for his assent to the postponement of one question and this followed by a second appeal from another noble lord and now again comes a third equally looking to his special acquiescence why me luds this is strange in deed aud not less embarrassing to me should any distinguished stranger be now present and here he turned and looked toward mr webster and nearly every head turned instinctively in that direction also i say me luds if any distinguished stranger were here present he would really be led to suppose that i was a man of some consequence herewhen it is well known to your ludships that i have at this present moment no more weight or influence in this house than here he paused and looked over the table that l separated him from the ministerial bench and making a bow in that direcj tion than anv of his majestys minis ters this of course brought a general chuckle in which the ministers themselves could scarcely refrain from join ingthough probably not so joyously after describing as i have attempted to describe the crsnnal appearance of this distinguished manit might be deemed discourteous to trace a resemblance to any distinguished person at homeand yet there arc handsome and ugly likenesses traceable between individuals if the hon c j ingersoll of pennsylvania wore his hair less closely cut and its color was a shade or two lighter his resemblance to lord brougham would be very markedhe has i think a decided advantage over his lordship as well in jiersonal beauty as intellectuality ofexpression there nre various features in the house of lords during the session of peers that give an air of dignity to it but take away the lawn sleeves and ample clerical dress of the bishops remove the bigwig and gowm of the lord chancellor cut off the associations that w ill instinctively gather around men who are there and whose as

politicians are so exceedingly afraid of doing wrong that they scarcely ever dare do what is right not so joshua r giddings from his first advent to public life he has made i war heart and hand upon the aggressions and iniquity of the slave power buffeted and scorned at first he redou i bled his blows the more he was reviled till he has compelled that power to abate much of its arrogance and listen with respectful attention but our object at present is not to eulogize mr giddings but to introduce a scene between him and a southerner and to commend to public admiration the manly course and nobly reply of mr giddings on that occasion it occurred on the floor of the house in february just after mr g had made a speech on the bill for the relief of the slavers owning the slaves onboard of the slave ships gomel and encomium the correspondent of the n y tribune from whose sketches w f e select the facts in this case censures this speech of mr g as too much a philippictoo little an argumenttoo violent and recriminating in its character a fault to which it must be confessed mr g is rather inclined but though sometimes bitter in expression he never loses his self control or becomes murderous in thought or bloody in deed as the following encounter sufficiently proves a scene followed the delivery of this speech such as never occurred i before and for the credit of the house and country it is to be hoped never will occur again a personal assault was made upon mr giddings by a southern member the newspapers of the day contained the particulars of the affair from some iof which the following scene is con j densed while mr giddings was speaking j this member w r as seen standing in front of the clerks desk evidently much excited after mr giddings had ceased he was observed to approach the aisle where mr g was standing and violently to push him out of it as mr g i turned round to see who his assailant was he passed close by him with his right hand inside of his vest apparently taking hold of his bowieknife mr giddings recognized him and addressed t him by name he stopped and with his hand still on his knife came hack to within some four feet of mr giddings land placed himself in a menacing j attitude directly in front of him mr giddings inquired did you push me and looked hnn directly in the eye as he spoke i did was the reply intentionally usked mr g yes for the purpose of iusult again demanded mr giddings yes again was the answer well sir replied mr g weare in the habit of leaving those men who w antonly insult others to thei contempt of public opinion by this time the friends of the member interfered and led him from the hall the excuse offered for his conduct at the time was partial intoxica tionexpress the press  the art of printing is perhaps the mightiest instrumentality ever contrived by man for the exertion of moral influence rev dr adams in his late address at yale college remarked in the city of strashurg on the i eastern

concealed from our hnowleifge bat not o the certain resuls its perils are already passedits difficulties have alieajy been removedwhen it shall have boen accomplished it will bo justly regarded as the noble effect which rendered the republic imperishable he dwelt often and emphatically on the words let it be remembeaed that it has ever been the pride and boast of america that the rights for winch shecontemfod wi re the rights of human nature uy the blessing of the author of those righto they have prevailed over all opposition and formed the liasis of thirteen independent states no instance has heretofore occurred nor can any instance be exjieeted hereafter to occur in which the unadulterated forms of republican government can pretend to so fair an opportunity of justifying themselves by their fruits in this view the citizens of tlie united suites re responsible for the greatest trust ever confided to a noliti society if justice good faith honor gratitude and all the other qualities which ennoble the character of a nation and fulfil the ends of government be the fruits of our establishments the cause ofliberty will acquire a dignity and lustre which it has never yet enjoyed and an example will be sn whic h cannot but have the most favorable influence on mankind if on the other side our governments should be unfortunately blotted with the reverse of these cardinal vrrtues the great cause which we have engaged to vindicate will be dishonored and betrayed the last and fairest experiment in favor of tbe rights of human nature will be turned against them and their patrons and

since as thought forever i conic back to them by your command to fulfil a higher duty and more honorable service than ever before devolved upon me i repay your generous confidence hy of feting to you this exposition of the duties of the magistrate and of the citizen it is the same which john quincy adams gave to the congress of the united states iu his oration on the death of janies madison it is the key to his own exalted character and it enables us to measure the benefits he conferred upon his country if then you ask what motive enabled liim to rise alsivc parties sects combinations prejudices passions and seductions i answer that he served his country not alone or chiefly because he knew her duties and her destiny and knew her cause was the cause ol human nature if you inquire why he was so rigorous in virtue as to be often thought austere i answer it was because human nature required the exercise of justice honor and gratitude by all who were elothed with authority to act in the name of the american people if you ask why he seemed sometimes with apparent inconsistency to lend his charities to the distant and the future rather than to his kindred ami times i reply it w as because beheld that the tenure of human power is oneon dition of its being lieneficieutlv exercised for the common welfare of the human race such men are of no country they belong to mankind if we cannot rise to this height of virtue we cannot hoe to comprehend tbe character of john quincy adams or understood the homage paid by the anuricau people to his memory nejd it be said that john quincy adams studied justice honor and gratitude not by the false standards of the age hut by their own true nature he generalized truth and traced it always to its source the bosom of god thus iu his defence of the amistad captives he began with defining justice in the language of justinian constans et perpetua voluntas jus suum enique tribuendi he quoted on the same occasion from the declaration of ludepen j dmee not by the way of rhetoru a embellishment and not even as a valid human ordinance but as a truth of nature of universal application the memorable w ools we hold these truths self evident that all men are created equal and that they are endowed by their fre ator with certain inalienable rights and that among these rights are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness in his vindication of the right of debate he declared that the principle that religious opinions were altogether be youd the sphere of legislative control was bu one modification of a more exteusive axiom which included the unbounded freedom of the press and of speech in the communication of thought in all its forms he rested the iavio lability of the right of petition not ou constitutions or charters which might be glossed abrogated or expunged imt in the inherent right of every animal creature to pray to its superiors th model by which he formed his character was cicero not the living cicero sometimes inconsistent often iresolute too often seeming to act a studied part and always covetous of applause rut cicero aa he aimed to be aud as he appears revealed in tboae inimorla emanations o
