meeting in canada on wednesday evening a great and most enthusiastic antislavery demonstration was made in the city hail his worship the mayor occupied the chair rev dr willis opened the meeting with an appropriate prayer the chairman then stated briefly the object of the meeting and called upon rev mr mcclure to move the firs resolution mr mcclure said the resolution entrusted to him was to the effect that slavery that is the wanton and forcible bringing into bondage and retaining indefinitely in that state of rational beings is an outrage on the laws ot humanity and of the bible and that the continued existence of the practice on this continent is just cause of grief and demands our best exertions by all lawful and practical means for its extinction slavery was denied in this resolution as the wanton and forcible bringing of rational beings into bondage and retaining them indefinitely in that state now he had not to draw a picture ot what slavery is in order to prove to the audience what was meant by the term it was defined in the words of the resolution and it appeared to him that his present duty was simply to sustain the facts therein stated by a reference to what they all knew they knew that there were in existence at present on this continent three millions of rational creaturesbeings like themselves men women and children designated by the law as chattels and so entirely in their owners power as to be bound or loosed bought or sold worked or fed housed lashed driven imprisoned insulted and dishonored maimed hunted down or shot down just as their owners please this is what is called in the resolution wanton and forcible bringing into bondage he needed not to stop to prove these statements the papers of the city and the cummunications they received from almost every city in the neighboring states fully sustained the facts ho had so briefly referred to no relationship or affection was respected in this state of slavery thero was no respect paid to the relationship of father or children of husband and wife or of menbers ol churches professing christianity for the husband was liable to be sold away from bis wife and the wife to be torn away from her family and sold into bondage it is the same with regard to children and there is no deference paid to their affections or ties of relationship this therefore was a good definition in his resolution in reference to that the law of the slave slates is that the children follow the law of their motherthat is the mother being a slave the children no matter who the father may be are slaves inconsequence of the mother being a slave the result is that the fathers of the children are not unfrequently their masters and thus their own children are their slaves and they treat them with no greater lenity than they do those bought by them either from bondage or from other men they are refused education only so far as their instruction may benefit their masters they are taught various trades and branches of labor so far as that labor or these trades will promote the interest of their mastor but they are not educated as men and women ought to be educated the owner of such property know well thbt instruction wilt make them all the more uneasy in their bonds and particularly the instructions ot our holy religion it is a well known fact that a freeman though betake away the life of a slave may have little difficulty in securing his retreat and obtaining impunity for his crime yet if that freeman persist in teaching a slave knowledgeparticu larly the knowledge of the bible of god there is no more mercy for that man he is seized fined and imprisoned and the roost relentless feelings are shown to such a man it is too bad and what no man has a right to do with his fellowman unlees he is convicted of crime or of breaking the just laws of hie country it if too bad to chain and bind and flog and sell his bones and muscles but it was far worse to keop the key of knowledge out of bis hand and to shut out from him the knowledge pc that eternal life in the word of god the north star frederick doclass mltr ul propriftor vol iv no which is fso capable of ministering comfort to the wretched need he stay to prove the utter repugnance of all this to our common human nature it would be waste of time the rudest and most thoughtless mind would at once see the injustice and the wanton cruelty of such a state of things a seaman in a british vessel who was in the southern states on taking a ramble after his work with some of and women put up for sale as he had been in the habit af seeing old furniture in his own country put up he and his companions stood thunder struck for a time at last he said well jim if the devil dont get these fellows i dont know what use there is for a devil not only is such conduct repugnant to our humanity but to the whole teaching of the spirit of the bible and it is in this view an impossibility for a man to carry out in his own heart or practice the teachings of that holy bible and bean abettor of slavery i thou shall love thy neighbor as thy i self tells us the grand object for which we circulate the scriptures and for i which we bear christs banner to the i remotest corners of the earth now i slavery is entirely opposed to this prin i ciple and it is utterly impossible under i such a system to preach from that text i thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the very phraseology of i the bible is against it the savior i says a new commandment i give i unto you be kindly affectioned one toward another in honor preferring ione another but it is opposed also ito the very letter of the bible it is i directly opposed to that summary of the i moral law which the lord jesus christ i lays down for the guidance of the church i in all ages of the world in matt i and he says all things whatso i ever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them this is a brief law and easily recollected it is clear and easily understood and it isa law so substantially general that itis impossible to misapply it it is retrospective as well as prospective forsays the redeemeron these hang all the law andlhe prophets the existence of such a law as this described in the resolution is a grief to the christian church and so long as his memory reached back the subject of slavery has been a cause of grief to good men and good women wherever he had travelled it is an old principleold as the book of godold as the laws of the almighty it is not only a cause of grief to those who live under institutions so favorable to freedom as are those of britain and in a land where no man can be a slave to his fellow menwhere every man the moment he plants his foot upon british soil can no longer be a bondman but if he obeys the law of the land and follows a course of honest industry he has all the advantages of citizenship and since he recollected that had been the boast and glory of his native land in some parts of the british possessions it is no doubt but as that the stain was washed away yet he rejoiced that it was washed away it took years for the full enunciation of these principles and wasted the lives of many good men to accomplish this but their lives were not thrown away and the day was coming when every bond of every bondman shall be taken away and when the liberty indicated in the word of god shall become as universal as the family of man the rev gentleman here read an extract from an merican paper showing the evils of slavery and sat down amidst great applause professor esson in seconding the resolution regretted that having had no previous intimation of the motion which he was now called to support he was not prepared to do that justice to the cause which he would ardently desire what was it that constituted the guilt of murder tbe poor beetle that we tread on in coiporal huffering feels a pang as great as when a giant dies that life which is like a bubble blown upon tbe bosom of the water this moment to burst the next why should it be thought a deed so dark a crime so inexpiable to take it away hear the language of inspiration whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shedfor in the image of god he made man this it is which constitutes the infinite distance between him that killeth an ox and him that slayeth a man if it bea crime to lake away this poor dying lile of ours the breath of man which is in his nostrils what shall we say of slavery which is soulmurder what shall we say of the man who tramples in the dust the image of the god of heaven and who takes away the inalienable rights of the being god created for his own glory to show forth his praise and who therefore is responsible alone to the god whose image he bears for his actions and his conduct here then lies the infinite guilt of taking the being made in the image of god and treating him as a brute creaturerating him amongst goods and chattels as a part of human property taking from him every possibility of fulfilling his responsibility to the god who created him to be his minister who created that soul to be made happy now in tbe enjoyments of the communion of god and happy forever in the full enjoyment of god fere is the double crime of inhumanity and impiety hare is the highest cfime that can be perpetrated treason shatnet both god and mana crime ijucb enlist heaven and earth

other communities if to intermeddle with the affair of our neighbors in the same community be impertinent to interfere with the affairs of another independent country is inconsistent with the rights and the laws of nations but there are things which cannot be made ex bihsivfijjrpnefitv vm sllowivl jniversal indefeasible rights of man all over the the globe are the common conern and must be the common cause af all menof all nations the prerogative and rights of humanity admit not of circumscription by time or place the divine character of free agency is jiven to every brother of the race and we have no more right to despoil him oft than we have to absolve him from he responsibility of every tree and noral agent to the most high god nonan no nation has a right to say that his universal right of humanity is not heir own cause this all men are not ly permitted but are bound to con iider as their own cause as what most ntimately and essentially affects every individual and every nation

sim whose inspiration gave it could t pagan auditory a heathen assembly n a roman theratre upon the utterance of the lines of one of their poets l am a man and nothing that affects humanity can be indifferent to mer could even the romans accustomed as they were to the ferocious sports of their amphitheatres rise at once and express their sympathy with the language of their dramatist and shall christian men not feel as a heathen or pagan community and that they have a right to speak and to be heard in a cause which annihilates all conventional distinction they had a right to use all the means which god and nature have put into their power to remove an evil which is a plague spot upon the face of gods earth let him not be misunderstood as if with these views he would use the language of reproach in treating of the existence of slavery in the neighboring states for he felt that the guilt lies not wholly upon those whose condition they lamented as having that inheritance transmitted to them from their fathers they ought to feel that their own country has been greatly guilty and that this is the common guilt of the civilized and christian world and he would say further that the manner in which they should now make atonement is for all christian men for allcizilized and enlightened men to join their hearts and hands in a peaceful crusade and to be ready to give freely of their money in order to indemnity the slaveholders and in order in one united confederacy to form a glorious and holy enterprise not merely to emancipate the slaves for that would be the least part of the work but to educate enlighten civilize and christianize them and not only these our brethren of africa but all those nations that may be regarded as in a state of barbarism or semibarbarism applause no country has a greater or more imperative duty laid upon her than britain britain has assigned to her the high positionof advancing civilization and advancing the interests of all the family of man their great effort should be to combine as christian men and as communities to form an enlarged and divine mission for the purpose of saving from degradation their brethren who are compared with themselves like mere children and they are called upon like elder brothers to take them under protection and to impart to them that knowledge which will elevate them to the standard of human beings here was a great work surely very different from that undertaken by the crusaders in the dark ages which only deluged the earth with blood his motion did not at all say that thej were to revile their brethren of the united states to whom the curse of slavery bad been transmitted as an inheritance nor did it call upon them to condemn the evil and ait still as if there was no call upon them to do anything it is the duty of britain as well aa the united states to see that thia common guilt ia expiated and a call is made upon all christiana to combine in the spirit of love and brotherly kindneaa to endeavor to redeem their brethren in the united states as well the slaveholders as the slaves themselves who are unhappily oppressed by this incubus they are called upon to see whether the combined wisdom and intelligence of christiana and of civilized men enlisted in the cause of religion and humanity cannot teach the world that it ia possible for once to unite in a truly christian enterprise worthy of the divine and beneficent religion they profess great applause the chairman having put the resolution u wns carried dr wiutfmtd the reeolutioa so rochester n y thursday march trusted to him was in the following words that entertaining the feelings of brethren and friends to the inhabitants of the neighboring states in the most part united to us by a common origin and common if nguage and disclaiming all desire to intermeddle officiously with their internal affairs we fee we but take the privilege of our common riwr however severe either political or domestic civil military or naval hut m i the forced servitude in perpetuity i the helplesa poor unaccused untried iand uncondemned imposed on them by a power which they cannot resist supported by laws in which they have no voice the laws are grievously aggravated by the fugitive slave bill are at open variance with the best interests of man as endowed by our great creator with the privilege of life liberty and the pursuit of happi nessprivileges and rights always inalienable except when forfeited by crime charged and proved he could not do better than begin where his worthy friend left off and reiterate the sentiments he so well urged towards the conclusion of his address that to consult together and to act together in this cause even on a soil that is itself happily free from the evil ol which they complained is no undue interference with any right of neighborhood it was well said that no man should put away from him the cause of his fellowcreatures and no one should feel himself free from the duty of endeavoring to vindicate the aggrieved that is the duty of humanityit is enforced upon them by the doctrines of christianity they had an answer to give in these words of the sacred scriptures remember them who are in bonds as being bound with them and them that suffer adversity as being ourselves also in the body and he did remember also among the other sayings of solomon due therefore to his inspired wisdom he remembered among his many aphorisms with regard to those who are delivered to deathlf thou gayest behold we knew it not doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it and shall not he render to every man according to his works so that they were not only enjoined to vindicate the rights of the oppressed but admonished also of the dangei v being negligent it doing their part in this great work he time has been when the word strange and the word enemy were almost identical it ia happily not so now the nations in spite of themselves are acknowledging that they must work to getherthat their interests are mutual hence commercial interchanges and commercial treaties and political international communings cheers but in addition to that sort ol communion between nations and in addition to that which refers to selfpreservation there is a third sort of communion that they availed themselves of at this time and ought to recognise in the spirit of friendship between country and country the commenion of moral sympathy in seeking to do a neighbors part they would hasten to save others as the would save themselves from the guilt of great crime and the danger of that crime being sanctioned ami prompted by law whether on this side or on the other side of the lines it is but the business of philanthropyit is but a manifestation of love to your fel lowcreatures thus to hasten forward for the sake of the americans as well as for yourselves the cause of civilisa tion and religion and rational liberty and humanityapplause slavery involves a sort of relationship between the master or ownur as he is termed or the servant and slave as he is celled which our british jurists and our french jurists hold to be and he concurred with them a relationship which never can be legalized if they look to laws having their basis on reason and justice and humanity it is impossible to institute relationship between an owner and a slave and our frekines and stairs and montesquieus say it cannot be legalized he loved the principles of political equity laid down by montesquieu it has sometimes been said that slavery may be founded upon the right of conquest and montesquieu allows and puffendorf does not deny this they do not deny that there may be enforced service itis generally admitted that in certain caaes even life may be taken away and just as life may be taken away he did not dispute that liberty may be taken away this may be necessary under certain circumstances with a view to the safety and liberty of the community at large they all know that they but up the insane out of mercy to themselves and out of regard to the safety of the community too even so did they lay under restraint the depredator that property may be safe all that may be true and he would not say that in certain cases slavery may not be imposed by right of conquest to a certain extent but this he would say that every law natural aad sacred the opinion of every enlightened jurist in every part of the world want to this that neithor by the right of cooquest nor any power of human beings may men deaf capriciously with their teftow men without cause shown and crime chargedapplauseas the resolution expresses may not indefinitely dispose of human life and human liberty slavery has been contended forby those who have traced its history and imputed it to the right of conquer that iawtgfc m temss pot ann lirariably ii my met aj ve gotten into their power those fer ligand death who were found in tw atitude of seeking their destruc tifii jut it is but a mitigated use of if they impose bondage iiptelof death but however ii id said that in barbarous times tv victorious party exercised their rfthtofhusdealing with the captives he to be told that in this enlighted jmnh even the conqueror has a party r cerrwmv dictates and christianity dictates that no wanton liberty be taken either with the life or freedom of human beings over and above what can be asserted as necessary for the safety of those to whom providence may have given the victory ahd the ascendency montesquieu lays it down as a principle that if it can be proved that a man hasa right tq sell himself into bondage still he hap no right to sell his children and no into has a right to sell himself indefinitely for what is slavery many people lose sight of this question they forget to trace the matter to its lource and they faring forward some ascidental circumstance to compare it with they compare it with the relationship between master and servanf under circumstances very unfavorable where it is easy to make agood argument and they say that the grievatces under liberty are as great as those isnder the avowed designation of slavery now this resolution expresses that slavery in the united states is not to be compared with any kind of oppresuon however grievous which may be found in ordinary society in any departnent of life whatever it is easy to say tjiat there is a good deal of slavery in lorae of the cities of britain such as long hours and hard labor but no man is a slave and no woman is a slave in any sense to be compared to thf slavery be was talking of british justice renders the law open to every mtn to the servant as well as the mas tef what he complained of was hopeless servitude in these cases there was much hard labor and even oppression there is this peculiarity that they are in a state essentially different from slavery because in the eye of the law they are equal with the highest in the land and are not prevented from giving evidence upon any given case the slave on the other hand is adjudged to indefinite unrequited labor without contract and governed by the lafc of force alone thereforejt is that our jurists have ead that thw jaw cannot be enforced that a relationship existing by mere force alone can imply no obligations on the part of the slave let them tell the world as far as their feeble voices can sound let the press of our city carry the message thtt we regret for the sake of the states ol americathat we are ashamed for the sake of our brethren of the same language and ol kindred originthat they should have enacted a law which involves such an outrageous violation ofthe primary and fundamental rights of human beings as the fugitive slave law applause the relationship of min and servant as owner and slave sxists by no contract and there is no foligation binding on a man to remain moment longer in bondage than he can possibly help for there can beno violation or breach of contract where no contract exists great applause the man who seeks his way to the soil of freedom ought to be congratulated and hailed by all the inhabitants of the civilized world cheers he had regretted most of all to hear scripture abused and applied for the perpetuation of slavery though they had nothing more than the golden rule it is enough to discountenance it but then had they not the plain rule that roasters are to give to their servants that which is just and equal the scriptures are on the side of order and ha believed that to the end of time the relationship between master and servant would be essential a servant is respectable in his or her place by contract but no man has aright to ask of another indefinite and unrequited service and especially no man has aright by the law of scripture or the law of nature to deprive another of the rights of conscience and reasonand reduce a human being to a mere chattel no man has a right to relieve a human being of his direct responsibility to god if it be said of the murderer that he takes away what he cannot recall may it not be said of the man who stands between the scriptures of the mighty god and the creatures for whose benefit these were given that he takes upon him what he cannot answer for at the judgment day he caa not bear the burden of his fellowcrea ture and yet he depraves him to the level of the beast and stands between him and his hopes of eternity the worst slate of incidental oppression in all the wide range of civilized society where human rights hire recognised is not so low as that where the creature ie withheld from preparing to meet his godof preparing to receive at his hands the reward of everlasting life all the evil that can ba inflicted of atemporal kind cannot be compared to the evils of slavery besides expunging a mans chance of coinfort nod rational enjoyment in this life it does what it can to expunge hope for another world now for any man to say that chriatianitt eon enan fhi a to forget the whole purpose of the bible tie was quits awars m reading the old testament there would be found jwwsegaa permitting bondage under certain restrictions in regard toth heathen but no man would say whole no that because that special right was granted to the jews that other nations have that liberty neither the possessor of power in the british empire nor even those ton the continent of america will say that they have aright to extirpate their neighbors without provocation as to the bondage in he old testament there was a special erelation from the aimi to the i lews just as he might employ the pes iknr ofjtejwqrd to deal with those shall be put to death and it wtnni appear that when the jewe took slaves from other countries they bought only their services by such an argument it would be seen that the jewish bondage was of a different stamp from the bondage he was talking of and further the jews were not permitted to make bondmen of one another no christian nation therefore could involve in indefinite bondage their fcllowcrea tures and especially those who profess the faith and hope of christ in judea the servants were admitted by gods order to all the privileges rtf religions instruction to the privilege ol their sacred feasts and their djys and periods of sacred leisure how different this to the slave of the present day who may be at the altar of odd the one day and torn away by his covetous master to the slave market on the following one if thus the argument from the old testament shows that an israelite was not permitted to hold a brother jew in bondage much less is it permitted to drag into bondage or buy and sell men and women having one faith one hope one god one savior one law being a theologian he wished to dwell more upon that department of the subject he would speak of the new testament he found paul enjoining upon servants to obey their masters as he found in many passages in view of the greatness of the eternal hope everything that constituted a difference between one man and another treated as a small matter comparulively christ tells his disciples to cherish a patient and meek spirit and bear as far as they could what was thuir inevitable lot but noman who reads the scriptures can plead that they give a right to bring another into bondage however it maybe the poor slaves duty to submit inquiet to his lot he is bound to be faithful but the apoatl paul says that if he can be made free he is touse tan liberty rather he would maintain that thiefcanctioned the slave taking his liberty though be would not advise it imprudentlybut would tell him to wait till a good opportunity he had no hesitation in saying that itis a fair inference from that pasaage that if a slave can and if the whole number can either by confederation and united effort or otherwise secure their liberty they have a right to take it applause it is their natura right and no man may question thal right or if a man shall question that right and shall say they have no right to take their liberty he ask him upon what footing he defended the obligation for that man to remain in servitude it can only be on the ground of possession the man might say he owned the slave but could he show the right of transferwhere did he get him where did he get a right and title to him applause not event the slaveholders who cling most tenaciously to their illgotten wealth will say that they hold them by the right ol conquest or as men charged with crime who are required to be brought under restraint but they have then and they hold them opoo this principle he would say that if a slave b bound simply because he is an inferioi because he has been subjugated to t man claiming dominion over him he it entitled to take the first opportunity that presents itself to throw off hii chains and if by dint of superior forct he can make his pretended owner sab ject to him he has the same right u make the master his slave as the master had for keeping him in bondage no man has a right to sell himself ioti indefinite servitude and no man maj inflict personal bondage upon his fellowman but so far as right goes th slave bas the same right to subjugati his master whenever he has power ti do so neither has the right but hi defied all the slaveholders in the work to answer this argument if by tb mere fact of being under anothers do mjnion a party must be understood abound by the scripture law to obey and to obey indefinitely then the master who tomorrow should be brough into subjection by the slave would b brought into subjection by his slave wsuld be bound by these precepts town his master in turn and rende uiiiet and contented obedience thi reverend gentleman having again real the resolution sat down amidst grea applause mr p brown said that an importani part of the resolution wbieh bo rose m second hod already boon moch alluded to by previous epeakere vie tio intermeddling ub our neigbbon the united sletee he wee afraid thel however courteous the language of out resolution might be our sensitive friends ton the other side would still be offended one argument for our interference had not been alluded to it was wrong to remonstrate with our neighbor on bis great question it mast be wfcrtg to propagate the goa pel in heathen eud mohomedan coun bribe for geooioo cbrietianity broke kisbisas societies mutt close their proceedings oo they had no right to expect that heathen and mehomedaa raters would how moqp forbearance to them tliu they were disposed to do to those who held the fame precious faith with themselves cheers but americans were not remarkable for their scrupulosity in interfering with their neighbors it is not long since sym pathisers from the other side were found on the canadian soil it was but yesterday since an outbreak in one of the british kingdoms war fondly hailed at new york aa the beginning of a rebellion that might have torn to piece the british empiremoney was subscribed and emissaries sent to support that movement more recently still when we had a family quarrel in canada the traces of which are already fast disappearing the sympathi sers were again at band and they flattered themselves that because one house had been pulled down or destroyed we were ready to pull down the whole and walk into the union we meant no such interference as that with their concerns but as neighbors and having the same origin and professing the same faith we had an undoubted right to appeal to them in behalf of theioppressed of their land it was customary in the states to defend slavery on the ground that it was a british institution nothing could be hftmhaieba than such a defence been a most powerful argument abolition it would have been sounded in every corner of the land away with slaveryshall we leave this last trace of british oppression to diagyaee our statute book african slavery was not originally a national movement of any country but bad its origin in the selfishness and cruelty of individuals rhe first who stole men from africa to make slaves of them were the portuguese more than four centuries ago they were followed by the spaniards more than fifty years later for about two centuries englishmen to their disgrace partook of the same atrocious trade but the day of repentance at length arrivedbritain bought from the spaniards and portuguese their discontinuance of the slave trade a condition which they have never yet performed and as a crowning act gave twenty millions to ransom her own slaves from bondagemoney which was most cheerfully paid although it was equal to all the diminution of the national debt after twenty years peace britain had come out victorious from an unexampled war conquering all her enemies the victory was infinitely more noble for she then conquered herself cheers there was one thing he regretted in that trans actionit was that the lions share of the purchase money was not given to the blacks instead of being all given to the slaveholders suppose a judge bad been empowered to receive the claims of both parties he would have asked the slaveholders to specify the amount of theirsthis might have been set down in figures and their loss calculated but weigh that against the claims of the slaves and what would it amount to who could calculate a compensation for the oppression and helpless bondage endured for generations by that suffering race two thirds of the twenty millions should have been given to the blacksand with the remaining third the proprietors would have had flrr more than their fair proportion the example of britain in emancipating her slaves has been followed by france sweden and denmark and even the pacha of egypt and the semibarbarous chiefs of the principalities of the danube have set their bondmen free every movement lately on the european continent has been in favor of freedom in the united states it has retrograded go to washington and there we find in their proud capitol the representatives of twenty millions of people in the last year of the first half of the nineteenth century legislating gravely for ten monthsnot to break the shackles of tradenot to benefit their own people or the people of any other countrybut to extend the area of slavery over other countries where it does not exist unheard of cruelty to conquer nation for such apurpose it is without a parallel in the history of the world but it may be said a compromise was effected true california was admitted as a free state and why because she refused tocome in on any other terms and because she carried in her hands a golden tocher which the virtue of our republican neighbors was incapable of resisting to balance this great effort of magnanimity the atrocious slave bill was passed which cut the union into two grand divisionsslaveholders and slavecatchers applause goodmen in their legislature have opposed this iniquitous measure and that true patriot governor seward of new york informed his countrymen ihat there was a higher law than any human r enactment the law of the governor of the universe which was ever opposed to injustice and oppression but he was ridiculed by his colleagues and has been assailed for the noble sentiment by many public journals these i men seem to think that the almighty i has given up all control in the affairs of men and they rush on the thick bosses of his buckler they will yet discover that he who sit in heaven will have them in derision slavery i is doomed and must fall and let the people of canada do their utmost in accomplishing that desirable result applause r rhe chairman said after what the t audience had listened to they would i fel proud of being british subjects t slave onnnot live in britain i the moment they touch our shored their shackle fall hie motion was put and carried unanimously the rev mr lhlie said the resolution which wim now be submitted directs your attention to a subject somewhat different from the preceding more agkeeabfo nd one for which het aught they would be prepared by the able remarks which had been made it intheae words jd that this meeting heartily j bid godspeed to the noble end ever increasing band of christians end pa tripts in the united statesthe truest friendsin thw particular of their cimn tr who publicly plead without fear of favor the cantos of their enslavedfellowsubjects by constitutionsi and chiiatian means pursuing this object with singleness of aim and not mixing it up with ulterior and irrelevant designs the resolution recognizes the faet that in the united sutes this most unrighteous slavery exists and exists voluntarily and that it could not exist were it not voluntary that the inheritance of aavery has been deliberately retained while everything else has beeu thrown off the resolution also recognizes the fact that in these states there is a noble band of oatriota pleading now and have been long pleading without fear or favor the causes of their enslaved fellowsub jects it is a noble thiog st a meeting like this to have such a fact to recognize and at such a meeting where they were called on by every honorable principle to condemn the wrong it was right and proper to recog uize the existence of this fact because if the wrong be dragged into light that it may be bianded and condemned it is proper that the good be pleed by its side in order that it many have the honor that is due awarded toit honor to whom honor is due is a christian principle of universal application to rank honor is due because with rank there is invariably conceived to be associated virtue to virtue honor is due it is due therefore in a large measure to the men who impelled by love to god and love to their oountry come forward and stand in the biesch and devote themselves to the removal of anything be it what it may by which their country is damaged whether in ila constitution or in its reputation the men that thus act lay their country under an obligation to them they lay the whole race under an obligation to them in proportion to the difficulties with which they have to contend their claim rises and is in proportion to tio difficulties with which hey actually have to battle they could not overestimate the claim of the men who have bad boldness enough to plead in the face of the prejudices of persons high in power the rights of their enslaved fellowmen who in the very face of storms of vituperation and the threats of violence with which they have been assailed and what is even much worse to bear the misrepresentation of their motiveshave yet manfully and determinedly urged the grand principle of their idolized constitutionthat all men are born free and equalthat god has given to every man the right to use his own limbs and to promote his own happiness and that this tight is never to be taken from him unless taken from him as a punishment for his crime sin in every form and of every character is ruinous it offends god and in this way brings punishment upon the nation as well as on the individuals who persevere in it it leads to destruction as its natural consequence the men then who throw themselves between their country and the commission of sin whatever be the form of that sin or the fallacies used in its defence prove themselves to be their countrys truest and best friends no matter in what light they be looked upon by her they may be branded as the enemies of their country and become the victims of their countrys lawless violence but by the very act for which they died they prove not merely the sincerity but the intenseness of their love to their country thus it was with christ himself he came into the world to save the jewish people but a robber was preferred to him let these men then who have given themselves to the promotion of a good cause hold on even though they suffer persecution even should it proceed so far as death itself ifit be the duty of a christian to protest against sin in every form and to use every lawful and honorable means within his retch to put it down must it not more especially be his duty thus to act in relation to slavery which is a sin of a most aggravated description and may be called the very concentration of all sin that is sin which takes the man god made in his own image and makes a thing of him to be bought or sold and trifled with and trampled upon at the pleasure of a tyrant that sin which lifts up against god the high hand of rebllion yet there are those who say slavery is not asin with these men it is a sin for the slave to free himself should god give him an opportunity to do so with them it is a sin for the father or the brothw and even itn the wife the son or the daughter to whispet into the ear of the poor slave that god has given him a right to freedom with them itis a sin to aid the slave in making his escape his resolution recognized the fact that that band of devoted men who are pleading the cause of the oppressed is ever increasing itis a delightful fact and calls for gratitude to god ana no man had a greater interest in the breaking up of that droadful system than the slaveholders themselves it is a cheering thought that this band of patriots will go on increasing wherever christianity is known applause he had some years ago listened with pleasure to the sentimentthere is but one price in the vast enough to purchase a man and that price is the blood of gods own son this fact being felt and realized it becomes impossible for an individual to feel when seeking redemption through that blood that he can hold a brother in bondage and look upon him as a thing to buy and sell without violating every fundamental piinciple if they trace the churchs history down through its darkest times they would discover the genial influence of this noble principle it was this principle which banished serfdom from britainthe land that has given so many of us our birth and which we continue to love this principle led the british people with almost unanimous consent to pay twenty millions of money that they might get rid ol the injustice of slavery and restore to freedom the men whose bondage they had themselves so long countenanced his resolution also bids god speed to the noble men who are pleading for their fellowmen it bids gods speed to them in the use of all constitutional means to pursue with s steady aim and a single purpose this grand object without reference to ulterior designs the reverend gentleman here adverted at some length to the course pursued by the abolitionists and to the constitution of the states the americans he said believed their constitution was good but be believed that if it was worth sixpence there would be a provision in it which gsve them the power to change it for no constitution under heaven ever made by man can give a right to do that which is in itself morally wrong they had the power to do what was right sad in the manly use of that ley their strength they were not enemies of america who advocate the abolition of slavery they desired its liberty its stability its glory and therefore they wished to see all men now in bondage set free and he trusted ere long to  htar emancipation proclaimed throughout the land applause rev mr reaf said he bad great pleasure in seconding the resolution he thought it right to make an addition and it was to the effect that in he and dr willis were deputed by a meeting like the present the last one he believed held in toronto on the subject to represent the municipslity of toronto in an antislavery meeting in new york on that occasion he not only attended meet  ingsin now york but also ia philadelphia and his observation led him to conclude that while there is sn immense amount of antislavery feeling in the union there are very flaw who ate prepared for real antislavery measures they regarded abolitionism as subordinate to others subjects which are really of inferior importance they are hampered with fear about state rights the danger of sacrificing the intereateof churches the difficulty of removing slavery and toon instead of first resolving that slavery shall be xemoved at any cost and then sitting down to devise the means it was so ones in england at last england resolved that h should e abolished and then sought the means of oing in and did doit and thenceforth the name of slave was beard no mote on british oil the object of tbit meeting is not merely to assert the principles of liberty bat to redeem to homwitj its right tkhich cannot ho coufc ter balanced by any considerations what tefr interest or policy be at etake if they have a light to keep a nuisance at oar doors we hare a rght to denounce it if oar oast neighbor was heard abasing his wife end ends of murder given we should break open the door to help her and oar conduct would be morally excusable whether legally justifiable or net he looked upon the americans as making one of the grandest political experiments that has ever been attempted but he wonid rather see their onion blown to atoms then that slavery shall continue if they will not do away with slavery by moral mesas slavery will remedy itself by physioal means beeause the multiplication of the colored population in some parte of the south is much greater than that of the whites he trusted thet news of this meeting and the formation of an antislavery association would reach the sieve and cheer him in his efforts for selfemancipation he hoped indeed that the society will aet as a kind of suspension bridge between her and the states helping the poor negroes to escape from bondage aswell as to find employment and subsistence when in canada they heard of toasts being drank in rapturous applause when the sentiment was given that the glorious republic is the only place where man can be free bat while america shouted liberty to poised to hungary and to ireland they could join them in the shout and addliberty toman this meeting would have ite weight they would hear of it and may hereafter hear of the speeches and resolutions adopted on this side besides the people of color will heat that there is an antislavery society in toronto greet applause he hoped that efforts would be made to help those who escaped from the land of liberty to find an asylum and to prooure employment for them the resolution was pot and carried unani mously mr thomas plummer proposed the next resolution ththat a society be now formed to becalled the antislavery society of canada the object of which shall be to aid in the extinction of slavery all over the wot id by means exclusively lawful and peaceable moral and religious such as the diffusing of useful information and argument by tracts newspapers lectures and correspondence and by manifesting sympathy with the houseless and homeless vietims of slavery flying to soil he trusted that they would continue to discuss this question while there was one negro slave in the world they had paid dearly for the light to do it and aa a nation they were pledged to do so applause never did their abolition friends require encouragement more than at the present time the fugitive slave law appears to have paralyzed all men he trusted that if the society was organized they would let it be seen that they were the friends sod not the enemies of uie american people while they denounce the great evil let it be done for the good and for the honor of america americans are our brethrenthey have the blood and breathe the spirit of our forefathers let us not then doaoything which would cause them to shed that blood or say anything which woold wound that spirit jbut let them meet together on the broad principles of liberty to battle against the iniquitous slave law until the black man ia aa free as the white rev mr geikie briefly seconded the resolution which was carried unanimously it was moved by capt stuart seconded by mr t j short and carried sththat a committee now to be namud hall be appointed with suitable officers who shall conduct the business of the society have power to make bylaws and shall meei on mu eaily day for that purposethree to bea quorum rev mr roaf

for this paper will confer a favor by remitting the amounts due to us without further delay we beg to remind our friends generally of our rule that payment be made in advance geo thompson esq in rochester the visit of this distinguished orator and philanthropist to this city has imparted an impulse to the cause of liberty in this section which will long be felt and remembered hia efforts have been crowned with a success which baa far exceeded the most sanguine anticipations of his warmest friends for several week previous to hia arrival among us his coming was announeed by the daily advertiser in a manner well calculated to arouse all that was narrow mean malignant and mobocratic in tbs mind and heart of this community mr thompson was denounced as an emissary a british spy t foreign agitator an insolent intermeddler with american in dilutions an enemy to the constitution a foulmouthed libeller and as deserving the severest censures of the eitisens of roch ester the journal above named kept up an almost incessant fire of this sort during more than a foitnight making the most inflammatory appeals to the bigotry and baseness of its negro hating and slaveryloving patrons and by implication calling upon them to deny the right of speech to the distinguished stranger mush more cautious but not less mischievous than the course pursued by the advertiser was that adopted by the american for while it was free from the brutal and shameless aspersions upon mr thompson which characterised the former journal it nevertheless exerted itself with much adroitness to east contempt upon the man and the object that be came to promote to say that the whole community was agitated and excited toa degree hitherto unknown by the approach of any mao to onr city is to say what no nitisen here will be dispoeed to question serious doubts an apprehensions were entertained as to what would be the result of bis visit many thought that personal violence would be offered to mr thompson if be should essay to speak on any subject and that damage would be done to aoy hall which should be let for the pnrpoeeof reeeivinghim numerous letters were cent to the proprietor of the

enemies of the human race who would fain obstruct the march of the people to the attainment of their rights be able to point to this country for the proof that here where men are free speech is not

environed mr douglass was followed by mrs foster she failed to ace in the present aspect of affairs the cheerless end dreery prospect which had beclouded he spirit of frederick douglass and she addressed the meeting at considerable length congratulating the friends of freedom on the glorious critic which had now arrived the abolitionists had accomplished what they bad long ago desired to accomplish they had brought millard fillmore end william lloyd garrison face to face and had brought slavery and freedom to a handandhand struggle the meeting here adjourned met at p m the hall was thronged by a largo audience to hear mr thompeoo who it was understood would speak that af ternoon after e few remark from mr douglass george thompson esq ascended the platform and was greeted by a about of applause which attested the high respeet and warm cordiality felt in rochester towards the distinguished and eloquent champion of human liberty and brotherhood at the call of multitudinous voices mr t proceeded to iddrnee be meeting he took up the question repeatedly put to him since his arrival in this country aa to what he had to do with american slavery v and moat ably did he answer that question he denied that io meddling with slavery he was meddling merely with an american question if was a human question before it became an american question the system might be local but the principle was universal once grant that the americtu may hold propetty io man and we concede the principle by which the egyptian the turk the russian may do the same thing indeed america had made the subject of slavery a subject for the whole civil ixed world she had cast three millions of her people forth upon the sympathise of mankind utterly refusing to take cognisance of them herself it was said that he spoke here without invitation but he was invited by the groans and taars of speechless millions to plead their cause the secretary can do no manner of justice to this part of mr thompsons speechwhich was masterly in the extreme and at times sublimely eloquent he next glanced et the american alsvs trade and showed that in all its essential characteristics it was equal in cruelty and barbarity to that carried oo on the coast of africa every wind from the south aid he comes to us freighted with the sighs and tears of his victim slavery wao a perpetual act of tyranny against three millions the stupendous wickedness of slavery could nor be grasped nor fathomed the certain consequences of retaining slavery in america were pointed out in a fearfully powerful manner and the doom of assyria memphis babylon greece and paraepolis was held up in biasing eloquence warning the american people against the longer continuance among them of this system of iniquity there wee a deep shudder manifest through the audience as mr thompson lifted the veil and displayed the desolation sod ruin into which mighty nations and empires had fallst in consequence of their wickedness end wbeo he demanded io tones of thunder can americana defy the omnipotent god tho matchless orator again denied that the question of alavery was exclusively an ameriean question the slave was a brother it warn m atman question the slave possessed a living soul it wa a religious question it was e question of labor and of commerce here mr thompeoo treated the audieaco to a brilliant conuscation illustrating tho difference between free and slave labor and bestowed a wellmerited encomium upon the industry enterprise rapid growth and beauty of the eity of rochester sod closed this part of hia address by aaying god mass you and increase you a thousand fold speaking of slavery aa a religious question mr thompson said tell mo that god sanctions slavery and i will look op to heaven ao more tell ms that god vnetioot do very then farewell toe god of lovo thors was something absolutely thrilling io these words ae they fell from the lips of tho speaker the whole speech oo this occasion waa a raeaterpiece of eloquence end it produced an electrifying effect on the vest audience assembled s s faster now essayed to apeak the attempt was a hazardous one the audience had been ao completely enraptured by the tl oquenoe of mr thompson that there appeared little disposition to boor any one tfee the meeting now adjourned friday morning at ten oclock the coeven tioa reassembled after a song from mr g w clarks s fester addressed the meeting hin re j marks won directed to show the pulidptuon of tho obareb in kgtai of amt h  slst mr thompson address on this occasion was on tbs condition of tbs colored people of tbs united states he deeply sympathised with them in their present hopeless cheerless and melancholy forebodings theie rested on their cause at this period shadows clouds and darkness yet he was inclined to a more hopeful view of the condition than many of the most thoughtful among themselves were disposed to lake since this speech was decidedly the most powerful of any delivered by mr thompson during the convention and since we have but imperfect notes of the same and there is a probability of our having that speech from mr tbomp sone own pen we shall omit here the publication of the secretarys notea of it in the hope of laying it before our readers in its full beauty power and completeness axtzrnoon mcktino by two oclock the vast hsll wss again thronged a string of resolutions were read by frederick douglass upon which he madea short speech at the close of which the resolutions ware adopted s s foster now reoommended the antislavery newspapers to the notice of the people toe north star was held up as especially deeervieg the sympathy and support ot the friends of the slave in this region aries this forward to address the meeting he regarded the vaatnees of the audience si a gladdening spectacle and expressed his sense of the deep responsibility resting upon one who presumes to address a msss of his fellowcreatures if said the speaker for every idle word which one man may tay to another he ia to give an account in the great day of reckoning how awful is the responsibility of addressing a multitude like that before me mr thompson said much in his opening remarks on the importance of speaking the truth we are wrong angty and avaricious because not true truth now dwells but par tielly it shall dwell universally among man kind mr thompsons afttrnoon speech was a searching review of the colonisation scheme as aet forth in the recent speech of henry clay before the american colonization society on the th anniveiaary he deemed that speech important because it had given tone to the press and because it governed the opinions of the mass of the people the scheme of colonization had been recently revived and is designed to be carried out by state law missionaries from that society are being sent about in all directions the kev randolph gurley had been lately sent to libeiia on this mission another emissary had been dispatched to eog gland to mislead the minds of the people there on the subject one miltiou of dollars had been lately bequeathed to the society by a tieh planter in louisiana large steamers are being built expressly to transport the free colored people to the shores of africa and to an unhealthy and unhoapitable climate and the society implores the blessing ef heaven on its labors only think of it it ia the glory of america that veaaela are bound to her shores bringing freights of op preseed human beings from every clime under heaven america acs bread enough emd to spare for all such but her vessels are bound to the western shore of africa transporting a portion of her people there to find their graves far away from the land of their birth the colonization society does not seek nor desire to touch the subject of slavery nor to provide for the slaves that society only deaiiea to carry off the free colored man the colored man who ia being whipped and gagged and acatred at the bidding of a cruel master he may not go but theree colored man who is honestly and industriously earning his living and providing for hit family he must go to send the slave would indeed be a mercy mr thompson here read an extract from the epeech of mi clay refering to the degraded condition of the free colored man which be followed by one of the moat pathetic aimilee we ever remember to have heard and of which we can give but a faint portraiture see yon plant fading withering and dying it ia placed where no refreshing showers can descend upon it and where no gently falling dew can revive itblame not the plant it does bat follow the law of its condition but blame the gardener who suffered it to pine away neglected and uncared for anisic thou art the husbandman the colored people are the plants committed to tby care god had placed them in a garden where they could have bden nurtured and brought up healthily and carefully but thou hast transplanted them and rudely torn them away from all that ia genial and if they art degraded if they are criminal i turn to the negrohater who jeetingly points out the guilty creature and i say thou art the man the eloquent speaker then exposed most ably the various sophistries and machination of the colonization society and gave a seriet of opportane illustrations of the various methods panned by the emissaries of that society and dosed his speech by an earnest and heartfelt appeal to the american people to redress the wrong they had so long inflicted on three millions of thsir people that the soothers winds should come wifted no moic with the sighs and groans of a single slave the meeting then adjourned julia griffiths assistant secy letter from h o wtfontr chicago match d  fkiiho douclam lf i could advance any new or additional arguments to those already advanced by youtaelf and others against the colonization scheme as advocated by henry clay and otheis i would gladly avail myself of the opportunity but the whole ground has been fully canvassed and therefore there ie net room for me to add anything new or interesting upon the subject think however that it can be safely said that the sentiments of the most intelligent of our people throughout the union are opposed to leeving the country while three millions of our fellowcountrymen remain in iavary what could waar the appearance of meanacm sod eowardioe more then that of abandoning the country leeving our enslaved brethren to the mercy and despotic ooatrol ofa people and government whose only aim a rams to he the devising of new pleas of op and degradation but surely if moral influence the medium of which it is said we are to effect the abolition of slaver in ibis country is to be relied upon it does seem to me that we could better effect the object by remaining here than by going to africa from whence we would have to throw our influence acroas the atlantic fiat the truth is we know that the authors of the colonization scheme were the very men of all others who were anxious to get rid of us and they could devise no better scheme to get ua out of the country than through the medium of their pretended friendships of bettering our condition by eolooiaing us is africa fiat your ninth lecture in corinthian hall rochester february d l is full of argument upon the subject and ia much better adapted to the purpose than anything could aay in this communication but when i reflect upon the condition of our people in this country and behold the gloomy prospect before us i am forced to ask in the name of high heaven what ia to become of us butin the midst of all this dreariness and gloom may not say that doubtless a god of justice and mercy will yet awaken to our distresses but says some of our learned divines how awaken to your distresses i answer by diffusing moral light and a love of liberty among the people can any man vtflwt wae sninj ss j f mi ak means of information within his reach say that light ia not bursting in upon us from every quaitar does not all europe give ugns of the dawn of light and does not sll civilization givetestimony to the same import and is not this some encouragement for us to be patient and to wait a little longer for the good time coming coeval with moral light ia the love of liberty and when tha love of liberty dies entirely out of the hearts of the people we may still look for progress however slow in the lirection of true liberty nor should we be liscouraged by the efforts which are being put forth from certain high sources to stifle tnd to check the tide of light and liberty tmong the people and especially when we tre reminded that freedom is not a gift of nan but of god and we believe that no gift f god can taken from us by mortal man great britain had not the power to lake it from our revolutionary i lires and it is to be hoped that future generations may never have the power to annihi ate it but do not say the colonization scheme a wholly incapable of doing good but suppose it were to succeed in a long time in solonizing all africa that free one slave in america when the professed object jf its founders werenot to send the slave there but the free people of color only it is also contended as an objection to the mmediate emancipation of the slaves that hey would be incapable of selfgovernment were they all to be let loose at once without the necessary preparation but how does it happen that the moment they become free m this countiy they are afonce capable of self government in africa without any furthet preparation surely if we though a corrupt class would be good citizens and capable of selfgovernment in africa why should we not be equally yo in america but it must he acknowledged by sll sound sober thinking men that however well those men may argue on other aubjeeta yet on this subject they seem to lose sight of all consistency what man endowed with a common share of talents would have ventured to throw out to the scrutiny of the civilized world such crooked and crippedup logic as that of daniel websters on the exclusion of slavery from california and new mexico by the geography and climate of those territories suppose one of out corrupt and dissolute class had ventured to present to the enlightened people of the united stales such silly and simple arguments as those of daniel websters just referred to what would have been said by a great majority of the people why it ia just like the reasonings of a thickheaded nigger what else could we expectbut not so in this case for this is the great expounder of the constitution if webster were to say that the city of bot ton is in the state of maine there are those who would believe it and who would aay all right it must be so webster has said it but no the free people of color should be awake to all subjects of the day pertaining to our weal or woe and should endeavor to assume some position and to act in accordance with reason and principle but before i close permit me to observe that in order to become anything in this country we cannot too strongly enforce nor too often remind uur people of the necessity of cultivating our minds and of leaving the large cities and towns snd resorting to the woods there is no use of disguising facts for the truth is we will have to come to this sooner or later and we might as wall make a break now aa at some futute period every new arrival of emigrants from the old world tends to hasten the period let us look to these things snd put forth our best efforts in the matter and trust in god for success yours aa ever h o wagoner letter from george weir buffalo march th mr editor sia i wae somewhat astonished to find in yonr paper of the th inet an article copied from the new york evening poet in relation to the effects of the fugitive slave bill in buffalo stating that one hundred and thirty communicants from the coloisd baptist church had left for fear of arrest on the charge of being fugitive slaves and also that the methodist church had lost a considerable number from the same cause from whatever source this information emanated allow me to inform you that it is ioeorreet and instead of the large number spoken of not three have left from either shurch and i know that not three have left from the whole eity therefore the report it entirely incorrect and without the least shadow of foundation the boffalooiaua are mads ap of different stuff we are not so easily frightened sa to leave our homes m consequence of any such machinations of the devil and i imagine that it would require more force than any of the fillmore clique could summon in buffalo to drive us from the homes of our adoption at least in such numbers as spoken of we have long since considered the matter and have ootoe to the conclusion that we have a right to live here and also that wa have a right to use the some means to maintain our rights that our rawu nonary fathers taught us so a osrtain occasion no attempts have been made here as yet to arrest any one oar city has so joyed a quietude and repose which it is devoutly tobe hoped may continue but when it shall m broken buffalo will be beard from youia die george weir ja mam cmrntim on wednesday and thursday next ih th and th inst ao antislavery convention will be held in lockport which will be attended by george thompson rev si j may f douglass and mr and mrs foster the meeting will commence at oclock a m and will be continued throughout the afternoon and evening come onecome all other oatbarst of malaee and mortification from the american duting the last week we studiously avoided mingling st all in the agitation occasioned by the advent and antics of george thompson and hia followers the other presses of this city devoted more or less space to the events that quickened into life st the approach of mr thompson and which matured under the fertilizing influences of his rtay understanding however that mr thompson with characteristic egotism toook occasion to sneer at the american because it had not informed tin readers of nts coming and with the sue cess of hia mountebank gyrations it were a breach of courtesy not to respond though we neither wish nor hope to emulate the reckless assertion the wanton calumny and ribald abuse that marked too great a portion of the proceedings in which he bare a part the gentleman from england was not alone in his abuse of us but divers gentlemen from africa and hybrid nondescripts neither fish nor fleshalbeit foul turned several pretty sentences and pointed several elegant periods with the gratifying remark that ws were struck dumbwere mum call of which occasioned howls of applause and put the assembly of disorganize into marvellous good humor perhaps the most marked incident of the week was the attempt of mr thompson to browbeat tbs public which we will give in the language of the democrat that paper said ou thursday were it true that this peisoo george thompson indulges in vituperative assaults upon the government and constitution of this country we should agree fully and ordially with the com adv in commending him to the silent contempt of the people but we find no language used in his discourse that could be so construed and ws are ready to judge him by bis acta and not prejudge him from hearsay and misrepresentation in the commencement of his address on tuesday afternoon he called upon anyone who eould do ao to convict him of anyone of the offences against hospitality which are charged upon him promising in case they were or one moment substantiated to immediately leave the city and country tbe rochester herald free soil a few days previous iu attempting to answer an ai tide in the advertiser said that to reiterate a cettain statement attributed to mr thompson waa to progagate a lie and only caitiffs would do it or wcrda to that effectbut we are sure about tbe caitiff the sentiment is as follows there isnt a rood of earth on the globe that is not more sanctified by the spirit ol liberty than republican america and that nothing is contraband in this country bui truth and honesty the advertiser did reiterate itthe papei waa read by thompson and the caitiff acknowledged it moreover he declared tha tbe words were just and truethat he wisher them transmitted to hia children sind inscribe as an epitaph on his tomb and we are tou that some of the audience applauded him that they sent up their shouts of joy at thi uttaranee of such mendacious and abusivi sentiment and laughed in fiendish glee wher told that in tbe country of their birth onlj truth and honesty were contraband anti this by a vagrant libeller an offshoot from the unnatural growth of the heart of crowded londona brazenfaced contemner of the hospitality that sheltered him in rochester and the healthy public sentiment that protected him from a penalty that in hia own home and own roiod of free land would have been bestowed upon him unstintedly we know that the many wellmeaning citizens who were present on that afternoon actuated by motives of curiosity loathed tbe monster that dared thus to insult them mr thompson doubtless thought having boldly declared his intention to leave rochester if convicted of the offences charged that no proof would be offered that he had so offended but when the proof is offered and the sly fox ia unearthed he pleads guilty cowardlike deserts his ground and braves public opinion by justifying hia atrocious sen timent friday p m he devoted to a tirade of abuse against henry clay chiefly but a thousand thompsons and ten legions of fallen angels like unto him and all the shapes hot from tartarus in the plastic monld of s modern abolitionist can never shtke the love of gallant harry of the west that is deeply planted in the heaits of his countrymen he may rave and rant and invoke the demons of the pit to kis aid but he cannot move the firmly seated love of this eminent statesman nor change the old rallying cry and the enthusiastic ahout of heres to you harry clay the audience stood his billingsgate like good fellows but only fssble cheers from a few insane sympathizers responded to his slander with the lesser lights in this elan we have nothing te do they have learned however that the thronged houses were no tribute to them for with the dying away of thompsons oice the audience usually slipped out to breathe the pure air and when the regular army gathered about their council fire there were hardly enough present to keep each other in countenance wm suppose these fanatics had a good lima in rochester doubtless they departed with malevolence sod bitterness enough in their hearts to last tbe residue of the season we cordially rejoice in their disappointment at not being mobbed and bope they will come again and pass some more resolutions but the pestilence that waatath at noonday has passed tbe aky has cleared up and a puier air has diasi paled the miasma that waa doing is work some of us took the disease the natural wayothers by inoculation however all are satisfied and they wont be williog to introduce tbe virus into tbeir systems again these pseudo friends of the slave are his worst enemies and had he no better friends we might indeed despair of him and of the republic baseness and mendacity we ask the attention of all candid readers to the following facts when it was announced that george thompson esq bad been invited to oar city for the purpose of lecturing upon reform in great britain and brittab india the daily advertiser aaaailed him in the most opprobrious tsrms and to excite the prejudices and hostility of the public published what purported to be extracts from a speech made at springfield it asserted that mr thompson had violated the rights of hospitality and vilified and abased our country as a whole knowing that these pretended extracts originated whh l the springfield rebubticen the instigators connected with which got up the mob that haa eternally disgraced that town we took it for granted that the men who would get op mobs were probebly liars nod such proves to be substantially the fact the advertiser publishes a letter from sam bowfot k sew the springfield mobo crt which exhibit the spirit of the wit mmm by low abusebrrse sam bowies a son do eot testify to use of iho words jooied bat that somebody whoso name they not give told them so now in opposition to the assertion of this mr nobody wo have the frank and manly explanation of mr thompson himself mads from ths platform of corinthian hall on thnraday aftsroooa bnt such is the malignity and nnainea of tbs advertiser that it garhlso and falsifies this explanation mr thompson did sot admit that he never used ths language moo tedbut said that when speaking of the fugitive slavs lewhe did aay that for tbs fugitive slave there was no apet of earth that was not more sacred to liberty then america this was the seothnent which he declared to be just sad trua and who will have the hardihood to deny it but gaibling the explanation and omitting the most essential part the eallumniaior of the advortiasr endeavor to made out its cue but he cannot thus impose upon the good sense of the citizens of rochester he charged that mr thompson bad attacked the government and constitution of this country had slandered our country as a whole and had been guilty of offences against hos pitality mr thompson declared himeelf to be a friend of this country and people and an admirer of all its institutions save one slavery sad promised to leave the oountry if any ef the vile chargee against him could be aub taniated and now this contemptible ad vertiaer libeller calls upon all true democrats to spurn out mr thompson from our city ana coantry and dr wnat whyfor believing what the advertiws admit tobe true that slavery is a great social moral and political eviland for saying that for the safety of a fogitiyj slave is no spot on oarth that is not more sacred than republican america that such ia the fact recent aceiee in new york and philadelphia bears sad witness those who have heard mr thompson in this can testify that nought has been said by hiaa against our country its constitution or its goverenment on the contrary he has uniformly expressed love and admiration for all with the exception of slavery and ita accompaniments color phobia and the fugitive slave lawthat after columns of vituperation and abuse of a stranger visiting our eity the advertiser should resort to a garbled misrepresentation of mr thompsons remarks ia a depth of meanness to which no man but thomas h hyatt could descend roch herald anticolonization we have been respectfully requested to publish the following proceedings and do so because we are willing to give every one a hearing whatever may be our own opinions some of these resolutions certainly contain bold and extraordinary avowals which must depend entirely on their own merits for approval jin isonjpartil pursuant to public notiee a very large and respectable meeting of the colored citizens of ihis city was holden on the evening of the st of march in the union baptist church for the purpose

in the negative whereas some fifteen or sixteen individuals met in a society capacity at p walkers barber ahop and adopted a preamble and reeolutiona in favor of african colo nizationsaid preamble and resolutions published in the daily enquirer of march ith which was headed negro emigration and whereas the sentiments therein contained do not reflect the opinion of onefiftieth part of the colored people of cmoinnati there fore resolved that we the colored citizens of this city in public meeting assembled enter out protest against the whole scheme of african colonization resolved that said preamble which declared that with all the exertions on our part and the assistance of those friendly to our elevstion we mutt despair of ever seeing the prejudice manifested against our people done away in the united states for centuries yet to come is a mere fallacy and totally uncalled for at this juncture resolved that the first and second resolutions which affirm that the colored native born american can never expect to enjoy apolitical equality with the angloamerican race is another gross error contradicted by the history of the times and the progressive spirit of the age resolved that we are more than ever convinced of the heartless nature of the american colonization society inasmuch as it only purposes in the language of its great founder henry clay not to interfere with the peculiar institution but to remove the free people of color in these united states to africa resolved that the slaveholders of the south and their northern allies need give themselves no uneasiness about the fine negroes of ctucinusti going to liberia but reserve the equilibrium of their temper for the preservation of their health for io reality they have no such an idea resolved that this is our home this the spot where our fathers mothers sisters and brothers have died hera are oar kinsmen in chains and while ooe rattles upon their limbs er clanks upon their neck we will never

interesting account of jenny linds first concert at havana we find in the correspondence of then y tribune i the immense tacon theatre quite the finest ever saw was literally crowded to overflowing every seat and standing place being occupied and the audience numbering probably full five thousand persons including the captain general and his family and the nobility of the city perhaps some three hundred of these auditors had heard jenny before and therefore knew what was coming the rest were brot there out of curiosity or led by sheer malice to attend and put her down first came the overture to massanielo admirably played by the orchestra of the opera and several professors from new york who travelled with jenny lind led by burke bendict conductor the overture was tolerably received then followed an aria by signor belletti which was coldly received the next announcement in the bill was a cavatina from the opera of somnambula by jenny lind this lady soon appeared lad on by signor belleti some two or three hundred persons clapped their hands at her appearance but this token of approbation was instantly and peremptorily silenced by at least four thousand five hundred cold calculating decided and palpable hisses thus having settled the matter that there should be no forestallingof public opinion that if applause was given to jenny lind in that house it should be most incontest ibly and incontrovertibly earned i have heard the swedish nightingale often in europe as well as america and have ever noticed a distinct titmu lousness attending her first appearance in any city indeed this feeling yras plainly manifested in her countenance as she neared the footlights but when she witnessed the kind of reception that had been ia store for her so different from anything she had reason to expect for i am told she never reads the papers nor permits persons to tell her what the public think of her musical talents and so different from any she had ever received before her countenance changed in an instant to a haughty selfpossession her eye involuntarily flashed a ray of defiance and her form becoming instantaneously erect and apparently immovable as a statue she stood there perfectly calm and beautiful evidently satisfied beyond measure that she now had an ordeal to pass and a victory to gain worthy of her powers and as evidently feeling ns perfectly conecious of the heightb depth length and breadth of these powers in a moment her eye scanned the immense audience the music began and then followedhow can i dare attempt to describe ft i will not such heavenly strains an i verily believe mortal never breathed except jenny lind and mortal never heard except from her lips some of the oldest castilians kept a frown upon their brows and a curling sneer upon their lipstheir ladies however and most of the audience began tolook surprised the gushing melody flowed on increasing in beauty and glory nearly all kept their teeth clenched apd their lips closed evidently determined to resist to the last the torrent flowed on faster and faster the lark flew higher and higher the melody grew richer and richerstill every up was compressed by and by a the rich notes came dashing in rivers upon our enraptured ears one poor critic involuntarily loudly whispered a bravo this bursting of the soul was instantly and simultaneously hissed downthe stream of harmony rolled on till at the close it outdo a clean sweep of every obstacle and carried alt before it not a vestige of opposition remained bat such a tremendous shout of applause as went up was never before beard the tiiumpb was most completeand how was jenny lind affected she who h few minutes previous stood like g pillar of adamant before cold criticism and malice prepense now trembled like a reed in the wind before the storm of enthusiasm which her own simple notea bad produced tremblingly lowly and bowing her face almost to the ground she withdrewthe roar of applause and victory increased end core encore encore came from every lip she again appeared an curtesying low again withdrew but again again and again did they call her forth and at every appearance the thunders of applause rang louder and louder thus five times was jenny lind called out to receive their unanimous and deafening plaudits some three years since the liberty duett in j puritani was sung and encored so many times on one night that the doors of the theatre were locked and platoons of soldiers marched in and put down the enthusiasm of the audience at the point of the bayonet soon after that event a law was passed prohibiting a song from being repeated on an encore without a special permit from the president who holds his appointment from queen isabella and whose business it is ever to be present at public representations and with the printed bill before him see that it is carried out and performed to the letter since that law was enacted the president has never deviated a single time and therefore never even once has there been a song repeated on an encore a solo on the violin by burke although truly excellent was barely tolerated then followed the duett from rossinis opera ii turco in italia by jenny lind and sig belletti here bdletti began to creep into favor and some of his finest passages elicited many loud bravos and louder plaudits from the hands of the audience while jenny gained more ard more upon her auditors who appeared enchanted by her powers they were both called four times before the curtain and thus terminated the first part of the programme twenty minutes elapsed during which the ladies chattered likel had almost said moneyswhile the men withdrew into the open court to smoke a cigar and give loose to their astonishment in the strongest terms which the spanish language can command to express admiration and surprise the overture to the black domino opened the second part after which jenny lind came forward to sing casta diva this cavatina was the first which passed the lips of jenny lind at her debut in castle garden new york and now it was to be submitted to a much more musical and critical audience there sat tedesco in the palco adjoining that of signor marti still further on was a box in which were bosio steffanoni salvi badiali colleti and bettui botesini and several other artists sat sat in an opposite box and all seemed to think that jenny lind was venturing on dangerous ground jenny again assumed the peculiar attitude of modest defiance which characterized her first appearance and the music commenced before two minutes had passed by jenny lind who was never in better voice and who certainly never sang casta diva better had charmed her auditors once again and as she proceeded the bravos came so thiek and fast that sometimes beautiful passages were almost lost and when she arrived at the close it seemed literally as if the house would be torn down by the delighted multitude boqueta covered the stage and the applause was truly deafening jenny attempted to leave the stage but the audience would not permit this for every step which she retreated backward drew forth a thousand encores there stood jenny lind for two full minutes fixed as a statue and stooping almost to the stage amidst the most overwhelming thunders of applause that can well be imagined but why oh habaneros will you still cry encore when you know an encore is not allowed no matter the captain general and his family appear as much enchanted as the rest and the stately president in a rapture of delight whispers something in the ear of a page who instantly leaves bis box in a few minutee word is passed to jenny lind that the president will with pleasure permit her to repeat casta diva the orchestra again commences the air and the audience discover what they have achieved then did jenny lind for the first time in her life repeat the cavatina of casta diva on an encore and who ere the roost enthusiastic in their plaudits and their demands for this repetition every prominent artist in the italian opera troupe tedesco clapped her hands till she was red in the face bosio was no less enthusiastic and all the others joined most heartily or at all events roost loudly in the ap plause i need not go further the flute song and the cho song followed and were repeated by permission of the president and when the curtain fell after calling out the fair cantatrice six times the most delighted audience that i ever saw reluctantly withdrew the proceeds of this concert are estimated at some from tiw national era letter from

this nuturing a young century plant is not such egregious folly after all true you may never see its blossoming but eye a which caught their brightness from i yours may grow brighter as they gaze on it in the days to come i i left my letter rather abruptly yesterday and went up to the capitol i was so fortunate as to be present in the house at the passage of the resolution for the aid of kossuth it watt really beautiful and cheering to witness the ready and almost unanimous action of our representatives upon this question on the last day of the session when overwhelmed with business of the most pressing importance they yet turned aside in the spirit of a chivalrous fraternity to give countenance and assistance to hungarys unfortunate patriot and his brave associates all honor to them for their generous impulsestheir magnanimity for their sympathy with the fallen for their recognition of the universal brotherhood of freemen i never felt so proud of my country as at the moment when that resolution passed i turned an exulting look upon the face of an english friend who stood at my side and he by his sympathy added not a little to the patriotic glorying which swelled my heart but pride must have a fall is an old saying and it soon proved itself in a most melancholy and mortifying manner in the early part of the evening session in the house there was as you will have seen a personal rencounter between mr stanly and mr clingman the wrong and disgrace of which would seem to rest upon the shoulders of the latter gentleman he began an altercation with mr stanly calling him opprobrious names and followed them with a blow though of a passionate nature and of a keen sarcastic temper mr stanly is said to have been wonderfully calm and forbearing in his language toward bis bitter and violent antagonist of course there will be a meeting perhaps as mr clingman threatened not se bloodless an one as the late affair between messrs stanly and inge well i must aj f tliat hope if mr ike other must fall it will not be he who has suffered the insult and the wrong mr stanly is one of the most fearless independent and liberal of the southern members beside being an able and spirited speaker and a finished gentleman the country could sooner spare the entire squad of reckless and belligerent legislators who seek to make of the floor of congress an arena for the bully who wanting equally the controlling force of high intellect and the weight of moral principle would settle the affairs of the nation by the pistol the bowieknife or a chivalrous resort to fisticuffs i deeply regretted that mr stanly should accept a challengel shall the more deeply regret his sending one he should never irore give the weight of his example tothe horrible barbarity the infernal ity of duelling he cannot himself in his own deepest heart approve of the practice and believe that he is mistaken if he thinks that public opinion even in the south requires him to prove his animal courage by murdering or being murdered that a great and happy change of sentiment in regard to this question is taking place in the southern states has been well proved by major bor land one of the present senators from arkansas previous to his election to the senate and in the midst of a violent political excitement he was grossly insulted and called out by a quarrel ione opponent having been in early life engaged in duel when be aeverely wounded hie antagonist he had become convinced of the evil sin and folly of the practice and now had the moral courage to refuse a challenge though forced upon him in a moat insulting and irritating manner he laid the matter before the peepis of his state in a noble and manly letter and to the honor of that people be it said that the refusal of the soldier to prove his courage by fighting a duel insured instead of defeating the election of the senator a conauraation devoutly to be thankful fornot only as the triumph of a moral principle but also because it has given to the senate a man of fine ability and generous spirit true to the interests of his section of the country and i doubt not to his own convictions he is not illiberal is never arrogant iu tone unfair or discourteous in debate the senate and house have benin session all night in my may attempt a sketch of legislation by gaslight or by the ghastly light of the early morning do pardon the haste in which i have written i am keeping the press open i have not locked back over a line but have been obliged to dash off a page at a time and let the devil uk itthua kindly aaticipating the fervent wish of some of my readers youts grace grbnwood barbarous outrage  i a few weeks since an individual in ghent carroll county ky purchased three negroesa mother and her two childrenone of the latter a girl some eight or nine years of age being an f idiot in consideration of his taking i the idiot child off the hands of the for i mer owner he got the mother and the other child at a very low pricer the child was given up into the hands of an old negro woman in a cabin some distance from the owners residence to be taken care of hav ing occasion however for the service of the woman about his premises the idiot was left in the cabin binding ita great burdeu he offered to give any f one who would take it a hundred dollars i this offer was promptly accepted by a man who was standing by who inturn offered fifty dollars to any one who i would take it from him the offer i was acceded to by a third person who i immediately offered twentyfive dollars to any one to take it on the conditions l on which he had done a customer l was not long wantingthe bargain was struck and the twentyfive dollars paid l the fellow into whose hands the i idiot last fell in company with another i proceeded to the cabin some two miles distant on a cold frosty morning took ithe child out almost naked and barefooted and drove it before them almost i the whole distance her feet having i been cut by the hard frosty ground the monsters took the child to a flat or store boat lying up there and for ai while amused themselves by placing her on a hot stove with her bare feet i burning them most horribly and applying them to different parts of her body the owner of the boat coming in ordered the fellows to leave his premises which they did one of the rascals then procured a skiff put the child into it and proceeded down the river he shortly after returned without the child and upon being asked what he had done with it refused to give any satisfaction a flatboat coming along in the course of a few hours he jumped into it and has not since been heard of the child was doubtless drowned or left upon the bank of the river to die the affair has created considerable feeling among the community in which it took place and the individual who purchased the family is greatly distressed he doubtless offered and paid the loo in good faith believing it would be amply sufficient compensation for the trouble of taking care of the idioc he has offered a reward for the recovery of the child it is to be hoped that the villains concerned in torturing and making away with the idiot will be arrested and severely punished p s since writing the above we find a paragraph in the madison banner in which it is said that a fellow named ross alias crawford has been
