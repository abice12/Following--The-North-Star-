from the pittsburgh saturday visitor sale of a white girl mrs j g swtsshelm the peruj gal of the journal which you so ably edit has been a source of much enjoyment to me since i became a resident of this city i seek it with avidityl and read it with a gratification have not the ability to describe the iirst half hour which i spent reading some of your spirited articles anent real liberty shed a feeling of you in my heart that i can compare to the delight the miserable victim of tyranny feels when the sun pours its glorious rays through the narrow window of his dungeon i had been living down south where the probability of my adorning an awning post was more than once hinted to me on my making inquiries for an amislavery newspaper which a friend as verdant as myself sent me through the post office during the earlier part of my sojourn in this country i lived in a slave state there every saturday my ears were assailed with the indian voice of the wicked and inhuman auctioneer as he shouted the remunerative qualities of the wretched being on sale while the villanous speculators in the souls for which the son of god gave up his life on the cross handled and felt the poor j victims bodies and queried warrant them sound exactly as one would do if buying a horse my god how blushed for my kind pray observe that i was in a place where according to the whigs slavery existed in its mildest form in fact i was in one of the strongest whig cities in the union and yet i was eyewitness to a scene enough to freeze your very soul with horror the atrocity of which no one can conceive who has not been a witness of the like one day i noticed the slave market rather more crowded than usual it was directly opposite the store in which i was engaged curiosity led me to swell the number of the audience ando god i shall never forget the scene which presented itself to my view a beautiful girl about yearsof age as white as the fairest belle in pittsburgh stood drowned in tears and wofuliy dejected beside the devil incarnate whose business it was to dispose of her body and soul to the highest bidder he spoke long loud and lasciviously of her charms but could not entirely quench the latent spark of human feeling some few cried shame he could not excite the bestial passions of the lustful to entrench upon their pockets to the extent he wished not even the brutal traders in female purity from new orleaiih were satisfied with his exordiums of her excellence they should know more an aged gentleman bid soo and there it stopped the old mans eye glistened and he drew up his attenuated form to its full height he thought the prize was his and that before tomorrows sun had sunk m the west the fair flower that now bloomed before him would be blighted and blasted forever but not so the skilful auctioneer of gods image saw that he had raised as much jas he could with the poor girls present appearance as she had clothed herself as nearly as they would allow her he crying gentlemen you know not whata prize you let slip pulled off a turban which she wore and a magnificent head of loog hair fell down about her shoulders as dark as night and wavy as the sea when fanned by a gentle breeze the southern rascal bid oo the old one oo and again all was fair for the hope of the septuagenarian j the north star iwhen with dastard band the ruffian salesman tore asunder the dress which covered her bosom and exposed to the libertine gaze around him a bust in beauty and purity never surpassed by painter or sculptor i turned away and went home sick at heart forgive me o god if i almost doubted your justice i was informed some few hours after that the poor girl swooned and while in a state of insensibility wsa examined bid for and at last bought by one of th southern traders may god have pity on heron inquiry found that she had been raised and educated by an old lady whose property she was and who died i suddenly intestate for the purpose of division among her heirs her realestate and slaves were all sold by auction undei an order from some court of law i had lived for many years lin a country where law and not justice ruled had seen much of the m quity of the system but never was so thoroughly disgusted as in this instance i remained but a few weeks in tennessee and without the slightest feeling of regret although i left many dear relations behind came here a comparative stranger to all around me but have now made many dear friends all of whom have as great a repugnance to the horrible traffic as myself having witnessed all have just related can you wonder if the perusal of a paper such as yours should give me infinite pleasurl the only one in this country at the time of my arrival which advocated the rights of manas a journal professing antislavery opinions should can it surprise you that i should use expressions of admiration to yourself when i say that to your exertions attribute a vast deal of the antislavery spirit which i find infused in the minds of the young men with whom business or choice leads me to associate reason common sense will tell you that flattery is neither my forte at any time nor my object now i have never seen you yet i know respect and admire you and ever shall for the sake of the glorious principles you so nobly up hold your exposition of the case of the edmonson girls in last saturdays visiter induced me to send you the preceding sketch trusting if you consider it worth publication it may have some influence on the minds and purses of the ladies of pittsburgh in their favor to the fate of that poor girl the pious edmonsons may not comenay will not for i am sure that among the pureminded ladies of this city alone the sum necessary would be raised sooner than the horrible sacrifice should be consummated v but there are hundreds of beautiful and gifted creatures in the south who undergo day after day the same brutally degrading exhibitionand for whom no cry is raised mothers i conjure you by the guardian care of the honor of your children wives i abjure you by the holy love you bear your husbandsdaughters i entreat you by your hallowed feelings have no fellowship with a slaveholder or anything in the shape of man who countenances the vile doctrine that slavery is right where its exists bylaw his touch is contamination and his honor a mockery in fact he is a living lie and as such should be scouted from all honorable society and from any participation in the affections or interest of a true womanfully confident that you will as ever i do your duty in the good fight and wishing you all the health and happiness you deserve remain madam faithfully yours t r m pittsburgh nov testimony against slavery the new york observer of november contains a memorial from the synod oi cincinnati to the triennial assembly it is said to have been adopted by a unanimous vote the conclusion of this memorial is as fol lows natural and inalienable rights are derived from god and are defined and protected by his authority and no human authority individual or national is at liberty to abrogate or abridge them or to extenuate or justify their violation and to attempt to do so is rebellion against the divine govern ment in one half thestates of this uuion there are laws which deny to a part of the population the control of their persons and just compensation of their labor which in some cases prohibit intellectual cultivation making it penal to instruct slaves to read thus virtually depriving them of the personal use of the word of god which totally disregard the marriage relation and subvert the family institution violating its integrity rendering it impossible to preserve its purity and frustrating its grand design by refusing parents due opportunity to exercise tbeir rights or discharge their duties which make all the facilities for obtaining a knowledge of religion as well as the entire outward practice subject to the will f the master which supersede the moral government of god by tbe substitution of physical force for the guidance of conduct and formation of character and whioh attempt to establish human legislation with reference to personal rights in opposition to that which ia divine the system of servitude upheld and perpetuated by these laws is both in its principles end practice essentially different from that recognized and sanctioned in the old ar new testaments the old testament securing certain personal political aod religious rights which the american system totally denies and the new testament requir right is of no sextruth is of no ooloilgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren ins masters to forbear threatening and to give their servants as the dreatures of god and not of lav or corrupt custom what is just and equal a requisition which if followed would at once annihilate the assumed right of property in od elevate the slaves to the dignity and right of men we are glad to know that the kind feeling and moral principle of the community prevent the full exercise st the despotic and cruel power conferred by these laws and lead to many efforts to ameliorate to a limited extent the degraded and wretched condition of those held in this bondage yet we are constrained to believe that a considerable number of the officers and members of our churches exact and receive the services of tbeir fellow men under these laws and claim and exercise the power thv in an doing tfo jf nye involved in the guih of this system and assist to perpetuate it by the sanction of their example and influence if they donot defend it as scriptural and right in view of this whole subject there fore resolved that this paper be forwarded as an expression of the views of this synod to the general assembly at its next meeting in may next and that we memorialize that body in behalf of our whole church to bear its solemn and decided testimony against these practices as inconsistent with a christian profession and requiring the exercise of church discipline and against the countenance encouragement or defence of the system by which they are produced and upheld republican despotism the following is the reply of a letter just received at the office of the republic from one of the border slaveholding states for obvious reasons we suppress the name and residence of the writer november respected sir hope you will pardon me for addressing you this note yet imperious duty compels me the young man who subscribed to your paper for me doubtless forgot that he was doing what is expressly forbidden by the laws of maryland respect for those laws induces me to respectfully request you to discontinue sending your paper to me were lin a state where the bright star of freedom sheds its inspiring rays on the white as well as those of our color then would read your paper with delight again allow me to reiteratel hope you will pardon me for addressing you this note i would have paid the postage for this note but our postmaster is so very in quisitive respectfully your obedient servant what a comment is this upon our stereotyped boasts of liberty of speech and of the press as existing in the united states here is a man who desires to read a particular newspaper but the law of a sovereign state interposes and says you must not read that paper it you do we shall fine or imprison you it is hostile to the institution of slavery and does not hesitate to express its opinion with frankness and boldness we cannot permit it to come within the limits of our authority is there in russia a worse despotism than this we know it is alleged as an excuse for such laws that they are intended to prevent insurrections but this is all a fudge as every well informed person knows how inexpressibly mean and vile must be that institution which can only live by sacrificing the freedom of the press against it who that has a soul will not wage eternal hostility philadelphia republic from ike columbia pa spy public meeting of colored citizens at a public meeting of the colored citizens of this borough convened in the schoolhouse on monday evening nov th for the purpose of taking into consideration the subject matter contained in a circular received from the colored citizens of alleghany county pa respecting the right of franchise the meeting was called to order by the appointment of william h wilson president and john williams wm whipper and h h webb secretaries after which the following preamble and resolutions in connection with others were adopted whereas we delight in honor that righteous maxim in american jurisprudence which declares that mil just governments derive their power from the consent of the governed and whereas this sublime and fundamental principle of legislationso dear to every american heartso admirably just and benevolent in its features so beautifully illustrates the republican principles of the early founders of the ancient and honored commonwealth of pennsylvania that it was to us a source of deep regret that her progressive history should be marked by either the denial or obliteration of rights and privileges in our persons that have from the foundation of the government been regarded as the birthright claim of the nativeborn citizen therefore be it resolved that we will respectfully petititioo the legislature of this state at the ensuing session and ask our fel lowcitizens to petition for the repeal of this antirepublican feature from the constitution of pennsylvania resolved thst we sre unwilling to believe that the

imposing on us an arbitrary obstruction to the privileges and enjoy meats of civil rights which no merit in us however great glorious transcendant and exalted can reach and from which there is no successful appeal but to their own sober and rational conviction of right and justice as expressed in their own declaration of principles resolved that as americans and pennsylvanians we feel as deep an interest in prosperity and progressive improvement of our common country as any other class of citizens who can claim nativfty by the accident of birth born under the influence of the same institutions our feelings love of liberty interests sympathies hopes and aspiration by nature and i durthiaw are destined to mingle with theirs resolved that in the established doctrine of slavery and

prest wm whipper h h webs secys settlements foe colored men some very praiseworthy attempts have been made in various parts of the state of new york it b well known to establish settlements for colored men and we believe with some success we learn now that a new effort is to be made in the town tof florence oneida county colored men having had several meetings upon tbe subject in which they have been making efforts to induce the colored citizens of boston albany new york and philadelphia to follow farming or mechanical pursuits in the new settlement rather than be barbers servants c as they are in the cities in florence it is said there are water privileges for sawmills and indeed everything necessary for a flourishing settlement one great cause if not the great cause of the degradation of the colored men at the north is no doubt the way they crowd together in cities and any project therefore which can take them out of the cities and turn them into tillers of the soil is calculated to their condition here in tbe cifflß ambition can hold out to them no adequate temptation for the accumulation of property or for instructing the miad but in a settlement of their own where all are on terms of equality there will be the same inducements to wok study and that the white men have in their various spheres of society all such projects as these to better the condition of the colored race have our warm and hearty support boston bee from the philadelphia republic suffrage in the times of saturday there is a pithy and well written article by one of our disfranchised colored men upon the subject of universal suffrage the argument is well put and put exactly in the right place too the young democracy of the city are framing their creed and if they have the courage of reformers and the candor of honesty they will put planks enough into their platform for all men to stand upon the old democratic party is especially responsible for the apostacy of pennsylvania from the faith ot the fathers and they never will be able to say that their souls are their own till they repair that great wrong taxation without representation was the exact fact by which britains king lost states thirteen and the principle that all governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed was the very fulcrunof the revolutionary lever which overthrew the tyranny of the past ages can the democracy of pennsylvania any longer sin against its own soul will it hesitate any longer to vindicate its own truth the race that is set before it cannot be run unless it throws away every weight and the tin that so easily besets it we demand justice for the oppressedwe demand it from the men who inflicted the wrongwe demand it from the men who profess to be tbe red reisers

places where slaveholderscannot come heaven and peterboro herkimer freeman from the emancipator j g palfreys liberation of slave property we publish the following account of mr palfrey act of philanthropy in liberating slaves which he inherited it is taken from the lowell courier of november th and was written by william schouler esq editor of the boston atlas who at that time was editor of the courier it is a truthful account of the whole affair and contains in addition some remarks which show an appreciating estimate of mr palfreys character we commend it to the people of district no as being quite as likely to be correct as anything they will be likely to get from the same source during the present can vass in advocating mr palfreys election we may frequently have occasion to make use of the editorials of the lowei courier of the fall of we shall be saved the trouble of writing articles of a similar character and shall compliment our neighbor over the way by giving the productions of his better days to the public ho job g palfexy we trust that our whig friends io the fourth district will not suftertheir organization to get out of order before they have had one more trial to elect a member of congress the defeat of the hon john g palfrey at the hud trial was deeply regretted by the whigs throughout the state we knew the man and we knew his popularity in the district and we believed be would he elected on the first trial but we were mistaken the liberty party vote was larger than we anticipated it would have been mr palfrey made however a glorious run he went ahead of his ticket no whig ever came so near an election in the district on the first trial last year the majority against gov briggs in the district was fifteen hundred now mr palfrey comes within about four hundred votes of an election this should encourage our whig friends to make a strenuous effort at the next trial they have but to pot forth their whole strength and n glorious triumph will be dm result one word in referenoe to the greet thllsmurfsenr which appeared in the the week bstf phiitntkpipy which graces the life of john g palfrey and which will be spoken of and applauded long after tbe present contest is ended aod forgottenwe mean of course the liberation of the slaves which fell to him by inheritance and the manner in which the act of liberation was accomplishedthe freeman told the people that there was no pecuniary sacrifice made by mr palfrey because he was a man of great fortune being possessed of some two or three j hundred thousand dollars never was there a grosser error promulgated about a candidate mr palfrey is far from being a rich man he is dependent upon his salary of secretary of state for his present means of living and we koow that he entertained doubts whether he could afford to sacrifice the income which his present office gives him i for the more uncertain pay of a member of congress but mr palfrey acceded to the wishes of the whigs of his district and accepted of the nomi nation we regret that circumstances render it necessary for us to touch upon matters of this description in speaking ot the claims of candidates for the suffrages of the people it is contrary to our practice but we think it due to mr palfrey due to the whig party and due to truth and justice that the statement in the freeman should be corrected we have said but little of the act ol philanthropy during the late canvass which the freeman sneers at and tries to belittle it was a noble act nevei theless and evinces a warm heart and liberal mind the slaves who owe their liberty to him were worth in new orleans ten thousand dollars they were w at he inherited and we believe all that he inherited from the estate of his father he immediately proclaimed them freemennay more he made a journey to louisiana and brought the liberated slaves with him to free massachusetts at his own expense and found places for them where they could earn decent livelihoods and live freemen this was all done without parade and without a desire that the act should beknown and we venture to say so little had the matter been bruited abroad that at the time of his nomination noi onefourth part of the voters of his district ever heard of the act mr palfrey takes no himself for the part he took he says he only did his duty and no more when some gentlemen called on mr palfrey two years ago and asked that his name might be used at the convention aa a candidate for the nomination they referred to the tact of liberating the louisiana slaves and told him that it would be a popular theme and would greatly facilitate his eleelioh he refused to allow his name to be brought forward and said that he could not bear that that act should bespoken of as a claim upon the people for their votes any one acquainted with mr palfrey will readily appreciate the motives which influenced him and bow a gentleman of his highly cultivated acutely sensitive and finely balanced mind would shrink from the idea of having one of hi benevolent acts even though that act be one taking everything connected with it that has as we believe no parallel in new england paraded before the public as something which is to be remunerated by a seat in congress we mention these facts because of the unfounded and we may add almost unparalleled slanders which have been circulated through the freeman editorially and by the address of the democratic district committee in reference to mr paltrey but it is not from these facts that we ask the intelligent voters of the fourth district to vote for mr palfrey they are only meant to influence the public mind so far as they show the character of tbe whig candidate we ask the people to vnte for mr palfrey because he is an able and truehearted whig a man deeply learned of spotless reputation of high and commanding talents a vigorous writer and an eloquent speaker he is an advocate of human progress in its broadest and most comprehensive sense not tied down to the dead letter of the j past his mind is filled with hopeful aspirations of the attainment of a higher civilization a truer libertyone capable of being enjoyed by tbe whole family of man whatever may be the color of tbeir skin or the accent of their speeb whigs of the fourth district such faintly delineated is ike candidate whom you have nominated let it not be said that he twice failed of an election to a scat in congress when by a little exertion on your part be could have succeeded the bad lump the following incident we relate m the authority of the old tailor who delivered a temperance lecture on board a steamboat running between n york and new haven having found a man who was divested of all decent clathiug and in a wretched state of health in consequence of drinking he induced him amidst the discouragements of the tavern keeper at whose bouse be had fonnd him to sign the temperance pledge for one year the landlord prophtcted that be would not keep the pledge n year or that if be did he would never renew it an the year wns coming to a clone the old sailor called upon the man and secured his signature again he signed it for of a ip lease wu ik iay arrived ap sgisussnsil tanra ketpar than ba etw f er will in ka will kaa mow so twuo hmg  w john dick rvstnus whole n abstinence when he arrived at the tavern he complained of a bad feeling at his stomach and of various evils among which was a bad lump on one ide which had been growing for a number of months ah said the landlord did not tell you it would kill you to break off drinking so suddenly wonder you bare lived as long as you have come wbat will you take and suiting the action to the word he placed a decanter befor biro but said the visitor i have signed the pledge again for years with the privilege of a life lease after it what a fool said the landlord if you go on as you have done you will not live another year do you really think so landlord certainly come what will you take oh no landlord have sigoed the pledge again and then this terrible lump on my side ido not believe that drinking will make it auy better it is all because you left off drinking said the landlord youll have a bigger lump than that oo the other side before long if you continue another year as the last do you think i will well then so be it i will not violate my pledge for look here landlord pulling out agreat purse with a hundred dollars in silver shining through the interstices that is my lump which has been growing for so many months and as you say it mis all in consequence of signing the pledge that is what you would have had if i had not signed it and if i have a bigger one than that for years i will not go to drinking again jy y evan human hydrophobia one could almost suppose that hydrophobia in a certain modified form was an endemic in human society aswell as amongst dgs the lower portion of the community in particular seem to consider themselves as having a prescriptive right to suffer from it the diagnosis of the malady in the human patient does not point to a catastrophe altogether so abrupt and tragical as in the canine but it is attended by circumstances quite as sinister dirty faces dirty clothes dirty houses dirt all over are the symptoms which most forcibly arrest attention and yet bad as these are know that there are worse effects underneath the surface for where physical dirt goesthere also resides moral degradation we know of no country in europe where there is so little disposition on the part of the people as in ours to give themselves even that exbiluatiag hipd of ablution which is derived from bathing at the present season the traveller on the continent finds the rivers alive with swimmers and we remember when sailing down the loire to nantez observing the steamer frequently surrounded more especially when nearing the great manufacturing cuy with crowds of black heads and white shoulders in russia where the people have not got beyond the middlo ages the lower classes do not yet know the use of a shirt but wear it above their trowsers in the form of a kilt they have not however abandoned the bath towards the end of the week they feel a prickly and umcom fortable sensation in their skin and at length rush eagerly into the hot steam and boiling out the impurities of the preceding six days begin life again with new vigor in summer they do not wait for days and times but merely get up an hour earlier and dash into the nearest pond or river in ou refined country dirt causes no uneasiness it is allowed to harden upon the skin choke up the pores and contaminate the whole being moral and physical it blunts the senses to such s degree that the husband does not detect it in the wife nor the mother in the child all are alike all have forfeited the dignity of human nature and sunk iuto a lower scale of aoimal existence while mentioning the custom that prevails in russia we are struck with the proof afforded there of the connection between moral and physical cleanliness the state of the hathhouse of the hamlet is an unfailing idea to the character and position of the inhabitants it is neat and trim the people are good and happy and their feudal lord kind and considerate if poor and ruinous there is tyranny on the one hand misery on the ocher and depravity on both in respect to its contagiousness or inclination to spread the human malady seems not s bit behind the canine tbo certainly the immediate symptom ere less virulent it has been implied the main of dirt extends from the akin i of the individual over hie file and eon vernation but it does more than that it contamioatea hie family it daube hie neighbors it forms nucleus round which impurity gathers end

appointed aa meeting held in faneuil hall in the mom of may last to take measure for the defence of daniel drayton now confined in prison in the district of columbia on the charge ol stealing rlaves beg leave to make the following statement there was and we suppose still is in the distrist of columbia if not already sold oil to the south a numerous family of colored persons by the name of bell moses bell the father of this family obtained his freedom by a decision of the supreme court ol the united stales on the ground that he hat been brought into the district contrary t law bells wife and children claimed thei freedom also under the will of her forme owner a suit vim brought to enforce thi claim which faileo as we are informed oi account of some informality or other defect ii the will expecting that his wife and children would be speedily sold off to the south bell went to philadelphia to solicit funds foi their redemption a large sum would be required for that purpose these person eemed equitably entitled to freedom and th idea was started of sending a vessel to washington to bring them away without anj privity on the part of bell the case of hi family was mentioned to captain drayton and believing the bells to be free in equity i not in law drayton volunteered on the payment of the necessary expenses to procure j vessel and to go with it to washington t bring the bells away information of what was intended wai communicated to a person at washington if order to give notice to the parties interested and being aware of the edmonson girls those girls lately brought to the public notice and redeemed from slavery and threatenec prostitution by the liberality of some person in new york he thought it would be i good opportunity for them to escape also hf communicated the opportunity to them and tc several others they communicated it to theii friends and when captain drayton came tc sail instead of having sevm passengers as he had expected he had ten times that number drayton was pursued overtaken anc brought back to washington he had beer guilty if of any offence of the simple offence of transporting the slaves out of the district but not content with finding seventyfour indictments against him on that ground thf grand jury of the district under advice of thf district attorney found fortyone additions indictments for stealing slaves from as manj different owners the trials of two of these indictments consumed upwards of a fortnight and anothei fortnight was taken up with the trial of othei cases connected with the matter contrary to an express decision lately made in alabama and other cases leaning the same way in other courts of the slaveholding states and without the shadow of any authority tc support him the presiding judge of the criminal court thomas h crawford late oi pennsylvania instructed the jurythat tc constitute stealing there need not be any design to convert the article taken to the takers use that any incidental gain to anybody was enough that to help slaves tc escape from their masters was stealing if the person so helping enticed or induced the slaves to go and that in the present case the freedom to be obtained by the slaves was a sufficient technical causa lucri f but even under this most extraordinary ruling by which the best settled principles of the law ol larceny were disregarded and set aside there was no case made out against the prisoner there was not the slightest evidence that drayton had enticed or induced the slaves or any slave to run away in fact he had never seen one of the

economy in all branches of public service isa duty binding upon government it has no hope of filling up at once the deficiency but it will consider much to have been done for the country when it shall have succeeded in stopping the emission of paper money and in establishing a just equilibrium between its receipts and its expense agriculture is still suffering in consequence of troubles which have afflicted the country meanwhile in those places which have not been the theatre of insurrection labor has progressed in a satisfactory mannei the state f our finances must improve under the favorable

improvement of their pro duce in time manufacturing industry wil become nationalized among us government has for this a strong desire the establishment of workshops for the manufacture of powder of soap of paper etc shall be encouraged we shall draw from it the double advantage of employing a greater number of hands and of freeing ourselves from a portion of the taxes which we are obliged to pay

was needed in order to insure the supremacy of order in regard to it government has only eulogies to utter public instruction is making progress the people comprehend the advantage and neces ity of

without fidelity to government and without devotion for country the delicate task of directing youth enlightening the mind of the young and implanting within them the noble sentiments of rights and of

church philadelphia a defence of the position of this church on the subject of american slavery was attempted in a long letter signed w d published in the north star on the th of november it will be remembered that the same writer undertook a defence of the two other churches in philadelphia a few weeks since but for some reason not given by him but easily inferred he s has abandoned his de fence of those churches and has bent his efforts and energies to a desperate defence of his ownst thomas may we not hope that the same good sense which led this gallant defender to abandon the defence of stephen gloucesters church may lead him to give up the defence of st thomas church also he can certainly have no stronger reason fur abandoning the one than the other unless it may turn out that our hero is defending his own castle we have little to say in reply to this letter and that little would have been said simulta rarnsly with its publication had we been at home at the time our numerous readers in philadelphia will excuse the unavoidable delay and what might appear to them a reluctance on our part to grapple with the arguments presented by w d the subject under consideration is one requiring more honesty than logic to enable us to arrive at an intelligent conclusion with respect to it the real question at issue between w d and the north star is not whether a meetinghouse sanctuary ought to be reverenced it is not whether ordination is right nor is it whether christ was in favor of or opposed toa religion of forms and ceremonies upon these questions severally it may yet be proper to expend some discussion at present however we think it best to confine the controversy to the real question at issue the question is this is st thomas church philadelphia by its practice and position hostile to the antislavery movement we affirm that it is w d denies the charge and demands the evidence upon which we base the charge he says he must have something more than mere assertion and treats all that we have said before as mere assertion unsup i ported by evidence in the following singular demand he gives us what in his judgment constitutes evidence which will satisfy him of the truth of our charge has it been shown that the episcopal church either inher general or diocesan conventions has ever declared herself hos ile to antislavery this must be done first and after that is done the particular link must be pointed out which holds st thomas church in the same hostile position all this must be shownbefore anything hke a strong case can be made outwith all kindness to w d we most say i that this demand is most extraordinary and is as much opposed to all the just modes of reasoning as it obviously is to every dictate of common sense can it be possible that aman of w ds intelligence has never suspected that a body of men may be opposed toa righteous movement without in so many words declaring its opposition are we incharity bound to suppose him ignorant that i some of the most refined villains i trod the earth have been persons who have j never declared those vil lames or themselves villains shall we try to thik that w d has lived these forty or fifty years among a people so honest and upright that they were never guilty of any crime that they did not declare themselves in favor of and that be himself has come up so pure and guileless that he imagines it impossible to make outa strong case against any set of criminals unless they shaft declare by resolution that they arp such but mere and still more to the point may not aimer itself be a crime dm he not know that some of the moat brutal outrages and monstrous crimes ever committed by nations and individuals against the authority of god sod the happiness of mas bare been committed not only without a declaration in their fe or but against the moat pinna declare tiooa of the actors take for inetaoce ou own boasted republic solemnly declaring that it holds these

ab aatdky and tfirimwoty of w da position u the aatiafectioa of meet of oar readers but as this position is the keystone of his argument and defence we may be allowed to press oar inquiries on thjt point a little further he affirms that theprotestant episcopal church baa never either in her diocesan or general contentions declared berself against anti alavery indeed most innocent man he complains that we do not eten allow that church the advantage of a neutral neither hot nor cold posit ion she has stood an nnirter ested spectator of the whole stidggle between slavery and freedom this is tacitly admitted and in our judgment could thui be proved in her favor which we deny she would yet remain a corrupt traitor to the cause of god and man and be deserving of the burning reprobation of all who wish well to the cause of righteous liberty for a body of men to stand by and aeo n fellowmen perish by flood or flame and refuse to lend any assistance towards rescuing him from the jaws of death and then piously fold their arms and say they never took sides one way or the other v ould be as richly to deserve the baiter as any feloqp that ever swung between earth and sky the protestant episcpal church has we admit remained less moved by the antislavery agitation than any other large communion in this country she has in her associative form maintained almost perfect silence with respect to the whole subject of slavery her character therefore is to be determined by what she has not done rather than by what she has the great head of the church and author of christianity has been pleased to give us two rules with which to test the character of men the one is a positive and the other a negative rule and either of those is sufficient in the case before us the first is by their fruits ye shall krune them and the other is inasmuch as ye did it not unto the least of these my brethren ye did it not unto me in the light of these rules we fix the brand of hostility to the antislavery movement upon the character of the protestant episcopal church and also upon her children st thomas church included the protestant episcopal church has never treated slavery as a sin it has never refused to fellowship slaveholders as christians it has never expressed the first word of sympathy with the antislavery movement or even thanked god foi its existence or expressed a hope that the movement would succeed though from all the likelihoods of the case that church is aware that three milhops ofpeople in this land are robbed of themselves and all that pertains to man as a responsible being compelled to live in ignorance of the great end for which they were created and not even allowed to learn to read the scripturesdenied the family relationvirtually forced into concubinage yet this church with all its pretend regard for the benign religion of the new testament and its love of purity has never uttered one word against their brutal enslavers it is of such a church that st thomas claims to be a branchit is liom such a church that the minister of st thomas church holds his authority to preach the gospel of christ it was from such a church that he received bis ordination and it is in such a church that he is by proxy represented but more and still worse it is a notorious fact that slaveholders and slavetraders are welcomed not only to the communion of this church but slaveholders and slavetraders are ordained as ministers of jesus christ itis now almost equally notorious that bishop meade of virginia is not only a slaveholder but defends that infernal system from the bible now to say that such a church is not hostile to the antislavery cause is equal to saying that slaveholders are not hostile to emancipation if it be true that no man can serve i two masters that there is no concord between christ and belial and that liberty has no fellowship with slavery then is the american protestant episcopal church in favor of slavery and hostile to the antislavery movement since slaveholders and slavetraders are in every department of that church from bishopric to laity and since that church has never uttered a single word in condemnation of slavery all this would be proof enough against that church to any unbiassed mind bot this is not all mach more can be presented which ought to put to shame if not to silence any man who ventures a defence of that cage of unclean birds we should as soon consider a den of wolves as a standing type and representative of jesus christ as such a church from the crown of its head to the feet there is no soundness in itbut it is full of wounds and putrifying sores w d wants something more than negative proof let him read then the following testimony wfa member of the protestant episcopal church and then let him ask himself if he ought not to be ashamed to be in christian fellowship with a body of men who are such respecters of persons and are so filled with the common american hate towards persons of our complexion that they will not tolerate the minister of st thomass church to represent that church an the floor of their diocesan conventioo

many similar instanoes there may be we know not that we cite has come undei our immediate notice the vestry and wardens of au episcopal church in the diocese of new york a few years since accepted a deed fora cemetery which was demised to them upon the express condition unbodied in the indenture that they should never suffer any colored person to be buried in any part of the same and all the subsequent conveyances on the part of tlie chotch of vaults and burialplaces are subject to the same condition what will w d do with this statement of facts will it be evidence to his mind ot the proslavery or antislavery bharacter of the protestant episcopal church or will he say that it is no evidence at allpronounce it mere assertionor will he say if evidence at all it is defective evidence insufficient to convict that church of hostility to the antislavery movement or will he come forward and honestly own as he ought to do that his mother church is a corrupt old ptoslavery hag and not to be regarded as the church ol the living god wbb is the god of the oppressed and not a respecter of persons if he does not say so it will be owing to no want of testimony against that church but a failurei on his part to appreciate that evidence in reply to what w d says about ordination it is enough to say that he misrepresents the point at issue we have never uttered a word in ridicule of ordination what we said bn this point merely had respect to making ordination the absolute condition upon which persons are allowed to speak in episcopal churches and this he must have known if he read with care our remaks on this point we say now as we said before that i this rule strictly carried out would admit the devil into the pulpit of st thdkias church could he appear in holy orders while christ unordained would be rejected this we say is the practical working of a rigid adherence to this rule x you have experienced it in that while you would not admit frederick douglass martin r delany or charles lenox remond into st thomas church to speak for the slave the reverend mr allen a notorious slaveholder has been repeatedly an occupant of the pulpit of that church the case is made

speech made by rev h w beecher at a recent meeting held in broadway tabernacle new york on behalf of certain females members of the methodist episcopal church who were claimed as slaves two oclock p m meeting addressed by rev j s mewry mr m urged the importance of a decided testimony on the part of clergymen and others on the subject of slavery and other reforms mr m was follower by mr j b sanderson of new bedford who very forcibly and eloquently illustrated the proposition that colored men have a peculiar interest in the antislavery movement that he is a walking living speaking monument of the influence of slavery e also urged ist upon ihe colored people tobe vigilant active diligent in making themselves in deed and in truth proficient in all things pertaining to civil and social life d consistent political action d to separate themselves from the proslavery spirit of the communityand identify themselves thoroughly with the friends of the slave and the slave himself rev martin cheneyhad found it difficult to identify himself with ilie colored man supposed that it was difficult for others lie thought the persons who came nearest to it were win l garrison and gerrit smith it looked as though some of the colored people found this rather hard nowhere can this lie done except in this poor despised hooted antislavery movement it is not that the colored people do not come with us it isa despised place must all rise above circumstances not be enslaved by them where is the hope of the slave ist has he any hope from the attitude of government not so much as from the north star no hope from the constitution its influence has been to fasten the slave in his chains d is there any hope from a change of government the free soil party may produce some favorable changesjut doubtful is there any hope from the church it is difficult to produce any change or reform here whence then have you hope for the slave from the aritislavery influence that is abroad as seen in the disturbed state of church and stateas seen in the late buffalo convention gods eye is upon the slave hence there is hope the slave will be redeemed for the truth will raise him up in closing mr c paid a beautiful and eloquent tribute to the editor of the north star mr reddendid not feel like censuring the colored people as fiercely as some of thea friends we exjiect too much of them expect them to spring at once from their degradation uuo full growu men their progress for the last two years has been wonderful lo elevate them we must respect them and acknowledge their equality jb sandersonwe do not ask the whites for pity give us our rtghit we ask nothing more take aay the obstacles you have thrown in our way then if we do not rise let u sink to oui proper place mr

doctrine has been admitted by all statesmen and jurists and until within a few years has never been doubted it is the duty of all to say that they will not be parties to these compromises it is said that the term slavery is not there art ist sec d threefifths of all other persons must refer to slaves art sec d it is admitted that a person is a slave and a slave is a person in this clause the term person must mean slave apprentices are everywhere held to service and labor wherever found slaves owe service under the laws of the state where they are held chattels are held to service slaves are held to service in the same sense geo bradburnl national justice only lawnothing else can be the application of certain legal rule pf interpretation i would make the constitution an antislavery instrument viz seek its meaning from its own words when susceptible of two meanings that must be given which will favor honesty deny that slavery ever was legalizedcould not be legalized under the charter for they contained clauses prohibiting slavery it is a mistake to suppose that massachusetts abolished slavery by the adoption of the constitution it was abolished by the judiciary the constitution finished the work perhaps there is nothing in tlie j state constitution establishing or legalizing j slavery the instrument itself art sec not a word in it about slavery must go out of it this conflicts with the j rule held to service sic this is ai legal holdingapprentices are thus held no statute requiring service of a slave service is not a characteristic of slavery under the laws

beneficial influence upon public sentiment of the following resolutions nos and were laid on the table the rest were adopted  resolved that the constitution of the united states by allowing the slaveholders tobe represented in congress and in the electoral colleges for their human chattels by its provision for the return of the fugitive slave to his master and by pledging the free states to aid in putting down slave insurrections involves all who swear to support it or who vote to place in any office a man who must before entering upon the discharge of its duties take an oath to sustain it in the guilt of supporting an infamous proslavery compact resolved that the friends of god and liberty if they would absolve themselves from bloodguiltiness in this matter must withdraw their support from the union of the states as at present constituted and establish a government tree from the contamination of slavery and which shall maintain the equal rightsof all who dwell under its jurisdiction resolved that the principle of chattel jbinary nrkwk lro cvutb dcmiujb dts tinction between a man and a beast crushes the aspirations of the soul the strongest evidence of mans divine paternity is tbe same with the spirit of prejudice against the free people of color at the north which makes their condition but little better than that of the slavedenying to them the elective franchise refusing to treat them as brethren in the house of worship closing against them the seminaries of learning and thus shutting out from their minds the light of knowledge ia obstructing the development of their will and ingenuity degrading and treating them with all manner of contumely practices which implicate the people of the north in the responsibility of giving the most efficient support to slavery resolved that this society again renews its oft oftrepeated and solemn testimony against the slaveholding position at present occupied by the american church and clergy and again renews its oftrepeated pledge nevi er to relinquish that oftrepeated testimony while the religions bodies referred to continue to fellowship slaveholders as christians toi fraternize with them for the spread of tbe  gospel to unite with them in efforts to send the bible to tbe heathen abroad while they deny that book to three millions of heathen at home and by maintaining a studied silence respecting tbe awful sin and crime of slavery do thus award that horrible system the most profound religious sanction and support and tbat we call upon all who would free themselves from responsibility for slavery to abandon at once those slaveholding churches and atone for their past wrong to the slavery devoting themselves unreservedly to promoting in every christian way the immediate apd unconditional emancipation of the american bondman resolved that we rejoice in the rapid spread of antislavery principles as evinced in the recent formation of tbe free soil party and while we cannot regard its platform as sufficiently broad for aboiiudhists to stand upon we nevertheless hail it as tbe harbinger of the downfall of the alavepower and the i slave system in our lands

power aright and it is mighty to the pulling down of the btrongholds of oppression and j wrong therefore let us not be slothful but diligent doing all we have the ability to do so that if we must be made longer to bleed beneath the cruel inflictions of ignorance prejudice and heathenish proscription we may at least amidst our sufferings have this consolation that we have exerted ourselves to the uttermost to escape the bloody scourge to the county committee you gentlemen are expected to cooperate with the central committee in bringing together to form this convention a body of independent fearless and talented menmen in whose hearts burns unquenchably the love of liberty and who will permit no surmountable obstacle to work any intermission in their efforts tocome at once into the most complete enjoyment of that liberty wbichdhey love there are such men and reasonable exertion will suffice to assemble them together hitherto our conventions have been made up of men who had received the suffrage and been sent up by the authority of their constituents under that arrangement there is reason to suspect that in very many instances those most roughly acquainted with our grievances and the best qualified to remedy them have from their faithfulness in reproving whatever evil they have seen prevailing in their respective communities incurred the displeasure of their fellowcitizens and been repudiated by them as busybodies meddlers in other mens matters while those who have stood by cordially assenting to the shouts of the multitudes knowing nothing about the interest of the people and caring less are sent up to do business for our oppressed people in order that this as well as other evils resulting from the old order of things may be averted we have proclaimed a mass convention thus affording every man who feels the i weight of the yoke and is tired of wearing it and has sufficient intelligence to contribute aught to remove it a fair opportunity to do so j poindexter j

lived a short distance la the country the boy was lightlr built and bis burden seemed almost beyond his strength many times had he sat down to rest himsell on his way up the hill bat it seemed as if he would never reach the summit bach time he lifted the basket it feh heavier than before the boy was about halfway up the hill with his basket when a gentleman overtook and passed him he had noi gone on many paces when he stoppec and turning to the lad looked at him i moment or two and then said kindly thats a heavv load you have come let me help you and the gentleman took the baske and carried it to the top of the hill there do you think you can ge along now said he with a smile ai he sat the basket down or shall j carry ita litte further r oh no thank you sir returned th boy with a glow of gratitude on hii fine young face i can carry it now very well and am very much obligee to you you are right welcome my little man said the gentleman and passec on twenty years from that time a careworn man well advanced in life sal motionless in an old arm chair wit his eyes fixed intently upon the glowing grate he was alone and appeared to be in a state of deep abstraction in a little while however the door of the room opened and the light form of a young and lovely girl glided in papa said a low sweet voice anda hand was gently laid on the old mans arm ls it you dear he returned with a sigh yes papa and the young girl leaned against him and parted with her delicate fingers the thin grey locks that lay in disorder about his forehead i would like to be alone this evening florencesaid the old man i have a good deal to think about and expect a man on business and he kissed her tenderly yet sighed as he pressed his lips to hers the girl passed as noiselessly from the room as she entered the old man had been calm before her coming in but the moment she retired he became agitated and arose aud walked the floor uneasily he continued to pace to and fro for nearly half an hour when he stopped suddenly and listened the btreetdoor bell had rung in a little while a man entered the room mr mason he said with a slight perceptible embarassment mr page returned the old man with a feeble quickly fading smile good morning and he offered his hand the visitor grasped the old mans hand and shook it warmly but there was no pressure in return sit down mr page the man took a chair and mr mason sat down near him you promised an answer to my proposal tonight said the former after a pause i did returned the old man but am as little prepared to give it as was yesterday in fact i have not had an opportunity to say anything to florence on the subject the countenance of the visitor fell and something like a frown darkened upon his brow there was an embarassing silence ol some minutes after which the mac called page said mr mason i have made an honorable proposal for your daughters hand for weeks you have evaded and dc still evade an answer this seems sc much like trifling that i begin to feel as if just cause of offence existed none is intended i do assure you replied mr mason with something deprecating in his tone but you musl remember mr page that you have never sought to win the young girls affection and that as a consequence the offer of marriage which you wish tc make to her will be received with surprise and it may be disapproval i wish to approach her on the subject with proper discretion to be too percipi tate may startle her into instant repugnance against your wishes she loves you does she not inquired page with a marked significance ol manner a child never loved a parent more tenderly replied mr mason give her then an undisguised history of all your embarrassment show how your fortunes are trembling on the brink of ruin and that you have but one hope of relief and safety left the day she becomes my wife you are relieved from dangerwill you do this the old man did not reply he was lost iri a deep reverie it is doubtful whether he had heard all that the man had said will you do this replied page and with some impatience in his tone mason aroused himself as from adream and answered wjth great firmness and dignity mr page the struggle in my mind is over i am prepared for the worst i have no idea that florence will favor your suitand i will not use a stugle argument to influence her in that matter sh must remain perfectly free approach her as a man and win her if you have the power to do so it is your only hope as if stung by a serpent page started from his chair you will repent this sir he angrily retorted and repent it bitterly i came to you with honorable proposals for your daughters hand you listened to them gave me encouragement and promised me an answer tonight now you meet me with insult sir you will repent this mr mason vsnturad no reply bat merely bowed in token of his willingness to meet and bear all consequences jut might come for a long time after this angry viator had retired did mr mason crew ind recross the floor with measured at last be rung the beu am the servant who cane to my to florence be wished to see ber when florence eano she was sur prinl to see ber fhthsr so strongly agr tsfed sit down dear be said in a trem mng voice i hive something to tel you that most be no longer concealed florence looked wonderingly into bei fathers face while her heart began u sink just then a servant opened the dooi and ushered in a stranger he was i tall fine looking young man iuut in the prime of life florence quickly retiree but net before the stranger fixed hii i eyes on her face and mailed its sweet expression i pardon the intrusion sir be said as soon as the young girl bad left the room but facts that i have learned this evening have prompted me to call on you without a moments delay my name is greer of the firm of greer miller comr mason bowed and saidi i know your bouse very well and now remember to have met you more than once in business transactions yes you have bought one or two bills of goods of us replied the visitor then after a moments pause he said in a changed tone j mr mason i learned tonight froma source which leaves me no room to doubt the truth of the statement that your affairs have become seriously embarrassed that you are in faot on the very verge of bankruptcy tell me frankly whether this is indeed so i ask from no idle curiosity nor from a concealed and sinister motive but to the end that i may prevent the threatened disaster if it is in my power to do so mr mason was dumb with surprise at so unexpected a declaration he made two or three efforts to speak but his lips uttered no sound confide in me said the visitor trust me as you would your own brother and lean on me if your strength be indeed failing tell me then is itas i have raid lt is was all that the merchant could utter how much will save you mention the sum and if within the compass of my ability to raise you shall have it tomorrow will twenty thousand dollars felieve you from your present embar rassment fully then let your anxiety subside mr mason that sum you shall have tomorrow morning i will see you good evening and the visitor arose and was gone before his bewildered auditor had sufficiently recovered his senses to know what to think or say in the morning true to his promise mr greer called upon mr mason and tendered him a check of ten thousand dollars with a note of hand for thirty days for ten thousand more which was almost the same as money while the check and note lay on the desk and ere he had touched them mr mason looked earnestly at the man who had suddenly taken the character of a disinterested selfsacrificed friend and said my dear sir l cannot understand this are you not laboring under some error oh no you once did me a service that i am now only seeking to repay it is my first opportunity andi embrace it eagerly did you a service when twenty years ago replied the mani was a poor boy and you was a man of wealth one hot day was sent along distance with a heavy basket while toiling up a hill with the hot sun upon me and almost overcome with heat and fatigue you came along and not only spoke to me kindly but took my basket and carried it to the top of the hill ah sir you did not knowhow deeply that act of kindness sunk into my heart and i longed for the opportunity to show you by some act of kindness how grateful i felt but none came often afterwards i met you in the street and looked into your face with pleasure but you did not remember me ever since i have regarded you with different feelings from those i entertained for others and there has been no time that i would not have put myself out to serve you last night i heard of your embarrassment and immediately called upon you the rest you know mr mason was astonished at so strange a declaration do you remember the fact so which i refer asked mr greer it had faded from my external meu ory entirely but your words have brought a dim recollection of the fact but it was a little matter and not entitled to the importance you have given it to me it was not a little matter returned mr greer i was a weak boy just sinking under a burthen that too heavv when you put forth your hand and carried it for me i could not forget it and nw let cue return at the first opportunity the favor by carrying your burden for you which has become too heavy until the hill is ascended and you are able to bear it onward again in your own strength mr mason was deeply moved words failed him in his efforts to express his true feelings the bread caat upon the water had returned to him after many days and he gathered it with wonder and thankfulness the merchant was saved from ruin nor was this all the glimpse which mr greer had received of the lovely daughter of mr mason revealed a character of beauty that impressed him deeply and he embraced the first opportunity to make ber acquaintance a year afterwards he led her to the altar a kind act is never toot even though dons to a
