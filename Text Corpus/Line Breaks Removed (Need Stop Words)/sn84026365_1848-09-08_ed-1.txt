declined respectfully but explicitly numerous offers from my friends in other states to prom re my nomination at the late baltimore convention and in the same spirit refused permission to the new vork delegation to present my name to tli it body under any circumstances whatever the refusal would have been equally decisive if it had been certain that they nud it in their power to carry their friendly wishes into effect tile new vork delegati n to the utica convention requested my opini ms in regard to the obligations imposed upon them by the ballon re nouiinaions and the constitutionality and expediency of a prohibition by congress of the introduction oj slavery into territories now free irorri it i hey also asked my con sent to the use of my name by the convention as its candidate for the presidency i cheertuilv gave them the opinions they desired but declined the last request absolutely that they sincerely desired to respect my wishes in this regard i hove never doubted but the

tefcuo due to the ra eusoocts under i the north star i which it i predated ii breathes the spirit and presents a political chart which with the explanations i am ab ut to make i can in good faith adopt and sustain in regard to the chief topics of the resolutions it is not to be doubted that the present unprecedented movement of the public mind infthe nonslaveholding stales upon the subject of slavery is caused mainly by an earnest desire to uphold and enforce the policy in regard to it established by the founders of the republic that policy in addition to the prospective prohibition of the foreign slave trade was ist adequate efficient and securitv against the extension of into territories where it did not practi r cally exist nd that in the language of your own condensed and excellent resolution slavery in the several states of the union which recognize its existence should depend upon state laws which cannot be repealed or inoditied by tne federal goverment and d a spirit of considerate forbearance towards the institution in localities where it was placed under the control of congress by a wise observance of this policy we have until recently been able to neutral ze the inju i s lendencies of an element of discord more dfficult to deal with than any to which our institutions are exposed but unhappily for the present hannony and posihly for the i future welfare of our beloved country a pretenison has been recently set upby our bret in n of the slaveliolding states in regard t the first branch ot this policy so inadmissible upon prin i ciple and so revolting to our feelings as to produce a rush of public sentiment towards the point of resistance which with a population so considerate and so staid as ours is never seen except when a conviction exists t rnt the honor and safety of the country are ut stake and then always attain f events all tending to the same gen eiul end which have lor a few years i past followed each other in rapid suc cessi n has raised this feeling to an elevation hitherto unknown and produced resolves which it is not in the power of individuals to induce the people to recede from the constitution j ulity the justice the humanity and the i expediency of hie ground they have taken ore all so clear as to preclude the possibility of a continued diversity of opinion or action iu the nouslave result from this conflict of opinion between us and those who are unhappily our opponents if their pretensions arc persisted inare known only to thatomni j scient and kind providence which has j hitherto protected our country and its institutions from the dangers which have threatened them the claim set up by our southern brethren is p departure from the plat i form raised by our common ancestors at a period when the chain of our union was the brightest and the fraternal feeling between the states that composed it the strongest it comes upon the back of a series of events well eal culated to awaken ait the north that deep and as it respects ourselves overwhelming sensation in the public mind to which i have referred a brief review of them at a moment so critical cannot fail to he useful i tne further condition of the respective states in rogad to the probable continuance or abolition of slavery were correctly foreseen at the formation of the government those of the old thirteen which are now exempt from it acted under a confident anticipation that they would soon become so whilst those of the number where slavery still exists would not look forward to an equally favorable result in regard toth emselves it was theref re u r ell understood at the adoption of the con stitnti n that although a large and hig ily respectable portion of the members ol the confederacy would probably lor a long certainly f ir an indefinite period remain slaveholding states a majority of the states would be nonslaveholding and that a constitutional preponderance in t ie federal govern m mt would be thus secured to the latter to make assurance of this result doubly sure the sluveh tiding states themselves were prominently active ina measurethe ordinance of hv which six new states were first designed to bp a id five actually were arraved on the same side these added tothe seven in which slavery had been or was expected to be abolished would make the division in this regard twelve j to six i ue evidence we possess of the circumstances and dispositions of the times warrants us in assuming that no on at that day anticipated that this difference in the respective conditions of the statesin regard to slavery j would ever be overcome or neutralized by accessions to the confederacy of new slaveholding states yet in the brief period which has elapsedwe may well sav brief when viewed iu connection with such great resultswre have wit neased the additi n of nine slaveholding and only three nonsl vaeholding states to the confederacy beyond those which were provided for before the adoption of the c institution making them to stand fifteen to fifteen the preponderance originally secured to the mnslavehold ing states and with a knowledge of which they assisted in investing the institution io the states with the privileges and guarantee of the constitution has thus been annihilated theee facts cannot be controverted or concealed end when once fully understood end appreciated by the people of

they hav already excited ought not to surptis intelligent and ingenuous mind of au quarter but this is not the only nor even thi most repulsive view which we ar compelled to take of the preseot

such now for the flrst time the attempt i made to permit the introduction of sla i very into territories which are now fret from itterritories from winch it was expelled within the last fifteen or

clairncc dominion over that state the territories in regard to which the queslior i is now made are among the conquests j of this war it is therefore in effect whatever may have been the origina objects of this war an appeal to the inhabitants of the nonslaveholding stater to sanction the extension through oui instrumentality of slavery into territories which the united states have ir fat acquired by the sword hut whicl others had relieved from that great evil such a proposition need only to be stated to ensure its prompt rejection by the nonslavebolding states upon what grounds is it attempted tc i sustain a principle so repugnant to oui feelings so destructive in our views tc our national character and so tgeil calculated if successful to cloud the glory of this great republic that there should be diversities of opinion and feeling upon the subject of sleyejsfjgsfe tveen us and our southern brethreiis thu htiglh of to the institution has very truly stated on the floor of the ep ate by a very distinguished southern statesman the people of the north could no overcome this aversionif they would and they cannot desire to do so because they religiously believe that the highest earthly interest of man arc based on its permanency and ultimate universality at the south the feeling is very different because the culture of their minds and dispositions and the force of habit have had an opposite tendency this known and for a season at least incurable diversity of opinion and feeling should beget a spirit of conciliati n and inculcate mutual forbearance in speech and action this duty has doubtless been occasionally lost sight of on both sides but it cannot be denied that the departure from it has been the greatest on the part of our southern brethren no one will venture to insist that itis at this day either expedient or right to originate slavery in territories that are free from it if it can be properly prevented but it is insisted that this cannot be done in the case under consideration and under the form proposed first because the constitution does not give congress the power to prohibit slavery in the territories and that consequently the great number of acts for that purpose which have been passed for the last sixty years with general assent were but so many infractions of the constitution all will remember the solemnity and rapidity with which state after state at the south in succession announced this doctrine and the acrimonious vehemence with which their conventions denounced political proscription in the form of political exclusion from the offices of president and vicepresident of all who refused to adopt it but it is already apparent that differences of opini n upon this important subject cannot be settled by vehement assumptions nor conciliation in regard to it prompted by denunciation in our country such difficulties must be solved by appeals to the tests provided by the constitution for the rectitude of our motives and the correctness of our conduct we are responsible on earth to the opinion of the civilized worldand hereafter to a power that is greater than all the question of the constitutionality the gravest of all objections that can be made against a public measure has just passed through the ordeal of publio discussion and the doctrine in question has been so thoroughly rejected and condemned by the voice of the nation that it is no longer necessary to spend words in refuting it two circumstances have however occurred which though not necessary to its overthrow give to that overthrow a sanction that entitle them to notice it now appears that twentyeight years since at the time of the missouri compromise mr monroe then president ta slaveholder and elected from a slave holdiog state submitted this very question save oaly that it was then applied to slave territory to a cabinet composed cm eng other great men of such giant intslloef from the rfaveboldtng staten an crabbed calhoun an wirt the letter the lewafteer of the rochester n y friday september ly of opinion that centres did posse the power in question aid that th then president a man who was ou tb scene ot action when the constitutioi was formed concurring in that cpinioi approved the bill the document which attest these interesting circumstances are before the countrv an ever y one will judge for himself of theii claims to credence considered in connection with what has been said upot the subject by the survivor of the cabinet relerred toto bring the matter nearer to oui own times within a few days upon th very heel of the recent discussions upor this point a bill containing this restric tionthe very has in part produced this discussionhas passec both branches of the national legislature and received the constituliona approval of the present executivear approval which it was his sworn duty tc withhold it he had not been satisfied that all the provisions of the bill wen in conformity to the constitution tin present president also a slaveholder elected from a slaveholding stute witt a large portion of his cabinet in the same situation ha given the highest sanction to the doctrine wc contend foi that is known to our institutions ant although he felt himself called upon tc make an extra message setting forth his reasons lor believing that the restrictions ought not to he applied to oui mexican ten itories he dues not take the slightest notice of the constitutional objection on which so many southern states have based their opposition totht general measure tins branch of the subject has been thus and we hope forever disposed of it is further contended that slaves are so far to be regarded as property as to authorize their owners to carry them into any of the territories and to hold them t ere notwithstanding any act which congress may pass upon the subject it congress have the constitutional power to prohibit slavery in the territories its laws place the subject on the same footing there as the state laws do in the states as well therefore might the slaveholder contend that he can bring his slaves into a state which prohibits slavery as that he can bring them into territories where slavery is prohibited congress f if his slave runs away and enters one of the nonslaveholding states he does not therebjgfrcrgne delivered claim ofroo persmi tue of an ofthe constitution which constitutes one of its compromises upon the subject of slavery his view of the matter was placed in a clear light in the recent debates by one of the oldest and inot distinguished members ofthe senate when he insisted that the claim on the part of the slaveholders though nominally to remove their property was in reality to transport their laws into the territories one has therefore only to imagine a territory governed by the various and conflicting laws of thirty independent states to appreciate the absurdity of the pretension but it is insisted that the prohibition carries with it a reproach to the slaveholding states and that submission toit would degrade them this is obviously the principle if not the material ground of opposition to the measure that is persisted in and most assuredly if it were well founded we would have no just ground to take exception to the earnestness with which it is sustained let the objection therefore be fairly and dispassionately considered very erroneous opinions of the dispositions of the northern people are entertained by those who think them capable of desiring the degradati n of any of the states of the confederacy whether they be slaveholding or otherwise they entertain too enlightened a sense ofj their own interests they have too justa conception of the true glory of the confederacy and ofthe extent to which the humiliation of a part would tarnish the lustre of the wh le and they are above all too national in their feelings not to cherish a deep solicitude for the honor and welfare of all its in mbera if they could therefore believe that thesuccess of this measure would draw after it such grave consequences they would be am ng the last to uphold it if it can have such a tendency it will certainly not be owing to any want ofi generality in its application the restriction will of course be obligatory on all who settle in the territories from whatever state or country they may have emigrated they will all in this respect stand upon an equal footing if any inhabitant of any of the j nonslaveholding states who removes to the territories has his capital invested in business transactions which are not permitted hr the laws of the territory he must change the investment if a slavehoider desires to rem ve there he must dispose of his slaves and em ploy free labor as bis countrymen and neighbors did when they retnovad to different portions of the northwestern territory and in doing so made themselves prosperous contented and happy let us for a moment look at the character of this measure and compare it with others that have gone before itj it is a reenactment of the ordinance of which prohibited the introduction of slavory into territories which had been ceded by several of the state to the united states the difference between the effects of the two measures consists only in the act that the territory to which ths ordinance of v was tpplied was previous to its cession subject to ths introduction of slavery whilst ths territories to which it is now sought to hs aptisd had tz the tfjt j of the cession to us been already exempted from tt by law who first proclaimed the principle which triumphe i in the euactment of the ordinance c ij thomas jefferson who pro i moled and secured its passage throug the continental congress all th distinguished and patriotic mn wb that year represented the slaveholdin i states in that body without a solitur i exception who gave to the measun  his official sanction by approving a bil to carry it into effect under the nev government george washington within the last sixty fyeara ant d wn to the same enactment ha been again and again repeated with thi general concurrence of the southeri i member and often through their particular instrumentality a full fifth othe states of the union has been organ i ized as territories under its restrictions j in respect to ohio the oldest of them conformity to this principle in the ordinance of b was required even in tbt state constitution and government ant the bill giving the ordinance this application was reported by a committee o which william b giles of virginia was chairman and john rutledge o south carolina a member it was passed in the senate by a vote of sixteen to five and among the aves w ill he found the respected names of baldwin and jackson of georgia breckenridgc and brown of kentucky franklin ane j stone of north carolina stevens thompson mason and wilson caiy i nicholas of virginia sumpter of south j carolina and wright of maryland the states which have grown up undti and in conformity to that ordinance i have in a very great degree been settled by emigrants from the slavehoiding states thousands of these hardy and enterprising pioneers many of them among the most respectable of their fellow citizens for a series of years in i succession left their friends and neighbors in tltc slaveholding states for what was then the far west accompanied by j their prayers and benedictions it never entering into the imagination of either that in doing so they submitted to any personal or sectional reproach or degradation prosperous and happy in their new abode they and their associates and the great enterprise they accomplished have been honored and admired by ail who have witnes ed their success one of those very settlers after assuming and for many years discharging the responsibility of enforcing the ordinance of and after enjoying a large share of his countrys con ftdonce and respect in other form whs finally elevated to the presidency and died in that exalted station another highly distinguished inhabitant of one of the territories subject to the same restriction after having also for a long series of years borne the responsibility ot seeing to the execution of this now derided ordinance as governor of the territory is at present the favored candidate for the same high office of portions of the citizens of the slaveholding as well as of the other states in the face of facts like these is it possible that the application of this restriction to new mexico and california can operate to tho disparagement of our brethren of the slaveholding states no impartial mind can i think regard it in this light and if there be any other objections insisted on that are worthy of notice i am not apprised of them none that are tenable can in my judgment be offered the measure is right in itself and what is right may be done with ultimate safety the present generation stand in the same relation towards these very extensive territories in which the sages of stood towards the northwestern territory if we act as wisely as they did results not less glorious than those which reflect such undying honor on the policy of that day will follow the labors and perpetuate the memories of thse by whom it is now upheld the sixth resolution embraces the subject of slavery in the district of columbia and i observe in it a generality expression in respect to the time when and the circumstances under which it was the opinion of the convention that it should be abolished which has not been usual on the part of the friends of immediate action most reflecting and philanthropic minds live in the hope that they will one day see slavery abolished not only in that district but io the states also in the latter through the agency of the state governments to whom the constitution wisely leaves exclusive power in the matter and in the former by congress i maybe mistaken but i think i see in the guarded language of the resolution evidence of an apprehension on the part of the convention that adiflerence in opinion to some extent at least existed among its members upon the point referred to and of an enlightened and truly patriotic resolve not to suffer that circumstance if it existed to weaken the moral power of their unanimity on the great question which had brought them together my opinion in favor of the power of congress to abolish slavery io the district of columbia has been repeatedly avowed as well when a canddate as while president and every days re j flectiou has hut served to confirm my j conviction of its correctness lat the same time expreesde myself strongly j against the expediency of exercising it and in a recent letter to the new j york delegation at utica referred to my continued opposition to that measure the subject was only incidentally introduced and there arts consequently but little cere taken in regard to the terms in which the suggestion was made the form of expression which employed has it sppsrs led many hop m sad sent uksq that the remark related exclusively to the past and was nt yiten i ded to convey my present views on th i matter this construction though perhaps not unwarranted by the words cm ployed is in fact erroneous and it i due to truth to fairdealing and to al who take an interest in the matter tha the subject should now be placed in it true light it is not to be denied that many othe reasons which in and before operated to produce the convictions then expressed no longer exist am if when writing to the new york delegation at utica i could have anticipated what has since occurred i shouit have felt it my duty to discriminate between the reasons which had passet away and those wtiicb yet remain but when my letter to them was written nothing could have been further from my expectations than that i should ever again be a candidate for the presidency and of course it was not mv intention to say what my conduct would he on this or any other matter if again an incumbent of that place i have spoken in a former part ol this letter of the three leading leatures of the policy in regard to slavery adopted by the fathers of the republic history if true must record the fact that the north has hitherto faithfulv sustained her part in the maintenance of this policy and in none more so thai in that which inculcates forbearance or the point now referred to wish t see the forbearance which has so loop characterized her conduct in this matter sti fartln r cot tinned approving of the platform which the conventioi has adopted and conscious from mv impressions of right and duty in regan to it that i shall be among the last t abandon it i prefer not to connect oui efforts to sustain it with an issue which all must admit to be in some degree at least affected by different considera tions in my judgment all that is necessary to insure success is dispassionate but steady and firm action let the great principle we are now contending for be once more rcestabiished in the councils of the nation and the institution of slavery in the district of columbia will fall of itself other and more important interests will intervene and induce the inhabitants themselves to labor for its removal i must not hlbwever be understood either by what i now say or by what was said in my tetter to the new york as repeating the declaration thaft would if elected withhold my approval from a bill foi the abolition of slavery in the district i could not now give any such assurance for the reason that the circumstances by which the question is now surrounded are widely and materially different from what they were when the declaration was made and because upon a question of expediency circumstances must control at that time the apprehension was honestly entertained that there was danger of a servile war in consequence of the extent to which the agitation of this question had been pressed participating in the apprehension and believing that such a declaration in advance of any action of congress upon the subject would have a salutary influence in allaying excitement and warding off the danger which menaced the peace of the slaveholding states i did not hesitate to make it whilst on the one hand all grounds for this apprehension have passed away weare on the other threatened with a subversion of the spirit and character of our government through the successful encroachments of the slave power if under such circumstances two branches of the national legislature should decide that a due regard for the public interest requires the passage of such a law i should not if president think it within the line of my duty to arrest its passage by the exercise of the veto power among the difficult subjects that occupied the attention of my illustrious predecessor whilst i was a member of his cabinet and of myself whilst president that of river and harbor improve  ments by the aid of the federal government occupied a prominent position whilst the conviction was very general with our slaves and others that alarge class of them was deserving of aid from that quarter and that it could be extended to them without exceeding the prescribed powers of the g verri ment all were strongly impressed witha deep sense of the liabilities to abuse to which the legislation of congress upon the subject was unavoidably exposed the matter was one of frequent and earnest conference between president jackson and myself during the f first two years of h first and the whole of his last term the result was a conviction that no better course could be adapted than to approve such bills as we were satisfied came within the class referred to and do all that could le rightfully done by the executive to prevent abuses by appropriation for object that were not entitled to the aid of the federal government the appropriation for river and harbor improvements contained in acts of congress approved during or respective administrations will show tbs results of that coo vioitoo and i know of nothing that would prevent ms from pursuing the earn oourse if i should agnin occupy the office of president the subject is one of vs importance and well deeerviog the attention bestowed upon it by tbe chicago coo notion of last year i have not be fcwtm the letter sddreed by my i ameoted friend governor wright i that body nut l tu strong john dicx prusaa whole no i uvori sed by the view he expressed upon the general subject toe view which i have for m nf years entertained in regard to the best disposition by congress of the public lands have been receutly set forth in my published letter to the industrial congress they were first that congress ought to act upon the principle that the u states have a greater interest in the early settlement and substantial improvement of the public lands than in the amount of revenue which may be derived from them secondly that the accumulation of large tracts in few hands should be discountenanced and thirdly that liberal facilities ought to be afforded for th acquisition of small i portions by such of our citizens wherever residing as in good faith desire to possess them as homes for themselves and their families these opinions were announced as far back as whilst a candidate for the presidency i set forth also in my letter to the industiia congress the recommendations i had w hilst president made toc ongrcsscnd the acts i had approved to promote the policy i had avowed the general principles i have sustained upon the subject of the disposition of the public lands arc in harmony with the resolution of the convention w ith this difference that whilst the convention propose free giants of limited quantities for actual settlement the farthest that had gone w as to recommend grants of portions ofthem at prices little if anything more than sufficient to defray tho expences of survey and location the policy to which have so long adhered and for the success of w hich have been sincerely solicitous makes tho eail and u far as practicable substantial settlement of the public lands the principal and the revenue derived from tho sales ofthem a secondary and comparatively unimportant object regard the question of revenue as only important because it affords a prospect of securing regularity and a gr eater degree of stability in the settle meets it a plan can he devised by which these objects would in ull reasonable probability lc us w ell effected as they can be by the exaction of a pecuniary consideration from the settlers the relinquishment of that consideration would with me bo no objection to the measure from a report of the committee on public lands which has lately been forwarded to rnc it appears that the sales of the public lands have been pledged to thy public creditor for one of the loans of the last year if this is so congress will w ithout doubt if any plan for the free gift of any portion of the public lands to actual ettlers should hereafter find favor in their eyes sec that the objection arising from this cause be in some proper way obviated come what may the good faith of the nation must always be scrupulously maintained my opinion in regard to protective duties and the best sources of revenue were very fully given in my litter to the indiana convention in winch was extensively published and they are the same now i on that ocasion gave my reasons for regarding the system of taxation in force in the states viz a direct tax upon assessed property as more equal and equitable than a system of duties on imports i gave also ny reasons for believing that duties on imports would for a long time continue tobe used as the mode by which the federal government would collect its revenues in preference to a resort to a direct luxate n although the latter policy is i believe steadily gaining in tho public mind its advance has not yet been sufficient to authorize us to expect its early adoption in the mean time the government must have revenue foi its support and the very heavy debt which it ha recently incurred ought to be payed as soon as practicable i r ndr these circumstances i acquiesce in the resolve of the convention that the means for these purposes should be raised by a revenue tar iff i have deemed it duo to the convention and to the occasion to depart thus much from the rule which prescribed to myself in my letter to the dustrml congress in regard o linker exposition of my opinion upon public questions a ving done so i

realize that i hare passed through a scene so trying trying however as they were and j gloomy as was the prospect thanks be to the most high who is ever the god of the oppressed at the moment w hich was to determine my whole earthly career his grace was sufficient my mind was made up i embraced the golden opportunity took the morning tide at the flood and a free man young active and strong is the result i have often thought should hk e to explain to you the grounds upon which i have justified myself in running away from you i i am almost ashamed to do so now for by this time you may have discovered them yourself i will however glance at them when yet but a child about six years old i imbibed the determination to run away the very first mental effort that i now remember on my part was an attempt to solve the mystery i why am i a slave and with this question my youthful mind was troubled for many days pressing upon me more heavily at times than others when i saw the slavedriver whip a slavewoman cut the blood out of her neck and heard her piteous cries i went away into the corner of the fence wept and pondered over this mystery i had through some medium i know not what got some idea of god the creator of all mankind the black and the white and that he had made the blacks to serve the whites as slaves how he could do this and be good i could not tell i was not satisfied with this theory which made god responsible for slavery for it pained me greatly and i have wept over it long and often at one time your first wife mrs lucrelia heard me singing and saw me shedding tetrs and asked of me the matter but i was afraid to tell her i was puzzled with this question till one night while silling in the kitchen i heart some of tiie old slaves talking of theii parents having been stolen from africa by white men and were sold here i as slaves the whole mystery was solved at once very soon after this my aunt jinny and uncle noah ran away and the great noise made about it by your fatherinlaw made me for the first time acquainted with j the fact that there were free states as well j as slave states from that time i resolved that i would some day run away the morality of the act i dispose of as follows i am myself you arc yourself we arc two distinct person equal persons what you are i am you are a man and so am i god created both and made us separate beings i am not by nature bound to you m j you to me nature does not make youi existence depend upon me or mine to depend upon yours i cannot walk ujmn your legs or you upon mine i cannot breathe for you or you for me i must breathe for myself and you for yourself we are distinct persons and are each equally provided with faculties necessary to our individual existence in leaving you i took nothing but what belonged to me and in no way lessened your means of obtaining an honest living your faculties remained yours and mine became useful to their rightful owner i therefore see no wrong in any part of the transaction it is true i went off secretly but that was mure your fault than mine had i let you into the secret you would have defeated the enterprise entirely but fur this i should have been really glad to have made you acquainted with my intention to leave you may perhaps want to know how like mv present condition i am free to say greatly prefer it to that which i occupied in maryland i am however by no means prejudiced against that state as such its geography climate fertility and products are such as to make it a very desirable abode for any man and but for the existence of slavery there it is not impossible that i might again take up my abode in that state it is not that i love maryland less but freedom more you will be surpiiscd to learn that people at the north labor under the strange delusion that if the slaves were emancipated at the south they would all flock to the north so far from this being the case in that event you would see many old and familiar faces back again at the south the fact is there are few here who would not return to the south in the event of emancipation we want to live in the land of our birth and to lay our bones by the side of our fathers and nothing short of an intense love of personal fret doin keeps us from the south fur the sake of this most of us would live on a crust of bread and a cup ol cold water since left you i have had a rich experience have occupied stations which i never dreamed of when a slave three out of the ten years since left yon spent as a common laborer on the wharves of new bedford massachusetts it was there i earned my first free dollar it was mine i could sjend it as pleased i could buy hams or herring with it without asking any odds of anybody that was a precious dollar to me you remember when i used to make seven or eight and even mne dollars a week in baltimore you would take every cent of u from me every saturday night saying that belonged to you and my earnings also never liked this conduct on your part to say the best i thought it a little mean i would not have served you so but let that pass was a linkawkward about counting money in new england fashion when i first landed in new bedford like to have betrayed myself several times i caught myself saying phip for fourpuice and one time a roan actually charged me with being a luuaway whereupon was silly euougb to become

hare fwiitjf as be is pretty generally known among slaveholders he put it into my head that i might make myself scrvicable to the cause of the slave by devoting a portion of my time to telling my own sorrows and those of other slaves which had come under my observation this was the commencement of a higher state of existence than sny to which i had ever aspired i was thrown into society the most pure enlightened and benevolent that the country affords among these i have never forgotten you but have invariably made yon the topic of conversa tionthus giving you ail the notoriety i could do i need not tell you that th opinion formed of you in these circles is far from being favorable they have little respect for your honesty and less for your religion but i was going on to relate to you something of my interesting experience i had not long enjoyed the excellent society to which ii have referred before the light of its excellence exerted a benefiml influence on my mind and heart much of my early dislike of white persons was removed and their manners habits and customs so entirely unlike what i had beerfused to in the kitchen quarters on the plantations of the south fairly charmed me and pave me a strong disrelish for the coarse and degrading customs of my j former condition therefore made an effort so to improve my mind and deportment as tobe somewhat fitted to the station to which i seemed almost providentially called the transition from degradation to respectability was indeed great and to get from one to the other without carrying some marks of ones former condition is truly a difficult matter i would not have you think that am now entirely cleai of all plantation peculiaiiti sbut my friends here while they entertain the strongest dislike to them regard me with that

extent the people of this i country have been duped and deceived by f those engaged in that nefarious project two weeks since an article appeared in the col unins of the noith star drawing attention to f the proceedings of the rev j b pinney y first missionary and afterwards governor of e the colony it now appears that muchvery  mu ch that might have been said was not said in that article the liberator of last week copies from an article in the new york day r book details of the most extraordinary character respecting the colony and its officets j b pinney of course comes in for a share of the benefit and what is here copied respecting him is particularly recommended to the careful perusal of the reverend gentlemen who composed the presbyterian synod that reeent ly met in this place and they may probably be induced to thi tk again before placing implicit reliance upon his statements at the time here mentioned it seems that j b finney was advocating the cause of the colony probably by that time the prospect of becoming governor was present to his mind the writer dr bacon editor of the day bookj says in the editor of t iii tfook then making arrangements l v t africa in order to investlg it me condition of the liberian cu y l operations and prospects of t o v ialion scheme of which he then was atd from his early youth had been an enthtisiamic admirer and advocate was introduced at his brother shouse to a person called john b pinney who had returned from liberia where lie had been at first nominally a presbyterian missionary and then abandoning that sacred cause had become a secular agent of the colonization j society with better pay and much better suited to his moral character being very desixious of acquiring the fullest possible knowledge of every fact concerning the liberian colony and considering himself eminently fortunate in such an i opportunity to know the truth in a matter upon which a great purpose of life and even life itself depended he made this man his friend as he supposedat any rate treated him like a friend introduced him to gentlemen i passed many hours in conversation with him j for weeks seeking to draw from him the truth in regard to the condition of liberia the character of the colonists the difficulties of colonization and the ultimate feasibility of the original scheme a few months afterwards the writer of this was in africa and from the first day of his landing on that continent till he left it he had evidence that all which he had so studiously learned irom j b pinney was a mass of the most absurd and abominable falsehood one of the first things that he heard there inspeaking of pinney was that he had been notoriously actually insane during a large portion of the time when there resident that he had been carefully watched for fear that he might do himself some mischief friends i and foes were alike agreed that he was a thoroughly insane man the writer has now no recollection of any particular in which pinney told him the truth in regard to liberia iu reply to his anxious personal inquiries before going to africa or in published statements rfead as before mentioned i africa tfiajreib uttim portant partreulars w true hr or course probable bat in all matters essential to a correct qirprwssion of the cnmto ford character of liberia and the colmtfets the falsehood was uniform the whole of the testimony was recollected only as a he in the general purport and in all particulars of any importance on this subject there was no difference of opinion among people in africa acquainted with his testimony the only question was as to the moral or intellectual causes of this monstrous mendacity it thus appears not only that the rev tb pinney had been guilty of fabricating the grossest falsehoods respecting the colony but that even while resident in liberia he had been found to be insane and had been carefully watched for fear that he might do himself some mischief even while residing at new haven where dr bacon was first introduced to him his behaviour had given occasion for a rumor that he was insane it appears then first that j b pinney had been detected in giving out as one w ho had been an intelligent eyewitness and therefore to be relied uion statements respecting liberia which were utterly false and without foundation and secondly that lie has at different periods of his life shown nelf to i insane little more than th eein to i be required to show that i lif er tte j tg inent nor the veracity oi tie reverend iui tleman is of the most satisfactory character it may be rather an interesting question whether the little stories with which he amused the reverend fathers in this city were j works of fiction founded on fact one source of consolation is that whether true or false they were of a sufficient harmless character tending simply to show for the edifica i tion of pious minds that providence hadj been very kind to liberia bah such hypocrisy is too gross it is difficult to contemplate it without a certain degree of heartsick nessi the following extract will afford some idea ji of the condition of the colony and shows what reliance is to be placed on the oft repeated assertions which are found in colonization prints that the colonists are happy and proaperuua by a singular coincidence it so happens that exactly rune yean ago this afternoon july the editor of the day buk i left the colony of liberia for the last time j after a residence at monrovia of seven months and in other parts of what is called liberia of j about a year in other parts of west africa of j a liule more than a year he first landed in ji liberia february and consequently the whole penod between hie first and last sight oflhalvety interesting country was two years five months and one week at several times after ceasing to resute then he visited i monrovia and made careful observations of the condition of the people he was slways j welcomed by them with strong expressions of delight and of hopes that he had curve back to remain and resume the agdiral charge of the colony and after his departure he was followed to the shore with loud regrets that be would not stay and with earmst entreaties that be wold change bis determination especially was this feeling manifested when be left the colony nine years ago today when some of the

the offspring of a most unchristian and unreasoning prejudice it is worse than eveu that however it is the twin sister of slavery and is a plan fostered and encouraged by slaveholders by which they might increase their unrighteous gains it is objected that benevolent men lend the sanction of the names to the scheme yes but they are deceived as many have be n who arc now the most strenuous opposers of colonization every statement respecting liberia requires to be scrutinized with the utmost jealousy further extracts will be given at an early day showing to what an extent the officers and agents of the colonization society have been implicated in the slavetiadej d ireland that the recent attempt of the irih to effect a violent revolution and force a repeal of the union has come to a most ineffectual termination at least for the present is now i beyond all question the leaders are either j arrested or are hiding in the mountains and the people dispersed discontent is not removed the causes of discontent are not removed still no one who has any knowledge of the state of matters in that country could ever dream of the possiblity of any other result to an attempt for their removal by such means it has proved to be nothing more than a most mistaken and unproductive expenditure of energy all that can be said to have been gained by this effort is that it will serve to attract the attention of the legislature to the redress of the peculiar evil under which ireland suffers and what are those evils if we except the temporary i measures which unusual emergencies call into operationmeasures which are doubtless ofttimes unnecessarily harsh and stringentthe most determined enemy to saxon rule will find it difficult to make out a case of very peculiar hardship for irelandthat is a heavier taxation or a mure rigorous government than falls to the lot of the other portions of great britain the miseries of ireland those of them that can be affected by legislation are more the effect of past than of present misgovernment the protestant establishment to which all are forced to contribute either in the form of tithes or church rates is a monstrous iniquity which is folk not less severely by a majority of the people of england and scotland than it is by the roman catholics and other dissenters of ireland a grinding taxation the result of long years of war and profligate expenditure pusses upon the laboring classes throughout the kingdom and aristocratic misrule has done and is now doing its work to widen the distance and to make more marked the distinction between wealth and poverty but the peculiar grievances of ireland are not so i easily pointed out that she has peculiar and almost unparalleled sufferings is a self evident fact it is also apparent that ninny of those sufferings may be tiaced to prese t causes the results of past misgovernment thit some of them rnay lie traced to the religious beliefsome to the ignoranc and the genius ol the people some to abocntce binami some to the plan extensively adopted by the landlords of paying the lalsirers on their estates by allowing them us squat on a small patch of laud where they may if they have sufficient courage and iu dustry to make the attempt without capita or means of any kind contrive to procure a miserable subsistence when this is said itis nearly all that presents itself in reference to irelands peculiar wrongs and it is much easier to say this than it is to discover a teinedy the protestant church establish meat might be removed there is out tko shadow of a reason aside from tho selfin terest of the aristocracy why it should gva tmue a single day the absenteeism might to some extent be remedied and a better system of wages might possibly be enforced but after all

of his coirieteiicy teaching says ihe author has by no means received the emolument either of mo ey or honor which strict justice would award in any other department to the talents and exertions

common ujki the seacoast at lhat season of the year it is well known to the observing mariner that a storm from the southeast never continues beyond twelve or fifteen hours and when the violence of the storm abates it is a common remark of the sailor that the northwester is not long indebt to the southeaster previous to this change of wind however there is what is expressively termed the lull of the storm a period when the rain ceases to fall the wind dies away to a perfect calm the barometer is suddenly depressed the clouds hover almost upon the face of the earth shutting out the light of the sun and causing a cheerless damp o settle upon everything terrestial and a dreary gloom to enshroud the mind itself hen the w ind changes these clouds ate not gradually dissolved and broken up so that the eve can catch transient glimpses of the blue sky beyond as after a snowstorm in winter but the dark drapery is suddenly lifted up as if by an uns en hand and the western skv from the horizon

the schoolroom and partly because of their protracted confinement within a close apartment during a gloomy afternoon were a little earlier than usual about to be dismissed the puois all seemed to welcome tin happy release that awaited them and in their eagerness to escape from confinement they very nalu rally neglected to observe their accustomed regard tor quiet and order inlaying aule their hooks it was however a fixed habit w ith the teacher never to give the signal for leaving the room till all the pupils had taken the proper attitude for passing outwith regularity and then had composed themselves to perfect silence on this occasion perlmpk two minutepassed away white imr boys were gradually almost impatiently bringing themselves to a compliance with tins rule of the teacher during this interval of waiting the cloud unperceived by the teacher had been slowly raised up from the western horizon just intime to allow the setting sun to bestow a farewell glance upon uie sorrow ing world at his leavetaking through the venetian blinds that guarded the windows towards the west the celestial light gleamed athwart the apartment und painted the opposite wall in front of the pupils with streaks of burnished goldin an instant every countenance was changed a smile now joyously played where before sadness and discontent had held their moody reign the teacher was reminded by all these circumstances of the beautiful language of the prophet which promised the gift of the garment of praise for the spirit jof heaviness what could lie more appropriate on the occasion than a song of praise without speaking a single word the teacher commenced one of the little songs already familiar to the whole school l die he ivens aio breaking pure an tln igtit above lite and light

l have just been reperusing your address delivered at the celebration of the first of august hdd in your city in it i find the following passage about eighteen years ago a man of noble courage rose among his brethren in virginia for what purpose we have long been subjected to slavery the hour for our deliverance has come let us rise and strike for liberty in the name of a god of justice let us slay our oppressors yes noble man oh that there were a few such noble men now oh that the slaves would rise as one man and hurl the tyrant from his throne oh that this were not a nation of hypocrites oh that there were at the nsrth a few noblemen with philanthropy religion and soul enough in them to go and aid their brethren in freeing themselves from the galling tyranny and is it possible that there arc not do we not all know that the slaves would be justifiable in rending their chains even if to effect it it were necessary to take the blood of every slaveholder in the land and do we not know that what one man may do another j may assist him in doing in short do wej not know that we ought to deliver the despoiled out of the hand of the oppressor why this silence on the part of abolitionists and the abolition press i wish to propose for the consideration of abolitionists the fol lowing question is it the duty of abolitionists under present circumstances to make an effort to liberate the slaves by force willits discussion be detrimental to the cause of liberty who will take the negative give us light yours for the slave fimtk iurrv from our own coir upon lent st lleliers

provinces ihe inhabitants of which not long since all but repudiated the term french and considering themselves as in truth they are distinct races chose to adopt different designations and to adhere to the denominations of their respective countries the tall atatmo lo fresh complexion the light hair and the clear blue eye of the norman bespeak a very different animal to the frenchman proper the old scandinavian blood has remained com  pantively free from admixture in the veins of j ihe peasant of normandy though the language has faded away utterly the bretons iare a branch of the great celtic race and as such are less akin to the true french than their norman neighbors their physical distinctions are not perhaps so marked butin temperament and in ideas they are even more adverse their language which in many secluded parts of the province remains almost unaltered is very different from the french under these circumstances you may judge that the mania which lias pervaded all france would if exhibited at all be se m in its mildest form in the vicinity of tlie northwestern coast the first aspect of republican france differs not greatly from that of france under the citizen

of distance when all personal leeling shall be dead and cold before them when they shall sound the social order we have prepared for them they will not receive lor excuse our prejudices ot birth our predilections of blood our family customs ourdeiicacy ot mind our fitness of position our vain regrets our weak dislikes they will ask of us if we have acted as men intelligent men prescient and free or j it we have lost in vain recriminations and in powerless sorrows the epoch which was given tous to regenerate social order and ascertain the depth tff political truth upon these foundations then we shall establish thus and in a few words the political symbol of a rational epoch whereon we are entering contine myself to laying it before you i it is for you to contrast it in each question of detail with the three principles which ought to govern and enlighten it i l iie limits of this letter do not permil rne upon auy of these articles either development discussion commentary each would be a book it net but a word i shall take them u again perhaps at a later period vutmß vin the attempt of the coup detat of ju lv was senseless and guilty then was error in the intention and violatior of sworn faith in the act consequent neither reason nor morality in the deed impartial conscience judges it as the event has judged it a coup detat i only moral and just when it is necessary and whensoever it is necessary ii is successful it is the first axiom o high politics the dynasty was thoroughly compromised in the chastisement inflicted by the deed the political punishment struck beyond the fault the fire oii popular indignation consumed the dry j and the green wood resistance in its perfect right for two days exceeded it on the third on that the violation oi another right commencesthe dynastic right its maintenance alone would have been moral was it possible in j the very excitement of action in the very fire of the fray history alone i knows and will say we are quite ignorant of it whatever the judgment delivered by a revolution in the heat of conflict in the partiality ol victory there are always two voices to protest more loudly against itone inheaven conscience one on earth history but it must be confessed herewith a mournful sincerity since two lights were alike violated and reversed in a private or social struggle con sciencelike historyattaches the strongest culpability to the aggressor and finds in the first violation if not the excuse at least the cause of tbe socond if in the appreciation of these two faults we are led to balance the popular right ogainst the dynastic right we find that they are only one and the same right the peoples right of safety the right of social necessity the one is pritnordially and eternally derived trom the other if the people violate it it without an invincible necessity they destroy it they are striking themselves violating themselves and by themselves are punished for their own crime but the event once accomplished is society to perish irremediably under the ruins of its dynasties are generations to transmit like a bloody heritage the vengeance of this right the redress of that wrong are men of reasou light and conscience to abstain in the absence of this right from their m st nnprescriptable law fro n their duties as citizens as children of the nation ot the age of humanity and to retire forever to their tents because one national chief is aubsii tuted for another no that would bethe commencement in them of an of fence graver than that against which their inertness would pretend to protest and be severe their bootless fidelity to a man to a recollection to a name to a duty that the fact would bare rendered fictitious would become infidelity more real and more culpable to themselves to the couutry the people to all mankiod for the purpose of boni oring the past they would betray the i present and the future the genera j lions would demand from them an account of their force voluntarily abau i doned by them in the eleroal social struggle in the progressive march ol ideas and of thiugs whoever does nut tight in that contest whoever does i not advance in that path is accountable for and an accomplice in the evil which is triumphant or the society i which stands still and besides if every one had the independent right of i the country to acknowledge in the dynasties which spread over history theone which appears to him to have the primordial right to his obedience the exclusive title to his affection what would become of the social world we should acknowledge as many aover eign as there are names in our calendar one would serve clovis another believe in pepin the absurdity of the i consequences proves the absurdity of the dogma common sense like morality like the invincible necessity of national existence leads us then to conclude that legitimacy the best of social objections is however nothing but a social convention a salutary tic f tion of right that it only has the i right so long as it has the fact or that it is striving to recover it that dynas i ties which possess the present do not possess the future that the royal races rise and descend in eternal rotation of human destinies like other races that the power expression and nroperty of the entire society is not alienated forever is not infeudated to an immortal family is not interminably transmitted as a fief of humanity that everything may perish that everything tnay change men races dominions names andi forms even of governments and empires but one single thing does not perish does not change is not pre scribedthe duty for each man for each citizen not to separate himself from his country nut to nullify himself in the nation not to protest alone agai ist a social necessity admitted by the fact for a social fact has also its logic and its consequences independent of its right but to serve the country the nation humanity in all the phases in all the conditions of his moveable and progressive existence the most j simple morality here becomes policy a single case is excepted that in which i divine law or the conscience may bein opposition with human laws this is the case which makes heroes or martyrs men greater than citizens for us then constitutional royalists men at once of fidelity and of liberty of morality and progress two duties are clearly written before our eyes theone a duty of conscienceto serve the country to march with the nation to think to speak to write act and fight with her the other a duty of honor which a special position an exceptional delicacy may impose on some few of usto hold aioof from the immediate action and the favors of government not to solicit its good graces not to deck ourselves with its gifts not to court its confidence not to adore victory not to glide with fortune from one palace to another not to repudiate our first worship the affections of our cradles not to carry to the feet of anew race consecrated albeit in our j eyes by necessity hearts still warm i with our devotion of yesterday to al race which exile shelters and which iw in kot pnnjikctir palace of the vicissitudes of the throne and of the returns of adversity even mourning sits well on grief without hope although morality does not reprovt i a contrary conduct when a political necessity instigates it this conduct altei j a devotion of fifteen years after bene i received perhapswould make ever i irtue suspected the past has it rights honor and gratitude may have their scruples to this rule there u but one single exception which confirms it by its rarity even by its improbability it is the case where the pr ince will require of us in the name of the country a service which no other can render him as well as we in this case honor all personal feelings must yield to patriotism a social feeling and consequently above the former sometime in these incalculable chances ol revolutions the prince may find him the first in this formidable exception king by the fact of his ncces s itv innocent of his elevation unhappy perhaps from his own grandur force of gk wit v is the moral world by elihu burritt in the material universe there is one grand royal law upon which hang all the laws that govern matter or motion that law the union and source of all the laws known to the physical world is the law of gravitation in its object operation and effect it is to the material world just what the royal law of love ia to the moral to every atom of matter in the universe it is the command andi the commaud shall he obeyed thou shall love the lord thy god with all thy j soul mind and strength and thy neigh boras thyself thou shall attach thy selfto his eternal throne with all thy capacity ot adhesion and draw with thee fellow atom towards the same centre since the world was made not a grain of sand not a drop of rain or dew n r a vicle of air has ever broken that law and there has been peace through all the peopled amplitudes of space pervading the whole universe with its socializing influences it attracts particle to particle planet to primary sun to sun system to system mooring all the creation of god around his throne the common centre of matter and of mind and there firm and peaceful that roval law holds them while they make music with the harmony of their motions singing as they revolve in their orbits which it peracribed them when eternity was young and which shall remain unaltered by a hair when eternity shall be old pon the almighty and omnipresent force of that law depends the destiov of worlds which geometry never measured the condition of beings oatstreeb mg the arithmetic of angels should ft release its hold on a single atom fioat mg along on the sunless disk of nonexistence trembling would run through all hose innumerable creationsand eigne of woe unutterable that all was jot suppose nowthat wotm human go eminent should undertake to suspend the operations or existence of this roy at law of the physical world and suppose that its puny arm could palzy that allpredtng concentrating force what mind could not conceive the wild catastrophe that would ensue through the material universe millions of suns would be quenched simultaneously in everlasting night all the worlds they lighted and led would crumble in their orbits into the minutest divisions of matter filling the whole irn  mensity of space with hostile atoms each at war with his fellow repelling its society and dashing on in its centrifugal madness to make confusion worse confounded all the beings that peopled those decomposed worlds would float promiscuous and dismembered over the black surges of the boundless chaos and not a throb of life or ray of light would beat or shine amid the ruins of the universe does any one doubt for a moment that all this and more than we can conceive of ruin would be the instantaneous consequence ol destroying the great law of gravitation but what is all this what to god and his moral universe is ail this disaster this wreck of matter and crab of worlds what this disruption of every vein of life and form of beauty what is this to that other and more dreadful catastrophe which war would produce when it reaches up and essays to paralyze with its iron hand the great law of love the law of gravitation in the moral world which attracts and centres around the heart of god all the hearts that beat with spiritual existence amid the decompositions of the material universe every undying spirit would be safe tram the general ruin nor verge a hair from its moral orbit nor be jostled from its centripetal tendency towards its great source and centre but in that other act of immeasurable iniquity j man would consign the moral world toa chaos infinitely more appalling than i that which would involve the material universe should he strike from exis j tence the law of gravity he would sever every ligament of attraction that attaches heart to heart spirit to spirit angel to angel and all created beings to god he would set the universe on fire with malignant passions on whose red billows contending spirits once blessed now damned would thrust at each others existence and curse themselves and god that act would put a sword iu every angels hand and every harp in heaven with horrid discord would summon the frenzied and battling seraphs to mutual and deathless slaughter it would blast the foliage of lifes fair tree turn the crystal river into burning pitch and line its banks with fighting fiends hate malignant and quenchless would
