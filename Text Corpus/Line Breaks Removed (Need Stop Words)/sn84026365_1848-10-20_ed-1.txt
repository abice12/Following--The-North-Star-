abolition of slavery ohio city sept messrs dougiass delaiiy there are those who steadily maintain that congress has power over slavery wherever it exists and who will preserve their principles uncontaminated sy proslavery parties and proslavery j influence and there are those who alsoj uniformly contend for the desired re forms in the state and federal governments as well as the freedom of the public lands and i am pleased to reckon gerrit smith as one of that number my views in regard to what measures should constitute a broad and permanent platform for a republican party having for its basis such engrossing objects are briefly stated in my letter of the ith inst to mr brown and published this day in the spirit of freedom to the th th and th articles of which i beg leave more especially to call your attention section of article of the federal constiiution reads no person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof escaping into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may he due on this clause apologizers for all the physical social moral religious and political evils of slavery principally rest for the coritiuance and justification of slavery it was i believe this clause only which daniel webster cited in the mississippi case it is the one if i mistake not and the only one by which seamen apprentices and the like escaping from one state into another are recovered andbrought back criminals are also recovered believe in conformity with this clause it must then be applicable to white persons as well as colored both are therefore placed on the same footing go far as slavery is concerned and therefore chattel slavery or properly in man cannot be maintained by this provision it is well to observe itlso that they are to he delivered up to the party to whom such service or labor may be due which implies indebtedness or obligation to the government under the penalty of administrated law applying it for arguments sake to the slave it must be shown from some other clause in the constitution that he has the to sell himselfand secondly from some reliable evidence that he did sell himself to the party claiming him or thirdly that black men and white men may he recovered from any state brought hack and held accountable under the constitution for civil debt it should also be observed that whomsoever it may refer to their personality is distinctly recognized hence cannot he regarded under the law as chattels nothing more nor less than man or woman another clause in the constitution is the only remaining one on which proslavery men hang for the perpetuity of slavery article i sec representatives and direct taxes shall he apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons including those bound to service for a term of vears and excluding indians not taxed threefifths of all other persons the north star that this refers to slaves when it speaks of threefifths of all other persons can only be supposed we know slavery existed at that time but there is no positive enactment for slavery in the language and what there is that refers to man as a beast or to property in a person can only be inferred or doubtfully implied and the sentence itself is constructed in much obscurity its tone evasive and guarded lest there might be something in it that would really express so disgraceful a thing as property in man it was not therefore intended that it should be expressed hence the concurrence of a majority with madison that slavery would soon be abolished and that the idea of property in man should not be admitted into the constitution there was therefore no enactment for slavery and the most favorable construction that ean be put upon the clause for slavery is the implication that until congress should abolish it threefifths of all the tersovs should be added in making out the apportionment of representatives and direct taxes slavery and the perpetuity of it are not nominated in the bond and in the clause cited the framers did more against than for it for while they were thus ambiguous in any expression of slavery if reference was made to slaves at all they have in this clause also openly avowed and recognized on the other hand perhaps intentionally the colored mans personality the provision directs the number of representatives not their duties and the manner of apportioning direct taxes either with or without the existence of slavery there is still another view of the subject no less important grant for a moment that the constitution doubtfully referred to slaves there is no provision in the constitution for perpetual slavery colored persons born after the constitution went into effect could not therefore come under any reference in the constitution to them if it could claim any as slaves the claim could apply to those only who were then living whatever therefore may have been the intention of some of the framers ol the constitution if there cannot be some other provisions than those i have noticed that will support slavery it is not beyond the constitutional province of congress to abolish it property in persons i hardly need repeat is not mentioned in that instrument and unless it be clearly expressed no implication for it is admissible in an action at law for the replevin of a black horse if the plaintiff in the writ describes a white one the action cannot be maintained however elearly he may be able to prove he intended to describe a black one so if some members who assisted in framing the constitution intended to describe apiece of property but carelessly allowed the word persons to he inserted in its place posterity cannot complain at the oversight however much it is on the side of humanity blackstone would say further even on the trial of a cause it is better for ninetynine guilty persons to go free than punish one innocent man and if any inan should think the constitutional provisions at all doubtful in its description of property in man the slave must have the benefit of that doubt unless then as it has been hinted there shall be some other provision for that insanity which contradicts the universally endeared words of the immor i tal jetlerson that all men have rights such as life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the subject must be referred to congress to decide whether the evil shall exist under its future action or not and our representatives and senators must bear the responsi bility i courts of justice may decide upon the constitutional rights and another decision may reverse it whatever may have been the precedents and those rights in the constitution of the slave by the great lawgiver are as inalienable but let us urge on the movement that will note the time when our courts will be courts of justice and their decisions in conformity with the constitution which was never intended to know any impartiality or to rocoguize interpretations that will admit of any inequality it would be almost a wrong anda shame to view it differently the policy of slating a time as the furthest period for the existence ol slavery by the government in the district of columbia and in the states may not be altogether uupliilosophical its bearings upon the country its influence upon the slaves themselves for it w ill be pretty sure to get to them in some way or other may not be any detriment and it can work no harm to the slaveholder to expect the abolition of slavery at the time stated would it not therefore be well enough for the lands acquired by conquest not tobe very much meddled w ith before the consummation of an event so freighted with the deepest interest to the country and one so devoutly to be wished no apology is necessary from me for asking your views on the subject at an early moment i am dear sir yours for progression e h sanford land rkfomebs the land reformers of kiyria ohiocomprising lfio out of voterswe learn from a friend just arrived from that place are strong for the buffalo nominees mr van atnringe who attended the convention while he would have preferred a more definite resolution on land reform expressed his satisfaction with theone we adopted our platform hi broad enough for them all to stand on amer freeman right is or no sextruth is of no color god is the father of us all and all we are brethren elections hot for emancipation the st louis reveille says since the barnburners have assumed a position as a party we have had more abolitionism talked in missouri than ever before it now has a more pleasing name and as free soilers many who before indulged their abolition notions in quiet now openly avow their sentiments in favor of emancipation we shall not be surprised if in a few more years the agitation of abolitionism becomes transferred from the north to the south nor shall we there are thousands and tens of thousands in the south who will eagerly sqise hold of the free soil movement to urge forward emancipation striking a line from the mississippi along the southern borders of tennessee on the west and on the borders of south carolina on the cast full a third of the white population of the slave states are opnosed to slavery this opposition they nave not been able heretofore to manifest but now when under a new name ant upon well settled principles a party has sprung up which resists the extension of slavery these southern emancipationists will have an opportunity to act and will embrace it heartily ah over the south the extension ol slavery and its perpetuation are held indentical no planter or politician doubts this point if slavery be girt around with free institutions if a limit be put to it if public opinion and the law affirm that we shall not have an inch more of slave territory the curse which blasts and blackens the south will die out it cannot be made to pay and when that is apparent or brought home to the pockets of the slaveholders a blow will be struck at every slave which will kill it in a few years the free soil movement then viewed as an emancipation move is one ol the greatest events of modern times what in past years has kept the south so united and made it so fierce against emancipation the bitterness and wide spread opposition to abolitionism a bitterness and opposition felt alike al the north and the south and manifested in both by a violence as deep as universal but this cause ceased the moment the present party had its being the south have felt this consequently from st louis to new orleans and from baltimore to wilmington north carolina we hear of able inen of masses of the people uniting with this movement or preparing to do soand ol papers and public men defending and debating free soil interests the gleam of the blaze which is soon to burst out is seen shooting up all over the south and soon the flame will grow so strong and burn so steady as to kindle afresh the same spirit which animated the slave states before and during the revolu tion that great event gave us our freedom the constitution was intended to consecrate and secure that freedom but lust of power in the south and lust of gain in the north clouded the spirit of the revolution when at the com raencment of this century a new generation came on the scene of action hour by hour and year by year the slave power grew until at last with the insolence of power and the contumely engendered by a long admitted control over the government it has sought to tread into the dust every principle of the constitution and exert the whole weight of the government foi i the atrocious purpose of extending slavery for once it has overshot the i mark the north will not submit tc this goading in human tyranny the moan of the slave shall not float on the free winds of the sierra madre or mingle in the roar of the surges of the pacific and in this determination the slave region not dependant on the cotton or sugar culture will unite will unite cautiously and by degrees at firstbut heartily and with thorough earnestness at last and thus be the means of making free in fact as well as in theory our glorious land for the friends of our free soil whal a motive is there for effort it is theii act which shall carry out and complete the great drama of the revolution it is their act which will break as il they were brittle glass the bonds of the black man and at the same time give life and growth and hope and thought to the enslaved and oppressed white la borers of the south let them not falter let not a man among then shrink away from the contest though il shall cover them with dust and beat when such a prize is to be won lei them one and all remember as did theii fathers that universal freedom is theii aim and that for it they should be ready willing and eager to toil day in and day out until this aim he accom plishedcia globe convention op colored people our private letters from cleveland ohio speak moat favorably of the character and doings of the convention ol colored people recently held in that city the official account of the conventions proceedings we have not seen we know not that it has been published but the address to the colored people of the united states adopted by the convention we have had the pleasure of reading in the north star it is an excellent document it oogbl to be read by or to every colored person in the country we will add that il ought to he accompanied by the address to the name class of persons pre paied by gerrit smith and sent forthby the buffalo convention of last june the muwe are sure we shall not be rochester n y friday october accused of intending any disparagement of the cleveland addressis comparably the beat thing of the kind we ever saw both of these addresses urge the people of color to extend the variety ol their employments which are now quite limited to blacking boots shaving and other peculiarly menial avocations it is however less the fault of the colored people than that of the whites that the variety of their employments is so limited the infernal prejudice cherished by our nice against the african race has operated to exclude the latter almost wholly from what are deemed honorable employments we know hardly a machine shop ia the country in which it would be possible for a colored youth to eater as aa apprentice or a colored adnk to find employment either we doubt not would be hooted from the lowell machine shop though possessing the mechanic cal ingenuity and dexterousness of a moody or a fulton and of all low ells multitudinous factories we presume there is not one in which the presence of a colored person would be tolerated even if he would work for nothing and board himself the same or very nearly the same might be said of wellnigh all the places in which other trades are plied but the land is open to them the land has just as much respect for a black man as it has for a white one let our colored brethren betake themselves to it they ought to have access to all they can cultivate or at leas to so much as may be necessary to procure them a comfortable subsistence as to the gospel itself without money and without price and they will have when our government shall come to be righteous enough to realize the doctrines enunciated by the last buffalc convention but onethe cleveland address has anothei good suggestion which it strongly urges on the regard of our colored friends il is that they ought to be abolitionists and take an active interest in the cause of abolitionism we question if a fiftli part of the free colored people are abolitionists though we fancy as many as ninetenths of the slaves are such in the address of gerrit smiths already referred to fivesixths of those who voted at the last presidential election are charged with having bestowed their suffrages on slaveholders and their abettors so that practically it were better if not a man among them all had ever possessed the statutory or constitutional right to vote it is by right voting probably more than by any other single process of action that the colored people are to win the rights o which they are now plundered a single vote rightly cast were wortli more to their cause than a thousand windy speeches about the rascally wrongs inflicted on them lynn pio neer tiie slate powerpoli ticaly it appeared by the last census that the number of slaves in the u states was estimating ten slaves to one master there were only slaveholders of the legal voters of the united states the slaveholders are about as to  threefifths of is which divided by the present ratio of representation makes the exact number of members on the floor of the house of representatives in congress sent there under section d of the constitution to represent the slave power the senate has a veto on every law and as onehalf of that body are slaveholders it follows of course that no law can be passed without their conseht no bill has passed the senate nor a treaty been ratified since the organization of the government but by the votes of slaveholders appointments are made by the president with the consent of the senate and of course the slaveholders have and always have had a veto on every appointment in consequence of the peculiar apportionment of presidential electors among the states and the operation of the rue of federal numbers whereby for the purpose of estimating the representative population five slaves are counted as three while men most extraordinary results are exhibited at every election for president in the election of the electors chosen were of these igb were from the free aod were from the slave states the popular vote in the free states was or one elector to  voters the popular vote in the slave states was or one elector to votes south carolina had electors chosen by the legislature these are deducted in the calculation even this disproportion enormous as it is is greatly aggravated in regard to particular states new york ge votes and had electors virginia maryland and north carolina gave votes and had  electors ohio gave votes and had  electors georgia kentucky delaware alabama louisiana and arkansas gave votes and had elector daring yearsand six presidential elections the south east electoral rotes and only of them for northern candidates in the election of free states had electors and gqjre votes elector to votes while slave states had electors and gave votes one elector to votes the rule of fedrml numbers confined by the constitution to the apportionment of representatives has been extended by the influence of slaveholders to other and very different subjects thus the distribution among the states of the surplus reveoues and of the proceeds of the public lands were made according to this same iniquitous role of the presidential terms have been filled with slaveholders no northern man has been allowed to serve more than one term from the adoption of the constitution to june there were elections of president of the senate pro ten of these the slave states had go and the free states previous to do northern man had held the office far yesn while the senate was equally divided the slaveholders almost always contrived to secure a presiding officer of the who bad filled the office of secretary of state up to the slave states had ten the free states have usually furnished the men for the army and navy and the slave states the principal part of the officers antislavery almanac for antislavery in the south the examiner published at louisville ky speaks as follows of the growing antislavery feeling of the south we are acquainted with a mississippi planter the proprietor of a large number of slaveswho is as earnestly opposed to tho extension of slavery as the greatest curse that can be inflicted on a community as any other person of our acquaintance we are intimately acquainted with another mississippi planter the proprietor of more than a hundred slaves who has been a warm politician from his youth up who refuses to support either of the presidential candidates for whom electoral tickets have been formedin his state because neither of them is pledged to sustain the wilmot proviso y r e have but a limited acquaintance with mississippi cotton planters but we have no doubt that a large number of them are as heartily opposed to all measures which contemplate either the extension or the perpetuation of slavery as we ourselves are our acquaintance and friendship embrace a very large number of kentucky slaveholders and there are very few of them who regard slavery with the least degree of favor the newspapers published in the most northern slaveholding states denounce northern abolitionists but at the same time refrain from all remarks that would indicate a belief that slavery is anything but a positive evil it is not politic to publish opinions adverse to slavery in slaveholding states and hence the antislavery sentiment in those states is not represented in the newspapers we are in the habit of seeing nearly every newspaper published in kentucky and if we had no other means of becoming acquainted with the public sentiment of the state than that afforded by these newspapers we should conclude that the subject is attracting no attention among our fellow citizens but we know that such a conclusion would be thoroughly erroneous for there ia scarcely a neighborhood in the state in which slavery is not exciting much discussion and in which they who are hostile to its continuance among us are not more numerous than those who advocate its perpetuation perhaps the newspaper which is the most intensely proslavery of all newspapers is the charlestons c mercury a correspondent inspeaking of extending slavery into our newly acquired mexican territories says i know that there are those in our midst who do not hesitate in private to declare their honul conviction that they see no valid objection to excluding slavery from the territories and there are some of them strong minded men themselves slaveholders and native c barleatooiaoi frwtu the litvrator the new york tribune mr greeley has at length run up the black flag with the whig raw head and bloody bones upon us sooty fold to the masthead of the tribune that unaccountable craft has keen cruizing about wuh no distinctive bunting to mark her

the clay whigs wished to put in his gripe their leader acknowledges a reluctant allegiance to the whig king d facto while he avows that his heart is still loyal to the whig king de jure bat uis an ungracious homage at best and one that can commend it to little gratitude it is but lipservice that he pays to the ugly service of the whigs while his heart is for from it he takes this stop with no new conviction excepting the impoesibilitf of defeating cam without electing taylor did mr greeley really suppose that clay would have bad any chance had he keen willing to stand and yet would ben

arguments ever used in support of gen taylor or any other man commend us to the following which we give iu the ipriwma verba of mr greeley the whig party faulty as it is embodies most of the temperate and measured easily measureda gill cup would hold it all antislavery sentiment of the country and the fact that it has nominated a louisiana sugar planter for president whose opinions on this subject do not accord with its own preponderating convictions constrains and will constrain it to more decisive and earnest hostility to slavery extension heard ye ever the like of that mr greeley is no fool but it must be acknowledged he is excellent at cooking of fiapdoddu or the stuff they feed fools on the daily advertiser and the other old whig papers give but a lenten entertainment to this eleventhhour conversion they evidently have but little faith in deathbed repentances we suppose that in their secret souls they had beerv wishing him to go for yan buren the staple of mr greeleys antislavery was never anything to brag of but he has drawn out his thread so fine as to make him pass with the ignorant including the bulk of whig editors as an eminent manufacturer of the article that it was good for little is now proved by its shocking bad wear but he has got his name up he may not have been guilty of the sin of antislavery but he has incurred the scantlal and that is quite as bad as everybody knows aswell as yoricks host at paris his accession will be of no material service to the party the slaveholders regard him as an abolitionist and his joining the taylorfaction will do it more harmat the south than it will do it good at the north the tribune has been unlucky it has reversed the true maxim of wise politicians it has not served god and yet it has offended the

indian war and the time gen jackson was in command of the troops in this city pierre then known to the citizens as a brave honest trustworthy man was appointed by jackson patroon or captain of a government transport to carry provisions to the troops stationed at fort montgomery or fort mims and to those in camp near the present site of mount vernon the udertaking was perilous as at that time the whole country was infested with hostile indians and hut a few persons could be found to take charge of an expedition attended with so great a risk of life pierre was however successful and reached the troops in safety with a supply of provisions c in during the ravages of the yellow fever pierre rendered essential service to the city by taking care of the sick aud protecting the property of the eitizens he and one or two others were compelled to act as nurses aud sextons the sickness and mortality was so great that it was difficult to have the patients properly eared forthree four and five bodies were taken at a time in a cart and deposited in a pitas a matter of course all who could getaway precipitately fled from the pestilence leaving their property in charge of pierre he daily opened the stores fr the purpose of ventilation and securing the goods from damage on the return of the merchants iu the fall they found everything safe and as some appreciation for his services and honesty a subscription was taken up at once for his emancipation and also to purchace hima horse and draysince that period his avocation as a drayman has enabled bun to support his family quite handsomely and at the same time amass a snug title property pierre until within a year or two past enjoyed throughout his long life unintempted health aod always seemed happy and contented no person

southern coadjutors have quite another doctrine on the subject and by that they will doubtless be guided whether or not it be true as a matter of constitutional law the following heads of a decision

limited extent and no positive law prohibiting it be shown h will be deemed legal it is not the policy of the slave states to favor the liberation of negroes it thus appears that in the opinion of southerners nothing more is required to legalize slavery theft to prove its existence even to a extent and to prove this the slaveholder ins nothing more to do but to emigrate thither with his slaves and of course the proof is forthwith apparentj d public sentiment in california the california star comes out decidedly against the toleration of slavery there by congress it says that the people are all against it the mining fever will also create such an emigration of froe white labor as we believe will settle the question against the extension of slavery a freeman at the mines would do more work than the slave and this is well understood the star expresses some fear that congress may establish slavery there but this is absurd jn tho judgment of uie american people congress has no more right to make a slave than a king the alxive paragraph is from the milwaukee wisconsin a strong cass and butler paper and it looks very well and rational when by itself the writer must either be grossly hypocritical or miserably lacking of discernment llow any one can pretend that lie is opposed to slavery and yet support the claims of general cass a a fit caudidate for the presidency is altogether a mystery says cass in his nicholson letter for if the relation of master and servant slave may be regulated or annihilated by legislation so may the relation of husband and wife of parent and cliihl and of any other condition which our institutions and the habits of our society recognize what can lie plainer than this what could show more satisfactorily than this the animus of the democratic candidate he would no more interfere with the relation between master and slave than he would interfere with the relation of parent and child this is w hat he means to say and it is sufficiently explicit though it is rather hard to conceive how he hit upon the idea that the relation between master and slave and parent and child are parallel cases auy one who takes a moment to consider must see ata gance that the two cases are just as far sti i possible from being similar the one is in accordance with or rather is itself a law of nature the other is in direct contravention of that law with just as much j reason the writer might have said if the relation between the owner of property and the thief who steals that property from him may be regulated or annihilated by legislation so may the relation between the sun and light between the clouds and rain the one is not more palpably a non seqttitnr than is the other shallow indeed must they be who gulp down such

in frout of the precession was a large wagon in w hich were thickly stowed several womeq and children this was followed by jbrtythree men and boys walking several of them chained together the whole under the charge of a man on horseback this miserable spectacle excited the honest indignation of our citizens who regarded it as a direct insult offered io them and the day and the hour we hare heard several of our most respectable citizens speak of this outrage on the feelings of a christian community all of whom concurred in reprobating it in the strongest possible terms and yet such spectacles are the necessary adjuncts of the system of slavery wherever it prevails they will be seen we have never heard any one speak of the slave traders who are engaged in the internal slave trade without denouncing them and their accursed traffic they are every where looked upon as unworthy of the least rcsjicct and their society is shutined by all ami yet men are found who for a base love of money will consign themselves and families to universal contempt and others are fu nd who for the sake of a few pitiful dollars will sustain these men in their traffic by soiling their slaves to them we

with a mean and contemptible creature from kentucky of the name of carpenter who calls himself a lawyer he was undoubtedly a slaveholder and vie by hircslnp for he certainly lacked the necessary brain to acquire propertv by hi own exertion this slaveholder and an old man quite as bad as himself held a conversation in the hearing of myself and other passengers the substance of which propose to give though old it may not be uninteresting slavery was affirmed to be a patnarehal institution the negroes were descendants of ham a curse was ujon them iwd had ordained them to b slaves caste was of divino origin the old man said that the negroes were a distinct race approximating to human beings onlv in form but without intellect and without morality that they were evidently intended by god to bo a servile race to confirm this miserable stuff the old man cited the sayings of some author whose name i do not remember on anatomy who had founded an argument on the resemblance of the bones f a monkey with those pf a negro and that the negro race was merely a connecting link between the human and the brute creation in the midst of this profound speculations ab nit th origin and relations of our abused race a shallowpate i priest but little superior to the slaveholder in point of intellect came to th rescue lie slid he thought his friend from kentucky mistaken in respect to the

ever heird speak in public he is no speaker at i all but the veriest negro storyteller to this the servile priest answered only that he was oppose to slavery hut in the same breath said he was no abolitionist here some one made allusion to the notorious wholesale amalgamation carried on bv slaveholders w ith their slaves which seemed to cut the slaveholder to the quick and we all looked to see how ho would answer it strange to say he owned up the whole j corn and said that the same was true of the patriarchs lie said that colored women were not like white women the former were destitute of virtue or intelligence and were fit onle to perpetuate the race ami never could be qualified for society what w hile man said lie would inury one of them here for the benefit of the ladies i stated

sympathy of inos of the passengers ever yours for equal rights w foster london ohio oct th sl t sir take the liberty of requesting a short space in the columns of the north star for the purpose of saying a few words on the great question of human freedom the great and absorbing question of the day i have recently attended a large number of political meetings of botli the old political parti es and have heard numerous speeches made by some of their ablest meneven the great senator corwin the most difficult of all questions with which they have to deal is the question of slavery limitation or slavery extension it is amusing to see how they sweat over it senator corwin in behalf of the taylor party seems to take this part of the work under his own care and sad havoc he tnak s of it he contradicts himself and seems not to know it he declared in his speech a few days ago that old zack gen taylor was not pledged to anything and in the same speech labored to show that he was pledged against using the veto power the whole speech was as weak as water and by fat the feeblest effort which have heard from any slump orator during this canvass it is certainly cause for rejoicing on our part to witness the extent to which the subject of slavery and liberty enters into the politics of the day we want to sec the report of the doings of our convention at cleveland ours for the oppressed d jenkins proscfptton in travelling mr editor sirhaving some knowledge of the position which you hold in relation to the subject of proscription on account of color i have taken the liberty to send you a few lines on this subject for the benefit of pnch as may ba disposed to withhold their patronage from a man who on account of his evtrme dislike not to say his inveterate ha ued against color stands solemnly pledged to proscribe illtreat and insult colored people whemver they favor him with it having occasion a hort lime since to pass np the canal from lock port to buffalo i chanced to alijiht oji board of the opposition but francis commanded by capt schuyler j soon aur we left the landingplace at lockport tie beil rung fr passengers to settle for their passage inmyturu stepped up to the table there being no office on the boat and inquired imw much the fare was to huffiilo i was informed by the captain that without dinner and i fifty cents with paid the fifty and j requested the capam to give me a dinner ticket hut he said that did need one as he should remember that had paid for dinner nothing fun her of importance occurred until the hour arrived when all thing i were in readiness as u usually rise case the ladies were all seated at the table when a general rush of the passengers eusued and the table was quickly tilled hut as i was in teeble health and quite weak did uoi attempt to gain admission to the first table but still coiumned on deck second table was ready the rush tor a was about tbs same and i still contin cd u keep my at on deck after the sec j ond table bad dined and the crowd was over i went down and took my seat hr the eabre imping to get a seat at the third without difficulty w hen due notice should be gives dot you can judge what was my surprise when as attempted to take my seat at the table found my arm fast is the firm grasp of ai stout colored man who very unceremoniously informed me that i could not dine at that tabic i inquired the reason and was told that there were yet white people to eat and it was against their rules to seat colored persons ati the table with white people i again inquired if i had not paid as much for my fare as they i had hut was promptly informed that it was useless for me to argue or contend as i could not ba permitted to take a seat at the table while there were white people to eat i finding myself thus shamefully insulted anj deprived of my rights fir which i had paid as dear as any man on board left the cabin in disgust and resumed my sat on deck to await the setting of the negrotabic at which i had no disposition to eat after the insults received when within a few miles of buffalo a favor aide opportunity presented itaelf and the following conversation took place burch captain i believe i paid you fur my dinner today did i not captain starting up with considerable apparent surprise you did sir b l think then it is nothing more than just that you should refund my money as i have been driven from the table by your steward and not permitted to have privilege c starting np from his seat with increased surprise not had any dinuer at the same time handing me back my changenot had any dinner that is very strange b that is just what i thought too captain and i wish now to inquire of you sir whether it is a rule of yours not to suffer colored persons to sit down at table because there may be white people eating or whether it was the exercise of undue authority on the part of the steward c changing from his apparent surprise and affecting a degree of sanctity which hadit been real might have become a better man you know that white people have an objection to sit at the table with colored and you know it will not do to offend those from whom we get our living to gratify a few colored people b then you would give me to under i stand do you that however respectable acolj ored mans appearance may be whatever may be his intelligence or his moral worth so long as he is a colored man he cannot be per j milted to eat at the table with white people on your boat c changing from his affected sanity to give vent to the spontaneous effusions of his evil heart his face flushed and his eyes sparkling with the indignant fire that burned j within thus nerved for his important work proceeded to answer i have had many colored passengers of as respectable appearance as you are bat i never had one to say as much to me on this subject before in my life and now i wish it to be distinctly understood once for all that no colored man can ever be permitted to set down at my table to cat with white people thus it will be seen that capt schuyler stands pledged to proscribe and insult every colored man that seeks a passage ou his boat permit me then to say in conclusion that itis the duty of every one who is true to his interest and true to his color to withhold from such a man his patronage till with repenting tears he shall wash out that foul stain from

boke the amount of the purchase money but she would not consent and said it was her duty and wish to remain with mr and mrs boke according to her contract which was until her wages should amouut to the purchase money and interest the object of thus writing her history is this her eldest child and daughter grace was recently sold to a slavetrader in virginia and would have been carried to the

rowdies wen to the schoolhouse took the teacher out of the school carried him to the public whipping post at georgetown and unmercifully lacerated the poor fellows back and only let him escapo upon a promise to teach no more a negro servant of judge wootton happened to say that they would not have served him so when the mob went into the judges yard took him out to the said whipping post and lashed him also unmercifully the judge nearing of the matter stepped to his yard gate to expostulate with the wretched mob wlien he was threatened to be served in like manner and the judge even thought it prudent to send an apology to the uiob for even speaking in behalf of his servant if this be true and we have it from most respectable authority are such mobocrats republicans are they fit

deepest sympathies of the people on its side this is so apparent that it paralyzes the efforts of the more ambitious placemen of the other partiesthey see very plainly that if not now it will ultimately absorb all other question in the free states and that those who resist it must do so at the sacrifice of their political prospects mr alhoun declared recently that the party in the free

which we published sem i time since it says that indications which led to the discovery is a sunken trench upon the t line of vein which being drifted into disclosed a mass of native copper lying in this vein estimated to weigh about seven ton the remains of large timbers were blind by which this had cv idently been propped and beneath it were several cart loads of ashes and cinders showing that the miners had endeavored to reduce the mass by fire several of the implements used in the mining operations were found consisting of stone hammers a chisel and agad of copfcr the perfect state of the point of the latter seems to indicate that a process of hardening the metal was known for the hammer end was most battered with the copper of this were some large particles of silver this chisel is ingeniously constructed so as to admit a handle no iron iuj strurnent was discovered that the mining operations were conducted to a greater extent than is practised by any existing tribe of indians is aparent from the fact that the trench sunk upon the vein extends more thau a mile in length the accumulation of earth in the trench concealed the depth of the workings except in the small part reopened but here the depth was found to be twenty four feet and the width eight feet similar trenches exist tn the neighborhood which were traced for several miles not the least interesting part of the discovery is the evidence of the great antiquity ofthe workings large trees were growing upon the earth that had accumulated in the digging one of i them directly over the mass of copper proved to be years old beneath it were trunks of trees that had preri ously decayed or fallen in and the depth of soil that had accumulated upon i this antique furnace was feet this mine is about four miles east j from the mass of copper which was removed from its place a few years i since and is now in the national cabinet at washington these mementoes of ancient aboriginal industry are deserving of more thana passing notice they may be considered as addiug to the proof that long before the discovery of america a race existed on this continent among whom the arts had reached a higher grade than with the wandering tribes that have succeeded the indians now living in this region know nothing ofthe people by whom or the time when these operations were undertaken they evince a concentrted effort which docs not now characterize their feeble efforts in the arts it is somewhat singular that among a people so observant and persevering the use of iron remained so wholly unknown since some of the ores which exist in vast abundance and upon the surface in the carp river region are found to be easily reduced toa valuable steel by the heat of a common forge a knowledge ofthe use o iron might have
