salem witchcraft slavery in the district ac washington june that old salem witchcraft what a strange business it was how it deluded some of th brightest minds of the time the sincere lover of humanity looks back to the scenes ofj that period with deep pity i observe of lute the editor of u boston paper has favored his readers with long disquisitions on the subject he is au aro observer of human conduct and dare say had some good reason for showing up attlie present time the cheating and enchantment that so sorclv afflicted the early puritans wish i could enlist his quick sight to ferrei out the witchcrafts and his effective pen to expose them to the public observation which still lurk in this community it is a matter ot doubt in y wind whether old otton mather aid his associates were more completely cheated by appearances than many people among us are at ibis very hour as to the fact of infernalpossession or bedevilment am sure the certainty md advantage are all on our side the present time over the miserable victims of suspicion persecution and the gailows in l in that case there was little or no satisfactory evidence of bedevilment in ours it is most abundant and conclusive let me jot down here and there a fact as it turns up in the run of a few davs not long since at baltimore my business led me to the wharl just as the philadelphia boat was about to tart there were present from twelve to twenty intelligent well behaved finely dressed colored people chiefly belonging to philadelphia as learned they were on to attend a genteel wedding and were now about to take the steamboat on their return as a bridal party with the new married pair could they go to the captains office like other decent people and buy their tickets before one of them could tep upon tiie boat they must go to an old warehouse and there have some white man known to the person in attendance to vouch for the freedom ol each one of them by name the re corti is made up they then are allowed to go on board and pay as much money as anvbodv it seems to me this i a strange flourish of republican sensibility recollect a few years ago in canada how strongly disposed i felt to light rather than endure the impertinent inquiries of a customhouse officer about my residence name age occupation destination and the like wouldnt it sorely puzzle the old witches to make u satisfactory choice between the despotism of kingcraft and the despotism of democracy for one if my rights mus be trampled down let it be under the iron heel ol horan grand monarch lar rather than through the petty vexations imposed bv lha spawn l vulgar insolence and tyranny but tins outrage upon decency and public law is practiced of course for the security and special benefit ol slavery it is intended to guard one of its exposed outposts a week ago last monday morning i look the cars at baltimore for washington while standing on the platform where passengers step mto theran rev john f cook of this city came up and entered into conversatioi with me he had been to bahitnor to preach the day beforewhile talk mg we advanced a few steps wind brought us opposite the jim crow carin winch were seated a clerk or runne from donovans alavepen with liv lavas a young man and woman tin the north star exact picture of despondency and desolation and three children whoseemei satisfied with the noveky of the scene about them these slaves weie or their wav to alexandria to be sent thence overland by bruin mill tc the far southern market while chatting with me mr cook was obliged ti jump on board tins car with the slaves and the wretch having them in charge as it was off upon taking my seat ira car which usually carries the well dressed and orderly sort of travelers observed a colored git i with a pale puling little white child in her arms crowded into a seat with a young w hite rnan apparently the father ot the child the child mad itsetf conspicuous bv noise and awtuesi for a time hut was at last soothed by its colored nurse of course the passengers were crowded close around the colored girl and no one took offence certainly i make no complaint now who is john f cook n by was not lie in the same car with ine wei are personal inends john h cook isa well educated man and a thorough gentleman in all his deportment heis the minister of a highly respectable presbyterian congregation in this city and a the head of a school as well trained and flourishing as any other ins washington his unblemished life and integrity of character command for him universal respect and confidence it would probably be very difficult to select a man in this community more devoted and m every way more useful he happens to range somewhere about j halfway between the pure anglosaxon and the doomed race lliat excludes him from the respectable car while slavery thrusts the poor simple dull colored girl into it more properly and truly speakingslavery is the tyrant who presides over this whole business it banishes mr cook with his intelligence and refinement to the jim crow car to brood over the gross insalt to his manhood and the outrage to his people in the person of the helpless slaves while it puts into the richest seat the simple coarse black nurse to the mortification and annoyance of those who are compelled to witness the transaction i shall like to have the boston editor or anybody else show if it can be done in w hat respect the theory of witchcraft adopted aryl acted upon by cotton mather and the dupes ol his times is one whit more absurd extravagant foolish or wicked than the theory of human nature and relations extensively received and apj plied amone us at the present time as to its fatai effects that old witchcraft delusion was confined and comparatively inconsiderable it was the blindness and effervescence of an hour our dej lusion is awful in the extent of its havoc in the depth of its cruelties it sweeps away at a blow the center column of christs gospeljhc oneness of the human race in origin powj ers and destiny a poor woman was put into jail about a week since it is the jail thatj cost the people ot the united states nearly or quite sixty thousand

com jelled to give her up heaven only mows these few slight incidents will help you to see n little how we live nnd yret on in this part of the country have we any occasion to dig up old superstitions and witchcraft or may we find full occupation in exposing and combating those that remain is it not enough to make one sick at heart to see at this noon of the xlxth christian century piracy the sanctioned usage of society how long shall right is of no sextruth is of no irgod is the father of us all and all we arf brethren we grow weary and taint in looking i before those who have prayers to offer testimonies to maintain ballotboxes tc i wield will shake themselves from slotli hand stupidity assert their sovereign majesty and swear before israel and the sun these enormities shall nc longer bs tolerated i there is a strong disposition on the part of slaveholders in this district tc i sell their slaves they anticipate the agitation of congress with the question of emancipation ii they can sell at high market prices the smartest and most valuable of their slaves ami get congress to pay tor the old and refuse ones when they must give them up that will all be decidedly rkver nd

which crowd upon the mind and heart when through the medium of a letter inviting your serious attention your historyas a people is more immediately brought before the writers consideration the wrongs which you have endured at the hands of the proud and savage white man iiave been so deep so aggravated and so long continued that no reflecting and benevolent christian cancontemplate them without

the immediate object of the letter which is now submitted to f your indulgent and candid notice to address the free colored population resident in the united states upon any other subject than one either di i rectly or indirectly connected with slavery would in my m nd be an unwise attempt to direct their attention from that which ought to be and which thereforewe trustis the incessant theme of their private thoughts their public gatherings and their closet devotions it is then upon the abolition of americas national crime that i would wish to offer a few observations earnestly and respectfully urging a slight claim to your consideration of them as founded upon a sincere deep iand righteous desire on the part of a britou to witness the final triumph of liberty over a sin so tremendous so utterly viituekilling as that of slavery in what i may utter that shall be right and to the purpose many others as before remarked are fully prepared to symapathize in what maybe deemed useless or injudicious let me beg to be considered as alone responsible for my friends w ill not in j suit your understanding by asking you whether you do not experience an unshaken confidence in the

they had an undisputed title to absolute property in other men and a careless unthinking world lias permitted them to enact the dream into a frightful reality but a change has come over the spirit of the j times a title to absolute property inman and irresponsible power over him j sounds now strange and awful the doc uinent is reexamined the validity of i the claim is disputed and as the enslaved and the enslaver present them selres in their respective chracters of defendant and plaintiff an upright and impartial judge will give this sen tance if the capital flaw in the instrument fully made out no matter how long it has remained undetected no matter for how many generations tiie title deeds may have passed undisputed from father to sonno matter how hard a case it may either seem or be for the plaintiff the defendants claim is the claim of justice and the i vitiated deed must go further if the conscience ot a vaet portion of the americans has long been hoodwinked by being told that slavery is a patriarchal institution and continued upon old testament authority and they now begin to dge for themselves and discover that while american slaves have not one recognized right but are declared to be absolutely and for everchatties personal the jewish bondsmen were a privileged class having personal civil and religious rights secured to them by law the will inevitably draw the just conclusion from this comparison ot slavery with servitude that although the latter was a patriarchal the former is nothing buta gross heathen institution it added to this thev with enlarged in ellect are j not dull to perceive that even the mild servitude of the old and inferior j covenant was inteuded and designed to give place to the freedom giving precents and spirit of the new and the better no matter how long theamencan mmd has been aliened how long blundering notions of testament institutions haveprevai ed or how long the glorious light shed by the new tesfameni has been objured inquiry

and land unholy league and by their evil i machinations and infernal agency have erected that theatre lor the ready perr tormance of the worst crimes and the r unblushing manifestation of the lowest i passionsa human market place and human beings are at length looking upon it with indignant self reproach i with grief and with terrifiedtfcnazemcnt at their long then heartless their tui pid apathyno matter how firmly the theatre is constructed how skilled the performers or hnw enormous the gains these are perceived to be wages of ini i quity those the children of satan this the temple of wickedness and each righteous soul pronounces its unhesitating liar that the humanmarket must go finally if thou hast waited for the day spring from on high to visit the region of the shadow f death if thou hast listened for a voice to summon to the bar ot public opinion the monster which so long derided thel tears of modest women the cries of helpless children and the anguish ot jstrong men rejoice tor the monster does stand at the bar of public opin j ionand that public is the world the day spring is at hand and as it bends its light upon this cowering iniquity it hits it with destruction slavery must go my friends you on the other side of the atlantic and we on this feel alike a strong and joyful conviction that this havoc spreading evil w ill and must be stayed krc long society will j strike its knell but until that hour arrives much truth must be calmly j though earnestly discussed much must be nobly done much must be patiently endured every earnest kind j whither among you or the fairer popu i lation should hold itself prepared to j pass through it in the might of the lord god j vour position my brethren t the j united states h one of peculiar diffi cully and trial the cup of freedom of which you have at length been permitted to partake is as yet by no means wholly sweet the poison of prejudice still lurks at the bottom of the vessel and j still infuses some taste of bitterness to the whole draught while respect is the fountain of kindness we all know that the transition from contempt to injury is but short an unrighteous and widespread contempt of man is americas grand defect and forms in fact the basis upon which she has erected her stupendous amphitheatre of crime america forgets that in man wherever found we trace the beautiful i design the wonderful workmanship the nice execution of the greatmaster lof all art man is in the style and manner of omnipotence mans works may and should excite our admiration the moviug machine the breathing statue the speaking canvass the temple of worship arc well calculated to strike us with respect yet ought we to look bevond these and exclaim man himself is the work to be wondered atman himself is the work of god we have said that your position is j one of peculiar difficulty and trial and we do not acknowledge this without at j the same time offering you the aid of sincere sympathy while enduring theone and our cordial wishes that r strength and wisdom may be voueh safed to you for overcoming the other it is not overlooked by others nor should it be by yourselves that your position is also one of great importance and interest a contest incomparably grand is going on in the f niterl states the issue hopefully anticipated is not only personal liberty to three millions of our brethren but through their en i franchisement the advantages ot an indelible and instructive lesson to the whole earth that to plant slavery upon any corner of its surface is to unite and stimulate for coming years the worst passions ot the worst minds to the worst deeds ot legalized cruelty and injustice and to lay upon every inch of the soil that curse of unrighteousness which must and will be redeemed sooner or later by the noble few who will bear anything and everything rather than their own and their country dishonour ibis is a contest not between large and comprehensive souls differing in their idea of good but each urging upon their country the adoption of their respective measures with such ability and zeal that it may seem difficult to determine where the balance of good lies no here the line between the contending parties is broad determined unmistakable the balance of evil is clearly perceived for it is m one word a contest between the just and the unjust the defiled standard of aiaverv supported by a vicious self interest alone is erected on one side the unstained banner of virtuous freedom waves aloft on the otber he who rallies round this goes for the right he who ranges under that goes for the wrong brethren and friends to doubt that many very many among you are watching the progress of the great freedom movement with an intense land absorbing interest is to doubt that you are men it is a movement to which all the dependents of injured africa should direct their serious their close their fixed attention as its success will affect the intellectual advancement the social position and the moral health of millions with whom they are nationally connected and who thus appear to have an especial claim upon the sympathy and aid of their free and intelligent colored brother or sister of whatever country or religion or party i have entitled this little i tract a lettter to the treecolored population of the united states and elsewhere end deeply is it to be desired that every intelligent and virtuous african should contribute the influence of his character anti talent to the promotion of universal freedom in missionary in africa in our own colonies and especially in the lj united states we have abundant proof that among our darker brethren as among ourselves our common father j has dispensed with no unsparing band those choicest gifts the feeling heart and the judging inimi u is by the happy union ot these qualities that a correct moral and religious taste is formed and settled and when it is formed can its purifying influence be better exerted than in efforts to aid that cause which aims to procure for millions of africans now existing and millions yet unborn the sacred rank the mighty privileges and the glorious expectation of the true disciples of jesus christ as however the struggle for the complete subversion of proslavery principles and practice is maintained in the united states witha vigor a resolution and an immove abiiity of purpose to be found nowhere else on the face of the globe and as your couiiuct and bearing with regard to this great subject will and must tell either for its advancemsnt or retrogression you might naturally expect that those friends of africas descendants who on this side of the atlantic felt prompted to address a letter to anv of them would address that letter more particularly to yourselves vou would expect also that it would contain not merely expressions of sympathy and respect for you as men but j also some allusion to those duties by the faithful performance of which you may prove to the world that you ire i christian mento it confirmed itfn diaky itblitatiovs by mail the south is now being hooded with abolition documents and newspapers whilst the antislavery standard continues its offensive visits we observe another of the same sort the pcnnsyl vnniu freemanhas commenced to lie circulated in the southern states we respectfully invite the attention of president paylor the man ot the south to the management of the postoffice department these documents are treasonable the freeman denounces the constitution of the united states as an infamous and wicked

south that he should endeavour to till the pot office department with men who will not by virtue of their office aid m circulating these documents in the southern states whore they are prohibited by law the recent and increasing circulation of these documents is beyond doubt attributable to the knowledge i that the postmaster general is a thoroughgoing free soil man and in all probability an abolitionist and it is ibad beginning for the admission of a southern president that the enenies our institutions should have such confidence in the agents of the post office department and that their

arrangements for meetings i n finn the dundee scut courier slavery in america it is of importance occasionally to test the sincerity of professions whether in nations or individuals and to sec how far their principles and their piactice agree this is particularly necessary hi the case of those who lay claim to preeminent purity and win lookdown with complacent coinmisseratioti upon the professoffc of an humbler creed w hen a nation throws wif the tuie ot an ancient monarchy and adopts the mote popular form of government represented by a republic itis not unreasonable to exjiect that the great principles of liberty and equality on which all republics profess to ik based should receive some practical effect when that poi tion of america which constitutes the united states was incorjkirated into one great republic the avowed principle o its political constitution wasthat all men are entitled to equal political rights and that the government should le established by the voice of the people as expressed by universal sufltage without inquiring at present whether this form of government has been conducive either to the greatness or the prosperity of those who embraced it we shall confine ourselves to the simple questionhow far the principles of the union correspond with its practice m the matter of slavery there is a general feeling in this country that the reports which reach us as to the extent and severity of the servitude which obtains in amencaare greatly exaggerated and overcolored and in fact there are many who disbelieve in tiie existence of slavery within the united states at all it seems such a monstrous contradiction that slavery should be tolerated by a people who pride themselves upon the superior freedom of their institutions that many are led to look upon the accounts which they receive of its existence as mere fabrications and only brought lor ward for the purpose of damaging the republican cause when this subject was brought prominently before the public some years ago in reference to the money obtained by the free church from slaveholding congregations in america many ot those who took upon them to defend the conduct of the receiving party not only denied the existence of slavery to the extent that was alleged but proceeded to palliate the system itself as not inconsistent with christianity hatever effect their representations made upon the public they seemed at least to satisfy their own adherents for the subject was allowed to sleep and the demand for restitution of the money was obstinately and successfully resisted when some of the antislavery party in america came to this country to represent the wrongs of the slave and the injury which had been done to the cause ol emancipation by the countenance given to slaveholders by the free church deputationstheir statements were contradicted and the men themselves represented as unworthy of credit at that time we had occasion to consider the subject and to direct public attention not only to the inconsistency of those who professed to belong to a tree slate tolerating the existence of slavery in all its hideous deformity but to the further inconsistency of those who professed to have erected a free church in this country holding ministerial communion with avowed abettors of slavery in another the correspondence which ensued betwixt the free church and thetr slave

bore more heavily tn his remaiki upon i umer than upon either of the other candidates and it was now evident for the hrtt time there was some unpleasant feeling between them bon the next day friday another discussion took place at a regimented muiur at foxtown willis spoke first turner ni whan turner had spoken about an clv appealed lo him to give maor burnham jan opportunity of defending the

interruption and when he concluded c m clay took qe stand for tlie purpose of making a kind of apology to the people for the inter ujton he had caused he again stated that thought each party were entitled to be beard and that each should be allowed a fair division of the titoe that the friends ol right and justice by such a course had nothing to lose for if the emancipationists held incendiary notions and advocated principles op jiosed to ihe best interests of the country the people would judge of them correctly and put them down w hile if principles were founded in right and justice it was certainly not wrong that they should be known in older that they may beupiield and supported after making this explanation which did not occupy more than two minutes he was leaving the stand when mr

statement of our views on the scheme of giving bibles to the slave and in ists that we are opposed to giving the slave the bible thus making our opposition to a weak and ineffectual scheme opposition

light the proscriptive customs prevalent in this country it is this in the town of mason there is a settlement of blacks not seeing any particular show of justice or reason in the laws which exclude them from voting simply on account of color they took it into their heads when an opportunity occurred to go and ofler their votes they expected to be repulsed and so they wereall but one this one was so nearly white that the wise fathers of the town believed him tobe a pure anglosaxon and recorded his vote here however they got into a quandary for it was bruited abroad that a nigger had voted but w ho w as the nigger there happened to be a good many rather dark complexioned individuals thereabouts and there was danger that some of the principal men of the town might be found to be partially afiican at length the difficult rested between two the one who was really of negro origin and another who dawned to bewhite these two men were ushered with all ceremony before the board that they might undergo a searching examination and have the very important question decided which of them was the tarral nigger thst had presumed to give his vote w hen only white folks are allowed that privilege after having subjected the two men to a rather microscopic inspection the spokesman of the board arrived at the very sagacious conclusion that the while man was the rugger o said hei can see it in his eye what this solon saw in the white nuns eye that proved him to be a nigger our informant does not say perhaps no one knew exactly the science of negroology is rather indigenous to the sot of these united states whit americana seem to have u as a kind of instinctjust as tbe crocodile as soon as it is hatched in the ad finds its way with all convenient speed into the water having as naturals inform as an intuitive knowledge that its lather wilt eat it if he catches it out it might lie a c rious and perhaps profitable subject of inquiry amongst students of natural history whether it is not something of this sort that makes the uhite american dread the negro he sees it in his eye and this it w hatever it may be has the rather unpleasant effect for those who love to vote of excluding them from the ballotbox more than this however some white men seem lo have it in thru eves and the consequence is that it having some mysterious effect upon the political artmn of the man who has it iu his eye rentiers his vote invalid this does not appear in the evidence on the present case but we are left to infer that if it is found m the mans eye he cannot be allowed to vote suppose that in cuiise quence of the decision of the board of mason the vole of the white man was rejected and that of the nigger accepted it by some unaccountable freak ot nature did not happen to

misguided youth up be fori their own oaze a torrent of opposition and even persecution followedbut prepared rather lo follow the line of duty and our own convictions ol right than the popular will we continued our course until eventually we had the pleasure of having many who con demeduslo approbate it and even give us among others thanks for the benefit they derived from our precepts and admonition in them at the present time we do not think there is anv community of people who are making greater efforts at obtaining realestate than those of pittsburg scarcely is there an industrious family but is making ihe effort more or less in almost every direr lion in every new streetwherever property or lots are put in market there will you find same colored persons more or less to be among the purchasers and holdersmany ol whom are tearing up neat and comfortable dwe lings of moderate size some quite elegant houses for their means and capital indeed the greatest objection we find to the buildings generally is they are too good that is out people generally build houses mo elegant costly and expensive tr their means which they usually intend lor their own residences instead ot like the whites putting their ground to the best possible use by first building several small tenements for renting by which means they at once cream for themselves an income several v oitfiy colo ed citizens have put their properly to the iicst of uses and built tenements which are now let out yielding them a handsome percentage on their investments this is as h should fie and we would that more who have real estate would make like improvement on increasing theit means by the improvement of their property a little industry and little enterprise would accomplish this among the business enterprises there are several worthy of note there have been one shoe store and one hat store established by two colored men both practical mechanics during the last year and in allleghany city an adjunct of pittsburg one good grocery store by mr harper and a fancy store and mantua mak ng bv two colored ladies besides other srhaliei shops all of whom appeal to be well doing in alleghany city there is also

siicond lsttk fredirick douglas dear friend jn iny letter of last week i took occasion to state in outline the proceedings and results of the harrisburg and philadelphia conventions called for the purpose of securing the elective franchise to the colored population ot that state and i spoke of them as sad failures and attributable almost entirely to the indifference procrastination and illiberally of the colored people themselves and i may be permuted to repeat that if there is one thing more than another preventing our rise as a people obstructing the progress of our cause and making us a byword and hissing in the land of our nativity and in the midst of those institutions around which cluster our hopes ior the future it is the spirit of envy jealousy and deceit entertained and practiced towards each other this next to the inexorable prejudices of our white oppressors hangs like a mill stone about our necks take philadelphia the past winter for example and on the subject of the elective franchise and in that population of twenty thousand and upwards there was no unanimity of feeling and liberality of sentiment sufficient to fix upon any man in their midst ijr from abroad of their own complexion to act for them as agent or lecturer in fact they held many meetings and much opposition and angry debate was had before delegates to the state convention were appointed and the paltry amount raised to pay their travelling expenses and the truth will sootier or later force itself upon us that tio great change in public sentiment can be effected or any longlost right restored or general abuse corrected or popular nuisance removed until the sufferers or disfranchised signify their deep abhorrence of the injury done them their unmistakable opposition to every form of oppression founded upon color or other adventitious circumstance and that itis not enough that our white friends w ho are greatly in the minority write speak petition and contribute but that it is ours also to j write speak petition and contribute and at times and under circumstances best calculated to keep up the agitation let the quiet of the church the stability of ordinary societies among us the accumulation of dollars and cents the anniversaries of odd fellow societies the display of free masons the levees j of sons and daughters of temperance the suppers of good samaritans and fancy balls and parties be made subordinate lor the lime being to the great and true idea of our moral social political and religious recognition to make me a sectarian odd fellow good samaritan son of temperance or freemason before you make me a man and a citizen is to mock my heart and insult my head liberty first names societies and conventionalism afterwards ot what advantage is the church state or any human society or institution to me if i must purchase them at the price of chains slavery and proscription  wl it the glory of houses and lands if enjoyed upon sufferance suffer me to live on southstreet and beat and stab me for walking on the next street below after o clock in the evening tell me may walk in an odd fellow society and mob me lor walking in a temperance procession permit me to pass in a free mason procession and club and stone me to death for being in au antislavery procession go when where and with whom we please as servants or slaves but denied place above or beneath ground scarcely breathing air or drinking water as gentlemen as musicians we may play in the centre of fashionable circles but must not presume to walk or march ou grand parade occasions ride side by side with our white employers or masters carry the children in our arms kiss them and be kissed in retuin as servants or slaves but must not come within hailing distance as fiiends or equals such then is our true condition four millions of people living acting dying not as god wills but as slavery demands and prejudice complies and who needs to be intoimed that any appeal from us to the law gospel humanity or civilization of the country is a dead strain and will continue to be so until we shall grow more uneasy in our chains as slaves and self respectful confident and daring in our demand for our rights as nominal freemen the true secret is we are slaves in our persons because we are slaves m spirit and shante ujioii the craven cowards and equal shame upon those who willingly and patiently wait for their white friends to do and dare tor them what they will not do and dare for themselves and long too long this ha been true of us andi ask if our fate is to he sealed through our own inertion or whether as a people we are doomed and damned by slaverys fiat irft him who dare answer ouj colored friends throughout the country know this is no fancy sketch but every day reality they know that when oui friend ro liert purvis says we are but miserable automata in community and in ihe country he speak a truth and when will we better ourselves in a manner becoming our cause in view of our present lifeless listless attitude to the cause emphatically our own  agam confess my selfrespect as a man is hunt bled my pride i s un broken my ambition u a son anti brother hi my upi tat

to err out against the dorp damnation ofj slavery and prejudice upon ua and mv equal j right to enter my solemn ptotest against the silence of our peopie or any and every dem oristraiion militating in any way against the progress of our cause and proslavery among ourselves is equally obnoxious and detestable to my mind and feelings as among white people and let the line be drawn as discriminating and impartial among ua as one of the means of saving us ftoni a common slavery i and a common disgrace and i here declare that in future i will show no more quarter or lenity communion with the one than the other ours truly observer items from a spectators journal during a recent visit to philadelphia was much interested with the several colored schools public aud private as also various

resources of our brethren in the city of brotherly love that teel justified in reserving the major pari of ray own lucubrations as a spectator i cannot forbear however an allusion to the north star association a circle of devoted antislavery friends who manifest a readiness in and out ol season to enlargethe circulation of the paper regarded by them as an efficient auxiliary in a good cause and tht too as am happy to learn without lessening their hearty good will arid patronage ot the other prominent antislavery periodicals a meeting was held under their auspices in n eslev church which was addressed by robert douglass jr among others m an elegant and pertinent manner setting forth the claims of the paper and urging a generous support i trust the philadelphia north star association will be successful in their effort and that other cities will follow the example thus creating a wide spread impetus in its behalf the paper has successfully redeemed the pledges given at the outset the favorable testimony of the press generally to the ability displayed in its columnsthe position it has already won as a faithful exponent of the colored american the channel thiough which his wants can

scalping knife of truth to the latter alike commend it to patronage as a class the colored people have not yet done their duty in sustaining an antislavery press a few days since heard an intelligent

the juveniles but by those of a larger growth ami that most heartily several distinguished friends ol the antislavery cause were present who consistently appreciated such art opportunity on separating rounds of happy cheers were given in grateful testimony to the proprietor and his lady both of whom always appear most pleased when contributing to the happiness of others w c n boston june the protective policy ok an armed peace something far the merchant the armedprotection policy is a strange species of economoy truly nothing like it can be found in the history of common business transactions there is only one thing like it which we can imagine and that would be the case of a person who should set one ol his children bringing water for the family in a gourd from a neighboring spring and should keep an athletic hired man armed with a bludgeon merely for the purpose of attending the child on the way to protect it from dogs donkeys pigs and geese such a protective policy would be about as economical as that adopted by enlightened nations fur the protection of commerce the great object of navies is to protect commerce it is said and the merchants aud manufacturers of chistendom believe it to a marvellous extent of credulity to be sure in the still times of peace navies do but little in this way they sometimes sleep dismasted in hulks for years in the best harbors of nation or upon their stocks under cosily building commerce is expected to take care of itself during a time of peace butin war these great sea bulldogs are unkenneled to protect commerce by chasing halt of it fr m the ocean but let us count the cost of this kind of protection beginning with great britain the sum appropiated to the british navy for the last year amounted to at least x  after deducting xt for packet service the entire value of all the exports of the united kingdom in did not probably exceed x thus the naval protection ot this commerce cost nearly seventeen percent of its whole amount now it is doubtful w hether any experienced man utaciurer or merchant in england would put j the net profits on these exports at above t percent after deducting all risks insurance guaranties and other inseparable charges then this singular economy would produce this result profits of x x naval protection of ditto x excess ut protection over profits x required the number of years it would take for commerce to get nch at this rate but was a hard year for commerce it will be said then let us take the annual average exports ol the nited kingdom for the last five yeats and we shall find that they paid per cent of their entire amount for naval protection the commerce of france taxed lo percent and that of the united states cent for the same kind of protection how can the enlightened merchant and manufacturers of these three great countries be reconciled to such a protective policy a thud chrutian  citizen the bevas juneo pm then great crevae now in a fair way of being

which turned as barristers would say on a beautiful point of circumstantial evidence along with the attorney a sharp enough person in his wav examined various parties at the hoteland made myself acquainted with the nature of the premise the more wo investigated however the more dark and mysteriousalways supposing harveys ineocencedid the whole case appeal there was not one redeeming trait in the affair except har veys previous good character and good character by the law of kngland goes for nothing in opposition to facts proved to the satisfaction of a jury it was likewise most unfortunate that a was to be the presiding judge this man possessed great forensic acquirements and was of spotless private character but like the majority of lawyers of that daywhen it was no extraordinary thing to hang twenty men in a morning at newgatelie was a staunch stickler for the gallows as the only effectual reformer and safeguard of the social state at this time he was but partially recovered from a long and severe indisposition and the traces of recent suffering were distinctly apparent on his pale and passionless fea tures harvey was arrainged in due form the evidence was gone carefully through nd everything so far as was concyrned was done that man could do lut at the time to which i refer counse was not allowed to address the coulrt on behalf of the prison era practice since introduced from scotlandand consequently i was allowed no opportunity to draw the attention of the jury to the total want of any direct evidence of the prisoners guilt harvey himself tried to point out the unlikelihood of his being guilty but he was not a man gifted with dialectic qualities and his harranguc fell pointless on the understandings of the twelve commonplace individuals who sat in the jurybox the judge finally proceeded to sum up the evidence and this lie did emphatically against the prisoner dwelling with much force on the suspicious circumstance of a needy man taking up his abode at an expensive fashionable hotel his furtive descent from his apartments by the backi stairs the undoubted fact of the watch being found in his trunk the improbability of any one putting it there but himself and the extreme likelihood that the robbery was effected in a few moments of time by the culprit just ashe passed from the bar of the hotel to the room which he imd occupied if said he to the jury in concluding his add ress you can after all the circumstances believe the prisoner to be innocent ofthe crime laid to his charge it is more than i can do the thing seems to me as clear as the sun at noonday the evidence in short is irresistible nnd if the just and necessary provisions ofthe law are in such very plain cases i y will be dissolved and security for property there will be none gentlemen retire and make up your ver dict the jury were not disposed to retire after communing a few minutes together one of them stood up and delivered the verdict it was guilty the judge assumed the crowning imdge of the judicial potentatethe black cap and the clerk ofnrraigns asked the prisoner ut the bar in the usual form if he had anything urge why sentence of death should not be passed upon him poor harvey i durst scarcely look at him as the sonorous words fell on his ear im was grasping nervously with shaking hands at the front of the dock he appeared stunned bewildered as aman hut half awakened from a hideous dream might be supposed to look he had comprehended though he had scarcely heard the verdict for on the instant the voice which hut a few years before sang to him by the brook side was ringing through his brain and he i could recognize the little pattering feet of his children us sobbing unci clinging to their shrieking mothers dress she nnd they were hurried out of court the clerk after a painful pause repeated the solemn formula by a strong effort the doomed man mastered his agitation ins pale countenance lighted up with indignant fire and firm and selfpossessed lie thus replied to the fearful interrogatory much could i say in the name not ol mercy but of justice why the sentence about to be passed on me should not be pronounced but nothing alas that will avail me with you prideblind ed ministers of death you fashion to yourselvesout of your own vain conceits do you fashioninodes and instruments by the aid of which you fondly imagine to invest yourselves with attributes which belong only to omniscience and now i warn youand it is a voice from the tomb in whose shadow ii already stand w hich addresses you that you arc about to commit a most cruel and deliberate murder he paused and the jury looked into each others eyes fur the courage they could not find in their own hearts the voice of conscience spoke but was only for a few moments audible the suggestion that what grave parliaments l learned judges and ail classes of respectability sanctioned could not be wrong much less murderous or cruel silenced the still small tones and tranquilised the startled jurors prisoner at the bar said the judge with his cold calm voice of destiny cannot listen to such observations y oil have been found guilty of a heinous offence by a jury of your counj trymen alter a patent trial with that finding nevd scarce say i entirely agree la assumed of your guilt as ifl had seen you commit the act with my own bodily eyes the circumstance of your being a person who from habits j and education should have besn above committing to base a crime only aggravates your guilt however no matter who or whal vou have been you must expiate your offence on the scaffold he law has very properly for the safej ty ot society decreed the punishment of death fot such crimes our only and plain duty is to execute that law the prisoner did not reply he was leaning with his elbows on the front of j the dock his bowed face covered with his outspread hands and the judge passed sentence of death in the accustomed form the court then rose anda turnkey placed his hand upon the prisoners arm to lead him away sud j denly he uncovered his face drew himself up to his full heighthe was a remarkably tall man and glared fierce i ly round upon the audience like a wild i animal at bay my lord he cried or rather shouted in an excited voice the judge motioned impatiently to the jailor and strong hands impelled the j prisoner from the front of the dock bursting from them he again sprang forward and his arms outstretched whilst his glittering eye seemed to hold the judge spellhound exclaimed my lord before another month has passed away you wilj appear at the bar of another world to answer for the life the innocent life which god bestowed upon me but which you have impiously cast away as a thing of naught and scorn he ceased and was at once borne off the court in some confusion hastily departed it was thought at the time that the judges evidently failing health had suggested the prophecy of the prisoner it only excited a tew days wonder and was for gotten ihe position of a barrister in such cicuinslances is always painful i need hardly say that my own feelings were of a very distressing kind conscious that it the unfortunate man really was guilty he was at least not deserving capital punishment i exerted myself to procure a reprieve in the first place i waited privately on the judge but he would listen to no proposal lor a respite along w ith a number of individ ualschiefly of the society of friends i petitioned the crown for a commutation of the sentence but being unaccompanied with a recommendation from the judge the prayer of out petition was of course disregarded the law it was said must take its course how much cruelty has been exercised under shelter of that remorseless ex pression i would willingly pass over the succeeding events unable to save his life i endeavored to soothe the few remaining hours of the doomed convict and frequently visited him in the condemned cel the more i saw of him the deeper grew my sympathy in his case w hich was that of no vulgar felon have been a most unfortunate man said he one day to me a destiny towards ruin in fortune and in life has pursued me feel as if deserted bv god and man yet i know or at least would persuade myself that heaven will one day vindicate my innocence of this foul charge to think of being hanged like a dog for a crime at which my soul revolts great is the crime of those imbecile jurors and that false and hardhearted judge who thus by an irreversabie decree consign a fellow mjrtal to a death of violence and disgrace oh god help mehelp me to sustain that bitter bitter hour and then the poor man would throw himself on his bed and weep but the parting with his wife and childrenwhat pen can describe that terrible interviewthey knelt in prayer their wobegone countenances suffused in tears and with hands clasped convulsively together the scene w as too harrowing and sacred for the eye of a stranger i rushed from the cell and buried myself in my lodgings whence i did not remove till all was over next day james harvey a victim of circumstantial evidence and of a barbarous criminal code perished on the scaffold three weeks afterwards the court arrived at u populous city in the west oi england it had in the interval visited another assize town and there judge a had left three for execution at the

about for a fortnight amidst the wild solitudes ot caernarvonshire i took the stage foi the city which i knew the court was to visit and arrived on the day previous to the opening of the assizes well
