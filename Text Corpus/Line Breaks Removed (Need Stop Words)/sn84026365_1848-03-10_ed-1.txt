shackfords lecture on the war with mexico toncluded the false and foolish idea that slavery is or ever has been profitable to the north seems about to be met by the p evidence of god revealing in loss and disgrace iu far spreading ruin and failure that a violation of natures law of justice must suffer its just reward it is tints permitted that the success of evil shall be its puuislimcnt and instead of triumphing could we sec j aright we might s true patrums rather he called upon to mourn at every victory that has been won upon a foreign s il vc are but just entering upon that state cf retribution which is not arbitrarily induced but advances step by step through tnc instrumentality ol blinded and willing agents one yawning gulf after another opens before so gradually so imperceptibly that the rash and thoughtless know their danger only when danger has become a dreadful reality the prophet is not listened to lie whom i have before quoted said with a warning foresight if by our advances we put the colonies of england m new peril w ith what face can we oppose her occupation ot cuba suppose her with that magnificent island iu her hands to command the mexican gulf and the mouths ot the mississippi will tbe western states find compensation for this formidable neighborhood in the privilege of hooding texas with slaves there is here a subject of fearful import it acquires an aspect of reali ity when we consider our present condition those straws which show which way the wind blows may beseen floating by in the air already is there talk of the power of england in the gulf which is to be made a lever for action in the same manner as in the annexation of texas an article in a leading new york paper not long ago mav give us food for reflection in coneection with this tbe writer says we express a settled conviction when yve say that excited as the military spinl of the country is by the war with mexico and confident in the prowess of her arms a war w ith england in a purely national quarrel would be welcomed by all the stirring blood of the republic and that a rail for volunteers in such a war would bring into the field such a host as has never before been marshalled under the american banner eager for combat with foemen worthy of their steel and on fields where pestilence und climate wage not their unequal obscure hut fatal war j lure looking then as we do with certain assurance upon the near probabiii j ty of a war with england we are most unwilling t her acquiring such a fo ti dil in th gulf of mexico as the i if c itia would give hera ad we have the most entire cnvic tiou that any attempt on her part to acquire that colony would furnish the clearly national ground of quarrel which would unite the people of the hutted stales in opposition to her pro ject now with the existence of slavery j j n our country as a controlling power with standing army a military spirit among the nation and an ambitious demagogue to play upon the passions of the people with the false notions of patriotism that now prevail with the doctrine that once engaged in a war no matter for what cause or how brought j about every lover of bis country must aid the executive in prosecuting it to the end according to his direction a j war with some of the old nations of the world is us certain as the law of gravi the north star tation in the pfamcal universe bu

the reproach of the humanity and true civilization of the world but so it is in this age of improvement and of lofty ideas when everything seemed looking to the blessings of peace and a higher civilization when lovers of their race were seeking how they might break down the barriers of national antipathy and spread the blessings of peace and cement the bonds of a universal brotherhood when the principles of cooperation and love were beginning to obtain a place in the hearts of the rising generation when christianity in its practical truths seemed about to descend into the lives of men and shed abroad its healing and ennobling influences we find ourselves engaged in a foreign war the end of which no one can dis cern its consequences now beginning tobe felt will cast a long shadow upon our future even if peace were now established its burdens must fall eventually on the people the toiling husbandman the laborers for wages the mechanic the artisan those who work for their daily bread and earn that bread by the sweat of manly brows and the weariness of female hands upon these must fall at last the heavy burden out of the free labor of the north must come the means to pay these heavy debts hand and foot are we bound to serve our maters unless the soul of freedom once more comes to dwell among us and her angel wings fan us and wake us from our drowsy sleep a traditionary freedom will not save us it will not do to praise onr fathers and build their sepulchres worse for us that we have such an inheritance if we spend it foolishly and are unable to appreciate its worth sad for us if liaving served as the scaffolding only o the glorious temple of universal free lom wc should be at last pulled down sad if the genius of a true humanity leholdingws witbtearfol eyes from the nount of vision shall fold his wings in lor rowing pity and repeat the strnin i oh land of washington how often vould i have gathered thy children to ether as a lien doth gather her brood indcr her wiags and ye would not f dchold your house is left unto you des late but a moral deformity yet more lidcous is revealed to us in this war i mot only do we see indifference and a vrong estimate of greatness but a positive assertion of principles subversive of every principle of righteousness and indicating that lowest stage if degradation that degree of spiritual blindness which groping about in the light of noonday sees not and walking boldly in the darkness of midnight lighted by an internal fire of selfish lust claims to see this war has been defended and is upheld by many on the ground of anglosaxon superiority and the extending of the area of freedom it is our destiny it is said so it has always been and so must it he that the stronger shall overpower the weaker and the cause of humanity must progress if need be through bloodshed and ruin through the de j struction of that which is ready to perish and it is the plan of providence that the blood of the strong and young shall be infused into the old and weak and thus shall advance the cause of human progress i need not remind you that when the fiat of the southern slaveholders who have controlled the destinies of this country went forth that texas should be annexed many of our northern politicians who had hitherto opposed this measure dropped all their opposition and were found shouting among the loudest for the lone star of freedom they made a virtue of a pressing necessity and while the leading advocate at the south was upholding the measure in the eyes of the world as absolutely needful for the preservation of peculiar domestic institutions j his followers at the north were putting forth this plea of extending the area of freedom and uuder this mantle the attempt is made to hide the evil of this war following as a necessary consequence of the first extension of the area how can we characterize aright such a fatal blindness to all the principles of right and justice how cause the light to shine into that eye which has reached this mage of total blindness how argue when the shallowest of sophistry suffices to justify the worst of crimes it is a glorious thought that the all merciful creator overrules for good the sins and errors of his creatures and in his allembracing love makes the very wrath of man to minister to his praise glorious vision to look back upon the wrecks of ambition passion crime and folly and behold over theta all and through them all advancing the cause of humanity and love la spiring hope to look forward into the future and rejoice that in spite of jj that wickedness and injustice can do the intrigues of the selfish the corrupt ambition of the demagogue the right is of no sextruth is of colorgod is the father of us amd

piercing spear because through hi death in the blessed providence oi god shall come the salvation of s world he who with claim of farseeing statesmanship or exaltation above vulgai estimate defends this war on the gjound of the good that will redound to the cause of human progress would consistently be found among the murderers of the prince of peace there is no crime or wrong in the whole catalogue of iniquities which might not thus be justified the old man who can no longer use or enjoy his wealth is not safe because if he is removed the plans of providence to diffuse bis riches will then be answered and so it is right to murder him how much more worthy of the statesman of this age the motto no politicrl change is worth being purchased by a single drop of human blood the

not suffer the question to betaken with j out expressing the grounds of my opposition to the passage of this resolution in doing so i have no object in view except to manifest consistent opposition to the war in all phasesin all its as pectsand in whatever way it can be presented i feel constrained to record i my vote against the passage of this resolution because i cannot by any possibility by any sophistry separate in my mind a vote of thanks to these officers for the agency which they have had in the war from an approval in the war in which they are engaged i did not promise at this time to repeat tc the senate my convictions as to the character of this war because i have alreodyauffiriently expressed those convictions i desire only to vindicate the propriety of the course which i proposed to take upon this occasion any judicious efforts here or elsewhere to bring this war to a closeto a speedy and honorable closewill command my earnest and most cordial thanks but i have no thanks to ofter those who have been employed in the prosecution of a war which i believe to be thus unjust from its commencement nor can i accede to another proposition which i have heard maintained with a good deal of energy here and elsewhere that an officer of the army or navy has no discretionthat he is a mere machine of the administrationthat is to say go and he goetb come andhe comeih without attaching to himself any share of inoral responsibility for the character of the transaction in which he is engaged i do not believe any such doctrine i do not believe that officers of the army or navy are such machines or that by receiving commissions in either service they divest themselves of all responsibility for the character of the transactions in which they mhy be engaged in pursuance of the orders which they receive there is one bright page in the history of the english army which i think might with great propriety be commended to the thoughtful consideration of every gentleman who thus represents the officers of the army as irresponsible machines it is found in the history of the earl of effingham a distinguished officer of the army and a member of the house of peers he was colonel of a regiment in the british service when he received orders to join the army about to embark for america and fight the rebels at charleston and camden his conduct on that occasion was worthy of all commendation and would to god that we had some one who inheriting a portion of his spirit when the order of this administration was issued directing the advance of the troops to the rio grande would have followed so illustrious an example the story is briefly told in the annual register for the year and with the indulgence of the senate i will read it the earl of effingham whose military genius had led him when a youth into the army and had since prompted him to ripen theory into experience wherever real service was to he found by acting as a volunteer in the war between the russians and the turks had since his return as a peer in parliament uniformly opposed the whole system of measures pursued against the americans and finding at length that the regiment in which he served was intended for the american service thought k inconsistent with bis character and unbecoming of his dignity to enforce measures w ith his sword which he had so utterly condemned in his legislative capacity he accordingly wrote a letter of resignation to the secretary of war in which having declared the cheerfulness with which be would sacrifice his life tad fertwne hi support

which the burning sun shall cause to disappear and most foolish and miserable of all men are they who thus hope and pray and labor would not suffer him to be instrumental iin depriving any pert of his people of those liberties which form the best severity for their fidelity end obedience to his government he expressed the deepest regret end greatest mortification at being obliged to quit a profession which had been that of his ancestors for many ages to the study and practice of which from childhood his past life had been applied and his future intentionally dedicated and that as he waived the advantage which the custom of the service entitled him to the right of settling what he bad bought be entreated that he might be allowed to retain his rank in the army that whenever the envy or ambition of foreign powers should require it he might be enabled to serve his majesty and his country in that way j n which of all others he thought himself best calculated to do it with effect this was the course taken by that distinguished officer of the british army when he received orders from the crown to embark on a service which did not commend itself to his moral sentiments if there could have been found within the ranks of the american army an officer entertaining such exalted ideas of duty and dignity as that who did not merge the man in the officer and who could have told the administration that he respected his own convictions of truth and duty and could not yield obedience to an arbitrary mandate i would have thanked him and thanked god that he had given us such a man but i can record no vote of thanks to any of the officers of this army for having been engaged in a contest which every feeling of my heart and every dictate of my judgement condemns the resolution speaks of glory that glory i look upon as our shame we have won no glory in this war which i desire to share for it has been acquired in a cause which i believe has not been sustained by justice and there can be no glory without justice there con be glitter and there can beglare but no glory separate from truth righteousness and justice and believing that the whole of this transaction from beginning to end instead of adding anything to our national glory has detracted from itthat instead of clothing our national charcter with just renown it has rendered our name a shame and a reproach to the friends of free principles wherever the history of our doings in mexico are knownl must as one humble individual withhold now and forever any vote of thanks approbation to those who have been instrumental in carrvinw nn ikn wn great menthe following tribute to the venerable james fob ten though published several years since may not be devoid of interest at the present time i shall speak of great men according to the common acceptation oi the term i had a letter of introduction to some colored gentleiqcn in this city and as i have not hitherto in any city found any that have excelled them i choose in strict justice to give them a prominent place in the catalogue i am really serious and mean what i say although many readers j who seem to believe more in skin de j pravity than in that of the heart might j conclude from such an introduction that i mean to trifle one of those to j whom i was introduced was mr james forten the personal appearance the conversation and the manners of this gentleman are of the very first order hi stoture i should think is about six feet and he is most symmetrically formed as he approaches you there seems in his appearance an evident consciousness that he wears a skin which is everywhere spoken against yet it occasiens no embarrassment to the reverse of this he seems also conscious that he is a man possessed of certain inalienable rights and exhibits a corresponding dignity in bis manners he has no appearance of ostentation or vanity and yet he is polite in the true sense of the word and uncommonly easy in his gestures and conversation so far as i am capable of judging he talks pure english and every word weighs a more interesting gentleman in elegance of person ease and agreeableness of manners together with fluency and pertinence in conversation i hare scarcely ever seen mr forten informed me that he could trace his ancestors back in this coantry about one hundred and seventy years that he himself was born in philadelphia that he was in the statehouse yard whsn the farfamed declaration of independence was read and that he early engaged is the defence of his countrys rights in the revolutionary conflict he was taken prisoner after some severe conflicts in while serving in the royal louis under the father of the celebrated decatur and was seven months in captivity oa board of the notorious prisonship jersey during which time three thousand five hundred of ins fellowprisoners fell vietiaw to fortyfive years ago be cootmeaced the baseness of rail mshmg in this city philadelphia he served

engaged being once requested to rig a ship engaged in the slave slave trade indignantly refused considering the request an insult there appears tobe the utmost order and regularity in conducting his business and among his workmen and the foreman a colored gentleman has been with him twentyfive years all his work is done without the use of a drop of ardent spirits and he informed me that be never drank a single glass in his life mr forten told me he had been visited by a number of members of the legislature who were much interested in his history and one or more i them visited his family and joined their company at the teatable from what i could learn mr fcrten is abundant in liberal bequests to the poor and is generally a piron and promoter of beuevolent objects and not only do the poor of his own color receive by his charity an alleviation of their wants and woes but the white mans heart is often made glad by his benevolence the family of mr fcrten i should think would be enough to interest the black law gentry and skin depravity people they are most prepossessing and apparently intelligent amiable and genteel elis two eldest sons were engaged in the sail loft to whom he introduced me and more accomplished young gentlemen i have hardly ever had the pleasure of seeing their father showed me a map of the united states drawn by one of them entirely with his pen which i think excelled anything of the kind which i had ever seen it is with great difficulty it can be distinguished from the most neatly engraved map other productions of these young gentlemen were shown me equally creditable to their native intellect and acquired accomplishments mr forten died at his residence in philadelphia mar th among the last words he uttered w as his love for william lloyd garrison his funeral one of the largest ever seen in philadelphiawas attended by thousands of all classes and complexions including many merchants shippers and sea captains who had knowu and respected him for years here is another to william cos ten who died at the bank of washington may he had been porter of the bank twentyfour years and preserved ahigh character for punctuality and integrity after his death the bank directors unanimously passed a resolution expressiv e of the highest respect for his memory and presenting fifty dollars to his family the national intelligencer gave him an honorable t obituary from which the following is copied possessing the unlimited confidence of the president directors and officers of the bank millions of money were allowed to pass through the hands of the deceased and in no one instance as we arc authorized to say was there discovered the slightest defalcation the citizens of washington gener ally bear testimony to his excellent qualities his colored skin covered a benevolent heart he raised respect ablyr a large family of his own and in the exercise of the purest benevolence j took into his family and supported four orphan children his funeral was attended by a very large number of persons including citizens of the high i est respectability there were over seventy carriages followed by a long i procession of colored men on horse j back among whom to his credit be it h spoken rode one white gentleman francis s key esq a sincere andj consistent colonizationist john q adams while discussing the suffrage question in congress remarked the late wiiiiam cost in though he was j j not white was as much respected asj any man in the district and the large i concourse of citizens that attended his remains to the grave white as

are a mass of barbarians still more emphatically when compared with the free institutions of the n nth they are savages this is not a mere matter of inference th fat i substantiated by the notorious testimony of slaveholders themselves in lcfcm the synod of south carolina and georgia reported that the slaves may justly be considered the heathen of this country and will bear comparison with the heathen of any part of the world they are destitute of the privileges of the gospel and ever will he under the present state of things in all the slave states says the synod there arc not twelve men exclusively devoted to the religious instruction ot the negroes of the regular ministers but a very small portion pay any attention to them we know of but five churches in the slavcholding states built exclusively for their usc and there is no sufficient room for them ri llm white chnrclics for their accommodation they are unable to sead as custom or law and generally both prohibit their instruction they have no bible no family altars and when in affliction sickness or death they have no minister to address to them the consolations of the gospel nor to bury them with solemn and appropriate services they may sometimes be petted and caressed as children and toys they are never treated as men heathenism says another southern authority is as real in the slave states us in the south sea islands chastity is no virtue among them the slaves its violation neither injures the female character in their own estimation nor that of their mistress when there b no marriage recognized by the state or church as legal and permanent between slaves where the lemalc slave is wholly in her masters power how can it be otherwise said the roman proverb nothing is unlawful for the master to his slave when men arc counted as things instrument of husbandry separable limbj of the master and retained in subjugation by external force and the prohibition of all manly culture the effect of slavery on its victim is so obvious that no more need be said thereof the eltect of slavery on the intellectual moral and religious condition of the free population of the south is not so obvious perhaps at first sight but a comparison with the free sates will render that also plain all attempts at the improvement of the humbler and more exposed portions of society the perishing and dangerous classes thereof originate in the free states it is there that men originate societies for tire reform of prisons the prevention of crime pauperism intemperance licentiousness and ignorance there spring up education societies bible societies peace societies societies for teaching christianity in foreign and barbarous land there too are the learned and philosophical societies for the study of science letters and art whence come the men of superior education who occupy the pulpits exercise the professions of law and medicine or fiil the chairs of the professors in the colleges of the union almost all from the north from the free states there is preaching everywhere but search the whole southern states for the last sevenand forty years and it were hard to showa single preacher of any

separate religious organizations for the exclusive use of colored persons is the countenance and support which they give to exclusive colored schools the very existence of the former is an argument in favor of the latter if there be any good reason for a j colored church the same will hold good in regard to a colored school and indeed toi every other institution founded on complexion negro pews in the church negro boxes in the theatre negro cars on the railroad uc gro berths in the steamboat negro churches and negro schools in the community are all ihe jjetnicious fruit of a wicked unnatural and blasphemous prejudice against our god given complexion and as such stand dire j in the way of our progress and equality the axe must be laid at the root of the tree this whole system of things is false foul and infernal and should receive our most earnest and unceasing reprobation the evils of separate colored schools are obvious to the common sense of all their very tendency is to produce feelings of superiority in the minds of white children and a sense of inferiority in those of colored children thus producing pride on the one hand and servility on the other and making those who would be the best of friends the worst of enemies as we have frequently urged on the platform and elsewhere prejudice is not the creature of birth but of education when a toy in the streets of baltimore we were never objected to by our white playfellows on account of our color when the hat was tossed up for a choice of partners in the play we were selected as readily ms any other boy and were esteemed as highly as any no one ever objected to our complexion wei could run as fast jump as far throw the ballas direct and true and catch it with as much j dexterity and skill as the white boys and were esteemed for what we could do and such in our judgment would be the case here at the north but for the many influences tending to a separation of white from colored children wc shall however have more to say on this subject at mother tune for it is one which ought to receive speedy and um i rough attention not only in this community but throughout the union another reason against colored churcbet originates in the character and qualification of the moil aluuwt universally and necessarily employed as their teachers and pastors will few exceptions colored ministers have no th mental qualification to instruct and improve their congregations and instead ol advancing they retard the intellectual progress of the people some of the must popular colored preachers in this country are met unable to write their own names and mam of them are unable to read without spelling half their words colored churches form i field for this class of wouldbe ministers and their existence is one great reason of the ignorance and mental inactivity and general want of enterprise among us as a class wc have heard them denounce w hat they cailcc iuiutlearning as an evil to religion saying that the letter killeth but the apirii gtvcili life and that all we should care abou is to get to heaven when we die of conn the eftct of such teachers and teaching is u establish the conviction that ignorance h bliss and it is folly to he wise a virtu ii made of ignorance and sound is preferred n sense tn point of elevation and improve me lit w icked as are the white churches am cuirupt ua are

aad equality on the saase roods where fire yean ago they were insulted and degraded we should like to aee the same course pursued toward white churches colored members shoold go ia and take seats without regard to their complexion and allow themselves to he dragged out by the ministers elders and deacons such a course would very soon settle the question and in the right way it would compel the church to develop her character in such a manner at either to secure the rights of her colored members or to secure her own destruction we shall practice on this principle and in every instance give whits religious worshippers the trouble of removing us from among them or the pain of enduring our dark appearance another evil of colored churches ia their expensirencss colored people are scattered over the country in small numbers and are j generally poor and to be compelled to build churches lor themselves and hire i their own minister is by no means a trifling hardship the minister and his family must be supported though the members have scarcely the means of living to say nothing of the means of educating and improving the minds of their children we have knows of churches composed of a dozen good colored women and as many men the former gaining their living over the washtub and the latter obtaining theirs by daily toil at the same time supporting a minister and hb family at an expense of from two to three hundred dollars a year ohio black laws in no state of this union are there to be found laws more cruel unjust and atrocious than those on the statute book of ohio an assembly of devils could not have enacted laws more infernal and better fitted to promote crime than what arc called the black laws of that state during our antislavery tour through ohio last summer in company with william lloyd garrison we frequently called attention to these wicked and disgraceful laws and exhorted the people to demand their repeal they have done so for the people in northern ohio are ashamed ofthose laws and though they have succeeded in getting an excellent report in favor of repeal through the trickery of pandering politicians the bill to repeal them was defeated by a vote of to the discussion in the legislature on this subject affords some excellent illustrations oi political morality and sense of accountability take the following for example mr culbertson declared ills utter deflation of the disgraceful acts w hich are wellknown and well named as the black laws but in the county wliich he represents on this floor muskingum the question had not rn min assod before the peoplebut he felt it to be his duty in direct opposition to his own opinion to vote as he knew the majority of his constituents desired upon the subject lie should now vote against the repeal but should he be sent bade with the opinions which he took the present occasion to make known to the worw his vote should be given for freeing our statute books from the disgrace which such enactments brought upon thun is ho not a moral man are you not forcibly struck with his manly port and independent bearing his body in columbus and his conscience in muskingum he brands the law s as disgraceful and generously disgraces himself by refusing to repeal them lie marks them with his utter detestation and renders himself detestable by sustaining them is he not a perfect gem of his kind

than is found in the black laws of ohio we have no language to express our sense ef the mean wicked and worse than savage character of the men who by refusing to repeal have reenacted these

such what ia a slave state t ihe legitimate operation of the law respecting testimony is to tempt white persons to rob cheat and plunder those of color and not a few have yielded to the temptation under this law a white man may commit any outrage on his black neighbor with the most complete impunity in the debate on the bill to repeal these wicked unjust mischievous laws a mr nigh said he should vote against the repeal of the black laws because he was individually opposed to their repeal he thought they were right and would never have been placed upon our statute books had there not been a reason for it and he would j not be instrumental in removing the moral sense of a thug could not be i more dark lifeless and foul than ia that of i mr nigh he thinks the black laws right and is opposed to their repeal on that ground to such a man argument ia un j necessary we think a colored skin for a short time might be of service to his moral vision the man who can pronounce such laws right would have no moral hesitancy in committing murder and yet a majority of the assembled wisdom of ohio have by refusing to repeal those laws virtually said to the world we believe those laws to be right when slavery gets mastery the whole moral constitution becomes inverted and men become the incarnation of devils we cannot dismiss this subject without expressing our sincere thanks to mr blake for his able argument in favor of the repeal of those laws as well as his efibrts in behalf ofa law against the use of state jails and state officers in arresting and detaining fugitive slaves we must also thank mr a h lewis and mr b randeu for their able report in favor of the repeal of the black laws we shall give our readers extracts from it in our next number let our friends in ohio

expressions of honor for his memory each incident of his long and eventful life is seized upon with avidity and every effort is made to magnify and extend his feme this feeling of respect and veneration is not felt entirely by white persons but is shared to a considerable degree by the oppressed and despised colored people they remember with characteristic gratitude the heroic conduct of the deceased in defending the sacred right of petition his mighty exposures of the slave power and its aggressions on the rights of the north the glorious victory achieved over the slave oligarchy in

population op the south turn to laboring freemen south of the potomac and if you care nothing about slaves care for your own color j g palfrey it has been demonstrated that men reduced to a condition of slavery are in the lowest depths of degradation indeed almost beneath the pale of humanity were goods and chattels personal to be used adjudged and held to all intents constructions and purposes whatsoever it is evident that labor performed by such persons lias the same degradation attached to it the principal part of labor and the rude as indeed some of the fine mechanic arts at the south are performed by slaves this is prejudicial to the interest of the poor freeman for while the planter the contractor and the master mechanic can command the labor of slaves giving in return but a bare subsistence the stermr necessities of life they will not employ freemen giving them in return a sufficiency to maintain themselves and families with respectability and educate their children and even if they were willing to employ them freemen will never content to be the y okafellows of tasked and plundered slaves such being the ease it is evident that the effect of slavery is not beneficial to the poor freemen who comprise by far the greater part of the population of the south they look upon labor with contempt and will do anything to drag out a precarious existence rather than labor and those that woik are the slaves of noeentety mad are looked upon as the equals of goods and chattels so strong is this contempt for labor in the bosom of the peer white mss at the sooth that the writer

discussion declaring through their public journals that the question of slavery ia not and shall not be open to discussion that tbo moment any individual undertakes to lecture them upon its evils c at that moment shall his tongue be cut out and cast upon a dunghill they fear that a discussion of it would enlighten and awaken the poor white man to his interest and that the patriarchal institution would be doomed hence this censorship of the press this fettering of speech and mind bat truth crushed to earth wiujrisc again a discussion at the north will drive the slaveholder at the south into a

understand me you will recollect that the meeting took a different turn from what many had anticipated and that a desultory discussion was for some time carried on between our disunion and liberty party friends on the character of the u s constitution and that i stated that my views did not agree with either of them that i belived that there were some offices that an honest man could nor accept of and others that he could i staled that i believed an oath was to be judged of by the obligations a person taking ike oath thereby took upon himself that the obligations were to be ascertained by the expressed requirements of the government or people of the person qualifying contended that a qualified asscsser of the town of winfield did not take upon himself by the qualifying oath any mote obligation to go and put down a slave insurrection than rested upon him before he was so qualified and that the powers that be so acknowledged it by the absence of all special requirement on such person to do such act i stated that if s s foster resided in winfield and aeall was alike made on him and an assessor to go and help put down an insurrection of the slaves and should both refuse to go for aught knew the powers that be might chain them together and force them where they were ordered but that i knew no law that would inflict onehalf a hairs weight of punishment upon the assessor for such refusal than upon friend foster and for the reason that tb powers that be had never considered that they had placed suit assessor under special obligation to go or that he had placed himself usds any special obligations by his oath to go stated umt mere assertions that yoti have worn to go and that the oath meane so and so were mere assertions that aa oath was tobe judged of the world over by the obligations thereby incurred and that the governments wove not slow to define what the obligation vested on thoee qualifying were by expressed requirements stated that the state of massachusetts had forbidden her state officers under point and penalties from obstructing the sight or arrest of the fugitive on our ami which few i am informed was passed s accordance with ths deeitemi of the u s lowt in ths pngg csss now i believe that we were badly cheated when our fathers mode the eeretitotienal bargain and that slavery has takes and can taka away comtitu tkmally many of onr rights but for uua i do not wish to give up other rights unless it ha shown plainly and not by mere amer tisn that it aa wrung to enjoy them i iovo hhertj more than thin union and if slavery fl oontmas to lire and

prayer ihe president introduced mr douglass who expressed himself in substance as fullovve it is with emotions of sincere pleasure that i rise to address you this evening added to the satisfaction winch i ever experience in advocating any movement intended to promote the wellbeing and happiness of my fellowcountrymen is that arising out of the fact of being invited to address a white audience wholly unconnected with the movement with which i am especially and peculiarly identified it is quite a period in my ovvn aswell as die history of the progress of free principles in this city for one of my complexion to be thus invited and thus honored t his pleasure and privilege i frequently enjoyed while in another country but believe it is die first tunc i have been so honored in this my own my native land i must however be allowed to say that though this is a somewhat new theme for me i cannot promise to say anything new or original upon it the subject has been in one shape or another before the public nearly thirty yearn during thia time it has occupied the minds of many of the wisest and best men of the nation it may be fairly questioned if any one popular movement in this country ever drew out an equal amount and variety of talent in it behalf the bench bar and pulpit have all contributed their eloquent streams to the cool and ever refreshing tide of living water mighty however as has been all this combination a mightier and more thrilling eloquence is that which has come up from the dramshop and gutter the simple straightforward unvarnished narration of individual sufferingthe graphic pictures of family distress and ruinthe painful exhibition of shattered and broken constitutionstf le erful exposures of the subtle schemes and alluring charms of rumvenders have nearly all come from this class of person ri who have seen heard and felt the working of the prisonhouse there have reasoned where reasoning was necessary the denounced where

political office the churchmembers and demons whose proper influence wan withheld from reforming the drunkard and whose example in too many instances had scaled his rain all and each of these classes would oftumes evade the pointed rebuke and transfer responsibility from themselves to their neighbors and were all in a degree guilty yet no one class was wholly and only to blame but the drinking system was tle foundation of existing evils and this system it was the appropriate mission of the friends of humanity to exon themselves zealously to abolish after alluding to the many and effectual ways of discountenancing the use of alcohol of rendering the trade in its every manifestation disreputableand of extending in the true washingtonian style the hand of sympathy and encouragement to a fallen bro j ther the lecturer adverted to the injury which the cause had sustained by being blended j with politics the reformation had been j retarded instead of accelerated it had been dragged down from its once lofty position l and been made the tool of demagoguesa steppingstone on which many had been pro moted to office while the cause itself was under no obligation to them for advancement it is probably one of the most difficult things in the world to save a reformatory movement from corruption the thousands who may i flock around its standard are led there from various motives aside from promoting the cause itself no moral reformation was ever consummated by political maneuvering as the facts in the history of the antimasomc antislavery and the various other reforms abundantly proved moral suasion was the godappointed means for reforming the world the mild and peaceful weapons of love are more efficacious than those of force hei thought the temperance party in relying j upon politics to advance the cause were ex j peeting more purity in the ballotbox than in the church but it is vain to expect the stream ito rise higher than the fountain if the church occupied a right position its influence would be powerfully felt on this question in thus expressing his dissent from what he presumed to be the conviction of many of the audience lie asked only to be regarded as honest and sincere feeling assured of their concurrence with him in the sentiment that even error might be safely tolerated where truth is free to combat itin the course of his remarks mr douglass awarded an eloquent tribute to the rare virtues and zeal of father mattliew as the temperance redeemer of ireland his labors and sacrifceshis devotion to the cause could not be overestimated he had seen hirn administer the pledge to thousands and had himself been presented with one of the temperance medals by the venerable fathers own hand ilis manner of appeal was original and impressive and geuerally succeeded in persuading the multitude befote him to knee down and receive the temperance pledge mr douglass observing many colored citizens present improved the opportunity of enforcing upon them in a special manner j their being enlisted under the temperance banner for this one among other reasons that by their peculiar position in the land they could not afford to be otherwise he would bare llie colored people occupy a moral eminence so high as to command the respect of an entire community he invoked the cooperation of all both white and black in the great cause of temperance for as all who used the intoxicating cup were degraded in hke degree would the condition of all be elevated by abstaining entirely from its pernicious influence and this fact he thought was potent in hself in establishing the identity of the human family at the conclusion of mr douglasss ad j dress a vote of thanks was unanimously tendered by the meeting after which a dia etissiun arose among the members as to the est means of manifesting their temperance i principles at the ensuing city election during which the merits of the several candidates were freely canvassed there were many noble sentiments expressed by the speakers one of whom mr greig congratulated the meeting on the union now so happily manifested by advocates of temperance antislavery and other reforms all were meeting on one platform exchanging views and laboring hand in hand to hastes the goodtime coming names were being affixed to the pledge while a temperance hymn was sung aod the meeting adjourned evidently feeling that the cause of temperance had gained a dayw c x war on christian principles th following anomalous paragraph maybe found in the proposed treaty of peace between this country and mexico any future war that may break out between mexico and the united states is to be conducted on christian principles and according to the usages of civilized nations there is here first a confession of guilt and secondly a promise of amendment the confession a war has been carried on with mexico not in accordance with christian principles and the usages of mzed nations the promise that any future war that may break out will be earned on on those principles the confession is somewhat unexpected but few will deny its troth verily the war has not been conducted on christian principles no one who knows anything about christianity will attempt to gainsay this assertion as to the usages of aoealkd criibsed nations in the amftterof war there is net amah differ eaee between thank the harhnrilirs prvpn

also a promise of better things aad ia it bes the difficulty any future war tw break out is to be conducted oa christian principles and in accordance with the usages of civ dried nations we here seen that the mexican war thus far has not very widely departed from those usagesthat ia it has been carried oa in opposition to and to the destruction of every worthy sentiment of bomanity but a war conducted inaccordance with christian principles what kind of war is that paul says the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but spiritual he had never beard of cannons muskets bombshells and the other deathdealing instruments of civilized warfare he killed neither men women nor children he bombarded no towns nor burned villages nor desolated countries it seems therefore that a war on christian principles cannot be inaccordance with civilized usages how can we explain this can mr trist explain may it not be that the conclusion of the sentence is merely a rhetorical flourish to which no particular meaning need be attached and that generals scott taylor and the other christian warriors having learned by experience the cruelty and barbarity and uiter inutility of the mode of warfare which they have hitherto pursued have resolved on beating their swords into ploughshares and their spears into priminghooks and taking in their stead the spiritual weapons of the ajiostle well would it be for the world if all the men of war in this and all other countries would speedily come to the same laudable resolution the heroes ol the mexican war may perhaps handle their weapons rather awkwardly at first but they will not on that account be discouraged thev of all men need not to be reminded that it is always thus with the raw recruit and that practice and discipline make tolerably good soldiers out of the clumsiest and most incapable may they soon have an opportunity to commence this new war upon mexico their victories will be more glorious in proportion as they will

yearsnecessary in order to obtain a pension for his widow the public treasury thus economized the widows mite and she had nothing but thirty acres of ground to the proceeds of which she was soon enabled to join six hundred francs a year the rent of a license to sell tobacco this was ob tamed for her by m dc violaines her cousin who was forest guard of the duke of orleans now king and by i his advice alexandre was sent to a village school kept by an old priest who charged his scholars sixty cents a month i here dumas acquired his education and at the age of fifteen was apprenticed to a notary public in whose office he j copied deeds until he was twenty only dreaming of some day becoming notary general of the district just then the count dc leuven was exiled from paris by the bourbons and coming to reside at villers cottcrets dumas became acquainted w ith young adolphe de leuven who had just left college he inflamed dumas with a desire to f compose pieces for the theatres and the two young men wrote a vaudeville called un diner djlnis it was sent to a manager hut he refused to have it performed alleging that it would certainly be hisseda refusal that only stimulated the writers to compose i another but the literary partnership was dissolved by the return of the lcuvensto paris and dumas determined to follow them his mother sold her plot of land giving him sixty francs less than twelve dollars and her blessinghe played a game of dominoes with the stage proprietor and won ti place arrived at paris he hired a small garret at a hotel in the place de italians and called on general foy who had been his fathers friend to ask for some situation which would enable him to gain his bread until his litcran labours were productive what canst thou do r asked the general nothing replied dumas nothing why thou must know a little of mathematics of drawing of grammar of latinin fact all those studies that every one knows no general j must say that have never been a very hard student and am deplorably ignorant diablc that is embarrassing no matterleave me your address and i will see what i can find for the to do dumas sat down at a table tool ome paper and wrote the general who had been watching him crier ut hell well didst thou not sa thou didst not know am thing and see thy handwriting is splendid thais something and i hope will procun thee a good

loversof french ro mancea woman whose mind opposed napoleon whose eye pierced to the bottom of his soul and sounded all the most hidden depths of his heart madam de stael swayed at her will a thousand varied passions and her corinne is one of the inasterpieces of romance and her delphiue too where one finds the germs of her subsequently developed opinions the romance of her own life though her death is not there she passed away in paris in and but an hour before she gave up the ghost requested to be permitted to look once more upon the sun her friends carried her into her garden and thereunder the shade of a favorite rose tree she gave them its leaves as souvenirs with words of affection of love of hope madame de genlis came next that volatile woman who instilled everything but moral principle into the mind of louis philippe the exiles dc la si berie of madame cottin not only immortalized her but gave to silvio pclico the first idea of his le mic peigioni and here we are arrived at the present epoque when romance has left its thin volumes and the shelves of circulating libraries you will find it in the columns of the daily press the intellectual life of the nineteenth century the groat agent of moral civilization as dickens culls it long and brilliant has thus been the way of romance in france and the most popular of its ministering writers by far is alexandre dumas his writings are read with far greater avidity than those of sue or balzac or even that gifted woman whose syrenlike thoughts win the heart while they destroy its purity george sand dumas

accomplished by the most laboured delineations he visited spain in the suite of the duke de montpensier and his personal appearance sparkling wit and generous extravagance created a great sensation at madrid he was seranaded saluted by applause at the theatres and had his praises chanted by all the many poets none ofthese ovations are mentioned in his book in which a mere of the amusing personal adventures of his friends serves as a canvas on which to give vivid sketches of national peculiarities and manners lie was enabled while in spain to indulge his love of dress and gallantry vices to

as large as parson daytons francis wilson did not interrupt this iuj errogatory and exclamatory medley op words from his comrade by an explanation until he had exhausted all his incoherent inquiries sitting down in the proffered chair and lighting his long nine edward saunders placed his i feet upon his friends clean desk and seemed really to be waiting for a detailed account of the modus operandi by which an apprentice could acquire honestly such a collection of books nor did frank hesitate to gratiiy his curiosity both of the young men were in the middle of their apprenticeship and the most cordial intimacy had subsisted between them from their youth edward was deficient in nothing so much as in expending his small annuity and francis hit upon a very l successful method of administering to bis young friend a salutary lesson upon this subject while he explained how an apprentice could acquire a taste and the means for the cultivation of his in tellect edward said he taking op his pencil will explain to you in figures what seems to have excited your wonder if you will permit me by the i way of asking yon a few questions in order to solve the problem see you are very food of smoking how many i cigars do you buy a weak oh none of any account replied edward anticipating some unpleasant strictures upon his fevorite practise n after working all day k it ready a comfort in uxe the genuine hanoi it does not amount to ijr thing i smolre only six in tks course of the whole week six havanas s week repealed francis putting it down spas paper with as much formality as if he eras registering the date of a problem six a week at two easts a iriece amount to the trifling sum of six dollars and twentyfour cents per annum i suppose you speod n trifle at tbm fruit shops continued francis nothing worth mentioning continued edward rather startled at the aggregate of such little itemsr ell that buyapples nuts raisins figs oranges c acdo not amount to more than nine pence a week why thats not half as much as tom williams the goldsmiths apprentice buys besides francis you know i never taste a drop of any kind of liquor not even wine you certainly cant think that lack economy frankf ninepence a week for nuts raisins oranges and figs repeated francis in a low serious tone pronouncing the items one by one as he wrote them downwith all the precision and gravity of a clerk in a counting room ninepence a week amounts to six dollars and fifty cents per annum which added to six dollars and twentyfour cents spent for cigars mokes the trifling sum of twelve dollars and seventyfour cents for one year now edward sec what i have obtained for just this sum here said he taking down several neatly bound volumes of the american review and a handful of the knicker i have bought all these for aless sum than you have paid for cigars nuts c during the past year and as for these other books which you see here in my case i will tell you how i obtained them and how any other apprentice can do the same with only a year too you know our masters are very industrious steady men and are attentive in their business and like to see their apprentices with a book in their hands when they have done their work rather than lounging about at the taverns or in vicious company so when my master saw that i liked to read every chance that i could get and spend all the money i could spare fori books he offered to give a ninepence jan hour for all the time i would work from twelve to one oclock p m and this is the way edward that i have bought my books which you thought had borrowed begged or stolen i i work every noontime half an hour and earn every fortnight enough to buy one j of these booksmiltons paradise lost for instance to be sure they are not bound in calf nor are they giltedged j but they contain the same matter as if they were and thats enough for i me when edward saunders had listened to this very interesting and simple cxj planation of his uncles apprentice and had passed his eyes over all the fine books in his little library he arose suddenly at the last words of francis and opened his little chamber windowtook out of his hat the half dozen cigars which was to constitute his weeks stock of comfort and without saying a word tossed them into the garden anew fire of animation lit up his eye as he darted out of the room turning only at the door to say ill try  frank edward saunders esq and the hon francis wilson never forgot in their intimate intercourse in after life their mutual computation of the cost of nuts and cigars
