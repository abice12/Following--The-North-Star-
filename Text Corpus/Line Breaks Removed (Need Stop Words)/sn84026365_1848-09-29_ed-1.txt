the american religion pro slavery messrs editors my object iri directing the attention of your readers tc the proslavery tendency of the protestant religion ol this country is to trace its effect on the moral intellectual social and civil condition of the colored optilation with the hope of divorcing from their minds the fatal impression that by embracing said religion abey are espousing the cause of human freedom if i can successfully demonstrate this truth in my opinion one of the most formidable obstacles to oui future advancement will he removed therefore i assert that the p rotes tant religion is note and has been cvei since the days of the reformation opposed to the religious natural civil ant social equality of the colored peoplt with the whites it has assumed tlia we were by nature nml a law o providence a distinct and inferior peo pic that ought to be subject to th rule and dominion of those wlion god in ins wisdom had made superior nd assigned the duty ol a guurdianship ivcr us and our posterity forever tie protestant sects have united in proinot ing this doctrine for upwards ot a century and it may now be regarded a inseparable from their creed therefore every individual that embraces sai religion and lives in obedience to it teachings must from the very natur of his education and theological views imbibe its spirit and principles hence i maintain that it ought not t be a matter of surprise to find the col red people religiously occupying proslavery position the kind of education and religion we have obtained has placed us on our present platform therefore i cannot hurl denuncia lory anathemas against the colore churches and clergy as being hypocritical because they occupy a proslavery position on the contrary i is to my mind a distinguished mark o loyalty to the church when i see it members taking sides with our oppres aors and if the term hypocrite rightfully belongs to any class of our people it is to those who arc sufficiently enlightened to see the evil of their position und still embrace it for the majority who cling to those ancient laudmarks i entertain sentiments of regard fo their welfare whilst my pity for thei ignorance is boundless because the know not the evil they do from the period of the america revolution to the present hour hist or asserts that the leaders in every inora movement for the benefit of the liuinai family have been denounced as beinj cither of fanatical temperament or het rodox in faith the greut ruling idea that gave birth to the declaration o american independence was

the bold infidel doctrine that all mei were created tree and equal iiurlet the keystone of divinity from the decalogue of protestantism and with it thorn magic charms that had for centurici subjected the people of different nation to the despotic rule of kings and princes the pilgrim fathers have give us an illustrious example for gioriou imitation by repudiating the religion o their oppressors

happiness on authorities that had existed antecedent to church organizationsthe rights of nature that was imprinted on the heart of manon the first mooring of his existence the same in all times and in all ages this revolution was not accomplished by a reverential and worshipful obedience to the church its pioneers were not bishops prelates laymen or those learned lawyers in the service of the crown it was performed by men professing higher and holier aspirations for freedom than evei breathed through the nostrils of the knights of the gown or garter it sprang from natures noblemen the jclfersons the adamss the paines the franklins and others who were the infidels of their own times and the orthodox of coming generations with them the motto was liberty first now and forever they made their religion sanctify right to freedom while ours crucifies it this faithful adherence to the fundamental right of man to exist on this globe brought them into a powerful collision with the powers that be and resulted in a prodigal expenditure ol blood and treasure yet in this instance victory perched upon the banner of the faithful in this conflict protestantism after losing a portion ol her power made a base appeal to the avarice and cupidity of our infant nati n the firstborn of the earth from a divine parentage yet wrapped in swaddling clothes and dictated a compromise that ought to have been an insult to her virgin purity she was successful and loathsome disgrace and dishonor followed the foul embrace the substance of the compromise was simply this that the divine right of kings should he abrogated on this continent and the divine l ight of complexion be substituted v w columbus sept th buffalo sep dear douglass when last saw you promised to notice some of the doings of that notorious wolf in sheeps clothing kcv j b pinney who has at intervals for many years passed through the country doing the dirty work ol slaverys bidding under the garb ol philanthropy as agent of the american colonization society he has finally made his debut in a series of four lectures before an audience of from o to iou a portion of which were those that do not sympathise with his darling scheme the base ingratitude manifested towards tlte colored peoplt throughout his lectures justly merits the disapprobation of every honesl american would go at length tc show up his false position were i not acquainted with the fact that the menu and demerits of the colonization society have years since been analysed anc that it has received its everlasting quietus so far as the realization of the end in view is to be obtained he introduced himself by a mournful appeal with uplifted hand to iieaven to assist the colonization society it doing something for the down trodden and abused negro he made but very little progress in his remarks before he got off the track of his unbounded benevolence by appealing to the prejudices of the people of the impossibility of the colored mans being elevated in this country and whether any of the audience or even the most humble among the whites would be willing thal the most intelligent among the colored men should marry their daughter that the slave holders could not emancipate their slaves and suffer them to remain at the south that as soon as they received education they would demand equal political privileges and their numbers being much greater than thal of the whites they w ould become the law makers and the whites subject tc the blacks that the whites would never submit to black judges black lawyers see c that this government was not responsibile for slavery england was the guilty culprit in forcing it upon us and never ceasing their traf ic until the law was passed breaking up the slave trade and then they were loudest in calling for emancipation then the abolitionists were complained of for galling the slaveholders thieves and robbers and that they ought to bepaid for their slaves irginia be said always deplored the system and in her early history more than were emancipated and were on the eve ol final emancipation when the abolitionists commenced which turned back the tide ol emancipation and compelled the south to enact laws prohibiting emancipations on the soil that the law was just the blacks were a poor degraded thievish set of beings consequently a law that would be considered barbarous to inflict over an enlightened people would be a just oue over those unenlightenedmeaning the colored people that they were not fit for liberty unless educated he also stated that the colonization society had no idea ol tending ail the blacks out ol right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren i r ic r h the country that it was a scheme of the purest benevolence ever started in world that no white laborers would settle in a community cursed with slave labor that the rapid increase of white emigrants in this country would at sotne future day so fill up the south that they would outnumber the blacks and then they might legislate for their frec dom he said c m clay the great abolitionist told him in conversation last year when he asked him what he would do or what would kentucky do j when her slaves were emancipated and hit reply was that he had not givj en that idea of the subject any constd jeration no doubt said he they would become so debased and profligate that vkyddq dfad become extinct bufbc did not care for that he was for benefiting the white man the next hundred years said he without the carrying out of his scheme of colonization would then be fotind not three garrisonian abolitionists across mason and dixons line but already had the inhabitants of liberia arisen to equality with the whites citing as proof president roberts and others recently in new york and the attention paid them by the mayor c of that city i will not quote further these were some of his prominent positions as taken in his different lectures i will now leave you to comment if you deem it necessary every careful reader can sec the unreasonableness and entire contradiction of his own statements note two or three he never can be elevated with the whites already oni an equality with those who arc in africa poor degraded and profligate but as soon as transported across the ocean to africa a heathen country the transition produces all that is noble refined iand cultivated no white laborers would settle in a country cursed with slave labor when the emigrants fill ed up the south so as to out number the blacks then it would answer to legislate for freedom this is a sample ol that mans reasoning who dr baconl editor of the day book says that he not only retains but obtained from birth some of that blood which he despises but that he can prove him as well as roberts the president of the republic of liberia men of no principle dishonest and much more of what constitutes bad men challenged him to a disj cushion but of course he refused i leave him to bis own destruction which he is rapidly working out i purpose culling a public meeting next week and review his argument yours for justice a francis muss its

left the school when they heard that a colored child was about to be admitted amongst them this report is wholly without foundation not one of them left or thought of leaving on that account the facts of the case arc as stated by mr douglass in last weeks paer namely that the i pupils instead of objecting were most willing that his daughter should be admitted and that one only one of their parents was found unchristian enough uncivilized enough to oppose her admission and that one was g warner editor of the rochester courier and further when it was found j that she was uot to be admitted three left the school andthrce more whom it was intended j to send there were sent to other achools where the teachers were not under the influence of an ignorant and unreasoning pre judicej d cause and effect it is a law in physics as it is in morals that every cause is followed by a fixed and i unvarying effect in the physical world fire is always hot ice is always cold no one in his senses ever

all of course are not alike influenced by surrounding circumstances some have a greatersome a less affinity to vice still the rule is sufficiently unvarying jas stated by the apoatle paulthat otil i

this country will be sufficient to show how far we are from a just j appreciation of this truth in the southern states of this union there are three millions of human being whom it is criminal to instruct no it will not do to instruct them say their masters if they get intelligent we cannot hold them in slavery they say this and they say it with truth and to keep those three millions from claiming what but a little instruction will enable them to discovernamely the inherent right of every man to himself and the means of making good that righttheir truly pious and godly masters close against them as far as they have the ability all the avenues to knowledge and intelligence they keep men ignorant make them debased and then say they are not fit for freedom most satisfactory logic truly the effect of this viola i lion of moral law of course follows those who are thus wickedly excluded from the means of acquiring knowledge are ignorant coarse and in too many instances vicious and a universal demoralization and depraved i state of public sentiment are the retributive results and who is to blame for this that the man should be ignorant w bo has not been permitted to learu is

this wickedness but to those who perpetrate it j nor does this selfoverreaching injustice of the dominant class end here in the north we find colored men degraded and injured j they are not provided with sufficient means of education they are rubbed as far as possible of the ability to procure education for themselves in some places they are admitted into the schools only on sufferance and in others they are altogether excluded the consequence of tlus is that they are as a class more ignorant and less useful than the majority of their while fellowcitizens and they are it is probable as vice is the necessary concomitant of ignorance also more vicious who again is to blame for this not the i innocent victims of the inflicted ignorance but those who inflict this ignorance upon them it is tidiculousit is cruelly unjust j first to force i goo ranee upon them and then to taunt them with mfenurtty first to them vicious and then to denounce them as wicked and unfit for political

may at one and the same time be a christian and a slaveholder sorry indeed should we be to entertain such a low estimate of christianity it does not appear to ua more paradoxical or absurd to speak of a pious devil oran honest rogue than it doe to speak of a christian slaveholder our present object however is not to argue this question but simply to show on the authority of the contributor to what an extent slavery is sustained and practised by the different religious denom inationsespecially by the methodists baptists and presbyterians ichabod christians and slaverya published calculation how accurate we do not know stales that slaves are held by methodists by baptists and by presbyterians add to all other denominations and you have slaves held by religious men the average number to each may be about ten which will give us religious men holding slaves what ought these religious slaveholders to do some will say immediately and at all hazards emancipate their slaves others will any go to work immediately and with earnestness as citizens of the country to procure the rep al of the laws others will cay commence immediately and sincerely the work of giving instruction to the slaves to prepare them for freedom but will any intelligent christian say that these slaveholders are discharging their duty while eating and wasting ibe earnings of their slaves aud making no effort in auy way to give them their freedom since the above was written we see that the national era estimates all the riavehold era in the united states at which would give about the same proportion between slaves and slaveholders as the above calculation think of the immense mischief which these slaveholders are doing in the midst of a population of id the blackstone chronicle a beautifully printed and ably

hunkers of the th district of massachusetts now so ably represented by i mr palfrey r f i liberia ul the slnretmdr the ehtor of the nnw york day book has published several articles on liberia and coloniaanon from which extracts relating to j the retr j b pinney were made io a recent number of the north star these articles also furnish startling evidence of the fact that the officers and agents of the colony have been deeply implicated in the slave trade true it is some time since the occurrence of the events which he relates but up to the present day there is no evidence to show that either the spirit or the practice of those concerned in that alfiur are in any material degree improved the revelations here made are neither worse nor better than might have been expected from a society some of whose most prominent men are slaveholders says the editor of the day book the public will bo impressed with the fact that a prominent member of the baptist denomination in liberia was openly engiged in the slavctrade was in the employ of r dro i bianco in and that this business was frcclv tolerated in liberia without censure or question from ain body at the very time when the colonization agents in this country were demanding money from the deceived benevolent public on the ground that the colony of liberia was the most efficient means for the suppression of the african slavctrade all tbw is admitted and if it were denied it could habmsly proved mmr of the delegation payne states thwpß was not engaged in the slave trade at any me and was not at new sweaters in this is probably true and he may be exonerated from this particular charge butin correcting the day books crroi why did he not go on and show that it was his brother that was in the employ of the siavetraders at new sesters this mr paynes brother a little younger than he and very strongly resembling hun in appearance did with the knowledge and approval of his relatives engage as an auxiliary to the slavctrade and was at new sesters at the time specified his mothers house was the regular stopping place for the spanish and portuguese slave traders when they visited monroviawho were i in fact the principal support of the family if this mr payne inherited or even received any money from his mother he must have partaken of the profits of the slavetrade the editor of the day book not being sufficiently familiar with the initials of the two paynes had supposed that the brother whom he knew at new sesters was the person subsequently ordained as pastor they were both very good young men nephews of the pastor of the baptist church and most of ihe family were quite religious according to the liberian standard but now will mr pavne or any of the agents of the colonization society who know anything about the facts venture to say that church members in liberia did not at that time freely aid and promote the slavctrade whenever they could find cmploytne t from the siavetraders will they contend tint it was considered immoral or improper to do so or that there could have been any church censure applied to a communicant who subsisted entirely upon he money made by him in the slavetrade there wes never a word of cm sure uttered by any liberian against those thus employed the pastor of the baptist church at that time the rev colin teage uncle of mr p avne was employed at the same time j with john n lewis to store cargoes for i pedro blanco his storehouse was also a depot for siavetraders and he received plenty j of money from blanco without hesitation there were dozens and scores of liberian christians actively and joyfully engagtd in the slave trade without any more compunction than they would have felt about the palm oil trade it is a notorious fact in africa that the colony of liberia was for two years an important auxiliary to the slavctrade and that ihe facilities and conveniencics of the slavers were vastly increased by it the span ish and portuguese siavetraders were alj ways heartily welcomed and were ihe most popular men that ever visited liberia their company was considered a great honor and favor and all were eager for their notice it should be know n too by ihe people of this country that the liberian colonists themselves freely bought and owned slaves at that time and undoubtedly som them to their spanish and portuguese visitors when they could get a goxl price in doubloons for thorn especially in the starving times so often occurring there of the latter point however the w ri ter has no posiiive proof of the fact that the colonists professed christians bought and held slaves without scruple there can be no denial by any man of truth who has lived in liberia and become familiar with the customs morals and habits of the people there the editor of the day book was advised and strongly urged by a prominent and most respectable and religious liberian high in office to purchase two slaves for his household on account of the difficulty of retaining free natives for any considerable length of lime in one steady employment the dr also accuses president roberts of having been connected with tho slavetrade while residing in liberia to this roberts replies bacon accuses me of being employed in as the agent employee and factor of pedro blanco the greatest aiavetrader on the coastand that i was employed by him blanco to purchase vessels in sierre leone to be used as slavers now sir to be short emphatically do elare that i never saw or corresponded with pedro blanco in my life i have never been employed at any time by him or any other slaver either directly or indirectly as an agent employee or factor or in any oihei way during my residence in africa to this defence dr bacon thus responds he says he never corresponded with pedro blanco in his life uundouhtedly true he never saw him if by corresponding he means that he never wrote a letter to him or received one from him that rnay be true also but there arc other ways of corresponding than by writing it is very evident that a letter from pedro blanco who knew only the spanish language could not have been read by joe roberts who knew no language but the english and a letter to the latter would be equally unintelligible the former their transactions therefore must have been earned on through some medium which the governor docs not suppose to be included under the terra correspondence there were some very peculiar and forcible reasons why he never taw or coneonded with pedio blanco who never visited any place on the whole coast except galinhas where was the center of bis business and where hw power uas irresistible joe roberts could not nsk himself at any such place or put mroself in the power of the spaniards on that coast on account of a certain affair in which he had been engaged several years previous to the lime referred to as will be hereafter explained still these two worthies became necessary to each other s advantage and found means to communicate and traffic without seeing each other or writing letters now to be shortin the year joseph j roberts alias governor roberts president roberts went from mon twvia liberia to sierra leone and there without money or credit of his own bought alarge schouiu r which had becu captured from the siavetraders by the british cruizers and condemned by the mixed commission court asa slaver pursuant to w hich condemnation the j xem y wa at auction according to the provisions of the british treaties for the sup j prrsstoo of the slavetrade phis same rah trls went to sierra leone iu company with john n l ris now secretary f the col frfiy and now in this city at one of the del rgation cmm liberia who it is confessed was an sgrit employee and storekeeper of pedro blanco the purchased schooner was christened by the nominal purchasers by the hopeful appellation of the monrovia out of compliment to the chief tillage of that coiooy which was founded and supported by the amiable colon isationists of the cm ted states for the purpose amone others of suppressing the slavelrade the monrovia lay at anchor in the roadstead of monrovia for a few weeks entirely unemployed and utterly useless to the seeming ownerwho had neither busioess sufficient to employ a vessel of that size nor the capital nor the credit to make business of such an amount hs never possessed in his life money enough to buy half of such a tessc nor merchandize enough to fill the half hut the monrovia did not lay idle tory long about the beginning of july the brig ivanhoe brought from galmhas to monrovia t rodriguez huron heretofore described as the principal factor and agent of iedro blanco establishing himself in the house and in the storehouse of john x lewis he soon took possession of the schooner monrovia also with very liitle ceremony and sent her off to galinhas whence she w as almost immediately sent to havana crowded with miserable slaves destined to be worked and whipped to death on the sugar plantations of cuba of course to spare the feelings of the coloniaa uonists and other friends of the slave and enemies of slavery and the slave trade tho beautiful but inappropriate name of the monrovia w as taken from the schooner wbensho was taken from the keeping of her nominal owncr into the service of her real owner of course the governor or president of liberia will say that he sold the monrovia tot r buron undoubtedly that was tho form of the transaction senor huron told the writer of this article that ho had bought her hut the ysung senor was no more able to buy such a vessel fur himself than tho governor was he was merely bianco factor agent and representative so that there was no danger that the writer would misunderstand him senor bunn did not generally make the writer his particular con tidant in regard to his transactions at monrovia with joseph j huberts and john x lewis though his business with the latter was no secret it happened that the captain of tho brig invanhoe of which t r huron was acting supercargo at that time was violently attacked with the african fever on board of his vessel then at anchor in the port of monrovia and the writer of course was called to attend him professionally which he did taking along senot buron with him in his boat after attending to the sick man and leaving the brig to return to the village the writer was requested by senor buron to order the boats crew to pull alongside of schooner monrovia which lay not far olf as he wished to give some directions to the captain a mulatto liberian named cooper and to teprovo him for the negligent manner in w hich tho rigging of the vessel was left the writer readily complied without exactly understanding the relations of his spanish companion to the liberian vessel and tho latter probably noticing the surprise involuntarily manifested at once said in explanation she is mine indeed yesl have bought her as soon as the boat came w ithin hailing distance tho senor gave his orders to the captain accompanied with some sharp rebuke for ins carelessness all which was humbly taken by ihe liberian and tho orders were submissively obeyed this was the first occasion on which the writer knew that the transfer of the vessel front huberts to illanco had aeri ally taken place though it was afterwards familiarly known iii the colony and talked of without a word of ceusure from anybody it will he seen what eminent services were m this way rendered to the s ave traders by such men as govt rnor roberts him w hat peculiar facilities for carying oil the slave trade were furnishd by the colonv of liberia y hen the captured slave v sscl wertr sold in shire leone id ways at a bargain the spaniards themselves could not go thereto bid for them neither

purchaser the vcsaell could then leave sierte intone under american or liberian colors and could be transferred to the real purchasers in a place then under the jurisdiction of the american colonization society without rendering any body liable to punishment or even to exposure under ordinary circumstances hits one instance is enough to show the relation of governor roberts to the slave hade when he has made his answer this distinct specific ami detailed charge it will be time to look farther into his commercial history to expose more completely the dishonesty of the colonizationists in declaring that the colony operates for the suppression or discouragement of the slave trade so much for liberia and its agents that man must be mote than usually simple and credulous who can place any confidence in nen and measures that have been thus tried and found wanting as a means as it is politely called of improving the condition of the colored race or inplain terms ridding the country of africans the scheme it is sufficiently evident is utterly abortive thank heaven that wickedness it is not within the power of the colonization society to perpetrate they havo managed as their official reports state to transport during the last year just how many years at that rate would it take to tiarisport th yearly increase is of course many times the whole scheme is hollow hypocritical

was welcomed with the most enthu maatic applaud mr hale m reused the convention fin an hour and a half with even more than his usual ability and with great ef txic said he did not come there to speak to whigs or democrats a such hutto brn ami women not to politician he addressd himself to men whom god had made whigs and democrats being manufactured bv other hands and elsewhere lie then took a brief review of the political question w hich hail formerly occupied the attention of the people the subtreasury the bank the tariff for instance and demanded to knowhow or in what degree the people

interest unless it were the coterie of officeseekers that set which for thirty years pat m new hampshire had ever been willing to serve tlie state tor tne sake of the salaries to them indeed the question might have been of moment hutto the people generally they were of none at all but there is now mr hale said a question of vast and surpassing moment before the whole people a question w hich comes home to every mans individual responsibility a question on which every man is called on to vote within the next sixty days it is the question whether slavery shall he permitted to extend itself overall our conquered territories or whether it shall le confined within its present limits and we arc now in a strange state of things everybody in new england and all the north is now in favor of free soil and in new hampshire every body of whatever party pravs for writes for and talks for free soil hut can they be depended upon are they sincere mr hale said he must confess that he could noi credit both the intelligence and the integrity of many of these gen thmen because while they piotessed to be wholly devoted to the cause ol ree ftoil limr action was diametrically opposed to their profession mr hale went on to trace the importance of this question upon the intcrcls ot the millions who arc to inherit those vast regions of now unsettled territory and concluded by expressing luk

political encroachments ot the slave power licrefore we unanimously nominate the hon horace mann to the voters of the eighth congressional district as a candidate for reelection resolved that this

chief magistrates that in my opinion the whole country owe to him much lor his distinguished agency in giving proud predominance to those great measures of public policy to the success of yvhich my own political life was in a very small sphere devoted and that my preference for him arising ft out these considerations instead of being diminished is increased by the pledge he has given to follow in the footsteps of those illustrious patriots and philanthropists who by adopting the federal constitution that clothed congress with power to prohibit the african slave trade signified distinctly their desire to have the farther extension of slavery arrested and who by adopting the celebrated ordinance of forbidding the introduction of slavery into all the territory then held by the united states set an example that ought to have been followed by their posterity the opinions here indicated i have long entertaind and know of no reason why should not on this occasion give to them distinct utterance indeed so far from feeling any wish to conceal my opinions on this sub j ct know of no public question to be decided in the approaching presidential election of so much moment as that

men oi eminence both in this country and europe dr ruggles does not profess tc ho any other tiiaa a hydropathic prac t itioncr arid he uses no agent hut water he makes no claim to be an educatec physician and it does not appear to be conceding him too much to imagine that having confined his attention to the application of water as a remedia agent lie may have at least attained etjual skill with those who have yielded to the pressure of public opinion or other impulses and cotnbiucd it with thcii former system of practice dr ruggles is so nearly blind as to depend entirely in his primary examination of those who seek his aid on the sense of touch and it is hy that delicate preception of what he terms the electrical state of the shin that he forms his opinion whether the applicant would be benefited by a course of hydropathic treatment in the exercise of this mode of enquiry dr ruggles is most candid and in the cases of some who were very anxious to put themselves under his care he has frankly told them that his treatment was not calculated to do them good dr ruggles has maintained his theory for upwards of four years and has during that time made it the successful basis oi his treatment of a great number of individuals his establishment is capable of accomodating between thirty and forty patients and is at present full indeed he has been obliged for many weeks pastalmost daily to to turn away applicants the establishment is very pleasantly situated and comprises all requisite appliances for the most thorough course of hydrophatic treatment at about a mile

the past year are dr means of the medical college of georgia and dr llemmer of england to the credit of the former it may be mentioned that in his address before the college at the opening of its annual session in august nov bth hit lie takes honorable notice of dr kugglesremarkable and successful practice there is a passage in an article in the british and foreign medical review by doctor john forbes fellow of the royal and geological societies that hears so immediately on this subject it may lie as well to insert it particularly as it contains an admission that medical practitioners have not hitherto addressed themselves as much as they might to the deranged state of the skin as a prolific source of disease with aview to remedial treatment the skin is a part through which nature has arranged that a large amount of matter should be removed from the body during health and a still larger amount of different u character in the process of recovery from many diseases it is well known that a deficient cutaneous excretion is incompatible with perfect health perhaps there is scarcely am disease in ichieh the function of the shin is not to some extent deranged b iciat extent physicians hare not bcstoccd sufficient pains to learn nor have they been accustomed to give much attention to thi part in the practical investigation of diseases still less has it acquired an important position in the list ot parts to which medical treatment is directed therefore ice possess little information in medical writers us to the amount or frequency of cutaneous disturbance in general disease as to the effect of therapeutic means in correcting such disturbance or as to the value of the correction in the cure of disease  an effective and innocuous incans of increasing the excretion from the skin being thus found w hich appears to com dinc with its own peculiar action the indirect effect of a tonic have w e not reason to regard it as a promising instrument of cure in many disordered states of the system we fully believe that we have we know the utility of augmenting the secretion of the mucous membranes the liver the kidneys we recognize this in our constant practice it is by tins means that we combat alarge proportion of chronic as well as acute maladies should the shin alone be neglected l physiology teaches us that it is the vehicle for conveying out of the system a large amount of matter as well solid as liquid and practical experience exhibits it as the channel through which the maftries inor hi in many instances and the burthen of plethora generally find their evil these facts indicate it as a legitimate locality tor the same artificial measures which are found serviceable on other secreting organs it is a remarkable circumstance that the privation of ght should in dr rug gless case ban led t a more concern lrated attention to the other faculties and thus made the sense ol touch the vehicle by winch be acquired his valuable secret cow per sa ltd fflfil ifi iig ik ill it uhijri l pci fate and truly it is so but why should there be any iodisposition to allow dr kuggles the met it of his discovery the color of his skin cannot operate to his prejudice with the intelligent inhabitants of new england while ii physician of the slave holding state of georgia has volunteered him tbe meed of praisa those who are disposed to treat dr rugglos contemptuously or even uncourteously should remember that alli science is progressive though perhaps no department of it may owe any portion of its progress to them but the pio nerrs in scientific research inay console themselves with the reflection that some of the most important discoveries did not procure their authors immediate fame though their ultimate reward was immortality there was a time when the circulation of the blood w as not known ifarrcy discovered it he was ridiculed at the first promulgation of his theory but nobody laughs at him now there was a periodnot very remotewhen the law of gravitatiou was not understood but no man is sufficiently prodigal of his reputation as now to laugh at sir isaac newton there was an era still nearer our own time when the power of steam was not known but every one is now ambitious to join the chorus in the praise of fulton tis true that all these men j had a skin somewhat paler than that of the discoverer of cutaneous electricity but let it ho remembered that it was i out of chaotic darkness god first cre uled light it is a prominent feature in i the divine economy that the greatest i effects are poduced from what appear to be the smallest causes it is one of the processes by which the almighty wisdom has determined to check the arrogance of mao persecution for new ideas harvey who first discovered the circulation ofthe blood was styled vagabond or quack and persecuted through life ambrose parc in the time of francis introduced the ligature as a substitute for the painful mode of stanching the blood after the amputation of a limb namely by applying boiling pitch to the surface of the stump lie was inconsequence persecuted with the most remorseless rancor by the faculty of physic who ridiculed the idea of putting the life of a man upon a thread when boiling pitch had stood the test for centuries paracelsus introduced antimony as a valuable medicine he was persecuted for the innovation and the french parliament passed an act making it penal to prescribe it whereas it is now one ofthe most important medicines in daily use the jesuits of peru introduced into protestant england the peruvian bark invaluable medicine but being a remedy used by the jesuits the protestant english at once rejected the drug as the invention ofthe devil in dr greenuelt discovered the curative power of canthurides in dropsy as soon as his cures began tobe noised abroad he was committed to newgate by warrant of the president ofthe college of physicians for prescribing eauthai ides internally lady montague first introduced into england small pox inoculation having seen its success in turkey in greatly mitigating that terrible disease the faculty all rose in arms against its introduction foretelling the most disastrous consequences yet it was in a few years generally adopted by the most eminent members of the profes sion jenner who introduced the still greater discovery of vaccination was treated with ridicule and contempt persecuted and oppressed by the royal college of physicians yet he subsequently received large pecuniary grants from government for the benefit he had conferred on his country by making known his valuable discovery and at the present tiino its observance is very properly enjoined by the whole medical profession and the legislature river life at canton boats

men who were standing in the vicinity and hastened to the lower side of the bridge where she de sccnded a ladder or stairway made by pins being driven into a large pole log placed in an upright position and reaching from the lower side of the bridge some or feet down the precipice to a short recess in the cliffs when she arrived at the bottom othe latter she climcd with incrcasec speed along
