cant and blackguardism col schouler the editor of the boston atlas and the purchased tool of the boston cottonocracy writes from washington in the following strain in the house monday is always taken up with petitions memorials resolutions and bills such was the course today the only thing remarkable offered was a bill by mr giddings which provided as its title set forth to take the opinion of the people of the district of columbia upon the question of abolishing slavery in the district but the bill was drawn in such a way as to defeat the object ostensibly set forth among other things it provided that every male person in the district of years of age should have the right to vote upon that question a member asked mr giddings it he intended to admit the slaves themselves to vote upon the question he said yes he knew no distinction in persons he aid however he would insert in the bill if desired that neither slaves nor slaveholders should vote on the question there are several other sections of the bill so worded and no doubt intentionally as to exasperate the southern members and to defeat the very furpose proposed to be accomplished think it is about time to expose this species of northern demagogueisrn if we ever expect to accomplish any practical benefit to the slave we must take the matter up in a fair candid and rational manner the bill offered today by mr giddings was doubtless intended first to exasperate the south and second to entrap the w higs of the nortß it was however laid on the table the proposition that the slaves should vote comes with an ill grace from mr giddings for in ohio frftm whence lie comes free colored persons are not permitted to vote at any election and their testimony is not admitted in any court of justice yet this philanthropist comes all the way to washington and hurries in a bill permitting the slaves to vote i think that in no states of the union but rhode island massachusetts vermont and maine are colored persons admitted to vole do not say this is rightfar from it think that colored persons living in the free states should have the rights guaranteed to them which the white citizens have i have no doubt if a hill property drawn had been presented lor taking the sense ot the people upon the subject of abolition in the district it would have passed but that was just the thing mr giddings and his linle knot of impracticables didnt want they desire not to abolish slavery or to ascertain the wishes of the people in the district their aim is to agilate and to exasperatcand to make their constituents believe that they are very brave men and the exclusive friends of the slave if they can only keep up the excitement and secure their eight dollars a day and mileage their real desires are accomplished we ask the people to consider these matters let them hereafter examine more closely into the motives which actuate these factionists and they will discover the whole to be pretence instead of a high christian philanthropy being the base of their action it is a sordid malignant selfish ness the hol thkbn caults the washington correspondent of the philadelphia inquirer gives the foj owing as the spirit of mr bayly res the north star olutions which were referred to the committee of fifteen j the resolutions declare first that the deep attachatent of the south to the union of these states second that incase of the violation of the constitutional rights of any portion of the confederacy it is the dut and the privilege of the states aggrieved thereby themselves to devise the mode and measure of redress thirdly that in case the aggressions on the rights of the south threatened by the recent action of the house of representatives on the subject of slavery shall be consummated it shall be the right and duty of the staveholding stales to devise proper measures to redress their wrongs the same correspondent gives the following as substantially the remarks of mr calhoun at the caucus the resolutions of the gentleman from virginia mr bayly are good and considering the length of time which he has had to prepare them do him great credit but they are not perfect they are defective in several particulars i am therefore less qn willing to agree to the motion of the gentleman from georgia mr stephens another consideration strongly impels me to the same course i am thoroughly impressed with the necessity of harmonious and united action both on our part and on the part of the southern community i am opposed however to the great delay and consequently would prefer that the committee should report to a meeting to beheld on the th instead of the th ol january the legislatures of several of the southern states are now in session and it would be well that an address should reach them in time to be acted upon by them before their adjournment i consider the address indispensable what ever action is taken must proceed from the slaveholding states if the constitution be violated and their rights encroached upon it is for them to determine the mode and measures of redress we can only suggest and devise j we are in the theatre of action the witnesses of the alarming encroach j tnents which have been going on upon the rights of the slaveholding part of the confederacy we see them plainly we feel them deeply they are rapid and alarming for who would have believed even three years ago that preparations which have within a few days past comiwded tkm gupyet of a majority of the lower house of congress would have been tolerated by any respectable portion of either house we are in the midst of events scarcely of less import than those of our revolutionary era the question is are we holding our position in this confederacy upon the ground of equals or are we to content ourselves with the condition of colonial dependence sir it will be worse than colonial dependence for who would not prefer to be taxed and governed without pretence of representation than under the forms of representation to be grievously oppressed by measures over which we have no control and against which our remonstrances are unavailing it is undeniable that the encroachments upon our rights have been rapid and alarming they must be met i conceive that no southern man can entertain for one moment the idea of tame submission the action of the south should be united temperate but decided our position must be taken deliberately but held at every hazard we wage no war of aggression we ask only for the constitution and union and government of our fathers we ask of our northern brethren to leave us those rights and privileges which our fathers held and without se j curing which for their children all know i they would not have entered this union these we must maintain it appears to me proper that we who are on the theatre of actionshould address our constituents of the slaveholding states briefly and accurately portray the progress of usurpation and aggression vividly exhibit the dangers which threaten and leave it in their hands to mark out the proper line of action what that should be it is needless here to discuss whatever itis it should be temperate united and decided having expressed these views i have to say that i make no objection to the motion of the gentlemaa from georgia mr stephens to refer the whole matter to a select committee to consider maturely and report to a future meeting hut i would rather prefer an earlier day for that meeting than the th of january i am above all for union harmony and decision on the part of the south tut southern platform the washington correspondent of the philadelphia bulletin gives the following as the substance of certain resolutions said to be agreed to at the meeting of southern members of congress on friday evening last resolved that the southhaving an equal interest in the territories of new mexico and california it willing as a principle of equity to accept the terms of the compromise act of m resolved that the south is willing that said territory ahall be admitted into the union fcs state upon the presentation of conatitutiona in which the subject of slavery ia referred upon appeal to the decision of the supreme court of the united stalee each question to ho omitted in said constitution until the decision a aforeaaid ia awarded resolved that the south will accept of a bill for territorial governments upon the principles of the act of last session introduced by john mclayton right is of no sextroth of no colorgod is the father of os all and all we are brethren resolved ibat toe souin will accept of the act introduced the presem session by senator douglass with certain modifications relative to appeals as in the second resolution resolved that the south prefers i separation of the union to that of accepting the wilmot proviso and tin faith of each state is pledged to protec her interests in said territories at tht point of the bayonet resolved that this is the unanimous sense of this meeting representing the south virgiivia st wear resolctioss a series of resolutions were reported in the virginia honse of delegates or friday by j b floyd chairman the special committee on the wilmol proviso and kindred subjects which declares first that the institution ol slavery is fully recognized by the con stitutionand that any attempt to abridge the rights of the slaveholder to prohibit his free emigration with his slave to any portion of any territory of the united states is a gross and palpable violation of the constitution secondly j that virginia cannot in honor to her i self or posterity think for one moment of a submission to a law of congress having such an object in view andi thirdly that virginia will resist such ari act of aggression to the last extremity the fourth resolution empowers the governor of the state in case of the passage by congress of the wilmol proviso or any kindred measure dur j ing the recess of the legislature tc j immediately call an extra session tc take into consideration the said act at well as the mode and measure of re dress selections antislavery sentiments at the south the expression of antislavery sentiment quoted below was made on the i floor of the late general conference ol the m e church north by the rev dr tomlinson president of augusts college ky it is an encouraging indication when such language falls from the lips of a prominent clergyman in a slaveholding state dr tomlinson alluding to the church souths says do not hesitate to say that the control lug influpne m that swwisat innis decidedly unblushingly and i may add exultingly proslavery in its character and the church itself stands before the world and will stand before posterity and as i verily believe before the bar of god as a proslavery church it is the first and only church that ever has been and for the honor of our holy christianity i do trust in god that it is the last one that ever will be formed with the evident design of throwing up an impregnable rampart for the maintenance and perpetuation of human slavery amen from different parts of the house and surely sir it is one of the most humiliating spectacles that the sun ever shone upon that while the civilized world is making a gigantic and glorious struggle in behalf of human liberty men bearing the name of methodist preachers and tracing their genealogy to john wesley should be found with coats off sleeves rolled up and hammer in hand as it were to rivet more tightly and to rivet forever the chains of human bondage sir it is a shameit is a burning shamejt is a most grievous desecration of the very name of methodism it is doing gross injnstice to the memory of our venerated founderit is a flagrant outrage against the spirit of the timesit is a scandal to the christian ministry in the light of ihe nineteenth century it is a scandal to human nature and in perfect keeping with these sentiments an able and excellent minister of auother denomination who was born and reared in a slave state and who then resided and still resides in an interior slave state remarked tome in conversation on this subject that the course pursued by the methodist episcopal church south on the subject of slavery was enough to bring the bones of john wesley out of his grave for the frank and fearless utterance of these sentiments jet no one charge me with being an enemy to the south i love the south my own my native land with an undying affection and it is because i love it that i thus speak neither let any one say that i am a southern man with northern principles merely i claim to be a southern man with american principles i hazard nothing in the asaertion that alarge majority of the people of the delightful land from which i hail do most sincerely deprecate the idea that the withering curseof slavery shall be fastened upon them forever the wry thing that this new organization is calculated to do i believe that ido but echo the predominant sentiments of the great mass of our population when say that ray hearts desire and prayer to god is that in tome peaceful constitutional way the time may soon come when the beautiful and glorious country may not only be the home of the brave but the land of the free and of the free only then indeed will it occupy that commanding position ia this great confederacy which its climate

presidency of this enlightened country and first as to its extent between the years and a period of twenty years slaves were taken from virginia north carolina and maryland to the southern market according to the statement of the rev dr graham of north carolina and in it arms estimated by the most intelligent men of virginia that  slaves were exported from that state during the preceding months about twothirds of these accompanied their owners who removed the rer maming onethird were sold at an average of oo each amounting to which the domestic slave trade poured into virginia in one year in says the mayville tenn intelligencer slaves passed through a little western town on their way to the southern market and in the same year four states imported slaves from the north in a committee appointed by the citizens of mobile and alabama to inquire into the causes of pecuniarydistress then prevalent reported that between the years and alabama alone imported from the northern states worth of slaves annually amounting to in four years this gives us a fair idea of the extent to which the domestic trade in men women and children is carried on our masters have just annexed to the united states a territory half a dozen times as large as new york for the express purpose of extending and perpetuating slavery and this has given the trade a new impetus the price of slaves rose

they have but few privileges no incentives to either mental or moral improvemont and no hope beyond the most contracted circle of domestic servitude however they may have obtained their freedom whether by bequest or purchasewhe ther because of gratitude induced by devoted service or by a judicious appropriation of their scanty earnings they excite neither respect nor sympathy their condition is bad enough at the north it is infinitely worse in every moral point of view where a dark skn is looked upou as the badge of perpetual servitude the governor of virgiaia has had his attention directed to the moral poverty of his fellowcitizens the review has suggested a mode of alleviation more heartless than novel transportation is the process remedial recommended by his excellency he says but there is a way in which i would hope the condition of the free negro might be alleviated it is to transport them to send him beyond our limits into communities where the disabilities which oppress him here do not exist that society must be improperly organized which preeeots iasuperable barriers to the amelioration of us own condition this incapacity is undoubtedly felt in virginia so long as slavery exists there the mental and moral improvement of her free men of color cannot be looked for their release from the legal liabilities which a condition of slavery imposes secures to them no important social immunities indeed their exemption from compulsory servitude only seems teeggr a a e ir moral debasement for while thetr color excludes them from the pde of their condition ok

commentary let any candid person read them carefully through and then we ask him to say if he thinks the institution of slavery is a safe or propqr subject for public discussion in a slaveholding community would it be prudent to permit in an assembly of mechanics for example a discussion of the merits of an institution which permitted the sale of human beings in herds like dumbdriven cattle

explain his views he complained that every vote on the question of slavery hitherto had been taken withont allowing northern members an opportunity of explanation and that on motion of southern members to lay on the table or on analogous motions he believed that congress had the power to abolish slavery in the district but was opposed to action on this question unless at the instance of the people of the district he was in favor of the object proposed to be attained by the resolution but should vote for reconsideration because he did not like the language of the resolution and because be was in favor of giving the municipal powers here the power to put an end to the traffic in slaves and then if they would not exercise that authority he would compel them he was in favor of keeping the territories of the united states as they came to us if they were free he would keep them free if them remain so he contrasted the course of the south with that of the north the former were always holding conventions and threatening to dissolve the union if congress passed a law undoubtedly constitutional while altho those of the north saw their property and the lives of their fellowcitizens destroyed by the opposition of the south to constitutional laws for the improvement of their harbors there was no threat of disunion no talk of secession when he concluded mr vinton called attention to the fact that the deficiency bill had been made the special order for today and it was important that it should be passed he therefore moved to postpone the farther consideration of the motion to ncmiklw until this day week mr goggin called mr vintons attention to the fact that this day week was set apart for the consideration of the postage bill mr vinton modified his motion to this day two

to allowhim to have an amendment read which he proposed to offer if the motion to reconsider should prevail here there were a dozen members on the floor at once on points of order m the midst of which mr wentworth positively refused to withdraw his motion and demanded the ayes and noea upon it the yeas and nays were ordered and the house refused to lay the motion on the table by yeas to  nays mr c

incumbrances when they are informed that my payments to this end within the last two years not to speak of such as had been previovslv made exceed in the aggregat thirty thousand dollars am happy to learn that notwithstanding the industrious efforts made to dissuade the grantees from guiug uon their lands eome twenty or thirty are comfortably settled upon them and that a considerable share of the

thevit whence it sprungnevertheless even be aad though he lias the talents and dignity that would adorn the piesideocy of the nation could at the late election let himself down so far as to advise his colored brethren who vote to vets for such desptsers of bis rare as doctor smith once voted forhow sad that such men as doctor south and mr douglass should ever have so undervalued and degraded themselves should ever have so pocketed the detestable and infernal insults upon their race lam aware that it may be said in exease for these gentlemen that in what they did they aimed at the deliverance and elevation of their race but to this we reply that even the highest good is not to be sought for at the expenoe of self respect that even heaven itself is not to becrawled into and that in all our purposes relations pursuits activities the fvioe admonition to us is quit you like mrs the oppressots of my colored brethren and the north is well nigb as full as the south of themwill never voluntarily relax their oppressions and restore the rights they have plundered until they have come to respect those brethren and this will never be until the free portion of those brethren have come to respect themselves then it will hethen when that portion shall stand up in the selfrespect and dignity and virtue which j would revolt at fellowship ecclesiastical or political with their oppressors and despwers as at an ineffably degrading and criminal thingthen it will be morally to continue to oppress and despise my colored brethren much longer i have often thought how quick the coloied people of this land would be redeemed from thraldom and contempt were but those of them in the free states to rise into so high an expression of selfrespect and brotherly love as to refuse with all the promptitude and indignation with which they would refuse to drink their heart s blood to eat the food or wear the cloth extorted from the slaves unpaid and compelled toil indeed such sellsaeaifice would gain for them the world wide reputation of being a nobler and more truly heroic race than any other which ever lived could i but get the ear of my northern colored brethren coueild but get it away from their flatterers and deevers would say to them cultivate selfrespectcultivate self respectcultivate selfrespectfor by that means and not without that means can you peacably regain your own rights or the rights of your race at the south have no fellowship political or ecclesiastical with those who hale or despise yon turn your backs upon american christianity and american politics as upon the devil himself for he is their author vote for no man for civil office j who will not treat every slave law as no law the man who feels the least respect for or admits the least obligation in slave laws does so only because he despises your race he would neither feel the one nor admit the other in the case of siatclaws which might be enacted against life own race he abides by the present slavelaws only because it ia negroes and not his own race who are theii victims let laws to ensleve white men whether they be organic or statutory laws come into being in massachusetts newyork and michigan and the daniel websters and martin vanßurens and lewis casses who are so full of respect for the old slave laws would execrate and despise and nullify the new ones t would in conclusion say to my colored brethren be suspicious as well of professed sbolitionists as of antiabolitionists there were at one time seventy thousand professed abolitionists in the liberty party i hut where are they now nineteen twentieths of them have betrayed you and have gone down into a party with those who despise and loathe youwith a party which even at its formation and in its very platform admitted the validity and inviolableness of the laws which enslave three millions of their countrymen an admission which tbev would sooner have perished than have made had those three millions been whites instead of blacks very respectfully your friend gerrit smith meeting of coloied citiaunt on the evening of the th ult a meeting of the colored citizens of oberlin was held in the liberty hall at which the following resolutions were adopted resolved that we the colored citizens of lorain county hereby declare that whereas the constitution of our common country gives us citizenship we hereby each to each pledge ourselves to support the other in claiming oui rights under the united states constitution and in having the laws oppressing us tested resolved hut we hereby now and forever refuse to vote for or support any nun for office who will not go for ns and ours in common with others whereas we believe with the fathers of that taxation and representation ought to go together resolved that we very much doubt about paving any tax upon which representation ia based until we are permitted to be represented resolved that we still adhere to the doctrine of urging the slave to leave immediately with his hoe on his shoulder for aland of liberty resolved that we urge all colored persons and their friends to keep a sharp lookout for meuthieves and their abettors and to warn them that no person claimed as a slave shall be taken from our midst without trouble resolved that the coofcreece of colored men or association that is afraid to speak out against the monster slavery when they have an opportunity so to do and while their own brethren are in hoods ia not only undeserving of our confidence but deserving of our deepest reprobation and we further believe that the an be he white or colored who wrapped ia eckuiauwwl dignity shuts his pulpu against the claims of rods suffering pool is not unworthy only of the name of minister but of the more honored appellation mik  resolved that the attempt to establish churches or schools under the direction and for the benefit of colored pereooa exclusively where we eta enter either upnn equal tami

during the recent spirit of widespread revolution did not evince more alarm than the slaveholders in congress now do from the house to the senate all is trepidation bordering on to desperation the monster slavery always an unwelcome subject for dia cussiuq when the world listeos has made its appearance earlier and with greater terrors than usual the friends of freedom not only increased in diimbers hot what is stillmore alarming they have increased in boldness of spirit and their measures have jost all timidity they no longor talk of the sacred right of petition in one breath and denounce the abolitionist in the other as they used to do in order to appease the wrath of the slave power on the one hand and to seem courageous in the cause of liberty on the other rut now respect for the growing antislavery sentiment has cast out all fear of their once dreaded master and they now venture into the august presence of their old feudal lords with as little timidity as van amhurg does his cage of subdued tigers a great change has taken place the language of bold defiance has changed quarters both in the house and senate from the slaveholding to the abolition side even that old hoary veteran of perpetual slavery before whom the boldest used to tremble hath smoothed itis wrinkled front and is heard to reason o f temperance and conciliation this is indeed a great change and one over which we have eanse to he exceeding glad we shall not however be lifted up above measure by this new aspect of things or expect too great results from it the day wt complete victory over the

may yet do by playing the cat in the mealtub proud aud haughty as are our southern masters they like other tyrants will stoop to conquer we have no doubt that this talk about moderation and conciliation on the part of the south will have its desired effect for the present upon the doughfaces of the north to prevent any decided action on the subject of slavery during this session of congressf d gotts resolution when we first learned that congress had passed a resolution offered by mr gott of this state instructing the committee on the district of columbia to bring in a bill for the abolition of the slavetrade now carried on so boldly and triumphantly under the very eve droppings of the capitol we thought the news too good to be true and if true that by some parliamentary trick or other expedient the measure would be defeated from the last accounts it seems that on the th of december the motion of mr stewart of michigan to reconsider this resolution came up for consideration mr stewart made along rambling speech upon itantislavery but more especially proslavery at the close of his speech mr vinton moved a postponement of the subject for two weeks whereupon mr wentworth moved to lay the motion for reconsideration on the table this motion put to the test the constancy of those who voted for mr gotts resolution as it afforded an opportunity for them to reaffirm that resolution they failed to do so the following votes vytll show our readers the present state of the question we regard it as the first fruit of the calhoun caucus r d the latter motion

unacquainted with the years of hardships and toils through which we have had to pass the opposition and prejudice we have been compelled to meet the cold indifference and almost total apathy by which

country is now admitted by all and that the true friends of freedom everywhere favor ths movement in preference to all other political movements yet at issue is no less true that the colored american entertains a partiality towards the free soil party never before manifested by them for aoy other political party in our country is worthy of remark this perhaps is not from what this movement really ia but what it is expected to bethe great question now shoold be what j is to be the future course of policy pareoed by the free soil party is it to be sincerely and faithfully urged and if successful prac ticslly carried out free soil free territory free speech and free men to all men fundamentally including in this issue the rights of colored men or all persons on american soil of whatever origin or descant or do they simply intend by the alluring cry free sod free territory free speech and free white men this to every friend of freedom and impartial liberty especially the colored american

that can may he made what then should be expected under such circumstances f the cry of free men was raised not for the extension of liberty to the black manbt j for the protection of the liberty of the white the liberty of the whites of the north i endangered by the encroachments of the slats power hence an alarm was necessary to arouse the north and alarm the south who determined on the permanent establishment of slavery as the north is well adtieed of ever ready to compromise and always able to find one to this end the south will be on he alert ever watchful over her interests she wdl have an eye to the final retuh and rathe r than be instrumental in bringing about so disastrous a result as tho dissolution of the la ion the most sure and certain step to emancipation she will

only alternative though in the confusion of alarm they have said it but will join issue and make common cause with the free soil movement proslavery whig and democrats in the north will be among the foremost in the measure while the unsuspecting philanthropist honesthearted and inexperienced colored american will be de luded the free soil party will assume the policy of the national reformers whose fundamental principles are based not upon mans rights to himself his to them is of secondary consideration but upon his natural right toi the soil and homestead exemption thu does not interfere with the policy of the south and this they will quickly concede securely concealed behind this veil of deception and defended by the ramparts of such vast political machinery the accustomed cryoi free soil will be thundered through the nation every ear listfully catching the sound i and while the colored people are contentedly waiting for results favorable to their redemp  tion the rights of the whites will lie established the claims of the slave power conceded and slavery extended into every new state and territory south of m at l i the line this we predict will be the final result of the present issue or we very much mistake the american character finod friends there are who desire otherwise bet these may be set down as pure christian pht laothropists few in number and weak in power and means politicians we dare not confide in they have little sympathy with the slave or concern for the rights of the nominally free colored people and indians these facts the colored people both

antislavery society mr bush would have us retract if he will point out a line of the article of which he complains not strictly true we shall not need to be asked to retract but will do so with all promptitude and pleasure f d west broadway new york january sth frederick douglass we have just had a hardfought battle with a certain negro hunting villain named john lee of frederick county md who came on here with a determination to kidnap and carry off two innocent colored voung men upon whom he had fixed his covetous eye accordingly on the th nit at half past eight oclock in the morning and while joseph belt was walking peaceably through duane street two white rascals in the employ of lee for that purpose came upon him and without warrant or anything in the shape of legal process arrasted him on pietenee that he had stolen a coat having got him in their clutches they carried him in a coach to a hotel in broadway where ihe said john lee first made his appearance and on seeing belt said i will pay you for all this subsequently the young man thus kidnapped in open day was taken to long island where he was found on thursday night he was brought before judge edmonds on friday the d ult and after several days delaywas discharged on the ground of illegal arrest in the first place and in the second place on the ground of the absence ol proof that the laws of maryland sanction slavery the judge held that he was not bound to take it for granted that because slavery exists in maryland therefore it is sanctioned by her laws nor that he is bound to believe that a certain volume which mr lees counsel held in his hand purporting to contain the laws of maryland were published by the authority of the state i am told that john lee represents an association of slaveholders who have resolved to join their purses together for the purpose of lesling the strength of the constitution and laws of congress on the recovery of fugitives i believe it is generally understood here that had not lees counsel committed the two errors above stated or rather lee one and his counsel the other they would have taken belt away upon purely constitutional grounds mighty godwhat a government

spirit which has ever characterized your valuable paper of your willingness at all times to contribute to the cause of humanity have thought it not amiss to transmit to you a brief sketch of a series of spirited antislavery meetings which have been held in our city during the present week henry bibb a fugitive slaveone that has endured the most cruel sufferingone that has been deprived of every right guaranteed man by the author of his existence and despite the ged that made him has been manacled and driven far worse than the beasts of burden this distinguished fugitive for well may one be said to be distinguished who having undergone suen severe trials and persecutions yet remains a roan to plead in behalf his brethren still in bonds has for some four or five evenings past been deeply interesting the citizens of buffalo in a course ol lectures at the pearl street church formerly dr lords upon the subject of american slavery and by giving a nariative of his life his lectures commenced on sunday evening and closed on thursday evening having severally been well attended he gave a thrilling and interesting narrative of his life during twentyfive years experience of the most cruel and heartrending bondage his lectures were of a nature highly entertaining and instructive and most deeply elicited the sympathy of the gieater portion of his audience it may not be amiss to state that a large portion of his audience was composed of the most respectable of our white citizens sod many who hive hitherto manifested but little interest in the cause of human freedom the use of ihe church was gratuitously given by mr r b heacock the proprietor who promptly attended each meeting and expressed an unbounded degree of sympathy with ihe proceedings a t ihe close of the meeting the following resolutions were offered and unanimously adopted hereas the citizens of buffalo have for ome evenings past been deeply interested and instructed by the lectures of henry bibb upon the subject of american slavery and hearing the narrative of his life and whereas we understand that he is preparing his narrative for publication and believing as we do that it will be a work well calculate to advance the cause of human freedom and putto blush the apologists fer american slavery therefore resolved that we baspeak for him every encouragement and bid him godspeed in his laudable undertaking resolved that as a token of our appreciation of so valuable a work should it be published containing as it will a complete history of hia life during twentyfive years experience in slavery

of attending the antislavery fair and annual meeting of the western new york antislavery society after a pleasant but slow ride of nearly six hours we found ourselves cordially greeted by and comfortably provided for under the roof of our esteemed friends f douglass and lady whom we shall ever hold in giateful remembrance for their hospitality throngbout our sojourn in your city i could not help contrasting the present position and opportunities of usefulness of that man who only a few years since was a poor slave in maryland and seeing in him s living evidence of an equal susceptibility on thepart of the colored people to attain all the higher degrees of intelligence and further that the assertion of our inferiority was a perfect libel upon our character the doctrines contained in the model menage of gov smith of virginia to the contrary notwithstanding long may our friend douglass live to do battle with our opponents but to the fair the display of articles was large tasty and demonstrably set forth the skill and perfection to which the ladies have brought the use of the needle it confers gteat credit upon the antislavery ladies of western new york as well as the ladies of europe for their kind liberality and manifest interest in behalf of the slave injustice to the ladies of england i may observe that had it not been for the large amount of contributions fiom the old world the display in some measure would have been shorn of its beauty the meetings of the society on account of the inclemency of the weather were not as large as i should like to have seenneverthe less they were significant of the spirit of that old fashioned abolitionism which makes the pure heart glad ah if the identity of feeling and honesty of purposethere manifested were carried out by professed abolitionists generally my word for it we should soon bee a radical change the bloodguiltiness of this nation in regard to slavery would melt away under their scathing rebuke and expositions of hypocrisy and crime yours in behalf of the oppressed a h francis our friend will see that a considerable portion of his letter is omitted the modesty of the editor would not permit of his publishing that part of it which referred to himself for what is published the responsibility rests on my shoulders j dj from oar own correspondent london dec in the french news there is but little novelty at the present time the presidential election contest to be decided on the lotb inst occupies the minds of all and innumerable are the speculations as to its probable termination cavaignac has had a complete triumph lately in the national assembly grave charges were brought against him there by m st hilaire m gamier page and m ledru rollin retpecting his conduct in the june insurrection he met his adversaries face to face replying to each of their accusations most satisfactorily and with great calmness and moderation thus far he maybe said to have entirely confounded his foes a vote of confidence was passed by the assembly almost unanimously in his favor and it seems probable that the very measure that was designed to crush his presidential prospects may tend to their realization but all is uncertain the paris correspondent of a daily paper says every moment opinion i change here prince louis napoleon baa published a discreet and carefully written ad j dress to his fellowcitizens which has been received with approbation his popularity continues and his hotel is surrounded by large assemblages of people who wait to witness his arrival or departure democratic banquets continue to be held andare principally distinguished by the violence and sedition evinced in the speeches there made the minds of the french people are just now a good deal taken up with his holiness the pope who together with his cardinals has fled from the capital rome is in a mate of complete insurrection and the populace alone now reign and rule there before the news of the popes flight reached pans gen cavaignac informed the national assembly that four steam frigates conveying three thousand five hundred men bad been die patched by the government to civita vecchia to bia assistance the pope however departed secretly from rome on the th inst at first it was asserted that he had taken refuge in france operations were raak ng there to do him homage the rejoicings of this volatile and fickle people were in this instance somewhat premature as a telegraphic dispatch has since announced the popes arrival at malta where it seems probable he may await to avail himself of any favorable change which may be made in hia favor some terrible assassinations have taken place in rome the popes private secretary cardinal palma and his friend count roaro have fallen victims to the fury of the populace these stirring and extraordinary events will cause the question to arise in the minds of many will pius the dih be the last sovereign of rome as the

letter has been delayed a week hy the alteration in the time of the american mail leaving so shall briefly communicate the recently received news the result of the election for the presidency of the french republic though not definitively known is no longer matter of the slightest doubt prince louis napoleon bonaparte son of a kingsupposed heir according to the received principle of hereditary succession of the great emperor whose avowed maxim was everything for the people nothing by themis the man whom of all others republican france selects as the most appropriate e mbodiment of itself for every two votes cavaignac has received according to the returns as yet promulgated the prince has received more than five the funds which in anticipation of his election by a small majority fell three quarters per cent have since the certainty of a triumphant majority risen three per cent cavaignac has issued as the chief of the government a maniy and sensible proclamation announcing explicitly his intention to bow to the will of the people let their choice fall on whom it might although the people are in an excited state the only men of whom real apprehension is entertained are the red republicans constituting a small minority in paris where they most abound their can i didates ledru rollin and raspail have polled upwards of thirty thousand votesa  proportion of about one in eight the worst of it is a dread certainty that that man is ready to fight and that rather more like a demon than aught of earth whereas of the seven respectable men not devotees of communism probably five are still more abhorrent of combatistrij and the remaining two fight in a steady respectable oldfashioned way this calculation not a very inaccurate one gives a tolerable chance for the red demon not of his succeeding but of his doing terrible mischief no one can foresee with any certainty the events of a week but one may hazard a conjecture or two louis napoleon made two attempts avowedly for the empire when louis philippe sat on the throne can any one with a giain of sense in his head imagine that the events of the th of february have converted him into a prince republican visions of the frontiers of the rhine are too likely to coexist in his mind with that idea of empire he has never lost a war once began what prestige conld be greater than that of napoleon d emperor of the french at the head of the army talents he must have to assume this position but the strong tide that has now set in may carry him far on his way far greater talents will be necessary for napoleon bonaparte to

system is said to possess miserable incompetency has been but too visible n the majority of the austrian and german deputies the central german assembly has been but little better of course every

levels at agreat depth below the surface before he reaches his place of work and so deep are the mines that it frequently costs an hour to reach the surface aftei his labor is done few have an idea ol the magnitude of a cornish mine of the more extensive kind but some notion may be formed of the vastness of the workings when we state that ihose ol the consolidated mines alone extend g miles under ground or fathoms the ascent and descent are by ladders which were formerly perpendicular as to the sides of the mine and fifty feet long but as the mines have been worked deeper the ladders have been shortened to half that length and placed as slopingly as possible to ease the miner whose weight is thus rendered more dependent upon his feet than it was before and less upon his hands notwithstanding the great inconveniences of working much belowground the cornish miner has some of the enjoyments of life if his toil in the mine has not been to great on repairing to his cottage he cultivates i his acre or two of ground which he obtains on lease upon easy terms from the heathy downs for three lives at a few shillings rent there by degrees he has contrived to build a small cottage often a good part of it with his own hand the stone costing him nothing or it may be he has only taken land for the growth of potatoes to cultivate to which he repars and urns the ground and rents a cottage at fifty or sixty shillings a year with a right of turf fuel which he cuts and prepares himself many miners have tolerable gardens and some are able to do their own carpentry work and near the coast others are expert fishermen the fishermen themselves avery sturdy and bold set of men culti vatp their own potato ground when onshore in the mining districts of the west about camborne
