to many the recurrence of the season which celebrates the declaration and commencement ol our natiou u independence usually brings merely an occasion of idle and boyisli amusement it commonlycomes and it departs without suggesting one kindling thought wirhont awakening any deep emotion it is simply a day of relaxation and festivity but now when we are so rapidly approaching some great crisis in human ullairs when every child among us must be stiuc k with the contrast between the large measure ol security existing in this country and the alarm which overshadows the nations ol kurope now when older communities are struggling in the lire snd smoke of revolutions there is a significance an emphasis in our great national anniversary which must stir and kindle our deepest thouchts at least we cannot fail to congratulate ourselves tlrut we are here of some sentiment almost akin to devout religious thankfulness we must become involuntarily conscious ns the tidings reach us of burning cities and streets running with blood and a great horror ailing upon nations while over our homes peace and prosperity are emptying the full horn of their blessings but my friends it is not only or chiefly on account of the abundance of our personal blessings or for the sake of our national prosperity that our great anniversary is to be welcomed with grateful thoughts and remembrances it betokens a low and seltisli mind to exult only in what we ourselves possess flic glory of our declaration of independence is not that it broke the yoke of foreign oppression and introduced the state of tilings in which we now share its value is toj be estimated not by any definite results by which it lias been followed but by the principle which it asserted here is the glory of that declarationfor this should the whole nation doit homage this should awaken our gratitude our reverence our loyaltythis namely that as at the first so upon every return of the birth day of our nation the principle of the equality the brotherhood of ull mankind is most distinctly and solemnly declared when we consider it thus as it certainly is as a declaration ol the independence not of one nation but oi all nations as the charter of universal humanity who is not impressed with its greatness and its power notwithstanding some facts to the contrary it has not been and it will not he a dead letter it sustained thirteen humble collides m their bloody struggle with the mighty empire which sought to hold them iu subjugation to its power it breathed the breath of life over this western wilderness it wrought like a word of magic upon one of the foremost nations ol durope and as the infant cp of freedom was wafted over the atlantic france burst asunder the chains of despotism and madlv strove to clutch the bright vision of liberty and then tumbled headlong under the chariot wheels of military power the influence of our example the power ol the truth here declared spread over the southern continent ol this hemis pbce and the tie which hound it m political bondage to the old world wan broken the declaration and establishment of our national liberties like he pillar of lire and awoke which led the north star israel from egyptian slavery has conducted a vast procession of the oppressed from the old world to the new and still they come an ever increasing host to conquer and adorn the w ilderness of the west under the guidance of better institutions and now the spectacle of this great and thriving multitude living here under the formal recognition of human rights acknowledging no privileged classes of kings and nobles does it not unite with the sense of oppression and wrong which is stinging to madness the names of europe to inflame their noblest aspiration and nerve them to the contest with their oppressors the form of government here established and upon the principle of human equality is now the great european idol p it ah not in a day can the institution of freedom established if they have gained any strength here it is because the people of this land from its very first settlement were trained and prepared for them our fathers came to the world and emancipated from all the oppressive influences of feudal europe herein a condition in which no artificial distinctions of rank but only personal energy was of any avail they grew up naturally to the stature of freedom and our simple forms of government sprung from the character and condition of the people hut now in europe the general mind is perverted and turned away by the unequal forms of society under which and by which it has been fashioned and the masses do not know what that liberty is for which they are contending it will yet he a longtime we fear before the ancient monarchies of christendom can be transformed into free republics still distant as that change may be europe will never settle back again on the old foundations of arbitarry power there is a light shining upon her from across the ocean which so long as it continues to shine will hinder the sleep of despotism our declaration of independence though as yet but partially carried out is nevertheless the handwriting on the wall which disturbs the repose of monarchs and portends the doom of the oppressor vhat will be its effect how will it glare with ab finding splendor when the foul wrong of domestic slavery shall be abolished j on this soil and we shall give the lovers of despotic power no occasion to mock at our professions of freedom when we turn from considering the influence of our declaration of human rights upon foreign nations and look ati home here too we behold most animating tokens of its power it is true when this declaration was made broad and emphatic as it is many of those who were its most ardent advocates and who pledged life fortune and honor in its defence were at the same time flatly denying its fundamental truth in practice they were holding men not as their equals hut as their slaves and blinded by custom and interest they seemed to be utterly insensible to the great truth which they declared nearly three quarters of a century have passed away since the great declaration was made and until within the last few years the anniversary of it was celebrated year after year through the whole length and breadth of the land and the conscience of the people seemed to be cast into a deep sleep the author of the declaration of independence did indeed in his day confess that he trembled for his country when he thought of the justice of heaven hut still as i have said throughout the whole land there was an utter unconsciousness of the lact that there were thousands and hundreds of thousands of dwellers on this soil to whom our boasted freedom was an unmitigated and most bitter despotism and on our national birthday it was asserted over and over again that this country was the home of freedom that all its children were equal in the eye of our free institutions that here was the refuge of the oppressed and this while throughout that portion of the country which controlled the councils of the government men women and children were bought and sold treated like chattels and not like human beings the very existence of as many slaves on our soil as there were people in the land when our independence was declared w as utterly ignored and lor only one reason that can be imagined because they were of a different complexion thus nearly a century of our national history passed and excepting an occasional lamentation uttered here and there over the existence of this deep blot upon our freedom the general sense of the country was dull and dead hut then at lust a solitary voice was raised calling public attention to the fact of american slavery denouncing it as a direct violation of our great national charter and as direct a violation of the law of god and insisting that we must cease from doing this great wrong instantly and on the fcpot hat voice was met bv a storm of public denunciation still it was heard above the storm the lonely assertor of the fundamental principle of the declaration of independence and of the law of the christ and of iod soon drew others around him and mighty in the strength of freedom in the spirit of a noble christian patriotism they demanded simply a faithful application of our own professed principles and though they used nc weapon save such as reason and conscience furnished though they shed nc blood but their own yet their wort has gone forth with power and tu truth of our ualtonal declaration ha been reuserted with a broader am more glorious meaning altbougl mobs have gathered and there hav been burnings and bloodshed yet tin cause of human freedom has gone tri right is of no sextruth is of no color god is the father of i s all and all vf are brethren umphantly onward from one end ol the country to the other it has been made the absorbing topic of thought and conversation it has penetrated into the heart of powerful ecclesiastical organizations and broken them in twain it has entered the halls of outstate legislatures and made persona liberty a controlling principle of theii action it has withstood every effort to keep it out of our national coanciis it has engrossed the attention and time ol congress pushing all other business aside it has commanded the services of the wisest and most eminent of our countrymen of adams and ol channing it has forced politicians carefully to trim their sails in fine it is everywhere assuming in the public mind that importance which rightfully belongs to it and now it is felt tobe the one great question of the country and the age it is true the most desperate exertions have been made to suppress it but we may estimate its power and its success by the very extravagance of the measures to which its opponents have been driven they have denied the right of private judgment and the freedom of speech they have disowned the right of petition they have violated the sanctity of the post office they have entrapped the nation into a bloody war avowedly for the security of the slave power they have contradicted the principle of human equality they have imprisoned iree men and made it perilous for a free man to enter a state where slavery exists they have claimed a right to violate the first principle of our declaration of independence and to carry slavery where it never existed before but all these things only show how mighty is the truth which drives its enemies into such folly and madness notwithstanding all this resistance or rather in consequence of this resistance the free spirit of the north is steadily awaking into life and activity it is slowly and steadily becoming a commanding element in the public opinion of the north and in view ol all these cheering tokens of the progress of the antislavery sentiment i verily believe before jiod that there arc some sitting here ids day who shall live to see the kingdom of liberty come it cannot be hardened as our hearts have been against our brother man and sister woman crushed to the earth and kept there by our institutions it cannot be that when all europe tain arms clamoring for the rights of our common nature it cannot be that when evert barbarian powers are knocking off the chains of the slave it cannot bethat when all the world is awaking up to the simple claims of equal justice we claiming as v kj tobe the special advocates of freedom shall continue to strengthen the arrn of the oppressor we cannot much longer hide from ourselves the fact that the very first principles of our religion are involved and that as believers in christianity as those who glory in the declaration of independence nay as men endowed w ith the common sympathies of humanity we can have no plainer duty than to aid in all ways possible in the emancipation ol the enslaved i pray you brethren as you would render to the old world the greatest service that you can render it as you would help the cause ol oppressed nations hold back no longer from th cause of humanity at home let never a word againpass your lips in justification of holding men as property honor the declaration of human rights by recognizing those rights in the person of the humblest ol your brethren celebrate the return ol this season bv consecrating yourselves to the help of the slave to the held ol the weak against the mighty let there be no question on which side you are whether for the oppressed or for the oppressor i know very well that this simple work of humanity to which we are now summoned by so many voices at home and abroad is represented as a mere political afiair but it involves the essential life of religion in the progress of this cause i behold the influence of whatever religion there isin this land they who are toiling for justice and mercy for the slave seem to me to occupy at this day the same position which was held by the early christians in their day look not to the increase ot churches to the zeal with which church going is observed i look not to the forms and ceremonies of worship to the measures which are adopted the societies that are lorraed the monies that are collected i regard not these things as the indications of the life and power and progress of religion true religion before god is to do justly and to love mercyto feel for the slave as enslaved w ith himto condemn the sin of oppressionto proclaim liberty for all men of every name and color i cannot his not in me to have any respect for the religion which while it observes forms with scrupulous exactness and regularity passes over justice and the love of man ii the love of freedom if sympathy for the wronged alnchn f is increasing in our landthen is true religion flourishing this is the true religious revival for the sake of religion then as we would be truly religious wc must be humane and use all our strength to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free even though no effort of ours could liberate a single lave still for our own souls sake as iwe would know the power of religion in our own hearts and by our own personal experience we must commit ourselves to the cause of mans emancipation from wrong there ts no alternative no peace no hope no life foru but in cherishing that ptnt of rochester n y friday july love which feels instantly and deeply for the injured and knows no rest until they are righted that spirit is the spirit the life of god in the soul of man oh not in doctrines nor informs is our life but in loving what is right with all our strength and our neighbor as ourselves finally brethren upon the return of this season i rejoice in it as the most cheering indication in the condition and prospects of this country the agitation which has commenced and is going on in regard to human rights there is no more salutary discipline for an age and a people than tobe engaged in the contest for great principles it is a regenerating process our fathers learned the value of liberty by doing ind enduring in its behalf we can learn its value only in the same way we can know the truth only by doing the truth once work for it once suffer for it and you will know as you never can know otherwise what a treasure what a fountain of life it is so mighty is truth that if we only grasp at the hem of her garments with a hearty good will a healing and lifegiving power will shoot through our whole being from the itislavery standard progress on long island our friends the fosters who have always been distinguished for the pertinacity with which they pursue an object which they have once undertaken to accomplish without regard to obstacles are still on long island j their experience of the intelligence ot the people of hempstead did not prevent them from going to flushing and holding the meeting under george foxs oak in accordance with the notice published in the last standard though they probably foresaw the reception which awaited them they would we have no doubt had they lived in these days have been behind lots wife in the flight from the doomed city without any fear of a saline catastrophe and in the devout hope of j still finding some who would listen to a call for repentance so they could not turn away from a spot where the great quaker had preached trusting that a few might still dwell there who had some perception of the truths taught by early friends but had fox himself appeared in his leather breeches and we can conceive of no more dreadful apparition to modern quakerism j he would hardly have met with a worse reception of what that reception would be they had a foretaste in a previous meeting which is of in i fie flushytg journal mobocracy onlifonday evening last stephen s and abby k ostsr undertook to deliver a lecture tin slavery at national hall the room was crowded with listeners the tone and tenor of the remarks of the speakers were so objectionable that a portion of the audience who had evidently come prepared to be dissatisfied commenced throwing eggs at abby and stephen the meeting broke up in a row the speakers barely escaping with whole bones a more disgraceful affair never occurred in this village than this attack of a pack of rowdies to use violence against a helpless man and woman abby and her helpmate are entitled to their opinions whatever they may be as much as those who would use violence to restrain them from utteridg their sentiments if the speakers uttered objectionable sentiments the proper way to treat the offence was to leave the room the speakers would not have continued to address empty benches it is too bad that some tenor a dozen mobocrats should be possessed of the power to disgrace by such actions our beautiful village we are the more particular in speaking of this affair in orderthat the respectable portion of our peoplewe mean those who are attached to law and order may advise with the proper authorities upon some means to restrain the spirit of rowdyism which is becoming rather j too rampant there are some dozen or so of geniuses who have for some months been paving their way to notoriety hy sundry acts and they should not be disappointed of the legitimate consequences ot their devility it is quite time that something should be done to abridge their ability to disturb the public quiet we learn from a private letter that the sunday meeting which was here foreshadowed and to which some friendly hand thus endeavoured to give a uew character fulfilled the prophetic j fears of this writer notwithstanding the day was sunday and the place foxs oak under which the disorj ganizer and fanatic of his time had preached and is held venerablewe will venture to sav not one in a hundred of them can tell whyby tbe peoj pie of flushing and m spite of the influence of samuel parsons a friend j and one of the most respectable citizens of the place who declared that the lecturers should be protected in their right to addresi a public assembly the meeting was broken up by the shrieks and screams hisses catcalls beliowings and other characteristic noises of the sundaypious and patriotic people of that town the intelli gesi magistrates of the nlluge proved themselves us civil fathersaccording to the long island fashion we suppose by ordering the fosters ofl the i ground and threatening them with prosecution if they persisted id breaking the peace by affording an object fort the brutality of tbe people thus beaded by these civil fathers on which to vend itself mrs foster was struck in the faceby an egg which fortunately howf ever contained tmbrjq chicken an instance of the prodigality of the flushiogites for which we were nol prepared though it proves the sincerity of their admiration of slavery thal they are willing to rob their own henroosts to show how entirely they approve of a higher sort of theft mr and mrs foster have this week gone more into the interior of the island and we have some hope ot hearing better accounts from them there we subjoin a communication which we find in the hempstead inquirer which would find a fining place among the specimens of the literature of the south which we are wont from time to time to give upon our first page itis a fitting defence of the cause it advocates and properly holds up the hands of the editor of the inquirer from whom we quoted last week and who we hear by the bye is a pious member lof the methodist episcopal church whether north or south our informant sayeth not icp in the last number of the long island farmer its editor expresses agreat deal of regret that the spirit of misrule should have broken out in this village in connection with some lectures which were delivered here by the notorious foster and his more notorious wife abby now we by no i means intend to become the defenders of any who resort to turbulent means to deter any person however disreputable from the expression of any sentiments however disgracelul there are other and better ways of preventing or at least of remedying the mischief but we hold him who with a full knowledge of the nature of the opinion which foster and his wife profess to entertain and of the nature of their method and style of propagating them would defend those opinions or justify the language oftheir exponents as one whose judgment should not be relied upon as a public teacher and whose notions of what is due to public decency are neither safe nor respectable the object of the lectures as far as we could understand it was two foldto demonstrate the enormity of slaveholding and to suggest means of its abolition and to illustrate the first it was considered necessary to proclaim in the most positive manner that the great majority of the people of this republic have thought fit from confidence in their integrity and honor to entrust the making and the execution of our laws and in whom we have confided the safety of our iifstitutions and the honor of our country are in the most literal apd emphatic sense liars thieves and pirates and to ppint out the second it was recommended that thegonstitutfon and of the country shonldbe boldly and deliberately violated trampled and spurned with the view of a fence effecting n dissolution of afid designedly exposing the southern section ofthe country to tjie horrors of a sty vile insurrection whereby it is fondly hoped that the negroes there might by fire and the sword rapine and murder establish themselves as misters of that region the arguments by which these views were upheld were as little respectable jin point of logic as the sentiments which they were intended to justify are in point of morality and whenever any person of respectability actuated by right motives will endorse the one or espouse the other we hold ourselves ready to make it manifest that a leading motive which prompts the crusade in which foster and his wife are engaged is notoriety no one who listens to them can doubt that they in effect invited disturbance saying that they expected to be insulted and probably assailed is equally wellknown to all who were present and ito engage in any discussion with peri sons of such character would not only be affording them the readiest mans of accomplishing their unworthy object but derogatory to any one who would become their antagonist from the article furnished by foster to the farmer from which the editor of the farmer has evidently imbibed the tone of his own we should be led to suppose that hempstead had been the only place in which these wholesale slanderers had ever experienced any disturbance whereas in fact they took peculiar pleasure in telling in the course of their tirades how frei quently they had been inaulled and assaulted and in truth if auy confidence is to be placed in their own statements they were treated here not only much better than they deserved but with less interruption than they have generally met with the disturbance at most i amounted to some boyish interruptions in the lecture room and some funny expreaaions such as go it spec hurrah for aunt abby and caen equally innocent which occurred during a bar room discussion in which the s worthy who plays second fiddle to the late miss kelly chose to engage him j ae we fervently hope they may fare no i worse elsewhere as to the editor of the farmer in connection with this matter he has been evidently misled as to the manner in which bis new acquaintances conducted themselves i had he beard tbe lectures he would i hove been as prompt as we to have condemned them as not only offensive in manner but disgraceful in substance and we have only to hope that hcre after he willjadopt the principle audi alteram partem before he bears dowr too

the past year kept up regular monthly meetings and circulated much intormation particularly in reference to the introduction of free labor produce instead o that of slave labour besides this i box of contributions had been despatched to the antislavery bazaar ai boston united states which was valued at and assisted materially the pecuniary success of the bazaar which as a whoje realised the sum o dollars the report then proceeded to give a slight sketch of the antislavery cause at large trom which it appeared thatslavery in america still continued to i great extent  being there held in slavery that the churches with some exceptions whicn we are glad to find are increasing bear no testimony against the sin of their land but rather on the contrary lend their sanction to the guilt of the slaveholder the conduct of the american board of commissioners for foreign missions was brought forward to show the inconsistency of their course in leaving the slaves at home in heathen darkness and suffering the tribes to whom they professed to carry the gospel to continue in the sin of slaveholding the discussions in the louses of the legislature were then referred to respecting the question of whether slavery and a slave market should continue to exist in the district of columbia the seat of the government of the free republic of the united states and also as to whether slavery should be extended to the new territory added to the union by the conquest of new mexico several interesting cases were introduced of the sufferings endured by those who from a sense of benevolent and christian duty assisted slaves in their escape trom bondage to freedom fwo of these were fined the respective sums of and dollars other wo have been sentenced to virtual long life imprisonment and another a respectable colored citizen was sentenced to pay a fine of dollars and costs to be imprisoned for ten months and tfren sold into slavery to the highest bidder for fourteen the report then alluded to the satisfactory results of emancipation in the colonies belonging and flenmark aud then proceeded to span up tite number of slaves still in id by professedly christian nations this is computed at  the african slave trade is carried on to an enormous extent and from a carefully prepared statement recently laid before a select committee pf the house of commons it was ascertained that during the last forty ypars  of africans had been imported into brazil into the spanish colonies and into other countries the mortality during the middle passage captures by british cruisers since the year making a grand total of ashe victims of the foreign african slave rade from to added to this ruly appalling statement is the dreadful fact demonstrated by sir te buxton that for every slave embarked one is sacrificed in the wars and tiie deten in the baracoons and thus we have the result that ten millions are the victims of the slave trade for the last forty years of whom three fourths have perished in africa and in the middle passage and the remnant are letl to linger out a wretched existence and to meet a premature death the report concluded by entreating the aid cooperation and earnest prayers of the friendsofthe oppressed the treasurers statement showed the receipts to be s d aqd the expenditure to be bs the committee and office bearers were then appointed for the next year and a circular was read stating that the committee had resolved to send this year as formerly a box f contributions to the boston antislavery bazaar and the contributions requested to be prepared as usual before the ist of november the meeting then proceeded to consider a memorial proposed to be forwarded to the qtieen with the signatures of the women of britain it is to the effect that her majesty wll do allin her power for the extinction of the gave trade and the promotion ef the use of the produce of free labor the meeting agreed to adopt the memorial and to endeavour to interest friends in the city and country with a view to promoting its extensive signature they also proposed to circulate many publications on the free labor question ol which several copies were distributed

have been honest enough to speak their thoughts ever since the first blow was struck in the mexican war there are doubtless many in california who would gladly keep slavery from that territory but there are others and a much more numerous class who immersed as they are in schemes of wealth ami impelled ouwnrd by the most resistless current of avarice which prevails among the present population of that country care little whether slavery is introduced ihere or not too little to take any trouble themselves about it and there is yet another class of californians who instead of being indifferent to this subject are decidedly in love with the scheme of carrying slavery to that region and stand ready to participate in the business whenever they shall be allowed to do sp the

once by the tide of the slave fro m that point he has viewed and judged political parties churches and governments he has embodied and uttered the sentiments of the colored race towards the institutions that oppress that race no wonder then that he has the love and confidence of that oppressed race of man they will give him their confidence while living and when dead they will revere his

inferiority where any exists thai cause the eloquent lecturer showed to be an unnatural prejudice alike unreasonable and disreputable to the whites who indulge it the treatments received by mr r while in europe was admirably contrasted with that which his race is subjected to in this country and we may say the picture was one on ac cotfnt of which we as americans havt cause for deep and painful humiliation wt cannot do mr remond so much injustice as to attempt a synopsis of his speech wlier vve say that it was impressive eloquent earnest brilliant and scathing w idi a just anc honorable

being well and then go ahead mr x louis kossuth ol hungaiy jt is often said that a great man is the creature of an emergency the product of he times without disputing that great enrer i gencies develope the highest human energies we can usually gobeyond these emergencies and find their cause in those very men who manfully meet them when they appear in this view many a hero who seemed thrown up by a popular wave to be the leader of anation becomes doubly great as the cause cf the tumult which by the popular voice he is called upon to direct or allay such a manis louis kossuth the present masterspirit of hungary liouis kossuth is of noble birth and is now forty three years of age at the age of j sixteen we find him in pesth engaged in the study of law he was extremely poor but his industry and energy precured him malty strong friends and among the rest several membeis of the hungarian diet they paid his debts and furnished him in clothes and board and even paid his lecture fees he finished his course of studies entered into picture and succeeded in making a living though nothing more for three or four years he lived in comparative obscurity and then burst upon the stage a public man and such except during three years of most cruel imprisonment has he been ever since the hungarian constitution established in j knew no law or provision against the liberty of the press notwithstanding this j the austrian government has exercised for ths last forty years a most severe censorship i this censorship was not accomplished by any processes of law but the authors of the obnoxious articles were secretly thrust in prison kossuth who lived in presburg in the year conceived the idea of learning the art i of stenography and himself reporting the legislature he did so and published his reports in lithographed copies the government tried every method of checking their i circulation and at last ordered kossuth to discontinue the practice the people now i took the matter into their hands and the papers were carried to the houses ol the subscribers by the privileged messengers of the comitates or counties this went oni until immediately after the sudden prorogation of the diet kossuth several others suddenly disappeared the exciciement was great hut the government declared itself ignorant of the whereabouts of the missing men three years after this kossuth with the unfortunate men who had been entombed in a dungeon svith himappeared before i their families ofhis companions in misery one was blind and another mad but lus own firm constitution had sustained him kossuth the martyr was now the man of the people he became editor of the pesth gazette and in one year the paper i multiplied its subscribers twenty times kossutbs power of writing was felt everywhere the hungarian became the predominating language in many villages the peasants learned to read so as to be able to peruse the gazettethe attacks upon the government and its officials were unceasing anu decided improvemennt in the administration of iaw was perceptible every where government at last bought the paper of the proprietor and kossuth was of course cut adrift he then endeavored to establish a paper of his own but did not succeed heat this time suggested the idea of a protective union ft had its basis in this it had been three hundred years the policy of i the austrinn government to extract as much wealth as possible from hungary this was vione in various ways the system of absen i teeisrn was encouragedthe noble and wealthy weie drawn and kept at ienna and everything exported from hungary into the hereditary states went duty free in consideration of thiskossuth became the head of a society which in a short time numbered more than half of the nation and which resulted in the establishment of manufactories while the noblest ladies instead of foreign silks wore coarse hungarian cottons the nature j and objects of this society are indicated in the original proposition as follows hungary is divided in komitats counties if we should succeed in inducing two inuufactureis to settle in each county if we could give them the nescesary lands it would be to the interest of those manufacturers to build the roads neecessrv to a communication with the surrounding markets if successful we should thus have at least four principal highways in each county to j empower these men io carry ontheirmanufae tories and to bring them to perfection we i must guarantee them not only a maiket but for the first years even pecuniary aasistanee the whole nation therefore has to bind itself by its word of tionor not to use or purchase the products of any lereign manufacturer until its own manufacturers should be able to produce articles equal to that of foreign countries this union was at last dissofved by the cunning of mettermcii and his toolskos auth retired slandered but he could not j remain idle and immediately expended his energies in endeavoring to create a free harbor m h lume to be connected with pesth by j railway his was to be followed by a hun gaiiaii navy and the people look up the idea wall enthusiasm here he was foiled again m ll we ijui n the ilie emperor of austria opened his diet and kossuth immediately became the soul of i it from november h to march j he accomplished more by bis power of pei suasion and eloquence tfiau france had effected with the bayonethere the events ofhis fife crowd so quickly and startlingly jupon owe another tbt we have wot apace to chronicle them he made ministerof finance president of the ministry and carries avery measure that he proposes since the abdo cation of the emperor ferdinand on december d the history of kossnth has been the history of hungary that he is the prominent man now upon the worlds stage none doubt who know his recent history he is a powerful writer an eloquent orator a statesmau of consummate abiluyand m all points s truly great man his oratory is astonishing he has fine features and a commanding presence he addressed and carried the germans in german he spoke to the sclaves in the mountain cities in the slovak languages and raised them to a pitch of fearful excitementthe catholic j clergy he gained in their assembly council at sumog by a thrilling speech in he has already run a career of glory and the way seems clear before him for yet higher renown he hai succeeded in fastening the attention of the world and engaging the sympathies of all true friends of freedom fynngjicld republican george thomson of england groton july friend garrison we were favored yesterday with a visit from an agent of the american colonization society the rev mr pratt he occupied the pulpit of the orthodox church in the morning and the unitarian in the afternoon his discourse the one to which listened and both were alike i suppose was made up of the absurd contradictory and wicked arguments usually advanced in support of african expatriation ido not propose to allude to them particularly but simply to notice an assertion in reference to george thomson which greatly surprised me he said that the hon george thomson asserted in his place in the british parliament that the scheme ot african colonization as advocated by the american colonization society was the only means of destroying slavery and the slave trade and elevating the colored race in other words that he advocated the claims of that society how is it i ought to say perhaps that mr p said nothing abusive of abolitionists yours for the rights of alls c wheeler touching the colonization discourse of the rev mr pratt at groton as described by our correspondent in another column we deem it necessary merely to say for the present that vve have no more doubt that the assertion in regatd to mr thomson is utterly false than we have that the american colonization society is upheld by lying deception cant and brutality jjbrrator peace congress at paris as some apprehensions have been expressed by our friendsjt hat the state of siege tn which parisis at the present time may prevent the contemplated meeting ol the peace congress at paris on the appointed day vve are happy to allay them by the publication of the following extract from a private letter from mr burntt dated at london june d we are waiting a few days for the political agitation and the cholera to subside in paris before vve goto make the final arrangements we shall assume that the congress will certainly be held in paris but if any awful convulsions occur to render it impracticable we shall arrange so as to change our place of meeting to brussels at the shortest notice so i hope you will not entertain a doubt for a moment of the congress being held at the appointed time it will not make an hours difference in time or a farthing in expense to shift to brussels if anything unforseen should occur to induce us to go thith er in addition to the above our friend edmund fry informs us that mr de tocque vtlle the present minister for foreign affairs in france has given in his name to be one of the committee of arrangements in paris ch citizen proscription in ohio henry c wright in a letter to the liberator dated massillon stark co has the following account of a shameful instance of proscription on account of color enacted by the hypocritical religionists of that town wherein is christianity better than heathenism if it authorises such violation of right there are some six or eight families ol i colored people here having some twelve oi fifteen children of suitable age to be in the school when the school was opened last year under the management of the present trustees and teachers the colored children were admitted with others and were treated by teachers and scholars the same as others the children associated with them in free and loving intimacy and so did the teachers and trustees none made their complexion their leproach the colored children as to talents and behavior were on a par with the others and some of them were the brightest and best behaved scholars in the school as teachers and trustees assure me but this was not to be endured soon some parents began to cry out against having their children i associated with colored children a petition j was circulated by george hine a church member to gel the colored children excluded i from the school a meeting was called ol the voters of the town and by a formal town vote the colored children were excluded from the school this was done under the fol i lowing act at that time iu force and now it is but little better the past winter the law was amended so as to make it optional with the trustees to exclude them or not j sec and be it further enacted that iin every city incorporated town or village seat of justice or organized township m this state containing a less number than twenty black or colored children desirous of attending school it shall be the duty of the directors of any school district organized for the education of white children to admit said black or colored children upon the same terms and they shall be entitled to the same benefits as they would he if they were white under the acts to which this is an amendment provided no written objection be filed with the directors signed by any person having a child in such school or by any legal voter of such district thus you see any drunken polluted vagabond of this town is by law empowered to cast all the colored children however intellectual w ellbehaved and desirous to learn from the public schools so george hine a member of a church in good and regular standing volunteered to do tlie deed or to lead on others to do it there are no other public schools in town but this there are no private schools this public oue having swallowed them all uj and lam told the daughter of george hine before this school was opened taught a private school and went to the colored people and solicited their patronage and urged them to send their children to her school the colored people are too few and too poor to sustan a school consequently their children are without schooling then the very persons who drive them fiom the school are ever taunting them for their ignorance never was malignity more satamc what else can colored people be but deadly enemies of the whites l it is the government and the religion that make them enemies that drive them to ignorance and vice and then punish them there are no instances in the records of man of more commendable forbearance and suppression of revenge and its murderous promptings than are found among the oppressed of this re public in this action ot the church and state what makes it peculiarly hateful is that the law and the fact are a direct violation of the constitution of the state which they both recognize a tbeir supreme law when congresa framed a government for the territory of ohio it set apart one section of land ui each town to constitute a fund for the education of til the children the state constitution was framed in the following u the section touching schools sec that no law shall be passed to pteveol ihe poor in the several counties andi townships within thia state from an equal participation in the schools academies colleges and universities within this state which are endowed in whole or in part from the revenue arising from donations made by the united states for the support of schools and colleges and the doors of such schools and universities shall be open to the reception ofi scholars students and teachers of every grade without any distinction of preference whatever contrary to ihe intent for which said i donations were made nothing could be more explicit this pub lie school of massillon receives annually over dollars of that donation given by j you by me and by every man and woman to educate all the children of massillon without any distinction or preference whatever and yet george hine the church member and his allies break into our schixd and thrust out some twelve or fifteen of the scholars solely because of their complexion j ministers and churches are dumb about it nay not duned they hound on those who perpetrate this mean satanic deed and then denounce us as infidels and atheists because we wdl not worship at their shrine and allow j them to call over us the name of their god their god is a fiend their religion an imposition and for one intend soto treat it and him and to call on all the outraged and oppressed to join me that fiend to whom the perpetrators of uch atrocities build churches rung make prayers and ser j mons and perlbrm orship whom they dignify with the title of god must be dethroned from the hsarts of the people before they can admit the reign of humanity and justice and before they can be made to have any j just conception of him who created this world and engraved on the constitution of our social emstence the lawdo to others as you would that they should do to you will not the convention of colored people j to meet august istin cincinnatitake up this matter where are the freesoilers of ohio why do they not make the abolition of these laws and

bibles and testaments for distribution among the colored people we have received through a benevolent friend of the oppressed in this country one hundred copies of bibles and testaments which are at our disposal for gratuitous distribution among colored families destitute of the sacred scriptures it is proper to state that these bibles have been generously given for this purpose by the british and foreign bible society and that the same society will be happy to furnish us with an additional supply if more shall be needed any person destitute of a bible and wishing to obtain a copy of either bible or testament will be provided with pleasure at the north star office f d charles lenox kemoqd intelligence from the west assures us of the interest excited in that quarter by the happy efforts of this talented and eloquent advocate of equal rights for a very handsome notice of his first lecture in chicago we refer our readers to the article in another column copied from the daily tribune of that city the first oi august celebration at cincinnati it is now certain that cannot fulfil my engagement to be present at thia interesting anniversary the searching illness to which i have been subjected during the past fortnight has left me in a condition wholly unfit for the fatigue of the journey and the labors expected of me on that occasion i shall share mutually with my beloved friends and coworkers in cincinnati the regret and pain of this disappointment to say that i have looked forward to this occasion with far more interest than i ever contemplated a similar anniversary is but weakly to express ray feelings i have long desired to visit cincinnati a good report has gone forth of the enterprize spirit industry intelligence and independence of the colored citizens of that place and i wished to see them face to face to press their industrious hands and commune with them on the destiny of oar enslaved and oppressed fellow countrymen i expected to see them and to return home refreshed strengthened and invigorated by my fellowship with them i his great happiness is denied me for the best undoubtedly but how hard is it for short sighted beings like ourselves to submit to disappointments without a murmur i shall not however despair of meeting my fellow sufferers under the ban of oppression in cincinnati still hope that the day is not far distant when i shall have the pleasure of meeting and confering with them on the great subject nearest our hearts f d w e call attention to the letter of our vigilant british correspondent as containing the latest synopsis of the affairs of england and ol europe in general we share deeply the indignation he feels for the unnatural and extraordinary conduct ot the french republic towards the friends of liberty in rome the position of france in this matter is but another proof that the spirit of tyranny and oppression finds a place as secure in the bosom ot a republic as in the heart of a despotic names are nothing the shouting ot liberty equality and fraternity l in parisand the slaughtering the friends of freedom at rome is like the conduct of our own republic which fills the world with its boasts of liberty while it holds in the most abject bondage oue sixth part of its entire population many of the basest acts of our government against freedom and justice have been perpet rated in the sacred name of liberty the annexation of texas the mexican warthe florida war though each and all intended to strengthen and sustain slavery were defended in the name of justice and right if we go on at this rate much longer these terms will lose their significance republicanism will change places with despotism and the birth of a republic instead of being hailed with delight by a freedomloving woild will be greeted with groans as the appearance of a monster of oppression the eonduct ot france towards rome and that ol the i nited states towards its colored inhabitants strengthen the arm of tyrants throughout the woild aod serve to make the very names of republic and republicanism vile before all the people in classing france with the united we would not be understood as regarding kn guilt equal to ours france has emancipated her slates and though her conduct in the instance above alluded to ia at variance with this noble act of her provisional government it places her in a position far more creditable to her humanity and sincerity than that occupied by our boasted republic r o  rev henry highland gnrnet this individual we understand is to leave the inited states for england during the approaching autumo the particular object of bis mission to that country is not positively knownbut from the well known views of the party by whom he has been invited andbywhomhe is to be supported while there it is probable that he goes out as the champion of the free produce cause mr garnet is a man of talents and address asa speaker he ranks deservedly amongst the first and most eloquent of his race in this country to an english audience he will doubtless prove a most acceptable speaker and will excite ranch interest whetever he may go his complexion will be a help rather than a hindrance to his success he will find that the warm right hand of human brotherhood will be extended as freely to him in old england as to any other man of whatever color caste or clime he w ill look around in vain among tho crowds of white persons whom he may meet to observe a single averted eye or the slightest manifestation of the bitter and malignant hatred with which the colored man is haunted in this boasted land of liberty he will find to his entire satisfaction that color is no crime in england wepredict therefore that personally the visit of mr garnet to england will be a very pleasant one as to the actual good that the cause of the slave will receive from his labor in that country doubt may be very innocently entertained on thisj point duty requires us to be plain and while we would neither detract from the talents nor the zeal of mr garnet but freely give him the full benefit of our testimony to bothwe deem it due to ourselves as a friend of the cause of emancipation and the elevation of the oppressed as well as to fair dealing to give the public on either side of the atlantic in the most explicit manner our views of the man and his mission in the first place mr garnet has again and again declared that he had no faitli in moral means for the overthrow of american slavery that his hope for success was in the sword he has held up moral suasion repeatedly to the scorn and contempt of the colored peoplejn our presence and made many speeches in favor of insurrection among the slaves and these sentiments have never to our knowledge been recalled uor repented of now for such a man to appeal to the moral sense of england and ask the moral aid of england lor the aboliton of slavery is the veriest hypoersy and hollowness the man whose conviction do not go with his words is not fit to plead this causeand his eloquence will merely be sound and fury signifying nothing another reason which leads us to suspect no good from the visit of mr garnet to englandis that he goes there to espouse a cause which we believe he has never advocated here either by precept or example now a man who will advocate a cause abroad with respect to which he is silent at home does not give the best evidence of sincerity and leaves the impression that his motives are at least questionable when and where has mr garnet written or spoken a word in this country in favor of abstinence from slave produce we have attended with him many conventions where he has taken an active and even a leading part but we never remember to have seen the first line from his pen or heard the first word from his lips stating him to be an advocate of the use of free produce he may have become converted recently but if so one would suppose that he would have made his conversion public at home at least as soon as he published it abroad but no such profession has been made here and the natural inference from  the fact is that this profession of faith is intended for a foreign market rather than for home consumption the party who has invited him to england hires him to advocate a givent movement and mr garnet likej a practical man prepares himself for his office we do not hesitate to say that no reliance may be placed upon any statements which he may make respecting the north star or its editor should he condescend to notice either while in england his feelings towards us so far as we have been able to learn them aie those of bitter hostility his course here has been that of an enemy and we have no reason to believe that his course abroad j will be that of a friend we now take leave of mr garnet having honestly given our i opinion of hirn he is at full liberty to slander and misrepresent us in england or elsewhere as he has done most liberally in j various parts of the uuited states we prefer an open enemy to one in disguise we therefore without any cowardly disclaimer of i any kind wish it to be understood that mr garnet and ourselves are on any other terms than those of good fellowship t n calhoun and beaton the reply of mr calhoun to col benton of missouri is cow before the public and shows the intensity of the hatred and bitterness which exist between these two slaveholders and civil politicians as usual mr calhoun affects the utmost contempt for his antagonist but by the ruirmuieness of his rejoinder testifies to the ability and power ol his opponent we rejoice to see these senatorial defenders of slavery embroiled and atopen war much truth will be told on both sides to the detriment perhaps of both parties meanwhile attention will be directed to slaverythe bone of contention and agitation will be increased in any event good must result to the antislavery cause from this fierce controversy in mr calhouns repiy to mr benton he takes the same ground as that occupied in his southern address and places slave property on the same footing with property of other kinds it is perfectly horrible to observe the piratelike coolness with which he reasons about his constitutional rights of property in the bodies and souls of men and about the injustice and violence done to the slaveholders by refusiug to treat slaves as other property the ironhearted blood socker never seems to tftiect os one moment upon the fraud wrong and flagrant injustice which he is every hour perpetrating upon his victimsat the same time that he is audaciously prating about the rights of slaveholders it is most astomshingvat a reasoner so logical with perceptions so keen should involve himself m contradictions so palpable and in inconsistencies so glaring as those into which mr alhoun is constantly placing himself aman tn his position an atrocious robber of hs fellowcreatures of their daily toil and of all their rights and liberties should tremble at the very utterance of the terms might and justice yet this wretch can discourse as eloquently on these subjects as though his guilty soul were not stained with the foulest injustice and the most terrible crimes some years since he hid dow n the doctrine tn his place in the american senate that the laborer has a nghuo the fruit of his toil against the universe and that he who deprives him of it is a robber by his ow n standard blinding mr calhoun as a robber of the worst kind r n democrats nod free soilers union the late rupture in the demoaratic camp seems in a fair way to be healed overtures for union are being made on all hands we have already recorded notices of the uniteu platform of four or perhaps five of the slates the basis of union must of necessity in all such cas i be brought down very nearly to the level of the most conservative party th free soil men lose much in character and in fiuence by such movements it is in every case a sacrifice of principle to interestoi conviction to expediencyof honest and truthful independence to the expectation or hope ol political gain and preferment why should free soilers wish to unite with any party or any basis were it not from some such motive two or three are sufficient to make a party if a party must be made one is sufficient tc stand alone if he is only satisfied of the truth of his principle this descent of tho freesoil party from the platform which they erected at buffalo low and inadequate as that was is additional confirmation of the utter inetficacy of any plan for bringing the truth into successful operation which depends upon the external power of a majority and noi upon the irresistible influence of conviction let the free soilers merge themselves intc the democratic party and they are lost forever to the cause of freedom except as wlier not under government pay or the expectatioi of it restive units opposed to an overwhelming majority a consulting convention of barnburner and hunkersit seems is shortly to be held ii rome in this state to devise ways and mean to bring about the desired result convention have already been held in some of the eoun ties the following resolutions were adoptei at one held in onondaga co resolved that we tho delegates representing the two sections of the democratn party in the county of onondaga having mein county convention and consulted togcthc in relation to the unfortunate division now existing among the democracy in this count and state and on such consultation having ascertained that there is no substantial difference of opinion between us in relation toques lions of principle nor sufficient difference o opinion in relation to questious of expediency to justify the continued separation of thost who desire to unite in support of common principles have resolved upon the reunion and reorganization of the democratic party in this country resolved that in our estimation slavery in its moral social and political character and influence is an evil and that its introduction into the territories recently acquired by our govenrment ought not to be permitted resolved that under the federal constitution all power of sovereignty over the territories prior to their admission as states and also the district of columbia belong to the people of the united states and are to be exercised by their representatives in the federal government these resolves are tame enoughinoffen sive enougli yet the hunker members of the convention made many wry faces in the swallowing of them the first resolve asserts that the two sections of the democratic paity are the same in principle and that there is little difference of opinion in relation to questions of expediency what did they divide about then or have either party come up to the standard of the other look at the hunker resolutions immediately before the last election and these which they now swallow with so much difficulty are not u circumstance to them the hope of keeping themselves in office made the hunkers profess liberality then the expectation of retrieving their fallen fortunesand reaping again the fruits of office leads the free toilers to become parties to such an impotent conclnsion now the second resolution affirms slavery to be an evil most marvellous discovery and that its introduction into the territories ought not to be permitted ought not tobe permitted an evil ought not to be permitted discovery still more marvellous did these gentlemen ever hear of an ivil that l ought to be permitted if they have they surely will not fail for the benefit of humanity to make their discovery known the prevailing opinion has hitherto been that no evil whicli can by any possibility be prevented ought to be permuted v here and jow have the parties to this resolution been spending their days that they have just awoke to a knowledge of this fact the third resolution however is doubtleea the one aboul i which difficulty was prmcipaily experienced j it affirms the doctrine that all power over the district of columbia and the territories previous to their admission into the union as states belongs to the people the assertion of this doctrine is dangerous ground for the i hunkers if they allow that power over the territories belongs to the people they must also be prepared to grant that any evd which is likely to find a place in the territories and which the power of the people can prevent j ought not to be permitted aud here is then dilemma it lias been a favorite mode of shirking the question of preventing the allow i ed evil of slavery from being extended over the territories for them to say with the missouri senator that it is a mere dispute aboul goats woolslavery cannot be mro duced into the territories it is a creature of local lawand as there is no law in the territories authorising it existence it caanot constitutionally exist c this has been j their course of action and by it they either intentionally or ignorautly probably the formerbeen for years past playing into the hands of the slavepower and furthering the extension of the sum of all villamea and it payment lot then subserviency they hive got an

slavery to be a creature of local law answer so with respect to new mexico and california it has been a favorite doomne with th p democrats of the old school tint the wilmot proviso is unnecessary with general cass and his admirers that is unconstitutional and the result of this policy is wbait why simply that slaveholders are going to california with their profkhty in droves n d there is now every probability of that territory fiudine a place n the i non as a slave state this result it is not to be denied might possibly take place even were the wilmot proviso to become law for slaverv knows no restraint it acknowledges no law which is not framed to favor its perpetual and constantly extending dominion but this only show show necessary it is for those who trust to political action for the restriction of the slave system to wield the power which ihey pia i sess weak and inefficient as it is for the i accomplishment of their purpose if as they ay the people have all power over the tern tones of course it is to be expected that the j people if their wirepulling leaders will it so will exercise that power for the prevention of the evil of slaverv hut wnen will they will this

decent work they will do dirty work for pay slavery holds the pursestnngs she deals out the cash she casts a rough bone now and then to one and another northern dog just to keep them from barking at the wrung passenger or from baiking at all this has been and is now the policy of slavery and by this policy she succeeds in quelling opposition and in scattering conscientious scruples to the winds there seemed to be reason toi hope when the free soil party adopted a separate organization that they would take their place as the advance guard of the political friends of freedom their reunion with the hunkers on tins platform or oni any plalform deals a deathbiow to all such hopes they must be thereafter just what i their party make them they must go to make up as heretofore the sum total of

lronr such a reliable source as tins j is messrs kditors i saw an admission in ii your paper last week which i think is calculated to do a majority of the ministers of the gospel in this state injustice you gavo as j your opinion that most of this class of men i are in favor of the present movement for the emancipation of the slaves in this i think i you were mistaken the baptist is th most numerous denomination in kentuckye having more communicants than the methodists and presbyterians united speak ad visediy when i assure you that most of the baptist preachers are opposed to agitating the i subject of slaveiy in any way in the ap proachirig convention as an evidence of the i feeling of our ministry upon this subjectal though we number several hundredthere j were only two present at frankfort at the antislavery convention according to their published account as a ministry we are opposed to mingling in polities but being ardent friends of good order and the interests of our beloved state we ate unwilling that any undue influence should be secured to northern fanaticism or its legitimate offspring antislaveryism in kentucky by assigning us a wrong position i also understandand i derive my information from those acquainted with the facts in the piemisesthat the ministry among the reformed v ho are also a numerous denomination are generally opposed to the present wild and unreasonable movement upon the subject of emancipation i feel sirs that it is due to the denomination of which i am a member as well as necessary to the interest of the cause of truth that your attention should be called to the above facts hoping that success will attend every laudable effort which is made through the columns ot your valuable paper to thwart the schemes of the present agitators of slave ry i remain yours ca baptist preacher incredible there must surely be omo mistake here the idea of a man who pretends to teach christianity carefully clearing himself by such a disclaimer as the above trom any share in that work which is one the main objects of the christian systemuamely the promotion of the brotherhood of man seems to be utterly irrational and impossible he does this besides not for himself only but for the entire denomination in kentucky i assure you says he that most of the baptist preachers are opposed to agitating the subject of slavery in any way in the ap proachmg convention and in confirmation of this statement he mvj that only two out of several hundreds were present at tin frankfort convention the baptist denotnin anon in kentucky aie therefore the upholders of slavery this baptist preacher is very desirous that they should lose none of the high honor attaching to their character of friends of the inanstealiog womanwhipping licentious slaveholder it the baptists ot kentucky have that honor i it will hang like a millstone around their necks drag giog them down to the lowest depths ol infamy and disgrace ijo the baptists ol the erth associate with these kentucky brethren it they do they are equally wah them the lends of the slaveholder and the enemies of christianity and of man their claim to the name of christians is unfounded they are no more christians than they arc fire worshippers ijtl them dip or sprinkle or what they will and call themselves baptists the above letter from a baptist preacher helps us to a knowledge of what a baptist a pan of his creed is that slavery is right that tho present movement on the subject ot emancipation is wild aud unreasonable and that the schemes of the agitators of this slaveiy question should be thwarted an excellent church thisor blatter and the glorious company of slavesellers slavedriver and slavebreeder within her ample fold the entire gang ay

although it was i the month of january nor much co ering to warm me and by degrees m spirits weakened and my heart sunk a the desolate wretchedness of ever thing around me and gradually lo what i

ever fixed itsell upon tlie trial that had within a few hours to go through and as reflected on it a terror sprea over me almost in an instant a though it were that my sentence wa just pronounced and that j had nc known really and seriously that i wa to die before i had eaten nothing fo twentyfour hours here was tood which a religious gentleman who visited me had sent from his own table be could not taste it and when i looke at it strange fancies came over meit was dainty food not such as wa served to the prisoners in the jail was sent to me because i was to di tomorrow and i thought of the beast of the field and the fowls of the air that w ere pampered for slaughter j fflt that my own sensations were nc as they ought to be at this time and j believed that for a while i was insane i a sort of dull humming noise that could not get rid of like the buzzing c bees sounded in my cars and thoug it was dark sparks of light seemed t dance before my eyes and i coul recollect nothing tried to say rn prayers but could only recollect i word here and there and then it seemed to ine as if these were blaspherniei that i was uttering i dont know wha they were i cannot tell what i saidi and then on a sudden i felt as thougl all this terror was useless and that would not stay there to die andi jumped up and wrenched at the bar of my cell window with a force lha bent them for felt as it had th strength of a lion and i felt all ove the lock of my door and tried the doo with my shoulder though knew i was plated with iron heavier than tha of a church and i groped about th very walls and into the corners of nr dungeonthough knew very well ii had my senses that it was all of soli stone three feet thick ami that it could have passed through a crevic smaller than the eye of a needle hano chance of escaping and in th midst of all this exertion a faintnes came over me as it i had swullowe poison and i had just power to reel t to the bed place where sank down ia swoon but this did not lastfor in head swam around and the cell seemed to turn round with me and dream edbetween sleeping and waking that it was midnight and that elizabeti had come back as she promised an that they refused to admit her ani thought it snowed heavily and tha the streets were covered with it as ii with a white sheet and that i saw he deadlying in the fallen snow and i the darkness at the prison gate when came to myself w as struggling and breathless in a minute o two heard st sepulchres clod strike ten and knew it was a dreai that had had the chaplain of th prison came without my sending h exhorted me solemnly to think n more of cares and troubles in thi world but to bend my thoughts uno that to come and to try to reconcil my soul to heaven trusting that m sins though they were heavy unde repentance i might have hope ol mercy when he had gone i did fee myself for a little while more collected and i sat down again on the bed and tried seriously to commune witl i myself and prepare myself for my fate recalled to my mind that had but i few hours more at all events to live that there was no hope on earth of es capitig and that it was at least bette j that i should die decently like a manl then tried to recollect all the tale i that i had ever heard about death bj hanging that it was said to be thi sensation of a moment to give no pail to cause the extinction of life instantaneously and so on to twenty othei strange ideas by degrees my heat began to wander and grow unmanageable j put my hands tightly to in throat as though to try the sensatior of stranglingthen i felt my arms ai the place where the cord would be tied i went through the fastening of the ropethe tying of the hands to getlier the thing that i felt most averse to was the white cap mufhed over iny eyes and face if could avoid that the rest was not so very horrible in the midst of these fancies a numbness seemed to creep over my senses the giddines that had fell gave way to a dull stupor which lessened the pain that my thoughts gave me though i still went on thinking the church clock rang midnight was sensible ol j the sound but a reached me indistinct lyas though coining through many closed doors or irom a tar distance by and by i saw the objects before iny mmd less and less clearly then only partially they were gone altogether fell asleep slept until the hour of execution it w as seven oclock on the net morning when a knocking at the door of my cell awoke ine i heard tha sound as though in my dreams lor some moments before l was fully awake and my first sensation was only the dislike which a weary man feels at being roused i was tired and i wished to dose on in a minute after the bolts on the outside of rev dungeon were drawn a turnkey carrying a small lamp follow ed by the mater of the jail and the chaplain entered i looked up a shudder like the shock of elec tricitylike a plunge into a bath of ice ran through me one glance was sufficient sleep had gone as though  had never slepteven as i never was to sleep againl was conscious ot my situation r said the master tome in a subdued but steady tone itis time for you to rise the chaplain asked me how i had passed the night and proposed that we join in prayer gathered myself up and remained sealed on the side of the bedplace mv teeth chattered and my knees i knocked together in despite ol my sell it was barely daylight yet and as the cell door stood open could see into the small paved court beyond the morning was thick and gloomy and a slow but settled rain was coming down it is halt past o clock r said the master i just muttered an entreatv to be left alone till the last moment i had thirty minutes to live i then tried to make anothei observation when the master was leaving the cell but this time i could not get the words out my tongue stuck to the root ot my mouth and in speech seemed gone made two desperate efforts but it would not do could not utter w hen they lett me i never stirred from my place on the bed was benumbed with the cold probably from the sleep and at the unaccustomed exposure and i sat couched together as it were to keep mvsell ii warmer with my arms folded across i iny breast and my head hanging down shivering and my body felt as it it j were such a weight to me that i was unable to move it or stir ihe day was breaking yellow and heavy anc the light stole by degrees into my dun i geon showing me the damp stonewalls and desolate dark paved floor and strange as it was with all l conic do i could not keep myself from notic mg these trilling things though perdition was coming upon me the very nev moment noticed the lamp which the turnkey luul lett on the lloor ane j which was burning dimly with a long wick being clogged with the chill ane j bad air and thought

scrawls and writings upon the wall that had been drawn by formei prisoners and put my hand to mj own pulse and it was so low that i coule hardly count it could not feel though i tried to make myself feel it that was going to die in the inidsi j of this i heard the chimes of the chape clock begin to strike and thought lord take pity on me a wretch i could not he three quarters after sever yet the clock went over the three quarters it chimed the fourth quarter j and struck eight they were in rm cell before perceived them they found me in the place and in the posture as they had left me j what i have farther to tell w ill lie ira very small compass my recollections are very minute up to this point bui not at all so close as to what occurrei afterwards scarcely recollect very clearly how i got from that cell to tini pressroom think two little withered men dressed in black supportei i me i know tried to rise when saw the master and his people come into mj j dungeon but i could not lu the pressroom were the tw miserable wretches tiiat were to suflei i with me they were bound with theii  arms behind them and their hands to gether and were lying upon a bench hard by until i was ready a meagre rf looking old man with thin white hair j who was reading to one of them canu i up and said something i hat w would embrace i did not distinctly hear what it was the great difficulty that had wai to keep from falling i had though i that these moments would have beei all of fury and horror but felt nothing of this hut only a weakness a though my heart and the very  on which stood was sinking unde i ine could just muke a motion tha the old white haired man should leavi r me ami someone interfered and sen him aw ay the pinioning of my hand and arms was then finished and l heard an officer whisper to the chaplain that all was ready as we passed out one of the men in black held t glass of water to my lips but couh not swallow i this was the last moment but om of full perception that bad in life remember our beginning to move forward through the longarched passages which led from the pressroom ti the scaffold saw the lamps tha were still burning for the dayiigh never entered there heard the quid tolling of the bell and the deep voici of the chaplain leading as he w alkei before us i am the resurrection and the life saitli the lord he that believeth in me though he were dead shall live am though after mv skin worms destroy this body yet in my hesh shall i set lod it was the funeral servicethe order of the gravethe office for thost that were senseless and dead over us the quick and the living i felt once moreand saw i fell the transition from these dim close and hot lamplighted subterraneous passages to the open platform and steps at the foot of the scaffold and today saw the immense crowd llacken j ing the whole area of the streets below me the windows of the shops and houses opposite to the fourth story choked with gaers i saw st sepul chres church through the yellow fog in the distance had heard the pealing of its bell recollect the cloudy misty morning the wet lay upon the scaffoldthe huge idark mass of buildings the prison itself that rose beside and seemed to cast a shadow over u the bold fresh breeze that as i merged from it broke upon my face see it w nowthe whole horrible inndacajm is before me the scaffolduse ramthe faces of the multitudethe people clinging to the house topsthe smoke that bent heavi t ly downwards from the chimneys the i wagon filled with women staring at the innvard opposite the hoarse low roar thatran through the gathering crowd as we appeared never saw many objects at once so plainly ami distinctly in all my life as at that one glance but it lasted onlv lor an instant from that look and from that instant all that followed is a blank the prayers of the chaplain ot the fastening of the fatal nooseol the putting on the cap ot which l had so much dislikeof my actual execution and death i have not the slightest atom of recollection hut that know such occurrences must have taken place should not have the smallest consciousness that they ever did so read in the daily newspapers an account of my behavior at the sea hold that i conducted mvselt decently but with firmness of my deaththat i seemed to die almost without a struggle of any of these events i have not been able by any exertion to recall the most distant remembrance with the first view of the scaffold all my recollection ceases the next circum j stance whichto my perception seems to follow is the having awoke as if from sleep and found myselt in abed in a handsome chamber with a gentleman as i first opened my eyes looking attentively at me i had my senses perfectly that l had been reprieved at the scatlold and had fainted after i knew the truth i thought i had an imperfect recollection of having found or fancied myselfas in adream in some strange place lying naked and with a mass of figures floating about before me but this idea certainly never presented itself to me until l was informed of the fact that had occurred the accident to which i owe my existence wili have been divined my condition is a strange one i am
