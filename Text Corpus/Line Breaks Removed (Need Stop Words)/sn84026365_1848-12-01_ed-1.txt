availability the downward course years ago when the proposal was first made to the abolitionists to organize themselves into a distinct political party we were warned by many a faith m watchman for truth of the danger ofj ireb a measurebegun as it must be w conceding strict principle to seeming expediencyof the great liability if not the suro necessity of still further compromises and coalitions to the sacrifice of our integrity past history gave illustrations to enforce the argument but in spite of these our political friends thought they could venture on this path of expediency with safety though they saw that others had been wrecked in that course with a common and delusive confidence that their higher devotion to principle would keep them secure from evil they pressed on the same way which had led so many before to abandon principle for power the years which have passed have been swift witnesses of the truth of those timely warnings and cautions they have confirmed our conviction whatever may be the nature of political action itself that under our constitution any political action must be conceived in sin and begotten in iniquitythat it must have a fatal tendency to compromise it begins by preferring availability to right and can succeed in getting power only pursuing the same downward course a brief review of one chapter of antislavery history will illustrate itin its commencement the liberty party professed to be thoitughly anti slaver to aim at nothing short of the entire ah dition of slavery throughout the country immediate emancipation was a leading article of its creed its organs declared that they could consistently support no man for office who would not re present their antislavery principles they generally denounced the proslavery policy of the government and denied all obligations to regard the compromises by which the north were pledged to uphold slavery to save their consistency most ot them in some way maintained an antislavery construction of the constitution and thus by bad logic tried to keep good consciences they professed to glory in the name of abolitionists odious as it was then the mass of its members were no doubt sincere however inconsistent in their position with these feelings and to promote these aims they nominated mr birney who was distinctively committed before j the country as an abolitionist at that time we believe that the honest masses of the party would have been shocked at the thought that they could ever take the position they now hold but being defeated in their attempt to hold j up the principles of abolitionism they yielded to the seductive plea of availability and joining with the independent democrats whj chose mr hale as their presidential candidate bold and manly as bis course had been as a member of congress they knew he was not committed to any peculiar antislavery principle they had no evidence that he would recommend and sustain the measures they had avowed hi opinions of the compromises of the constitution were at variance with their i own but be was near enough to them ito content to be their candidateand the influence of hia name was a prize too rich to b refused this cnaeeasion to availability startled aod alienated a few ef the more rigid of their members but l the north star tbe great body were eleted at it ae i grand stroke of policy their next step of concession as u well known was a coalition with th barnburners in the support of mr van buren who had gained a most unenviable notoriety by his base bowing ol the knee to the dark spirit of slavery and who instead of showing any sincere repentance of his past proslaver action openly justified it end had just said of that action in tis letter to the utica convention the extent to which i have sustained it slavery in the various stations i have occupied is known to the country i was at that time well aware that i went further in this respect than many of my best friends could approve but deeply impressed by the conviction that slavery was the only subject which could endanger our blessed union i was determined that no effort on my part within the pale of the constitution should be wanting to sustain its compromises as they were understood and it is now a source of consolation to ine that i pursued the course i then adopted it is true he frankly withdrew hi pledge to veto an act abolishing slavery in tte district of columbia and committed himself against the extension of slavery into new territory but he still maintained abolition iu the district tobe unwise and must of course discountenance the passage of such a law he counselled a considerate forbearance toward slavery where it now exists and carefully assured the south that he should fully sustain the compromises of the constitution having chosen mr van buren as their candidate and placed him before the country as the great representative of their principles they were under a temptation too strong for many of them to resist not only to defend his present position but to justify or extenuate hi past course all the past political life of the northern man with southern principles once so odious to the friends of freedom for its servile cringing to the slave power by the wondrous this nomination becomes transmured into a cause eminently patriotic and just or if any faults are visible in it they incline to virtues sidethey are the spots on the suns disc and which must be hunted for tobe found and then are not worth anything the public has greatly misunderstood his policy towards slavery his vote for the gaglaw suppressing the circulation of antislavery publications by mail his action towards the ainistad africans his policy toward cuba bis gratuitous veto pledge and ail his other proslavery acts so often denounced by abolitionists are excused and almost or entirely justified lt is melancholy to see this apology for wrong by men who once would have thrust theirright hand into the fire before they would have written it such a course must be demoralizing not only to the men who take it but to the community at large we give mr van buren full credit for his course against texas annexation and the extension of slavery and for having broken from his old party and taken a bold slaud against the arrogant encroachments of the slave power and we would gladly overlook the sins of his past political life if we had any proof of his penitence for them bqt we cannot consent for his sake to see a proslavery servility exalted into virtue and patriotism in this connection we may mention that the national era makes a labored argument and appeal to the whigs of maine new hampshire and ohio and the democrats of vermont to induce them to go for van buren as their only hope of defeating cass in the three former states and taylor in the last the republic makes a similar appeal to the ohio whigs now suppose the politicians to whom this proposal is made shall show auy disposition to accept it provided the van buren men will all w them a sufficient consideration may we not look upon another compromise and coalition the temptation will be too strong we fear for political virtue though the free soil men probably as little dream now that they could sacrifice their present principles for such a union as they once dreamed as liberty party men they i could vote for van buren or any other person opposed to the immediate eraan j cipation in the district of columbia j we shall watch the future course of this party with interest while we must in fidelity to our cause and principles counsel all abolitionists to stand aloof from it and all other politiral parties j and apply themselves with unfaltering zeal to their great moral enginery lor the promotion of immediate emancipation throughout the nation and the world let us cling to the right and and we are safe and must succeed the first step of compromise for availability opens the way to unknown dangers and probable defeat

happiness are infinitely better off than most of themselves the sentiments here attributed to gen butler are neither new nor pei culiar whoever has given ordinary attention to the opinions of the

such incendiaries our slaves are happy and contented they sustain the happiest relation that bor lacan sustain to capital tbe sieve system of the south is essentially the feudal system of the middle i ages continued and the serfdom of the producing classes without regard to color or kindred is its very heart and soul the southern aristocrat mays talk of democracy but he acknowledges no difference iu fact between i the chattel slave of tbe south and the wages slave of the north nor can his judgment be fairly impeached while the one does hi work for victuals and clothes and the other fights his battles at the same rate and both alike submit to his usurped dominion over them when a man either by force or by choice becomes the tool of a tyrant he must take the contempt which belongs to his condition it not the declaration of independence that can emancipate the toilers while they are happy and contented in their bondage ignorance and disregard of principle and slavish submission in the white working man to the class of masters receives its just recompense in the insolence of such men as calhoun butler and davis the laboring man who gives his suffrage to the man who oppresses and despises him ought to do so with enthusiasm and go it with a rush for if he stops long enough and keeps cool enough to think he will make the unpleasant discovery that he is both a fool and a slave

and the light he intended should beam upon their darkened minds is almost excluded by artificial regulations which state governments have formed for the purpose of keeping them in perpetual bondage yes in this gorious republic and in the midst of the light of the nineteenth century there are hundreds of thousands of adults who are kept by the wicked policy of man in profound ignorance who as far as regards intellectual improvement arc mere children and who have not yet entered upon that career of improvement which nature has opened before them the slam and stripesthe glorious banner of the

exercise their prosper influence upon them for they seld rn enlighten their minds or purify th to hearts destitute of the great gilt ot reason and of other faculties they migbt perform all the duties which they now perforin and enjoy all the pleasures they now enjoy slavery interferes greatly with the domestic happiness of the slave population the pleasant associations that linger around the home of even the humble cottager have no connection with the rude cabin of the sluve the inmates of those unsightly abodes are generally as destitute ot interest as the dwellings are of beauty and the slaves retire to them at the close of their daily lab h like pnsouers to their cells not to mingle in intelligent conversation with their iaimlies or to enjoy the refined pleasures of social life but to rest from the fatigues of the day and to gratify their auimal propensities all those things that constitute attractions of homes of freemen are unknown to the cheerless abodes of slaves they are more like it rational brutes than like bemgs endowed with immortal minds susceptibleof endless improvement in knowledge and iu virtue the institution of slavery also affects the family relations of slaves as they hre entirely the property of their masters and as they may be diaposed of by them whenever their interest or caprice may dictate the family relations are liable at any time to be disturbed husbands may be torn from their wives and children from their parents at the option of their owners slaves have uatural affections as well as civilized men and we cannot doubt but they have experienced a vast amount of suffering in consequence of their separa tion slavery also produces debasing effects on the morals of slaves it is the nature of slavery to destroy every noble feeling of the mind and to leave inexistence those of a grovelling nature persons thus circumstanced fall more easily victims to the artifice of unprincipled men even in civilized countries where slavery does not exist many of the young and inexperienced are enticed from the path of virtue by the wickedness of artful men and it must in the nature of things be still worse in communities where the persons of individuals are within the control of their owners we have reaeon to believe that in ltose communities of fences against virtue and decency are frequently committed that unsuspecting slaves oflen become an easy prey to those who should be the prectors of their ionocence we have reason to believe that the slaves are as destitute of virtue as they are ol intelligence nod that the want of both is

are now prepared to take on this most important subject beg leave to submit the following report and the accompanying resolutions the time has arrived when the slaveholding states of this confederacy must take decided action upon the continued attacks of the north against their domestic institutions or submit in silence to that humiliating position in the opinions of mankind that longer acquiescence must inevitably reduce them forbearance is often a virtue with nations as with individuals but when it involves the loss of position or character in either it is base dishonorable submission if the south will permit the constitution to be trampled under foot if she is willing to become a fixed minority used only to assist in registering edicts for a jealous hostile and unjust majority who admit no rule to govern by but their own wills and no measure but the keenest conception of their own interest it is best that it should be known to us at once and that we should endeavor to accommodate curselves aswell as we may to a state of things so degrading that such will be the inevitable result of longer submission to the incessant attacks on our characters and institutions your committee cannot for a moment doubt unless the south shall take firm and concerted action to prevent it the agitation of the subject of slavery commenced in the fanatical murmurings of a few scattered abolitionists to whom it was a long time confined but now it has swelled into a torrent of popular opinion at the north it has invaded the fireside and the church the press and the halls of legislation it has seized upon the deliberations of congress and at this moment is sapplng the foundations and about to overthrow the fairest political structure that the ingenuity of man has ever devised the overt efforts of abolitionism were confined for a long period to annoying applications to congress undercolor of the pretended right petition it has since directed the whole weight ef its malign influence against the annexation of texas and had well nigh cost to the country the loss ot that important province but emboldened by success and the inaction of the south in an unjust and selfish spirit of national agrarianism it would now appropriate the whole public domain it might well have been supposed that the undis turoed possession of the whole of oregon territory would have satisfied the nonslaveholding states this they now hold by the incorporation of the ordinance of into the bill of the last session for establishing a territorial government for oregon that provision however was not sustained by them from any apprehension that the territory could ever be settled from the states of the south but it was intended aa a gratuitous insult to the southern people and a malignaut and unjustifiable attack upon ths institution of slavery the boundary between the aiavebolding and ommliwholding fixed by a solemn compact on the part of the two bectiotis known as the miaou n compromise and the line of was adopted aa the limit between thorn whatever may be the opinions of your committee as to the propriety of this compact and the concessions made by the south to preserve

of abmitioo tem and tha unholy lost of political power a territory acquired by the whole eouorty for the use of all where treasure has been squandered like chaff and southern blood poured out like water is sought to be appropriated by one section because the other chooses to adhere to aa institution held not only under the guarantees that brought this confederacy into existence but under the highest sanctions of heaven should we quietly fold our hands under this assumption on the part of the aonslavbeholding states the fate of the south is sealed the institution of slavery is gone and ha existence will be but a question of time are the southern people prepared for such a base abandonment of their natural aoeiat and political rights your committee hope not they believe not what then shall be the remedy your committee are unwilling to anticipate what will be the result of the combined wisdom and ioint action of the southern portion of the confederacy on this question but ss an initiatory atep to a concert of action on the part of the people of south carolina they respectfully recommend for the adoption of this meeting the following resolutions readved that the continued agitation of the question of slavery by the people of the noneslaveholding states by their legislatures and by their representatives in congress exhibits not only a want of national courtesy which should always exist between kindred states but is a palpable violation of good faith towards the waveholding states who adopted the present constitution in order to form a more perfect union resolved that while we acquiesce in adopting the boundary between the slaveholding and nonslaveholdi ng states known as the mtssoun compromise tine we will not submit to any further restriction upon the rights of any southern man to carry his property and his institutions into territory acquired by southern treasure and by southern blood resolved that should the wilmot proviso or any other restriction be applied by congress to the territories of the united states south of deg min north latitude we recommend to our representative in congress as the decided opinion of this portion of his district to leave his scat in that body and return home resolved that we respecifully suggest to both houses of the legislature of of south carolina to adopt a similar recommendation as to our senators in congress from this state resolved that upon the return home of our senators and representatives in congress the legislature of south carolina should be tbuliwith assembled to adopt such measures as the exigency may demand resolved that a copy of the foregoing report and resolutions be transmitted by the chairman of this meeting to our representatives in congress and that copies of the same be laid before both bodies of the legislature of south carolina after a few remarks by the chairman of the committee the report and resolutions were seconded by capt v d v jamison who was followed by capt o m v dania ler the resolutions were then submitted seriatim and together with the report were unanimously adopted on motion of capt jamison it was ordered that copies of the proceedings of this

mobile herald thus writes of gen taylors views ou this subject as expressed by the old slaveholder himself last evening a group of some dozen or more of us were gathered around him eagerly listening to an animated conversation in which his native simplicity of manner was quite charming he ran through various topics which he illustrated with excellent sense and varied information speakingof the freesoil movement in the north he expressed his fears that it would be the absorbing question in the present canvass and engross all other questions he said that he considered the missouri compromise a fair and liberal line for settling the slave question and he was willing to see it adopted while however he regretted the system he deprecated the foreign attempts to abolish slavery he thinks the agitation on the subject fiernicioua to both whiles and blades the two races could not exist together and a mixed race such as obtains in mexico was the greatest evil that society could be subjected to no plan of eradicating slavery met his approbation unless the freed negroes could be removed from the country he wouldnot emancipate his own slaves except on condition that they were willing to go to africa to the northern states he would not send them their condition there would be worse than that of bondage he thought that if the really philanthropic men at the north whose efforts to abolish the system are restricting the privileges of the slave could see its practical oierauon the agitation would cease and there would be lea seal and more wisdom thiliod in the cause as he expressed it

end is not yet the contest for the present political prize has ended and the result as we have always predicted is the elevation of gen zachary taylor an uncompromising slaveholder to the chief magistracy of this nationa nation professedly the freest on the globe and doubtless the slave power will dare claim itas a triumph even over the progress of free principles this they will do not that they so believe but obviously for the ostensible purpose of gulling their unthinking votaries thereby securing their suffrage for the next coming contest to be decided in which should now be considered as fairly begun and so regarded in all of their actions by every vigilant friend of universal liberty and unrestricted equality whatever may be thought by others we regard the result of the late campaign as a victory indirectly gained for freedomnot that the hypocritical canting of unprincipled whig politicians nor thjaljen stupidity of the heartless slaveholding nominee of that party would so indicate but there are other features of this mighty canvass which satisfy us that in the midst of the troubled spirits of darkness there certainly hovered angels of light there are doubtless those of the friends of freedom who notwithstanding the large figure of the vote polled in freedoms cause feel disappointed at the result having expected a much greater vote and many of the enemies of freedom who rejoice at the issue as ominous of the future abandonment of the antislavery movement at the north but let us we mean the people of the north the true friends of freedom one and all be not deceived this our enemies will endeavor most effectually to accomplish by scattering discouragement in every direction and thereby induce us to abandon the effort to throw off the slave power and free ourselves from misrule despotism and slavery it is evident that for years previous to the formation of any other than the two great political parties the whigs have endeavored to gain the ascendancy in this nation and for tliis reason many schemes of policy have been adopted among them as a party it must be admitted that there has been more liberality at the north among the democrats whose most exalted aim appeared to be subserviency and servility to the slaveholders this they managed with such adroitness for years as to keep the laboring classes who were enfranchised in continual hostile array against all other partiesthe opponents of liberty and enemies to the slave hence the democrats so called wereable to maintain the ascendancy as they have done foi years a radical change in public opinion in order to break the spell and tear loose the fetters which the democratic influence had thrown around and bound the north to the south being actually necessary before that monstrous clovenfooted beast could be overthrown for which purpose the antislavery movement was commenced eighteen years ago move recently a political antislavery party was formed as the avowed northern political party and the only party in which honest voters could conscientiously exercise thff right of election the avowed principles of this party were uncompromising hostility to slavery in any shape of existence in this country the whigs having been previously considered the liberal party among whom were many excellent menmen of principle and inveterate opponents of slavery at once assumed to themselves or avowed m their principles all that the liberty party declared or espoused it is evident that this had the effect of securing to their ranks all those who mast have left them aad

political progress when the whig seeing there was no alternative at ooee assumed the position of the free soil party inseparably associating with thair every movement the name of free soil and in many instances the whole of the freesoil motto free soil free territory free speech and free men it was amusing enough to see associated with the name of gen taylor the owner and occupant of a thousand acres of slave territory and three hundred human beings in worse than heathen darkness thus taylor and free soil this was a fraud and deception so palpable that we felt our intelligence insulted whenever we saw the inscription even the democrats iared finger upon their guideposts csss and free soil the unblushing coolness of this last trick is only equalled by the effrontery which suggested iu display conscious as all were that jthe friends of freedom could not in the current canvass succeed and anxiously desiring a defeat of the almost stereotyped administration party and thousands of honest men of both the old parties determined at least to place free principles in the ascendancy determined on supporting the whig party which they did declaring that although their leader was a vile slaveholder he dared not act against the power that elected him which was known to be the professed friend of freedom many were the liberty men as well as professed abolitionists who supported the whig ticket rather than suffer defeat it will readily be perceived that a majority of those opposed to the slave power supported the whig nomination for the present but in doing so rested their support entirely on the principles of freedom espoused by that party further than this we have every assurance they will not go the friends of freedom have everything to hope for in the coming contest for the next four years as the cause is essentially theirs neither of the old parties possibly can succeed it will be useless to make the effort to effect anything they must openly and without guile espouse the cause of freedom in stern and uncompromising opposition to the encroachments of the slaveocracy unfurling the banner of no compromise with slaveholders boldly placing in their front as the

endeavored to spread light and troth on the great and important subject of the elevation of the colored citizens of this oppressive republic and circulate the north star as a medium and means of reaching them and the public at large when they can be reached by no other instrumentality here they gave the best of attention the house being as well filled as could be expected under the circumstanees they being but few in number in the place the people herewith but one exception are poor and consequently unable to do much indeed this adjective may be applied in generaherms to dut

an excellent school for colored children supported by the public fund taught by miss bell an amiable and quite accomplished teacherone who is qualified to teach the children ihe higher aswell as the practical branches of education which has long been and is still much wanted in many of the schools in this country established for colored children miss bell took several classes through their rations exercises several of which had embraced the branches upon which they were examined as late as september but three booths since many of the pupils of which ure quite small yet all both male and

the children in harrisburg i have held three meetings on wednesday thursday and friday eve ningsendeavoring to awaken an interest among our brethren in their own welfare by showing them the necessity of acting and doing for themselvesthat we must in fact become our own representatives in presenting our own claims and making known our own wrongs here there is a good school kept by oar mutual friend mr johnwolf which school i visited finding many pupils of various sixes present but had not an opportunity of testing their qualifications mr wolf i am informed is a gentleman of fine attainments and is much indebted to our able and talented contributor w whipper esq of columbia for the direction of his mind this of itself isa recommendation to him the colored population of this borough is estimated at between seven and eight hundred among whom are many intelligent industrious people several of whom have long been noted for their assiduity in business yet notwithstanding there is an apathy and indifference about our people in this place which tests my ingenuity to account for this is apparent among the young people generally and the females in particular though there are many excellent exceptions of all the places i have yet visited save the single exception of springfield ohio which still bears the palm this place harrisburg i found the most difficult to awaken a general interest among the people perhaps were a saint to descend and attempt to speak to them there would be young women in the assembly who would laugh and make sport on his first appearance and nothing but his scathing rebuke of such conduct would prove an effectual remedy hence if they cannot come to misbehave they may not come at all so that ofa population n seven or eight hundred i had an average of fifty as after the first night the giddy did not come one of the great evils among oar people in the holding of their meetings is late commencing when other meetings are nearly ready to let out ours are but commencing this custom is so common that i found it impossible to get anything like an audience even of the few who did attend until halfpast eight oclock this is sad and i earnestly suggest to our people everywhere an immediate change the common excuse is that they cannot get out earlier but with this i differ and attribute the indifference to a want of interest from the fact that let there be a protracted church meeting a party or any other gathering in which they take an interest and one must go very early to get a seat at all heaven grant that we may be aroused to a sense of our true condition and stimulated to effort adequate to a remedy there are several owners of real estate in harrisburg yet the real wealth among them especially the old residents is fast changing hands

r delany the london times and n y herald our readers will be desirous to know what reply if any the new york herald gave to the severe chastisement inflicted upon it and the rest of the proslavery american press by the london timeswhich will be found on our first page the herald does attempt a reply just such a reply as was to be expected from that miserably mean iniquitous journal it is of course no reply but simply a tirade of recrimination and vulgarity the entire article is too long to publish yet the temptation is strong to publish a part of it and hang thereon a fact or two not by way of rejoinder but simply to show what it is that the new york herald and other papers of that stamp to their everlasting shame be it spoken undertake to palliate and defend says the herald instead of talking to us of the beam ii our eye and the mote in our brothers whi does not the london times the condition of ireland and endeavored ascertaii whether the white slavery established in tha unhappy land on general principles lh envy and admiration of surrounding nations does not present a far more revolting picture in reference to restrictions on civil ant social liberty comfort and morality than tha of the black slaves of the southern states where they live in clover year in and yeai out and where the scars and the lash and the servile misery and degradation cannot for a moment be compared with that of ireland or any of the british dependencies is he aware that the sister country with boundless natural resources and an intelligent and industrious population has been inconnection with the timeworn constitution of england for nearly seven hundred years and that her people are he worst clad the worst housed throughout gods creation talk of slaves pshaw how many thousands of that unfortunate people daring the famine of the last three years and during many a previous one would have been glad to have bad the fare and the treatment of our southern slaves all this about the misery of ireland and the british dependencies may beindeed everyone knows that it is quite truethough there is a difference of opinion as to how much of itis caused by misgovernment and yet the merest child would be ready to answer that although it is true it does not in the least excuse the atrocities perpetrated in this country now let us see what the servile misery and degradation is which cannot for a moment be compared with that of ireland or any of the british dependencies to show this i will quote a few extracts from a book called slavery as it is and could quote enough to fill columns first the slaves are badly fed hon w smith a slaveholder aidby confining the slaves to the southern states where crops are raised for exportation and bread and meat are purchased you doom them to scarcity and hanger it is proposed to hem in the blacks where they are ill red rev geo whitfield my blood has frequently run odd within me to think bow many of your slaves have not sufficient food to eat rev john rankinsthousands of slaves are pressed with the gnawings of cruel hunger during their whole lives many more quotations of the same son might be given but their multiplicatioa is unnecessary they serve to prove that the slaves were not only kept to labor without reward but were at the same time almost denied the means of sabewteoce tree this is some yean since but so mock the worse for that it was at a time when the slaves were less valuable than they are aow a boot the year previous to the introduction of the cotton plant so valueless were the slaves that their masters woe seriously thinking of setting them all at liberty to rid themselves of the burden of supporting then and an the scoundrels wished to starve their slaves such is the heart of a slaveholder a man who has a good hone knows how much thro heme in improved and how much move work he can do if he is well treated one would therefore expect thro slaves would bn well fed when there work for them to do even this however is not always the cans as late as the year thomas clay esq of georgia speakiag of the quantity of the eon given to the slaves say there is often a defect here rev horace moulton at georgia the food at food of the slaves m generally of the poemol kind but it is not needfel to go book even mi fer as to find proof of this feet we horn it m competent authoritythat

tktwant part ef it ssnfetisa of the slave besides bang fed be m overworked no farther proof at this is smmi then the bet kit it is avery rare thing to see a slave over fifty years at age in leonaim it was found by the agricultural society of baton rouge that the decrease of slaves on a well regulated sugar estate over and above the supply by props gation was two ajd a half ri cent even this bad as it is is not the worst of this atrocious system the cruelties to which the slaves are subjected are enough to make ones blood curdle with horror and act the whole soul on fire with indignation two or three instances will serve as a sample mieajah ricks nash county south carolina advertises as follows run away negro woman and two children a few days before she went off i burnt her with a hot iron on the left arm i tried to make the letter m mr wm overstreet lexington runaway a negro man named henry am itfl eye on some acars from a dirk on and under his left arm andmuch acaired with the whip mr nicholas edmunds runaway my negro man named simon he has been shot bully in his back and right arm sheriff of clinton co mi was committed to jail a negro man says bis name is josiah his back very much

he has a scar on his breast also a scar under the left eye and has two buck shot in his right arm mr beyou new orleans runaway the mulatto wench mary has a scar on one side of her cheek by a cut some scars on her back these are a small sample picked at random out of some two or three hundred there are relations of cases of cruelty altogether too horrible to extract indeed it does net seem possible that anything short of incarnate devils could perpetrate atrocities that are laid to the charge of the inhuman slaveholder here is one a comparatively mild case a man named jones living in virginia owned a slave who ran away jones caught him and tied him up and for two days at intervals continued to flog him and rub salt into his mangled flesh until his back was literally cut up the slave sunk under the torture and for some days it was supposed he must die he however slowly recovered though it was some weeks before be could walk add to all this thqt slaves are often badly housed huddled together twelve and twenty in small log huts frequently without floors and subject to the deepest mental and moral debasement and you have a very imperfect picture of what the n y herald says is not to be compared with the condition of ireland or any of the british dependencies that infamous paper further makes this monstrous assertion the condition of the black race in our southern states is generally speaking a condition of comfort from the application of the word however to the serfs in the old world who have been so long plundered beggared and oppressed by a tyrant aristocracy it is supposed that the colored race in this land are equally plundered maltreated and wretched but such is not the case if the colored race were to receive their liberty tomorrow in the southern states they would inone year be reduced to a condition of barbarity ignorance and want such as st domingo now presents and the british and french west india islands will soon indicate t false every word false that the tion of the black race is a condition of comfort false that the colored race as the previous extracts show are not equallynay they are worse infinitely worse plundered maltreated and wretched than the serfs of the old world false that the colored race in st domingo and the british and french west india islands are being reduced to barbarity ignorance and want all false and the falsehood of these statements is equalled only by their brazen effrontery and malignity here is another bitter sentence it would mean something were it true but as it is faugh it will be quite time enough for british journalists and british philanthropists to talk to us of our institutions of slavery in the south when they can present a white race under their sway or even a semicolored race of indians half as well off in comfort and contentment as the slaves of carolina or vir ginia the hindoos heaven knows are badly enough treated by their nabob maaters hut who can prove against them the branding shooting cathauling earclipping and other and less refined barbarities that are practised n south carolina and virginia no one those cruelties are reserved for the liberty lloving equallycreated monsters of repub ican lt makes one almost blush for his kind to be under the necessity of producing such witnesses against it but the wickedness of the wicked must be exposed and their deeds made manifest verily the tender mercies of the wicked are crash one more sentence from the n y herald and i have done it rays we cannot help mingling the tear with the smile when he the writer in the times pats into ns so strongly in consequence of the existence of slavery in certain parts of our country and places in juxtaposition with that our ardent professions of liberty we confess itwith sorrow we confess that our institutions have not yet reached that perfection which we hope they will do with the progress of time sod age the sentence quoted above will serve to throw considerable light upon this if the colored race were to receive their liberty tomorrow they would be ieduced to a condition of barbarity ignorance and want why then nungie the tear with the rank there eaa be no reason for it except with re fennee to the staten in which slavery has been abolished slavery in then a proper condition of society the prnfraaiiuia of lib etty are all a mistake it is not desirable that the slaves should be liberated aad the program to perfection would he just so much mischief dooe to the colored race by how little wisdom is the world isd albeit by rrmrusshas

detect any mistake and under the consoling faith that he was voting for his old friend the accidental hevoted for old zack but we have another case of still more affecting simplicity a pious old man who resides in east boston was congratulating his friends on the result of the presidential election what said one of them did you vote for taylor oh yes said he ive hearn father taylor preach a good

this vote given with extreme reluctance and many fears may not contribute to perpetuate the shame and crime of my beloved country nor bring upon her the curse of heaven we know not how this may strike

expense of principle he asks god to take care of the country by counteracting the legitimate tendency of the vote given a man might as consistently throw a lighted brand into his neighbors haymow

by universal suffrage with this proviso that unless the leading candidate has a clear majoiity of twe millions of vgtes over the rest the national assembly shall be at liberty to make its own election thus for instance should it happen that prince louis napoleotshouldhaves majority of ono million above cavaignac anc again cavaignac one say of nine hundret thousand above lamartine the assemblj would have the power of placing any one oi the three in the presidential chair the elec election is to take place on sunday the thof december there is little doubt but thai prince louis napolen will be at the head ol the pollthere is less certainty that he will obtain the absolute majority required in which case the choice of the assembly is sure to fall on cavaignac the french funds have recently fallen various causes are assigned for this the most probable is the declining popularity of cavaignac and the idea entertained by many of the friends of order that with the departure of his
