sermon on the memory of john quincy adams by rev theodore parker tixt matth xx and whosoever will be eltii f among you let linn be your servant lat sunday something was said of the moral perfection of the individual today jet us consider a man of a very marked individuality of character let us try him bv the christian rule and nothing extenuate and nothing add god has made some men trroat and others little the u se of the great menis to serve the littl men to take care of you and me that is the christian rule it is not the hebrew rule nor the heathen rule nor the common rule j but only the christian rule perhaps greatness is always the same thing in kind only differing in inode and form jas well as degree a great man has more of human nature organized in him than we have so fnr as that goes j therefore he is more perfectly me than i am myself and i feel that superiority jin all my intercourse with him in kind we arc the same in degree different we dud in society as in nai ture individuals for convenience sake are put in classes accordingly we find several classes of g re at men corrc sponding to the several inodes and forms of greatness it i well to iok ut these before wr examine a special man for this will make it easier to judge him and sec what he is worth only let me sav that service is the practical test ol practical greatness lie who docs the greatest service to men is the greatest iman that also is not the hebrew i nor the heathen nor the common but only the christian rule the first class of great men is the great discoverers luen that discover original principles great ideas universal laws correct methods of thought and action these it seems to me are the greatest of all men and the vast ncss ol their genius must be measured by the transcendency of their truth i by the newness of the idea by its l practical value and by the difficulty of grasping it at the tune when they discovered it iu literature these arc the men that originate thoughts and embody them in original forms in philosophy you meet with tueu of this stamp and they are the great inen of philosophy thus socrates discovered the philosophical method which distinguished his school thus newton discovered the great law of gravitation the universal law of nauir we find such men among the po uvan also who discover the laws o which bear the same relations o ocu ty which the law of gravitation cars o t ie orb of heaven and to the u o lie earth men who discover the just rules m poutics you fi d such men in r iigum mcu who discover truth so central that sectarianism shrinks before their who have discovered the true method of religion who have discovered the law which binds man to man and man to his god to my tu ud this is the highest form ol greatness here is a class of discovering men who give truths at firei handtruth of literature philosophy politics and religionend these are the greatest of all gods children the next class consists of such as organize these truths methods ideas and law they apply philosophy to practical purposes they concretise the abstract they particularise lis universal they organize these lairs into tho shape of a railroad to that truth becomes fact they organize jova into families justice into a state the north star petr into iu suitable forme they tike the power of love of wisdom ot religion and organize them into common life making humanity society this organizing genius is a very great one it is a great thing for a man to spread his thought upon the soil and make that soil whiten with bread com for man it is a great thing for a manto spread his thought out upon the rivers of new england making them spin and weave for the human race it is agreat thing to organize fire and water into a new instrument to d mans bidding to organize the very lightnings ol neaven so that they may do mans errands from town to towm bat a higher degree of this mode ol greatness is shown in organizing men it is a higher degree of greatness fora man to spread out his thought on maikind and put men into true rela tionj with one another and with god toj organize truth justice wisdom lovej and purity and balance the conflicting f rces of a nation so that each man has his natural ability justly to exercise his own natural rights as if he were the only man and yet lives in society and receives pleasure and advantage as if all converged to that one piint it is a great genius which can ualance the centripetal power of the state with the centrifugal power of you and meand combine them into the same rvthmctical harmony as god balances the orbs of heaven into those grand ellypses traceable through the skies the greatest genius the greatest organizing power is therefore the genius tor legislation which can make justice law and organize religion into common custom it need not be disguised any wherc that politics are the highest business that a great statesman is the very brightest example of organic skill it requires some head to organize nine and thirty clerks in a shophow much more to organize twenty millions of men and women not for a special purpose but for all the ends of human life this second class of men consist of organizers who found the institutions of the world little and great there is a third class of men capable only of administering and managing these institutions after they are founded who do this effectually even eminently it requires no genius for original organization and still less an original genius for disccering truths and untruth it requires only a knowledge of details a familiarity with methods a knowledge of routine an acquaintance with the past and the present times a knowledge of men these men are not discoverers they are not organizers they are administrators and managers mid the difference between these two i w ill not now stop to point out the ability of these men will consist in their knowledge of details routine methods and men they know the ropes and the soundings they know how to take advantage of the wind and tide in the factory in the shop or in the army in church crin state anywhere such men are valuable you cannot do without them they are the w heels of the carriage they arc always mire numerous than any other class more arc wanted and therefore born the american mind runs constantly in this direction j producing great quantities of adminis trativc men these are not men of theories of new thoughts they arc practical men of facts and figures not full of ideas but running over w ith precedents comm msense men commonsense men too who have not too much common sense to he understod now and to be useful such men are excellent statesmen but only in ordinary times in troublous times they get brushed off by the organizers or dis coverers to have a railroad there must be first the discoverer to learn the properties of fire and water and their ability to carry men over mountains second there must be the organizers to survey the route to plan the structure to set men to grade the hills and to fill the valleys and thirdly there must bethe administrators and managerswhose office it is after all this is done to hire engineers conductors ticket collectors and the rest of the hands to buy the coal and see that it is not wasted to determine the rates of fare and to calculate the dividends what happens toa railroad happens also to a state and church in common times the discoverer and organizer fare very hard in the world they are men illclad often times despised while the manager is thought to be a great man not only walks but ridesover their graves and distributes the dividends where they called only for assessments great sensation now the discoverers are the greatest of men they anticipate the human race they do not learn from history but from nature not from empirical experience but by prophetical intuitions of untruth of such men there are always few especially in the highest modes of this greatness the organizer also must be a man of great power of intellect and character it requires some mind to organize a factory out of i ver bricks wood and iron and make the connecticut spin cotton to organize state of twenty millions of drawn differently by conflicting osuie interests is the greatest work of inta hu p reiw ut idoaa uo yoke men and wo m v vi venal lawa to k care the liberty f c whiting the welfare of n ba u f he mj t constructive of all science u creative of all poetry i times napoleon seems to have been the greatest example of this faculty he had oo superior in the history of man and perhaps never an eoual in the ability to mould men to his will and right is of so sextruth is of no colorgoo is the father of us all and all we are brethren accomplish great ends there is no calling that dhmpds greater abilities than poliiicsappmtic develope greatness if the man only has the elements in him i know in politics a man may get along with very little intellect with very little head and very little heart without being a discoverer an organizer or an administrator if it were not so wa should have a very small house of representatives a very small senate and a good many of our presidents would never have been heard of great sensation but if the power be in the man it will come out in america politics demand greatness democracy requires a greater ability than any other form of government it requires a greater range of thought to discover the law for all than only for a few and after the idea and law are discovered it is more difficult to organize a democracy than a monarchy or an aristocracy it is more difficult to administer it requires more head to rule the affairs of toe democracy ol america than to rule england france turkey or russia we sometimes think there is only occasion and room in our day for administrators none for discoverors none for organizers and accordingly in selecting our representatives our senators and our presidents we choose them by that rule but there are ideas which are very well known and which yet wait to be organized into a government free tiade peace and universal education freedom and com fortall these ideas are waiting to be organized into a state a state without ignorance without war without tyranny and without want and there are truths enough waiting to be discovered why all the space between my mind and gods mind is full of truths and ideas waiting to be discovered and then to be organized deep emotion so much for great men generally now it is very plain where we are to place the distinguished person who ceased to be mortal ten days ago mr adams was not a discoverer he had no truth which was not known before he made known no new truth he was not an organizer he was an administrator of political institutions and taking the whole land into consideration and the prominent men who were his cotemporaries at first sight he does not seem to be very eminent in the class of political administrators in making that comparison with men of the south especially there is danger of doing him injustice mr adams was a northern man he was northern in his notions in his habits in his methods many of his cotemporarics were far different and had certain advantages over him at the very outset the business of the north is to get empire over nature to obtain power oyer the material world and so everything tends to that young men of talents become merchants they aim to make a fortune they care nothing about political power but the power of the pocket to get empire over nature we must have education not in a few hands but in all hands otherwise there is no intelligent labor and it is intelligent and not brute labor which gives power over nature men must be religious and so to secure intelligent labor education must be universal suffiage universal property widely dis tributed in the north see what examples of that see what increase of wealth and skill significant ot power see ou colleges our factories our schools and our churches see the movements oi commerce of manufactures of education see the movements for the promotion of religion all is democratic and is becoming more so in the south they seek empire not over nature but over man talent tend not to trade but to politics young men of ability go into the army to the navy to the public offices to give themselves to politics they learn to manage mena young man of thenorth acquires a fortune a young man of the south political influence and favor see the result of that the north manages the trade the commerce the manufactures of the land it manages also its spiritual affairs its morals its education its religion its literature and science the south manages its political affairs so all the presidents but three have been southern men and most of the public officers each of the three northern presidents has failed to be reelected but baa retired from public life with a large fortune the south has had seven presidents and four of them left the office poor men there is no accident in this none at all you behold in it the working of a law which is as universal as the law of gravitation to be continued eulogy on the lift and character of john qutnry adams dcticrrtd at buffalo march by asxza h francis ma president and fellow citiiens when an humble and obscure individual emerges into life and by his virtues genius and mighty powers of intellect can successfully grapple with the gigantic force which education and the favorable force of circumstances have placed in a nation or community too much credit cannot be awarded to him for the solutiooof the problem of the capacity of mind whea drawn outby indefatigable labors into such hands important trust nr the proper disposition of any great subject may rest with great eafety but to my mind when not only obscurity but iaeompe tency taka hold of subject calling forth ihe powers of a great mind in or dtr to make a proper dispomtion ol rochester n y friday march them rain wotild be any attempts to avoid criticism if not merited reouke when a true friend of universal liberty one who has labored to enforce its great principles vacates his place by death cold must be the patriotism of that people that pass in silenee his mighty deeds in view of this duty with the probable failure of a public demonstration on our part i accepted the too responsible position of delivering this eulogy our friend fellow citizens is dead did i say ours let me take that word back the friend of man of the human race has departed and while we have assembled to speak of his goodness and lament over his icy remains the remains of a departed spirit and touch upon some of the past acts of his honored career that one of the bright jest stars should have been blotted out at this important crisis of our countrys history while we have assembled j here for this ostensible purpose may we not forget that in his death there is one cause for rejoicing probably i may more effectively impress it by repeating the following stanza by mozart spirit thy labor i oer thy day of probation is ran hy steps are now bound to die untrodden shore and the lace of immortals begun spirit look not on the strife or the pleasures of eaith with regret pause not on the hounds of limitless life to moan for the day that is set spirit no fetters can bind no wicked have power to molest there die weaiy like ibec the wretched shall find a heaven a mansion of rest spirit how bright is the road i fur which thou ait now on the wing thy home it will be with thy saviour and god iheie loud liallclujahs to sing we have no reason to doubt that when he put on immortality death was swallowed up in victory oppressed humanity regardless of clime or condition has lost one of its uncompromising advocates it is true that often there might be found in him and particularly while battling in the councils of the nation against slaveholding and proslavery influences combined many errors of what i regard as of the head as regarded the wisdom of the policy of his procedure or measures recommended still throughout his whole life we have every reason to relieve the sincerity of his purpose that he had an honest hearta heart ecr ready to act in concert where he believed the premises correct and their application judicious when brought in contact with those maintaining opposite views to his own in regard to action when in the main they were agreed you never found him cherishing that direful bane of political profligacy so eagerly cherished by aspirants lor fame who for the sake of realizing their ambitious desires suffer in their guilty phantasy any institution to be overthrown it m its demolition the pathway to the goal oi of their aspiration might be shortened in john hunicy adams their was no such spirit in h m wa a mind and heart upon which the mildew of moral depravity had never settled or marred the features of that godlike attribute ol his nature in the family circle in the public gatherings of his native state or in the councils of the nation that principle of the largest liberty was his principle the affirmative godspeed to every just and honest movement to effect it was his affirmation that belie in the reforms of the age which held so near an alliance to his own but upon whose platform he never directly made j his assaults upon the enemy was nevj ertheless a subject of increasing interest to him so much so that singlehanded and alone amid sarcasm and rebuke threats and persuasions the knife and the bullet has the right of the oppressed and the right of petition had an unflinching advocate thus onward was his career unintiinidated in his purpose and although he is dead his principles live and live to do battle where his selfsacrificing labors wrought them out it was mainly through his influence that the saqred right of petition has been sustained and the discussion on the subject of slavery in the united states reached such prominence by his labors at a time when it required more moral stamina than was possessed by ally other on that floor and at the present time no fear need ever be entertained of expelling it from among the subjects of deliberation until the trial is complete and the end gained i am aware of some of his sentiments disavowing his connection with the abolition society as the name is ap plieda society which i hold dear be it of what school it may we have extant in one of his speeches on a subject in some way connected with slavery a full exposition ot his views and as he lived them out his remarks on that occasion were these i tm not here to answer for the purposes or views of any abolition society or of any individual abolitionist though i am in one sense an abolitionist myselfin that sense in which thomas jefferson in the th year of his life committed to paper his opinions which he addressed to all the slaveholders of the country namely that abolition must come the sooner it eornns the better if not force would ensue in the lie and writings of jefferson as published by his grand eon you will find the sentiment avowed word for word as i have stated it fate be further adds has decreed the freedom of that people in the leenee that thomas jefferson was an abolitionist and was so all his hfe ii un one and i inpe in all my soul that ithe day will come when slavery shall ba a word without a meaning in the english language and all other languages when there shall net he found a slave upon all the earth this in my judgment will be the consummation of the christian religion that will be the long hoped tor day when the lin shall lie down with the lamb and when all the glorious prophecies oi the old testament promises ard predictions repeated by christ shall receive their complete fulfilment in that day i believe man will be a nobler a purer a more elevated being by far than we see him now when he will ippruach nearer the angels in that sense he avowed himself an abolitionist he then goes on to speak of the animadversions and denunciations directed against him but instead of refiling again he said that there were men in the abolition societies of as much intelligence as much virtue as iigh rectitude and as ardent patriot sm as is possessed by any on this floor still he says as to their measures he thinks they are mistaken asio doubt they think the same of him but i do not propose to descant upon iny of what i may consider erroneous riews in regard to his mode of action simply give the opinions he entertained which he said he held from god ind from his own judgment theu lointing to the declaration of indc endence which was hanging in the lall he said in that too were those sentiments however any portion of it nay have been turned out of doors through it he wished the abolition of davery throughout this union and that le believed it was indispcnsible for its jreservation they are glorious senti nents worthy of the heart that gave hem utterance worthy to be promulgated in the age in which we live and worthy of the people who cherish them time forbids me to go at length into he history of his life in one address unless i forego comments i shali herefore be brief on this point john l adams was born in conse uently was at his death in his tist ear his remote ancestor henry j dams came to america years ago vith seven sons samuel was the first i vho emerged into public life and rose o conspicuous public stations i hi icxt that we read of w as john adams vhom thomas jefferson pronounced he colossus of independence he ivas the father of john q adams and listory informs us that while in the lawn of his existence his parents were jxerting every power in behalf of their country s freedom in his eleventh rear when his father and franklin went o france as joint commissioners he lccompanied them and spent one and half vcais of daily intercourse under the parental attention of tteryamin franklin whose kind attention simplicity of manner and habits left a lasting impression at the expiration oi that time he returned home with his father who came to assist in the formation of the constitution of his native state but a very few months elapsed before the voice of the country again trailed his fatner to repair to europe to legrtiate a treaty of peace whenever jrjeat britain might be disposed to putin end to the war he again took his ion with him in this voyage the ves iel came nigh being lost but finally anded at fenell in spatn from whence hey travelled by land to paris in  vhen his son john q was placed at chool the same year his father was aled to holland accompanying him j hither he was placed in the public school of the city of amsterdam and afterwards in the university at leden n when francis dana was cora nissioned minister to the empress ot russia john adams was selected by him as a private secretary alter spending fourteen months he left mr dana to travel through sweden den nark hamburg and bremen to holj and where his father was the minister o the republic of the netherlands he performed this journey alone in the j winter without a companion at pears of age but i must pass overmany important events of his life his renewed acquaintance with jefferson and their continued intimacy to the close of jeffersons life his desire to leave the city of splendor and gaiety while his father was minister to the court of st james of his returning to this country and becoming a member of the ancient scat of learning at cambridge his study of the law c are facts of lively interest hfi was a great favorite of general washington and filled offices of trust under his appointment in gen j washington appointed him then but years of age minister to the netherlands and one of the last acts of gen washingtons administration was to appoint mr adams minister plenipotentiary to portugal washington declared the most valuable public officer the united states had abroad in mr adams was elected to the senate of the united states for six years and here he seemed to make fully tumbles l that unfaltering principle not to permit nor suffer passion to drive him into indiscriminate opposition or blind support he was the great support of mr jefferson in those dark days of his administration when those who had led the republican party had thrown themselves in direct opposition to the administration disaffection had arises in the ranks much like the present political condition of our country in mr adams was elected president of the united states but his pure principles and antiparty spirit soon led to dissensions and all kinds of political chicanery were practised against him but he held hie position with an unalterable firmness diluting the offices of public trust irrespective of party the nation el peace w world tke f lie debt promptly paid and reducing the public debt over three million these with many other marked and beneficial results closed hieadministra tion and he was succeeded in office by gen jackson since that period his life must be familiar to all who have taken any notice of the public movements of the age hu nanly independence in the advocacy of equal rights against fearful odds and the unparalleled unyielding firmuess to principle leaves him no equal to say the least among the political chpinpions of the age i an bold to affirm that your n ebsters vour clays your calhouns or your mcduffies if you please when compared with him sink into perfect insignificance in the life ol john h adams the world can see in what true greatness consists in him the spirit of vacillation for the sake of preferment was unknown unlike the dishonored tourse of daniel in ebster who declared on the portico of the capitol of virginia before an assemblage of ten thousand freemen that there was no power direct or indirect in congress or the general government to interfere in any manner whatever with the subject of slavery or the institutions of the a very hard sample of true greatness to come from the great expounder of the constitution neither do we hear more substantial or better reasoning from the mouth of the idolized kentucky logician he would have the world believe that the libeiation of six thousand slaves in the district of columbia disconnected with the three millions in the country was not a matter of sufficient magnitude to agitate distract and embitter this great confederacy w hile he denounces and contemns w hat he calls a visionary dogma that slaves cannot be the subjects of property why he says he will not speculate on such abstractions that is property which the law declares to be property two hundred years of legislation have sanctioned it but not only so lie says it has sanctified negro slavery mc duffie says slavery is the cornerstone of the republic but i will quote no further feeling satisfied that the verdict is in favor of john q adams permit rne to remark here that have no doubt but what i shall be censured for the encomiums which i have passed upon mr adams but if had never known it before i arn now convinced from research into his life and character that all such censure would merit just rebuke in fact i have already been iskcil nlit lviv nu tlio tiff nl john q adams so commendable that the colored people need eulogize it as if we possessed so small a share of humanity or that there flowed in our veins so small a share of patriotic blood or that we were insensible to or illy appreciated the great design of our forefathers as well as our own inherited birthright from them and now i should like to hare the world know that the same principles ofo which led the great mind of john q adams to energetic action to advise in behalf of hts country to throwoff the british yoke actuated my father to shoulder his musket and serve through a bloody contest and not only my fathers but the blood of colored men w as freely shed in that struggle for national independence john q adams never proved recreant to that great principle but maintained it through life can it be supposed that wc have within us a principle so complicated so incomplete in its orginal designthat we can only appreciate the value of a man anu speak of his virtues only as they are prescribed for our own individual benefit if such were the prevailing sentiments god deliver me lion identity with any such people but this is not the case and were this a proper occasion i would prove that for true patriotism and hightoned sympathy for their fellow inen we the colored people have no superior among any class of men i base my abolition on the doctrine of universal freedom my field of action is the world wherevei there can be found beings possessing undying imperishable and immortal spirits regardless of the land that gave them birth they in like proportion share my sympathy and shall have my support i would not give one of tin most imperfect ideas which i havi penned in this discourse for the figlea covering of that man love of liberty that extends no further than what i di covered in a debate a few weeks since from one of the members of the bar u this city he was opposed to the ae cession of new slave territory for tin reason that he loved the liberties ofth whits man then a secon thought coining over him produced n doubt by the presence of colored men he mauc the sentiment more ridiculous by saying not that he haled the blacl man but i suppose it is a mmole c much of the wilmot proviso abolitionism i have long become convince that we can become selfish in any goo work and when see this spring up immutable laws of god must be brough to bear against it for wc are equaii bound to each other in the distributioi of our powers instead of lryf degrade we should encourage and m prove rather than withhold contract and disrespect the rights of each other we shoald enlarge and expand to greater and still greater degrees of beoevo lenee this undue regard which t practised in the social system must t redressed or we never shall avert th just judgment of the almighty and tp bold to affirm that if there is not i peed ushering in of reform oo tbi point it will most assuredly come dowi with increased vehemence on all wh throw off such mighty responsibilitiei it and detgontmioa of themcaa o f wllutti c mil fisiiisia john dm k rsistas whole noxiii ness into which man has sunk since th fall but to return as regards the errors into which statesmen have fallen i give t as my candid opinion that it would be far more advantageous to the republic if the management of its affairs were entrusted in the hands of those who had not studied the first lesson in the affairs of slate if they were honest and true rather than in the hands of those who entertain and practise sentiments like thosq i have already quoted there was a principle in john u adams which soared so far above such sentiments that he shrunk from no responsibility or regarded the whenever he was convinced he w ught he never suffered himself to become the passive tool of the petty tyrant the ancestral blood ot the pilgrims had early germinated and assumed such lofty mien that it through life forbade the engrafting into his nature the modern ideas of expediency but he was as firm as the rick on w hich the pilgrims landed and rigid as the wintry monarch which was above and around them the pilgrims landed on the hid december amid ice and snow he like raiuesis king of egypt whc about to elevate his great obelisk placed his son upon it in order that the workmen might take great care knowing that a lift more pis cious than their own depended upon their labors such was the feeling of john q adams he acted as if the buidcu of the responsibility of the w hole nation was resting upon his shoulders in this light he acted and literally died pleading for the salvation of his country u methinks that when the intt sound proceeded from the lips of thnt good old man while dying away in the remote corners of that spacious hall there was sent back a reverberating echo which ns it fell upon the listening ear toldin accents not to be mistaken that that voice would soon e hushed that that honored head which was bowing under the infirmities of more than eighty winters bespoke incontrovertibly that the sand of his probation were spent and methiuks then f not be lore the heart of the despot must have been filled with sorrow tv think that soon his own would be hushed and his name nevermore be written among the members of that ody bit that the next union would be registered by the recording angel and when the stern decree ot justice shall have submerged the last vestige of slavery and saved not only this natiou hut the poor sinstiicken world from having meted out to her the iust iudcjnenis of th almighty tor their national sms and nati nal calamities which they propagated when the labors of the abolition s cielie shall rocivc their everlasting ucquutu on the basis that there is no more w ork to accomplish or when labors like the great departed statesman performed when upon the earth shall conic to an end because then the oppressor can no more oppress and the assembled wisdom of the nations shall have rio more to do but to legislate to make man assimilate nearer and nearer his redeemer then the name of john h adams w ill he revered in short when the great end for which he lived shall have been fully consummatedwhen the great struggle so incomplete in its design and through which he hved and labored incessantly to achieve shall be in reality what it now is in name when the daystnr from on high shall emblazon fbilh inscribed hpon it in imperishable letters by the hand of omnipotence travelling forth in beatific splendor in its icspiendant orb to the most remote geographical boundaries of the globe anil by its stern mandate dash into chaos the chains of the despot when this shall have been accomplish d the name of john i adams will rtiii hold its place among

getting into churches and pulpits even at the periods appointed for public worship ministers ol religion of all denominations are becoming more and more interested in it monthlyser moos are preached in its favor in many pulpits north and south prejudice is being dispelled and opposition to the society is rapidly subsiding the press of the country speck of its movements with respect and admiration i and everything respecting liberia is regarded with increasing interest every indication seems favorable to a vigorous prosecution ol the work and to this end they now call upon the public generally for assistance they want fifty thousand dollars the present year they propose to act in such a manner as to divide the spoils with our w orsc than useless ships of war along the african coast they think they can abolish the slave trade a great enormity on the coast of africa but i christian incense on the coast of america if the government will place in the hands of the society a suitable sum with which to purchase territory they propose to support and provide for recaptives at a much cheaper rate and indeed to manage the whole business at a much less expense to the government than is now done by our own war vessels they think the recaptives at fifty dollars apiece would give them the sum of whether this sum is demanded i for services already rendeicd by the society or proposing to be the report is not clear a desire on the part of the society to get if possible into tlie service and pocket of the national government is quite manifest the report of the board has much to say about the republic of liberia and of the immense service its declaration of independence has done the society and says already among the colored people has a favorable effect been produced it speaks with an air of triumph of a convention of colored persons in the state of illinois who selfmoved have appointed one of their own number to visit liberia and return and report the facts to them in new y ork the report says another mission has been appointed for a similar purpose these movements amongst the i colored people are hailed by the society as indicating a returning sense of what is for their best interests and permanent happiness we call attention to this society not so much for the benefit of our white as our coiuicd leaders ibouoh it may prufliuuie to both the alluring wiles and fascinating blandishments must be closely watched and j firmly guarded against we as a people too nearly resemble our paler brethren to be i in all cases proof against such modes of ati tack the high sounding title of independent republic which liberia has now taken and the skill and grace with which tho title is used by this society is very well calculated to win upon the vanity of those possessing more ambition than brain among the colored people of this country the thought of liberia is associated in their minds with elevation to the offices of presidents vice presidents secretaries ijjf state judges generals senators representatives in congress this society understands our weak points and what chord to move we are persuaded that this new point of interest may be used quite injuriously to the well being of many colored men in this country and therefore call upon our brethren for a renewed expression of their opinion on the subject we are now told that liberia has assumed the form of an independent government possessing all the rights and discharging all the duties and meeting all the responsibilities of an independent nation but her independence is not yet recognised by any other nationnor has anything of the sort beon proposed to our government the american colonization society has recognised her independence and judging from the parade that is made over the fact this copy of the model republic would seena to have its army and navy its ministers and consuls at foreign courts all going on in the most statelike manner while the fact is the bethel church in philadelphia would hold the entire nation and a single warship might give laws to the republic to our mind liberia is as much dependant as ever she was and the colonization society has ns controlling a voice in her affair ever we anther believe that this new form is adopted solely with aview to revive the almost extinct spirit of colonization throughout the land the society does not however rely solely on the alluring charms of nationality independence wealth dignity and station to induce the free colored man to emigrate to liberia they threaten as well as ooax they appeal to our fears as well as our hopesthey oint to our degradation here as well as our elevation in liberia and teach us to believe that our condition here must liecome not better but worse the longer we remain they tellus that now we may emigrate with onr own free wit but that the time must come when we shall have no option in the matterthat we shall be compelled uuder the arm of stern necessity to quit this and suck another coun ts in the report before us the board use the j following language oq this point which leaves no doubt as to what is paawng in their minds j they ought to be convinced that the friends of colonization are their fnends that it is a scheme contrived and esteemed solely with reference to the good of their race wf j have always professed to be the friend of the colored man we have always advocated colon nation as his friend and have honestly believed that it presented the fairest hops and t the surest guarantee of his hi lure happiness we axe satisfied that in thru country

can any intelligent colored mac doubt as to the injury such sentiments inflict upon the cause of our freedom and efevstior here everything of progress and improvement which has taken place in oar condition is carefully avoided our degradation great as it is is nevertheless exaggerated for tbt sake of proving that this is not our home and that elevation cannot be attained here the fact colonization is now just what it was twenty years ago those engaged in it are our enemies look through the list ol officers and all find one who hat ever performed a single act which looked u the welfare of the colored man in this country from henry clay the president through the whole list of vice presidents they are cithei slaveholders or are proslavery in sentiment and their uniform practice can such a blasphemer as the rev bishop meade be a friend to the colored manwho charges upon god the ordaination of slavery and counsels the slaves that their masters have a just right to flog them f france the intelligence from this country pci steamship cambria which we give in another place though most appalling is by no means surprising to intelligent men considering the great familiarity of that people with the use of deadly w eapons their great excitability their great patriotism and love of warlike demonstrations and the intidious and dangerous infringement upon their rights and liberties the wonder is not that they have actually risen in rebellion now but that the catastrophe i has been so long delayed the fate of the french government in this instance isa mirror in which tyrants the world over i may see theirs it is impossible that the rc bellious spirit of enslaved humanity can always be kept under there must be some effort to enjoy that freedom for which our god and creator has shaped us and wo betide the class combination or government which shall presume to stand in the way of such effort such combinations or governments may succeed for a time but a revolt i must come the oppressed cannot always be subdued and the oppressors power must wear away they may deceive and cheat hut they cannot repress the upward tendency of the masses towards froedoin and equal i rights hie french government has long acted upon the notion that the people cannot be j trusted with their rights the liberty of the press the freedom of speech and the right of assembling have long been trampled upon by that government i these are rights not to be disregarded with i impunity by any government or clan the people must speak and write freely and if this rignt nc disallowed they will make themselves felt we call upon tyrants the world over and especially american tyrants to look and reflect upon this late revolution in france with the beginning of which even vve are only partially acquainted wc warn the slaveholder to learn anew that human nature is still human nature and that the time may not be distant when an illustration of the fact may be afforded nearer home than paris dip we understand that mr henry bibb is to sail for england about the middle of april he goes on the invitation of antislavery friends in newcastlcupontync and will pobably labor under their direction while in england one of the objects of his mission and perhaps the main one is to discourage the use of slave labor and encourage that of free mr bibb is an eloquent speaker and by a faithful exposure of slavery and the various inodes by which it is upheld and sustained before the british public he maybe instrumental in doing much good in behalf of the slave tiie barker family this interesting company of singers gave a concert last saturday evening at minerva hall the audience was large and respectable and we thought they were highly gratified with the entertainment so various are the tastes with respect to tune as well as color that it is somewhat hazardous to venture an opinion of either we arc free to say however that several of their songs made a deep impression on us dark as we are and called forth loud applause from the audience we observed that those deep rich clear and pathetic tones which moved the hearts of our white fclluwcitizens awoke in our own soul emotions corresponding to theirs some who looked rather savagely at us when we entered found us borne aloft with them on the heavenly wings of music equally delighted and charmed with themselves nowis it not too bad that colored folks should dare to love music and to liave the same emotions common to white folks cannot something be done to make a distinction here ought colored people be allowed to fed just like white folks is this sort of equality to be tolerated in this christian country ought not a colored man to be worth two hundred and fifty dollars in real estate before he ventures to lore mabir equally with white american citizens and is not here something requiring the immediate attention of these whom the people appoint to guard our most sacred institutions bat we are straying we merely meant to notiee the singing and the singers they sung several comic songs during the evening which were very weft received they will however pardon as if we say that in this they do not excel we advfcefhem to sing as flew ueh soup as poosibte and if any be sung let nation sing them he has more of the eotalc ia his composition than either of the brothers but it is on

mccvs smtdea si i have eel wholly forgotten my premise u yon last line while in your city to semi you seme report of my discoveries while ia visit to the lands given to many of oar brethren by that prince of philanthropists gerrit smith ton have a right to claim from me an apology for not baring fulfilled that promise at an earlier day on my return from that excursion in september last  fiuinii my fomily m deep affliction and one dour dear children lying dead in the house hits sudden bereavement l added to the carw and labors that dcvanffllfflkn me on mi return to the church of which have the pastoral charge took entire poases sion of my thoughts and engrossed my time for several months so that it has been onlj within a few weeks that i have been able k attend to general correspondence went in my own conveyance and devotee nearly seven weeks to the survey on mi route i accepted many krittii in to giv lectures on slavery and intemperance and upreach in methodist presbyterian and baptist churches and otic universalist attended also three camp meetings and tool part in the exercises and i did not fail to lei them know that in this land of camp meetings bibles and churches there are three null ions of slaves who have no bible nc church no camp meeting no w ife no child that they can call their own but in the room of these blessings arc sold in the market with oxen and sheep and other cattle foi i did think from the preaching of all theii ministers that they had either forgotten oii did not know this only one of the congregations that i addressed was colored you j readily perceive that i had a good opportunity of seeing many of the people as well as much of the country through which i passed i most of my time was spent in essex and ranklin counties where is the greater part ot the lands that hare been given to our people i visited in person many of these lands j and made particular inquiries respecting those i had not time to see tn essex county judging from my own observations and from the statements made to me by the most trustworthy men i feel confident in saying that the farms given by mr smith with very few except are as good land as any man can need in franklin county i visited j many more of the lands in person than i did in essex i found some there that i considered firstrate many that would not be good i tillage but are very valuable for the i timber upon them and not one that is worthless the timber in that region is coining tobe sought after more and more by the lumber morchants who are multiplying their saw j mills so that i am sure those who will hold on to and take care of their lots cannot fail in a few years to derive from them a haud som e income already depredations are made upon them so that it is much to be desired that settlements should be made there i speedily for the protection of the lands i come now to an unpleasant part of my story but fidelity to our brethren whose lots have fallen in that part of the state and to our nohle ixncfnctor demands that i should keep nothing back i found that a highhanded game had been played upon many ol our colored brethren who had gone there to visit the lands of which they had received the i deeds and feeling sure that there are many i unprincipled persons there who are standing j rcad y tle like game upon others i wiah to put them on their guard of course i t is necessary for one unacquainted with the i country to procure a guide or pilot to enable him to find the object of his pursuit and he will not fail to meet with those who are very ready to affordnay who eagerly proffer him their sei vices but there is need that he should be very careful to w lwin he entrusts himself else lie may be kept several days and nights travelling ia the woods and at length be shown a very dueirawc lot and be charged twelve shillings or two dollars aday for tlie service of the pilot and after all may never have been near the lot that is really his or he may be taken to a very undesirable spot perhaps a mountain peak or an irrecoverable swamp and when he has paid well for the toil of bis pilot that has ended in blank disappointment he will be kindly offered four or five dollars for his estate and be made to think himself happy to get rid of it so well i heard of one man at least who was in this way cheated out of his farm which he never i saw for thu paltry sum of twenty shillings i gathered the facts on which i rest these intimations of danger from the jokas i heard passing around among the men w ho had perpetrated these villanies and from respectable persons in the neighborhood who had heard of them and from the clerks of the counties in whose offices the transfers of the properties were recorded my best advice to my brethren is not to venture in search of their farms unless they can read and write or ia the company of tried friends who cun do both wbeliever they go they should in the first place see the clerk of the county in elizabethtown essex county or malone franklin county orin gate pleasant hamilton countywhere ever their lands may lie get their deeds recorded and take from the recorder the advice he may give to assist them in finding the lot described take with them the number of their lot and any other hint that may enable them to know when they have found them they may then if their lots are in essex county resort to alfred s spooner or j gay esq in elizabethtown to uriah mihitls keene to j tobcy jr jav to y endell lansing in williamston or to william m flack ausable forts if then lauds be in franklin county they will dowell to put themselves under the guidance ot the merilln in meriiville or of ratmollira bigelow not for from malone if they will keep a sharp lookout foe him they most sot be serprised if they meet with many persons ready to discourage them by speaking disparagingly of the lands and of the noble benefactor win has green them let them keep theftr own counsel refrain from disputation stijl more from intoxicating liquor which they will snd there in great quantity and high repute let them press on diligently u the end of their journey every lot hat been narked with

and if it be the spot where be has reason to expect to find the number heis m search of he may preen me it was once there if he finds the witnesses but undoubtedly in almost every case the numbers themselves may be found if the pilots conduct to the right places my last advtoe to our brethren is not to sell their land for a song they can be no poorer for keeping it mr smith has not given away any lots that are not worth something now and in the course of a few years they must rise in value and may hereafter furnish them or tlicir children with comfortable homes where they nay be happy and

requested to republish the above particularly the tree american the llcrkimcr freeman liberty press albany patriot the rains horn antislavery standard ami liberator colored churches mu editor the north star of feb th contains an article that seems to reflect upon me rather severely and you will therefore do me a favor hy allowing me to be heard in my own defence lam not awre that my conduct has given you any just occasion tosav that i have taken tip my pen to write for a proslaverysaper in defence of white ministers and churches linked as they are with the bloodstained church and evangelical manstealer of the south am also at a loss to know what good reason mr douglass has to impute to me bad motives simply because i do not think as he happens to think about separate organizations and much less am i able to account for such an unchristian gladiatorial thrust as mr douglass makes when he calls me the recreant keverend mr collins who though a black man himself is w illing for the sake of gaining the good will of his oppressors to play the part of a clerical sycophant now mr douglass you seem to assume that no man can differ from your notions and still be a sane and honest man just as though j yourself were the great fountainhead of sanity and honesty the great oracle that every black man must consult or die it may be i a startling and even a painfully amazing idea to you sir that a sane aivl ltonest man j can dare to disagree with you yet such is the fact as to my writing for a proslavery paper that is a dishonest assumption on yoftr part i hate slavery and its advocates as cordially as any christian can the truth is you did your best in springfield to oppose prinei pies that honestly think correct and i deem it my duty to speak through the papers my sentiments if i am agreater sinner for having my article published in tlie proslavery paper as you arc pleased to call it than you are for publishing your sentiments in the i proslavery town hall why then i am sorry as to playing the part of a clerical sycophant i am not so ready to plead guilty at your first nod my opinion is that colored people are more improved with churches of their own then they would bo w ithout them if you think differently very well that isyuur privilege hut it is not your duty to denounce me so unhandsomely and so unjustly your paper is your own but justice is mine as i well as yours shame will not cover me simply because you blow at mo with a scornful breath but i will not defend myself further in concluding i will suggest for your i future consideration snd discussion a few questions ist if we disband according to your recommendations would you have us join the corrupt white churches linked as they are with the bloodstained church and evangelical manstealers of the south as you without exception call them d to what extent shall we disband and go and demand admission to the white as sociations d shall we have mr douglass set the first example by dismissing his colored coadjutors in his printing establishment and knocking loudly at the door of the white printer demanding to be admitted to equal editorship  who are to determine the degrees of equal demand for brotherhood early and full answers will much oblige l collins springfield march eulogy to johm q adams monday evening last the methodist church on fitzhugh trwt was

douglass commenced his address b grateful expression for the kindness of h brethren in affording him an opportunity very much desired by him of meeting and talking with them on the great subject of humvn nghts ho was aware that many dilbred from him but nevertheless the spirit of dom which they had extended towards him i would prompt him to speak as in his judgment the cause demanded one of the greatest obstacles in the way of emancipation was the misapprehension existing in the public mind as to the principles which guided the abolitionists in their aggressions upon american slavery j slavery being regarded by them as the sum of alt villames thuy felt morally i bound to put forth all means m their power to break the tyrants yoke that the oppressed might go free slavery i the cause rf the unholy prejudice against color so prcvaltut at the north it is the fountain from whence springs the vast category of the evil of society therefore the system of slavery should excite the moral indignation and provoke tin persevering warfare of every truehearted man and woman in the land consistent with this feeling every proslavery influence is a legitimate object for antislavery to combat these influences aa developed u church and state and in the entire structure of society i the american church as has been so appropriately termed by james li birney is the bulwark of slavery nearly every sect is directly implicated in this giant crime they are either dumb on the subject or engaged in apologizing for the slaveholder and maintaining fraternal church relations iih him sheepstealing they regard as criminal while manstealing they endorse they practically deny the brotherhood of the human family separating men into classes treating uuh scorn ami contumely those who differ fn m themselves in complexion abolitionists could have no fellowship with regard to such organizations as christian for in refusing to do their duty towards man they were false to god and no other worship is acceptable m llw sight unless preceded by regard for their fellow men he was well aware of the antichristian prejudices which had excluded many colored persons fioin white churches and the eonse quent necessity for erecting their own places of worship this evil he would charge upon its originators and not the colored people hut such a necessity did not now rxist to the extent of former years there were societies where color was not regarded ns a test of membership and such chinches ho deemed more appropriately the place tor colored menthan exclusive or isolated organizations ho looked upon all coniplexioual distinctions such as negro jh ws negro berths in steamboats negro cars sabbath or weekday schools or churches ic ca direct obstacle to the progress of reform as the means of continuing the slave in his chains it is the policy of proslavery to keep colored people by themselves which he thought a sufficient reason for colored people not to obey any such wicked mandate they wi remen and women and so regarded by their ileaveuly f ather w ho ever counselled otherwise be lie white or black is a traitor to the cause of human equality the churches tn the land are indifferent

suffering meted out to his brethren at the south the indignities heaped upon them by those who received no rebuke from their fellow members at borne or even at the north were feelingly appreciated by his audiencemany an eye glistened many sighs esoajied whose personal testimony was thus appealed to under such circumstances he remarked there was no time for him to build up proslavery churches but to urge on ius brethren to hasten by their exertions that day when the lash the branding iron would no mure be used in the liceration of american bond men he would have colored men and women consistent in their hatred of slavery and put away from them everything affording it any countenance they should feel willing to practise selfdenial pluck out the right eyo and cutoff the right hand

tobacco is an advantage to great britain nr that a similar impost would he an advantage to this country both ideas are equally fallacious with respect to the former it has been proved almost to nausea by facts and figures which defy every attempt at contradiction that all indirect taxation is an injuryan injury to commerce and to public morality this very article of tobacco is a cse peculiarly in point scarcely a week passes in which we do not hear of some seizure at the english customhouse for an attempt to defraud the revenue the doctrine of free trade has now become almost universally allowed in britain as a matter of theory and it is also in a fair way to be allowed as a matter of fact with respect to the latter construction of the sentence quoted above it will not be disputed that if people will have governments it is the most reasonable tiling in the world that they should support them and if they are alive to their own interests they will do so in such a way as will best answer the purpose the wise itis said learn by other peoples experience while fools scarcely learn by their own an erroneous principle in britain docs not change its character by being transplanted across the atlantic what has been proved to be a mistake there will be equally so here if a tax on tobacco were to hare the effect of checking the consumption of this mischievous drug one might almost be led to desire that such a tax were imposed experience however does not teach this it teaches that all legislation for the purpose of checking vice is vain and nugatory but the mere money interest is not the only nor the most important matter to be considered in relation to what are called protective duties it is in every ones mouth that the free commercial intercourse of nations is very effective in producing friendly relations between them while the admission of foreign goods only on payment of a duty has an influence directly the reverse of this the selfish idea of mine and thine  my country and thy country the money in  terest as it is thought of one particular spot on the globe in opposition to the rest of the world is the idea fostered by all duties on foreign for the protection of home produce it is out of this sentiment that w ars and jealousies and hatreds between nations oiiginate when this narrow policy is adopted by one i nalion other nations reciprocate the

at butialo to purchase all their land held within the massachusetts preemption claim but the indians were unwilling to sell any portion of the country west of the genesee river alleging that the great spirit had fixed that stream as the boundary between the white and the red man mr phelps finding them quite immovable on that point represented to them that he was very desirous to get some land west of the river at the great falls for the purpose of building thereon mills for the use and convenience of the white settlers coming into the country and these mills when built would be very convenient forthc indian them splvos the indians then asked how much land he wanted for his mill site he replied that he thought a piece about miles wideex tending from conewagas village on the westside of the

was required they would let him have it after the treaty was concluded the indians tokl mr phelps that it being customary for them to give the man with whom they had dealt a name they would give him

evils how fallacious laws are nothing more nor less than the expression of public sentiment the form of govem tnent that obtains in a country is nothing else even a despotism is nothing else a despotic form of government could scarcely exist a single day in a country where the idea of human equality is in any measure recognised by the people it would be thrown aside at once as a badly fitting garment the expression of public sentiment now in russia id for a despotic form of government in england for a limited monarchical and it may row perhaps be in france for a republican in the united states the expression is undoubtedly democratic the balance wonderfully adjusts itself so will it be when the sentiment of the ameri cxn or any other people stretches forward toa better than

exit from the tuilertes in a brougham is an event which however momentous will be welcomed with contented laughter by perhaps threefourths of mankind with some the exultation will ba keener whilst fears of the future will with others overshadow anything like satisfiction but the whole rise and rule of louis philippe is so like a fable and the close at once so preg j nant and so just that we can conceive it written in letters of gold and put into every childs hand in order to teach how disloyalty in a prince cannot prosper how cunning overreaches itself and how retribution though tardy overtakes not merely the knave in rags but him in royal robes french history will indeed be rich in examples louis xvi naj poleon charles x louis philippefeeblej ness audacity bigotry craft all rejected is france like the ancient kingdom of the jews for which so many men and races were tried and found unworthy that it was the will of providence to leave them a republic after all the quarrel would be but about a name for government in france henceforth i if not a military despotism must b in the i sense and in the nature of a republic and bad louis philippe understood this necessity he would not have fallen into the horrible blunder of his administration he was elected to the throne by the middle classes and as their king his reign was as stable as that of any j monarch in any country but he could nfit tolerate these classes could not meet them had he kept up the national guard of the capital reviewed it mingled now and then in its ranks conciliated their not arrogant demands he would have had a body of armed citizens at his order to have put down by the bayonet as they did from to every effort of the anarchist and republican but he neglected the national guard shut it from his sight and instead of a citizen king became a king of functionaries and conservatives of these lie made a majority in his chambers and thus secure according to the letter of the constitution he thought he might neglect and brave the j popular voice he at last provoked the peo j pie to collision and court and parliament army and functionaries were but so many reeds before the storm of unpopularity which j has swept all even the very dynasty before it j future events remain exceedingly doubtful we will not say that a republic is impossible in france but most certainly the persons named upon the provisional government are not such as are likely to win the adhesion or command the respect of the influential classes either in paris or the provinces but the provisional government as it is called is more the representative of that party which has triumphed in the streets than a body of men assuming the government as representatives of the victorious people they may sit in the hotel de ville and have a very potential veto upon any resolve of the chamber of deputies but to govern france of themselves would bean audacious and vain attempt the duchess of orleans aud her son as well as the duke of nemours are at or under the protection of the chamber which has declared its sitting permanent and it is pretty evident that in order to get rid of the orleans family altogether the republicans of the hotel de ville must march upon the chamber and like cromwell dissolve it and disperse it this perhaps they may have had the power to do but in doing this the hotel de ville people will have deprived themselves of authority over the provinces and raised obstacles almost insurmountable to their designs funds must be procured to pay the army and to carry on the administration which the hotel de ville can no longer pretend to do as in the davs of the revolution the government of france is now a highly centralised and intricate piece of machinery requiring both skill experience and respectability to manage and any derangement of the centre wheel would cause all to stop and fall asunder hence the acts of the parisian authorities in and could not be repeated and ihe republicans of the hotel de ville convinced of this willin all probability accept the reign and the tutelage of the count oi ran should tliey not accept should they disperse the chambers by force aud put revolutionary law and measures iu practice there would bea terrible reaction against the republicans and this not only in the provinces hot in paris itself general lamoricurre is popular and able and would rally a groat majority both of the regular army and the national guards tim prince de joinvdle is also popular and not the man to submit to he set asule without a struggle so that however the reign of louis hiitippc may be irrevocably over his family appear to us to have still a very good chance of retaining or recovering the crown and the supreme authority it while however to speculate or indulge in conjecture as to events that perhaps have already occurred and that each coming hour will probably disclose the present state of things is

was a week ago explain the phenomena as you willwe merely state the fact now although we augur nothing grave from tlic increased earnestness of every non j we still think that times and circumstances

days since to parliament has excited most angty snd discontented feelings m the country the exigencies which weighed with the government in preparing or consenting to that budget are not considered of due or con elusive weight by the country the select committees to which the estimates have been referred will no doubt take this into oonsider ation but ministers we think ought also to j reconsider and withdraw till they have fully considered their proposal for raising the income tax to per cent we need not point to feelings of opposition generally arising in the country on this j subject nor need we eithc r enumerate the meetings or recapitulate the arguments from one end to the other the land is alive with protists and it appiars to bo as unsafe as it si unjust to make up that deficit in millions occasioned by the distress of last year by a sweeping levy upon that portion of the population which perhaps has suffered more than any other from that distress we learn that it is in the contemplation of ministers to make a move somewhat similar to that of the select committee and to demand of parliament the five per cent income tax solely for one year promising that that year shall be spent in investigation and in endeavors to settle some more equitable way of raising the amount of revenue necessary for the public service such a proposal no doubt indicates on the part of ministers a desire to conciliate public opinion and to remove the angry feeling which it evinces but is this enough parliament and all parties have more than once broken their word anil practised manifest deception in stating that the income tax was but for a time when in contemplation it must have been permanent and have thus rendered ffve per cent even lor one year unen durable the conviction in every mind is that in recent manipulations of finance however the burdens of the lower class may have beau lightened that of the middle class has been increased take the man of moderate income who enjoys from to goo a year calculate his assessed taxes with the enormous duties on all those items which constitute his expenditures being from to per cent upon the articles of his household use his tea his sugar his wine his spirits then the taxes that await his slightest attempt at enjoying more than the necessaries of life and which fall upon his servant or his horse add to this an income taxand it w ill be found that the state carries off perhaps onethird of his income that income too the result of years exertions to terminate probably in a year or two more of exertion whilst from the possessor of real property who has no fortune to provide for either regarding his children or himselffrom him the slate takes perhaps a sixteenth or a tenth the country knows these tilings and the country sees that the argument put forth for i the middle clxsscs and life incomes have not been answered and that they are set aside it is because greater and more fixed properties have greater and more fixed interests in par  liament the country sees that ministers however liberal want the courage to attack and do justice by taxing these large interests and therefore it is

certain portion of moral power it is this which makes them human for of mere physical power many animals possess more itis this moral power which has gradually softened and humanized the more favored portions of the race it is by means of this moral power that all revolutions and all advancements have been made women share it equally with men in all changes of opinion in ail the great straggles attendant upon such changes they have always borne a conspicuous part the grand rebellion in great britain which transferred the government of that country from the privy council of the king into the hands of the property holders and gave to england such freedom as she has owed much at its starting point to those women who overwhelmed the long parliament with petitons and who commenced the rebellion in scotland by an energetic and even tumultuous resistance to the introduction of the liturgy the french revolution which in its results has wrought such changes throughout europe and the world was cradled and nursed in the saloons of paris where female influence had reached a higher point than any where else be fore it is true that taking the past history of the world together the influence of woman appears on the whole to have been small phis however is more apparent than real we have the history of battles and sieges and political intrigues and revolutions of governments but the true history of the human race the history of the progress of opinion of the development of intellectual and moral power remains to be written christendom for twelve centuries had its opinions controlled by the catholic church and the catholic churcii knows well the power of female influence the several orders of female devotees were and are a great pillar of its power and female saints abound in its calendar it has been the same with the protestant churches is it not notorious that at this moment every protestant sect in america is mainly upheld its churches built its ministers paid its associations and charities sustained by the efforts i and influence of the women in every church the female members far outnumber the men and the men who are i there seven times out of ten are carried there and kept there by the women in al this it is true the women have played and play but a secondary part they are led on marshalled ruled and used by male leaders they are treated as the british treat the hindoos who compose the bulk of their indian armies they are welcome to serve as common soldiers but are not permitted to rise above the rank of corporal or sergeant at the best and the reason is the same in both cases the intellect of men has been far more developed than that of the women it has been held and in most countries still is held a crime for a woman to think for herself even here in new england a woman who adopts that course is looked upon with suspicion and distrust as an ambigl uous character vet the thing becomes more and more common and is fast losing its strangeness having admitted woman to equality in education having opened to them the doors of the schoolroom and the lectureroom having allowed them to read not sermons and books of devotion only but novels and histories and newspapers and everything else it is impossible to keep them from thinking and women who think will presently feel and act not as their mothers and grandmothers did but inaccordance with those new ideas to which they have attained but how can they act they cannot vote they cannot preach at least not many of themthey cannot legislate j what can they do more than voter preacher or legislator each and all of those is but the instrument to promulgate or carry into effect some preestablished opinion no man can preach except as the expounder and defender of opinions already espoused by his hearers or a part of them if he i preaches his own opinions in contradiction to theirs he must be content to lack salary and a pulpit and to seek audience as paul did in the marketplace or corners of the streets at the risk not only of brickbats and rotten eggs but of the police and the house olj crrection how many men are equal ito that no man can legislate except in conformity to the opinions of those who make him a legislator and the voter does only signify by bis vote his adherence to a certain principle or opinion which he thereby proclaims and vindicates

the history of peru mr prescott has lost one eye by accident in his early youth and had by study so strained the nerve of the other that he was all but completely blind he at first despaired but he determined to try whether he could make the ears do the work of the eyes he taught his reader unacquainted with any language but his own to pronunce the spanish though not exactly in the accent of the court of madrid he read at a slow and stumbling pace while the historian listened with painful attention practice at length made the work easier for both though the reader never understood a word of his author in this way they ploughed along patiently through seven spanish quartos he found at last that he could go over about twothirds as much in an hoar as he could when read to in english the experiment was made and he became convinced of the practibility of substitut in the car for the eye he was overjoyed for his library was no longer to consist of volumes he now obtained the services of a secretary acquainted with the different ancient and modern languages still there were many impediments to overcome his eye however gradually improved and he could use it by daylight never again in the evening a few hours though it was not till utter some years and then with repeated intervals of weeks and sometimes months of debility many a chapter and some of the severest in ferdinand and isabella were written almost wholly with the aid of the eyes of his secretary his modus operandi was necessarily peculiar he selected first all the authorities in the different languages that could bear on the topic tobe discussed he then listened to the reading of these one after the other dictating very copious notes on each when the survey was completed alarge pile of notes was amassed which was read to him over and over again until the whole was embraced by his mind when they were fused down into the consecutive contents of a chapter when the subject was complex and not pure narrative requiring a great variety ot reference and sifting of contradictory authorities the work must have been very difficult but it strengthened memory kept his faculties wide awake and taught him to generalize for the little details slipped through the holes in the memory his labor did not end with this process he found it was as difficult to write as to read and procured in london u large writing case for the blind this he could use in the dark as well as in the light the characters indeed might pass for hieroglyphics but they were deciphered by his secretary and transferred by him to h legible form in a fair copy yet i have hea d him say his hair sometimes stood on an end at the woful blunders and misconceptions of the original which every nw and then escaping detection found their way into the first proof of the printer amid such difficulties was the composition of the history of ferdinand and isabella heroically completed at the end of something less than ten years from its commencement he remembered that johnson says that milton gave up his history with the eyes of others and was stimulated in the midst of his embarrassments to overcome them well might he feel a proud satisfaction in conquering the obstacles of nature mr prescott had four copies of the history first printed for himself and had so little confidence in its immediate success that he had thought ol postponing the publication till after his death but his father told him the man who writes a book he is afraid to publish is a coward this decided him the work was published in the beginning of its reception in his own country and in all parts of europe was such as to pay him if anything could for the long nights of toil by which it had been produced capt peter flowery this individual who was convicted in the u s court of participation in the african slave trade was imprisoned in the county jail at salem at the same time that charles t torey was imprisoned at baltimore for the crime of aiding american slaves to get their liberty in progress op time torrey sickened and the governor of maryland refused to pardon him that he might die among his kindredand so he died in the prison hospital flowery had a room nicely fitted up for him in jail where he could enjoy the society of his wife and friends and every comfort and at length was pardoned by the president of the united states and immediately found employment his being a convicted slaver being a recommendation to some of our conscientious ship owners in the african trade he went to africa as master of the schooner mary ann and while at sierra leone was taken sick on his recovery he found that the mate and crew had gone off with the vessel which had been anchored at the gallenas he embarked on board the schooner i b gsger for new ork but died on the passage home a few hwurs after the i b gager arrived at new york the mary ann arrived also in the charge of the mate who reported that he took her from gallenas because he had ascertained that flowery had arranged to put her into the slave trade we hope the affair will be fully investigated bottom ctrnapunch says it may he proper in sute that the dieting

jliterature a pleasant surprise a young man of eighteen or twenty a student in a university took a walk one day with a professor who was commonly called the students friend such was his kindness to the young men whose oftice it was to instruct whilu they were now walking together and the professor was seeking to lead the conversation to grave subjects they saw a pair of old shoes lying in their path which they supposed to belong to a poor man who was at work ina held close by and who had nearly finished his days work the young student turned to the professor saying let us play the tnan a trick we will hide his shoes and conceal ourselves behind those bushes and watch to see his perplexity when he cauiiot find them my dear friend answered the professor we must never amuse ourselves at the expense of the poor but you are rich and you may give yourself a much greater pleasure by means of this poor man put a dollar into each shoe and then we will hide our selves the student did so and then placed himself with the professor behind the bushes close by through which they could easily watch the laborer and see whatever wonder or joy he might ex press the poor man soon finished his work and came across the field to the path where he had left his coat and shoes w hile he put on his coat he slipped one foot into one of his shoes but feeling something hard he stooped down anu found the dolior astonishment and wonder were seen upon his countenance he gazed upon the dollar turned it round and looked at it again then he looked round him on all sides but could see no one now he put the money in his pocket and proceeded to put on the other shoe but how great was his astonishment when he found the other dollar his feelings overcame him he fell upon his knees looked up to heaven and uttered aloud a fervent thanksgiving in which he spoke of his wife sick and helpless and his children without bread whom this timely bounty from some unknown hand would save from perishing the young man stood there deeply affected and tei filled his eyes voar said i protestor are you not much better pleased than if you had played your intended trick o dearest sir answered the youth you have
