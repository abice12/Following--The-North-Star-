burns anniversary festival this annual gathering of the sons anti daughters of old scotia in this city and land of their adoption took place on the evening of thursday the oth lust there was for the occasion a numerous assemblage not much under three hundred perhaps twothirds of them from the land of burns ihe remainder friends and sympathisers it was interesting to have an opportunity of seeing and conversing with so many who had visited the ground made classic hy the pen of the poet and who had been reared amid ihe scenes which he lias described with such inimitable power and pathos could almost have believed when heard the scotch voices and saw the scotch faces and listened to the wild notes of the pibroch which was played at intervals during the evening that was in the auld toon of ayr itself within a short distance of the hirthplace of the poet and ihe scenes of the disasters of his immortal hero in alloa kirkyard the association recalled to my mind many a barren crag and leafy rivulet in that brave old country memory was busily at work conjuring up pictures of early days and the almostforgotten events of longpast years as l wandered mentally among many a ruin old and hoary and saw the familiar faces of dear friends some of whom are separated front me by distance some by death it would have been strange indeed had not felt slightly disposed to philosophise on tlw vanity and changea hleness of all things earthly this is oneperhaps the principal advantage of such social gatherings it serves to strengthen the links that hind friend to friendman to mancountry to country it serves to refresh and water the green spots on memorys waste which are apt amid the business and hurry of this working world to he lost sight of if not forgotten my present object however is not to moralise hut to eke out some account of this anniversary festival the president for the evening mr russell took the chair ut eight oclock and commenced the proceedings of ihe evening with a speech of

parent to keep out minds buoyant and happy and on ull fitting occasions to meet together in so cial compact after a short interval during which several songs were sung and an amusing scotch piece purporting to he a dialogue between man and write on the propriety of signing the teetotal pledge was recited by mr mcttn f iivmsthe chairman called upon mri si dev w ho spoke as follow s mr chairman anj friesds this being a social party we are all expected to contribute our share to the amusements of the evening for that reason with your consent i will make a lew rermfrks this recalls to mind the joys which we had in our native landjoys which we neither can nor will forget and he who loves not the home of his childhood that land which contains the ashes of his sires is a being whose presence any land can spare if it looks to its own honor and weal such a one the poet has well said shall die tmvepl unlionoiej amt uusung all of us who are here met to spend a night in scotish style in the land of our adoption can look back with pride to that land whose earliest records give ns to know that she alonejof nations drove back the troops of the mighty caesars and whose every hill and glen bears record of where a martyr fell and patriot died in defence of freedom and fatherland in this our own time we can look back to a watt in sciencea hume and macauley in historya burns in poetry all of her history teems with truths which make her children feel proud of such a native land and likewise to know that she had some of her sons here when freedoms foes were strong in their attempts to crush the liberty which washington so gloriously achieved may we never cause scotland to blush lor her offspring in other lands may we always be found in the van of that march of progress that leaves destroyed in its rear institutions and customs which are a disgrace to the age and j may you always be amongst the firwf to remove all that degrades our race or supports a class by practicing an injustice on the many and may you likewise show that the poet spoke truth when lie speaks of home and of birth  place that though bleak and barren be tlw lonely spot its charms can never never le forgot and when memory leads you back to the haunts of your childhood may the virtues you saw practiced in the puirj mans hame make you feel as burns sung time but the impression deeper make as streams tleir channels deeper wear ninety years since today scotland received that child stamped not with titles or earthly grandeur but with natures mark of genius he was inis fortties child and scotlands glory natures poet and freedoms poeta man whose greatest joy was in the trij umph of right wherever asserted the powerful tyrants of a class government lie despised although at that time his countrys rulers he could sing the glories of america and the french j patriots even while those glories were reaped at the expense of britain and why because he wished to see that principle triumph which says irimes and lords are bm hie hreulliof king an honest man v i lie noble work of od for such iodlike conduct lie was told ins part was to work not to think but did he submit no he fulfilled his creators plan that was to set the world a thinking and mirth a laughing at the baby titles with which born kings decorated the lug but soulless men oi his time lien these titles and men are at rest in their kiudred clay burns memory shnii he green and while independence poetry and benevolence are revered his memory will lie not less so as long as there is oppressionthe oppressed will find in him their defence anti longfaced cant dressed either as the heavenly chosen or wordly wise will find soch a truth in his poetry us i will make them cry avauntthou art satan and while the slave wears the mark of bondage the songs of barns will make strong his hope where ye freedom finds a home her praises will be sung with his songsher brightest robes be independence such as his her first and proudest words a man a man fur all that burns was a friend to universal brotherhood an elevator of his race he cherished a love for his kind and for freedom that only found limits there these had no existence f n him we see the victim of the oppressor and the earthly god mammon they destroyed the mao but could not crush he spirit which wished and prayed that he time would come whru man to wait

tbt land of our birth and that of our adoption suggestive joinls of contra and of agreeuient a glance at whicl may not be inappropriate to this occa sion our island home as she rest like i wearied dove upon the expanse of waters presents in territorial extent nothing by which she may become an arbitrator among the nation or entice tc her fields the combatants of the world though in diversity and grandeur ol i scenery she yields to none incapacity to charm and captivate the hearts of hei sons nor in the history of martial prowess since war received its first impulse from the murderous hand ol cain till the complete development ol its enginery under the conduct of napoleon have the frequent wars of our country much affected the conduct and destiny of nations nor in the marts of the business uorld have her useful and valuable fabrics and the extent ol her commercial transactions entitled her to the position of a firstpporerw r er in establishing and maintaining the commercial equipoise or dictating restrictive measures to estrange mankind but like many of the choicest enjoyments the unfolding of her best treasure was deferred until the belligerents in war and its concomitants hud proclaimed a truer and he persuasive voice of home and school and religion and the application of these to the practical affairs of life in one short century has placed our country in the foreground of nations and scotland has become a formidable competitor in the discovery and elucidation of principles which are gradually but effecti r ely reconstructing societapfietigion and governments of the wrerddemonstrative evidence of whicl is afforded in the gradual fusion of ttajliversified character and peculiar itjfeslcformerly conflicting peoples rearing jrefrom as by magic the present american nation our adopted homegrander in extent more potent in power but dependent alike with the humblest community upon the same fixed rules of action to us then wherever we may go the discipline of our scottish homes and the examples of our countrymen are an invaluable behest the application of which ia our american homes from congeniality will ensure eminence and respecta bility frederick douglass who was present as an invited guest being called upon by a number of voices rose and said mr chairman i regard it as a pleasure not less than a privilege to mingle iny humble voice with the festivities of this occasion although i am not a scotchman nor the son of a scotchman perhaps you will say it needs no ghost to tell us that a laughl hut if a warm love of scotch character a high appreciation of scotch geniusconstitute any of the qualities of a true scotch heart then indeed does a scotch heart throb be j neath these ribs from my earliest acquaintance with scotland i have held that country in the highest admiration as i travelled through that land two years since and became acquainted with its people and realized their warmth of heart steadiness of purpose and learned that every stream hill glen and valley had been rendered classic by heroic deeds in behalf of freedom that admiration was increas ed that you may know that i have some appreciation of the genius of the hard whose birthday von have met to celebrate i went a pilgrimage to see j the cottage in which he was born and had the pleasure of seeing and con t versing with a sitter of the noble poet to whose memory we have met to do honor i can truly say that it was one of the most gratifying visits i made during my stay in scotland i saw or thought f saw some lingering sparks in the eyes of this sister that called to mind the fire that ever warmed the bosom of burns but ladies and gentlemen this is not a time for long speeches i j do nor wish to detain you from the social pleasures that await you i repeat i again that though lam not a scotchj man and have a colored akin i am proud to be among you this evening and if any think me out of my place on this occasion pointing at the picture of burns i beg that tbe blame may belaid at the door of him who taught mel that a roans a man for a that mrd sat down amid loud cries of goi on from the audience mr demotes the scottish vocalist j very opportunely happened to be in the city on this evening and as became aj true scotchman and admirer o the scotch poet hastened to lend the aid of j his eloquent voice to add to the interest of the occasion his highland mary brought the sympathizing tear to the eyes of more than one of his delighted i listeners and that song ol burns w hich is and will always be tbe admiration of all mena mans a man for a that brought of apt plause from tbe audience it was after tbe singing of this song that tbe call fort douglass douglass arose and that man for a that got upon the platj form and delivered a short speech of sketch will be found above several other gentlemen end one lady whose names i did not catch also votj unteered songs they were ell good but the song by m my let us baste to kefria grov was a peculiarly successful effort the feast of reasonwas of course the principal part of tbe entertainment but mr serpell an english confectioner who rochester n y friday february has taken up hia residence in this city to administer to tlie gastronomic wants of his amencaa cousins tool good care that another kind of lea si i should not be wanting may his shadow never be less the evening passed oti pleasantly to all parties the absence j of any beverage stronger than tea anti coffee prevented the occurrence of aav of those scenes that are the bane and the disgrace of social gatherings in but too many instances in the land ol burns much more so former than nowthough in that respect there is till room for improvement the assemblage broke up at an early hour taking with them food for pleasarable reflection and the anticipation of a future recurrence of burns anniversary j ds ct ct lions speech of mil j r giddixgs on the bill to pay the hut vf antonio pachrfo for v slave sent tocst of the mississippi mtk the seminole indians in ihs mr jhidings said he had not intended to participate debate hut from the favor with which the bill had been regarded in committee and the majority in favor of its engrossment he apprehended that gentlemen had not carefully examined the facts of the case ncr did he think they had fulljflcotisidi ered the principles involved in the pap sage of the bill there are tsaid he certain great and which lie at the foundation of mir gh eminent we profess to hold these truths to he selfevident that all men are created equal yet the bill before us admits one man to be the property ol another that one man may rightfully hold another subject to his will may scourge him into obedience and compel him to labor for the benefit of his master we profess to believe that all men are endowed by their creator with the unalienable right to the enjoyment of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness yet the hill before us admits the claimant to have rightfully held the liberty and happiness of his dmowman at his entire disposal now if we pass this bill our professions will be in direct contradiction to our practice if we really hold to these doctrines it is certain that we must oppose this bill and it is equally certain that if we pass this bill we shall by such act deny these truths we each of us deny these doctrines or we hold to them we cannot do both say that we hold to them and at the same time support this bill would he placing our professions in direct contradiction to our actions the inconsistency would be too obvious to deceive anyone tell me not that you hold to the undying truths contained in the declaration of independence and at the same time sit here to estimate the value in dollars and cents of the body and mind of your fellowman those who founded our government declared their ulterior object that object was to secure all men residing within our jurisdiction in the enjoyment of life liberty and the pursuit of hpppiness are we today said he carrying out these objects here sir are two hundred and thirty american statesmen legislating for the benefit of slavery there is no evading this plain and obvious fact no subterfuge can hide it from the people the powers of government were instituted by our patriotic fathers fop the express purpose of securing to all for whom we legislate the blessings of liberty we are now sitting here to compensate the oppressor oi his fellowman for his inability to continue his power over the victim of his barbarous cupidity the members who vote for this hill will give unmistakable evidence of their approbation of slavery and their willinsness to sustain it before i proceed farther i will give a synopsis of the facts involved in the case the claimant in d residing in florida professed to ou a uegro man named lewis tlijs man u said to have been very intelligent speaking four languages which he read and wrote with facility the mastbr hired him to an officer of the united states to act as a guide lo the troops under command of major dade for which he was to receive twentyfive dollars per month the duties were dangerous and the price was proportioned to the danger at the time these troops were massacred this slave lewis deserted to the enemy or was captured by them he remained with the indians acting with them in their depredations against the white people until when gen jessup says he was captured by a detachment of troops under his com mam an indian chief named jumper surrendered with lewis whom he claimed as having at he said captured him at the tune ot dades defeat jessup declares that he regarded him os a dangerous man that he was supposed to have kept up a correspondence feftb the enemy horn the time he joined major dade until the defeat of that that to insure the public safety he ordered him sent west with the indians believiag that if left in the country he would be employed against out ttoopa he was sent west and the claimant now neks that we should pay him fiiooo as the value of this mans body the committee on jfmtary affairs were unable lo unite in a report upon the case five slaveholder repro tenting ehreprpetty joy constitnting a of the committee have reported bih for the pay meat of this amount to the claims four northern men representing ftfe nten only have made a minority report against the bill the report as think is sustained by irre futable argu i utent the majority of the committee assume the position that slaves are regarded by the federal constitution as property and that this government and the people of the free states are bound to regard them as property and to pay i for them as we would so many mules or li oxen taken into the public service j the minority deny this doctrine they insist that the federal constitution treats them as persous only and that this government cannot constitutionally involve the people of the free states in the guilt of sustaining slavery that wei bsve no constitutional powers to legislate upon the relation of master and slave there are several othr points on which the committee differ some of l which i intend to notice but i propose first to examine for a few momenta that of the constitutional power it is due to myself and the country that i should call public attention distinctly to the fact that these questions are forced upon us by southern gentleinenagainst the wishes and remonstrance of ever member of the committee from the free i states involving as it does the great fundamental principle of our government a distinguished member from the north mr rockwell of connecticut i introduced a resolution to close the dei batq jn one hour from the tune we went i iato committee i thought it unbecoming northern members to attempt thu hutiffeidebate on so important a matter biwbld upon us by the south i there pwwcalled for the ayes and nays on that resolution and nuw bold the floor by a sort of legislative fraud having voted for the engrossment of the bill with the sole object of obtaining the fl itur sir at the formation ot the constitution slavery was condemed in the severest language by the delegates who framed that instrument it is true that they had been regarded in england as property in lord hardwicke had decided that trover lay for a slave in the british courts that was the last decision of the kind made in england or in civilized europe one hundred years has elapsed since that decision its doctrines have been a thousand times discarded contemned and overthrown by the statesmen and jurists of that nation but here in an american congress we now hear this barbarous doctrine revived in the year lord mansfield boldly assailed the obsolete doctrine i laid down in this hall today and ex j hibited its absurdity in one of the ablest opinions to be found on record from that period this doctrine of property inman has found no supporters under the government of england with all our refinement as a nation with all our boasted adherence to liberty on this subject we are threequarters of a century behind our mother country when sir warren hastings was on trial in the house of peers in mr sheridan speaking on this subject iu his own peculiar and fervid eloquence declared that allegiance to that power which gives us the forms of men commands us to maintain the rights of men and never yet was this truth dismissed from the human heart never in any time in anynever in anv i clime where rude man ever had any i social feelingnever was this unextin j guishahle truth destroyed from the heart of man placed as it is in the centre and core of it by his maker that man was not made the property of man t thus was the language of british statesmen sixtytwo veers since today we have before this branch of the i american congress the report of a j committee avowing that under this federal government in the middle oi j the th century man is the projierty of his fellowman these sentiments of the british statesmen and jurists inspired the hearts j of our american patriots in wbenj they declared it to be a selfevident truth that all men are created equal when they framed our constitution they declared their object was to establish justice arid to secure to themselves ami their posterity the blessings of liberty this siihject of holding property in men did not escape their attention nor have they left us ignorant j of their views in regard to it mr madison the father of the constitution has left to us a clear and explicit account of their intentions he informs us that on wednesday august the convention proceeded to consider the report qf the committee of detail in relation to duties on exports a capitation tax and a navigation act the fourth section reported was as follows no tax or duty shall be laid by tbe legislature on articles exported from any tate nor on the migration nor importation of such personx as the several states shall think proper to admit nor shall suck migration or importation be prohibited mr gerry thought we had nothing to do with the conduct of the states as to slavery bat we ought to be careful not to give any aaactioa our people think witk mr gerry that e have nothing to do with slavery in the states we are determined that we will not be involved n it guilt with mr gerry we intend tobe fateful to give it no sanction sir wewill not sanction your slavery by paring our money for tbe bodies o slaves this is the doctrine which we boldand which we expoet to maintain yet the me where of this body annow engaged in legiahag upon the price oi human flesh if we pans this ham wa shall give ear meet solemn sanction to that instiiuuoti which gerrty and bis compatriots detested will the members from pennsylvania the sorceeeon of fraiikßn and wilson lend their sanction to slavery by voting the toon ey of the people to pay for states m but mr madison tells us that mr sherman of connecticut was oppodld to any tax on slaves as melting the matter worse because it implied that they were property i understand that some gentlemen from the north admit that slaves are property mr sherman and the frameri of the constitution would do no act by which it could be implied that they were property mr madison also participated in the discussion himself and as he informs us declared that he thought it wrong to admit that there could be property in men and the report was so amended as to exclude that idea in that assemblage of illustrious statesmen no man expressed his dissent from these doctrines of gerry of sherman and of madison these doctrines are that we should have nothing to do with slavery but ought to be careful not to give it any sanction that we should do no act by which it can be implied that there can be property in man that it would be wrong tor us to admit that there can be property in men such were the views of those who framed the constitution they intended to express their views in such language as to be understood will this house stand by them the gentleman from south carolina mr burt declared that he would leave us no roqm to escape this issueno loophole at which to get out that we must say by our votes either that there is property in men under the federal constitution or there is not i am most happy to meet the gentleman on that point and am prepared to submit the question to those who framed that instrumentto mr madison his decision is left on record the only question is have the representatives of the people here the firmness and the independence to maintain the constitution there stands the record of their intentions he who runs may read no man can fail to understand the intentions of those who framed our political compact those intentions constitute the very spirit of the constitution which we are sworn to support a iv people of the free states are aware of the objects and intentions of those patriots they know their rights under the constitution that they hold the indisputable right to be free and entirely exempt from the corroding stain of slavery so perfectly were these principles understood inthe early days of the republic that after the war of the revolution no man asked pay for his slaves that were taken from him or killed in the public service during the revolution in the register of the treasury declared that no instance of the payment for slaves during the revolution was to be found on record no sir madison and jefferson and their cotemporaries were then living they well understood the principles on which the union had been formed they respected the rights of the free as well as of the slave states and noman then attempted to involve the people of the north in the support of slavery i believe the first attempt to make this government pay for slaves was in this was twentyseven years after the adoption of the constitution and tbrtytwo years after thej declaration of american independence it is an important historical fact that shows clearly the opinions then entertained on this subject after the close of the lale war with england a biil was pending in this house providing for tho payment of property lost or destroyed during that war when the section providing forj the payment of horses carts c impressed into public service and desi troyed caine up mr maryant from s carolina moved to amend the bill so as to embrace slaves the motion was opposed by mr yancy and mr robertson and was negatived by a large majority see national intelligencer december this was amotion so to amend this bill as to pay j for slaves if killed in the public service when they had been impressed i have heard northern members express the opinion pending this bill that we ought to pay for slaves if lost when they were impressed into the service sir such was not the caae thirtyfive years since our predecessors then spurned the proposition whore now is the feeling the spirit which animated them we have no record of the speeches but every member will see j that the case proposed wee the strongest case that could be imagined it i was where a stave was taken agaioet the wiu of the master and pressed into the service and killed by the enemy yet they rejected the proposition by a arge majority the claim before us is of incomparably icm force here the master hired the slave at a high price to go with the troops asa guide and of course took npon himself all risks the neat cate was that to daoterive he had etahne again the united skates for wood and other neceaeariee famished the army and for the lorn of time and the expense of nursing a stave who was wounded in the service of government at new orleans this case is mere inleremiag from the tact that there was at that time an attempt anon the present eeeasion to breakdown that wellknown principle an oar coortitntioa that slaves are persons and net property the comanlleo on claims at that tune was comeossd of taur northern and three southern amo at its kngl  builunidtv man lewis willow of north carolina who served hie eoantnj ssrsrswbfe john dick whole no quarter of a century he vu a distinguished member of this house there are fear very few now present that had the pleasure of serving with him but can attest to his great abilities and deserved influence that committee reported in favor of allowing compensation for the articles furnished to the army but said expressly that slaves not being i property they could not allow the master any compensation for his loss this was the unanimous repostmr williams of north carolina mr mccoy of virginia ami mr owen of alabama uniting in the report mr w illlams had been contemporaneous with madison and jefferson and be did not hesitate to avow the doctrines of the constitution and tti maintain them here is the record of hts opinion and of the views of his associates when the bill came up in committee of the whole certain southern gentlemen suddenly became excited worked themselves into a passion threatened s dissolution of the union and all that sort of thing in short they manifested that spirit of dictation and intimidation which we have so often witnessed on more recent occasions they made a strenuous effort to reverse the decisiou of the committee on claims but after j some two weeks discussion gave it uplaid the subject on the table and there the matter ended this discussion was thirtynine years subsequent to the adoption of the constitution and more than fifty from i the declaration of independence the principle that slaves were persons and not property waa reaffirmed upon full discussion without the light which wa possess on the subject the madison papers were not then published the views of gerry and sherman and madison in the convention and the action of that body in relation to this matter tyere unknown to them should we now reverse that decision and overturn the practice we shall sin against greater fight than they possessed the next and only remaining instance in which the question of appropriating the treasure of the nation to pay for slaves was in isis a bill for the relief of the people of west florida intended to provide for the payment of slaves taken by the army of general jackson from the inhabitants of that territory in came up for discussion the slaves had been taken against the consent of their owners by the military power of the nation think there were about ninety taken from different individuals the proposition was distinct in its character the object of the bill was to pay for human flesh i myself opened the debate and stated as the principal grounds of my opposition to it that slaves were not regarded as property under the federal constitution my venerable and lamented friend now no more john quincy adams suslauurd my positions several southern gcugg tlemen spoke in favor of the bill the journal is now before me and shows the bill to have been rejected by a vote of one hundred and ihirteon to thirtysix this was done by a whig congress not one of that party from the free states voted for the billi have now given a history of our legislation on this subject there was a bill passed this body sub silent io on one of days when there is by the rules of the house uo discission by which payment was made for ala yes my friend from pc niutflvunia mr dickeyj has stated the facta in regard to it i knew that such a bill was pending and so did mr adam and hc had mutually agreed to oppijse its passage but it slipped through unnoticed and therefore constitutes no precedent in a bill passed this bldy to pay over moneys obtained by the government from great britain and held in trust by us tu be paid to the ifuners st slaves lost on board the comet and encomium this bill also lathed the senate and became a law at the last session we passed two bills to pay over moneys held in trust for thi vume purpose these cases were not io lake the treasure of the people ut the free states to pay for slaves hut to pay over moneys that did not belong to us but which we held for the use of those who claimed it but from the daw noi the revolution to this day being more than seventy yean this house has expressed but one opinion on thie subject they have at all times refused to tax the people of the north to py for the slaves of the south we hare trover regarded them as property but au attempt is now making to change the essential elements of our goveroi nt statesmen mow in the high counci l of the nation deny that all men are created emal that they are endowed by their creator with the tin alienable right to their lives and their liberty or that governments sre instituted among men to secure the enjoyment of those rights it is now urged that this corernment was instituted for the purpose of robbing men of those rights of disrobing a portion of our race of tbair humanity and reducing them to the state of brutes and making them the property of others will northern members assist to commit this outrage open the honor of tha nation and

crushed the north is humbled and the south is ex i alted this result is all the more disgraceful since in both cases the north at the firstwar in the ascendant and had both measures in its own hands

with him throughout he does not address himself to the whole but to those who are sick he is not a eon of thunder striking terror into the bosom of tbe slaveholder or his guilty apologist but seems to regard with more affectionate interest tbe i sinner than the saint acting on the principle that there is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth than ninety and nine just persons he aims not to annihilate the ene tines of freedom but to save them his love of jibe right is more conspicuous than his ab j bajrrgce of the wrong and he labors more it win friends to the cause of freedom than itm warm and overpower itr ermies he taste for the science of offence and pleases those who differ from him if offended by his arguments they are won by his kindness and though they may repudiate his doctrine they are attached to the man his address on monday evening though it did not sparkle freeze or burn held a deeply interested audience in profound stillness mote than the space of two hours i during the course of his remarks he al luded to his first acquaintance with william i lloyd ganison in the infancy of the anti r slavery movement he related the deep imf pression made upon his mind by thatinter  view in mr garrison he found a man off large and warm hearta mind of singular purity clearness and forceof great activity earnestness and singleness of purpose his whole soul aroused to the enormous evil of slavery and a firm faith that the nation could soon be brought to repentance mr ganison was then writing letters to a large number of distinguished men throughout the country j honestly believing that the cause was such as only needed to be brought lo their attention to secure their sympathy aid and cooperation he then believed that if he could get the subject before the ministers of religion the object would be nearly accomplished he therefore wrote to a number of ministers of different denominations appealing to them to take up the wrongs of the slave and to demand immediate emancipation as the right of the slave i and the duty of the master in return for his letters he received coldnessin some cases reptoofin others silence and in nearly all utter indifference this did not destroy his confidence in the rectitude of his principles or the righteousness of his cause it did however chill and destioy his confidence in the soundness and purity of the church and clergy the remarks of mr may on this point were highly gratifying and useful removing as they must have done much of the prejudice which exists here as well as elsewhere against mr garrison he then passed happily to his acquaintance with the celebrated george thompson de j fended him from the unjust remarks made upon him recently in syracuse and in this city by dr baird in his lectures on europe and england after showing op the injustice andptejudices of the latter gentleman he bestowed a wellmerited eulogy upon the former it was peculiarly refreshing to us to witness the warmth of admiration and strength of brotherly affection with which tbe eloquent champion of west india emancipation was remembered and defended by one so able and devoted to the canse of freedom as mr may thank god that ther are those in our land whose sense of joslicewill not allow even one so beloved and popular as dr baird to injure with impunity the absent the promptness aad genuine earnestness with which mr may came to the aid of his friend showedths purity and benevolence of his own heart as well as added lustre to the character of the noble george thompson the next person to whom our attention was directed was mias crandallthe antislavery lady who a few yearn ago for establishing a school for the instruction of colored children in connecticut received such brutal treatment at the hands of the piety aad respectability of that very evangelical stale he gave an interesting history of the commencement and final overthrow of that school and commented upon the difficulties thrown the way of the edaealioo and improvement of colored persona at that time and now a tribute of teem was paid to the worthy young woman who gave such evidence of devotion to the easse of human brotherhood aad the speaker

somewhat in admitting the letter of irwin into the columns ot the north star it is a tart sharp letter and written with some ability though it belts all appreciation of reforms or the means of accomplishing them and want of charity for the foibles of those engaged in them her attention has been attracted by the cry of reform reform and sfart led by the cry she exclaims where what as though the cry were altogether new and the need of it a mystery like rip van winkle she has just eome out of an age of sleep just from the fair and sonny south and b utterly amaaed to aee the state of things

manifesting a wicked and malignant spirit it may he perfectly proper thus to characterra them and to do so anywhere on earth for there is no place where the command to be holy is more binding than another to think otherwise is to think that rigbtjand wrong virtue sod vice depend upon time and place and denies the everywhere present god the unwillingness of oar correspondent to have the churrh rebaked is a true index of the state of her mind upon the whole subject of reform she would have the church rebuked but it must be by men who love god but it so turns out that the persons who in her judgment ire fit are the very persona who utterly refuse to have anything to do with the discharge of that dnty and leave it for what she terms sinners we are glad that irwin has spoken and hope her attention may dwell longer upon this snbjeet a further investigation may lead her to sec as we do the persons upon whose course she has commented are abundantly able to take care of themselves apd we leave it to them to say how far she has misrepresented their conductf d the editor of the pennsylvania freeman for whose judgment in many things his appreciation of ourselves of course included we have the highesfiespect says there are few papers in our land wliose editorials are written with more clearness and force than mr douglasss were he a little more rigid in regard to the literary merits of some other contributions to his paper it would be well both for the paper and the writers we have not been insensible to the literary defects of many articles admitted into the columns of the north

colored population of philadelphia have been born out of the state and it is further supposed that twothirds of these immigrants are from the slave states the total number of those born slaves is stated as manumitted bought their freedom the amount paid for their freedom it has been attempted by the compilers of this pamphlet to form an estimate of the real and personal estate held by the people or color but it is justly observed that no returns of this nature can be more than an approximation to the actual value on account of the difficulty of obtaining correct returns from the

interesting and satisfactory say they of a large portion of this class of our fellowcitizens it may be truly said that they are steadily advancing in alt that constitutes a respectable and intelligent community they have numerous skilful and industrious artisans and tradesmenthe desire for information and the feeling of selfrespect are increasing among them and it is upon the influence of the christian example and the steady conduct both as regards industry and morals of those who have thus raised themselves and upon their benevolent exertions that the future welfare and respectability of the people of color in this city must as sj class in the community mainly depend the distinction of color and the prejudices which have grown out of the condition of slavery ate no doubt feu by the man of color to be the principal barrier against his obtaining that social position to which by his good conduct intelligence and wealth he is fairly entitled there are few things in the world more unreasonable and unreasoning than these prejudices of caste and color the writer lias huge hope that these prejudices will speedily die away our more intimate connection with the people inhabiting the tropics where men of color form a large proportion ot the people and exercise the highest offices of state must of itself in the end obliterate the odionsness of the distinction here let the man of color cultivate the spirit of self respect and independence and without allowing hi mind tobe disturbed by prejudices which cannot be at once removed pursue that course of quiet industry and unpretending virtue which will make him happy and respectable as an individual and will contribute more than anything else to elevate the condition of his people this proper feeling of self respect

objections w hich have long since failed to aid the grovelling apologist fot slavery it lias been the means of drawing thousands aw ay from former habits in a measure curing them of that loathsome

diseased public sentiment of the ageso little ju accordance with but far overreaching the popular religion of the day that sorry am i to record the fact a large portion of the colored people have

good results already emanating from a press conducted by colored men and needs no further proof that the hour has comeyea now is when upon our action in a great measure depends the freedom of the

heart and body politic of this professed republic and in spite of the efforts of slaveholders and their apologists against it party strife bloodshed mexican war and all other hellish ingredients the onward progress of equality can no longer be impeded and there is hope that this land will ere long in deed and in truth become what it has professed tobe for nearly threefourths of a century we must

slavery has just occiurred he gives the following particu lars william and flien crapt man and wife lived with different masters in the state of georgia ellen is so near white that she can eass without suspicion for a white woman eer husband is much darker he is a mechanic and by woiking nights and sundays he laid up money enough to bring himself and his wife out of slavery their plan was without precedent and though novel was the means of giving them their freedom ellen dressed in mans clothing and passed as the master while her husband passed as the servant in this way they traveled from georgia to philadelphia they are now out of the reach of the bloodhounds of the south on their journey they put up at the best hotels where they stopped neither of them can read or write and ellen knowing that she would be called upon to write her name at the hotels c tied her right hand up as though it was lame which proved of some service to her as she was called upon several times at hotels to register her name in charleston s c they put up at the hotel which gov mcduffie and john c calhoun generally make their home yet these distinguished advocates of the peculiar institution say

question were to be decided lre tween perpetual bondage and immediate emancipation we would choose the latter without hesitancy we go for the abolition of slavery on the best plan for the slaves own benefit that plan we could propose if necessary we believe that it is a national evil and an individual curse and that in the aggregate the whites would be greater gainers than the slaves  we suppose

refei particularly to the case of dauteriv which whs rejected on this nienticn point the committee say in express language that slaves have nevei been placed on the tooting of property and they rejected the haim ditinctlv on that point but to return to the cac of laic he the committee on claims of the senate vide rep it ihsessior  t cotigresa say in distinct language that the cart hoise and negro mac antoine belonging to the petitioner were impressed and sent to ihe lines ol the arnericnn army oil the jst day ol january where the negro man was killed by a cannon hall lioni ihe j british batteries the gentleman from south carolina mr burt assures uthal in was not impressed can hardly suppose that he was authorized thus distinctly in deny the accuracy of that report in a matter of fact however that may he it is certain that the committee understood that the man was impiessed they therefore acted upon that hypothesis and with that belief the eom mitee unanimously repotted against the bill no stronger ease can in imagined the horse rail and negro were impressed as the committee reported and believed the petitioner was paid for the property that is the i horse and cart but the claim for the slave was rejected vet sir they had not the advantages of kn wing the sentiments of the farmers of the constitution which we possess they were unconscious that the members of the convention declared that they ought the careful tb give no sanction to slavery that they should do nothing by which it could bo implied that slaves were property that it was wrong to admit that there could he property inman i repeat that to the best of my knowledge and i have bestowed much labor on the subject no report was made in lavor of paying for slaves from the public treasury during the first half century which this governmenl existed under the present constitution if wrong on any of these points j ask gentlemen to correct me here before the country let them expose mj errors in the presence of

which was chairman the friend jof the claim by some means learnei i that the committee had always reportei j against the payment for slaves the i therefore obtained the transfer of tha case to the

gentleman from south carolina if he intends to overthrow it by his sidebai testimony mr burtwhat is it mr giddingsthat this man wai impressed mr burtl df sir there is nc evidence of the fact mr giddingsthen i leave the gentleman to take issue with the history the docuinentaiy evidence is that this slave was impressed that he was taken to the american lines and was there killed by a cannon shot from the enemys batteries at the period to which i was refer nng when interrupted i had been placed at the head of the committee on claims bv the then speaker of the j house hon johu w hite of kentucky j of whom though a slaveholder i i can never speak except with profound respect there were at that time many claims for slaves before that committee it was then our settled policy to make no reports on those cases lest we should stir up agitation on this delicate question in this hall before the howe i wan interrogated by a slaveholder mr n ise of virginia j oe ibis select it was asked distinctly whether our com i mittee would report in favor of paving i lor slave i answered that we would follow the established practice on that h subject he replied that my answer t was evasive but that the established practice was not to pay for slaves it so happened that on the lst march i i introduced certain resolutions declaring the rights of the people of the tree states to he exempt from the support of the slave trade for this i was censured und driven from my seat another member war added to the fominilke on claims and then sir during my absence just eight day after left the committee thiscase was urged uxm the members who were most of them inexperienced m their duties and unacquainted with the precedents i ielt this mall on the jd march and n the i day of april fallowing a hill was reported by a slaveholding member of that ommittce to pay for tills man lewis this was the first cae of the kind that ever received a favorable report from that paiti rular committee and that report was obtained in the manner just slated it wa in the sixtyseventh year of american independence and the fiftythird of mu constitution this is the histo i v of this subject ami of this hill it was reported seven years since by a vhig committee we are yet to see whether ihi mouse can lie induced topass it sir we have the power to overturn the practice of this body from its first formation we may overthrow its established and timehonored principles we may defeat the objects of those who framed the constitution ue may sub vet t the essential elements of that sacred compact which we are sworn tot support we may attempt to change the law of our existenceto deface the work of d and declare his image to he property we may do all this at the bidding of the slave power we may humble ourselves in the presence o r those who hold the rod of terror over its but there is a superior power that will hold us to a strict account of our stewardship sir the eyes of the people are upon us they arc watching our actions the concentrated rays of intelligence now brought to bear upon alt our doings render it impossible for us to deceive them no evasion no subterfuge will screen those who would render northern freemen subsidiary to the support of southern slave ry to this day there has been in this hall sufficient independence and patriotism to reject all propositions of this humiliating character as i have said we arc now driven to legislate by southern slaveholders under the lash of the south mr burl i hope the gentleman from ohio will allow ine this opportunity to disclaim utterly and indignantly any such imputation mr giddings withdraw it then mr burt venture to appeal to this whole committee who heard my remarks mr giddings i thought when the j gentleman said he would hold northern i gentlemen to this point whether a slave was property that he would leave no loophole for us to escape i thought it looked somewhat like the language i of intimidation it smacked somewhat of the plantation of the crack of the whip i took it unkind in the gentle i man from connecticut that under such circumstances he should attempt to stifle debate to seal the lips of northern men this bill is pressed upon us at this particular time when southern men are holding conventions and manufacturing their usual mock thunder of i dissolving the union in consequence ol our agitation we hear it rolling along i the heavens it affords amusement tor our sehoolboys who crack their jokes and sing ditties in regard to it sir when l reflect that am now constrained to sit in this hall to legislate upon the price of human flesh as pruperty i feel humbled before the nation before heaven i protest against this degradation by what rule shall arrive at the value of this man he is said to he very intelligent and learned reading and writing lour languages in this respect he has prol bably few equals in this hall mean no offence by this comparison eithertc gentlemen now present or to the negre who is absent i regard the inoral qualities of a man as the proper criterion by which to graduate my respect in i this light i know not whether the comparison be unjust to him or to those t who estimate his value at precisely ai thousand dollars i would he as willing to enter into an inquiry as to the value of the body of the honorable i member reporting this bill as i am te estimate the value of a man who as a linguist probably has not a dozer equals in this body if we are u judge of him by the report of the committee if placed in this body he might have reflected honor upon our country and our race the splendor of has genius might have soared far above the grovelling intellects now engaged in figuring up his value in dollars and cents his name might have been placed in future history betide that ol i wirt of henry of burke and of i sheridan or perhaps hit philanthropy might have placed him on the roll of fame with adams and wilberforce j and yet we are now sitting here to inquire as to the value of this immortal mind to estimate ita price in glittering dust my soul shrinks from the impious sacrilege with loathing and disgust but this ethereal immortal

constitution of that state sait vos commenced on tho note given in consideration of tu slatea the defence set up won that the contract was illegal and void under the conmitotion of that state which prohibited the sale therein of slaves from without the rate the reply to this was that slaves were property and therefore the state of miaetamppi had no power to prohibit their introduction into the
