the first precipice they came to but teach them at the same time that there must be no violence to establish this right inspire them with an invigorating reliance in the goodness of their cause and with gratitude for the efforts of those who are so zealously labour ing to promote its success let slaves be taught that which all men ought to know that the principle of good must finally triumph over the principle of evil for that our creator is in sympathy with us when we practically enforce the former and that we are drawn aside by our own bad passions and desires when we follow after the latter let slaves be taught what if their masters had learnt they would never have been slaves that a gospel liati been preached in the world which forbids violence which forbids the injurious treatment of any man teach the slaves to obey this gospel though their masters have disobeyed it the enslaved through means of a system vitiated and rotten to its very core are iu a state of unjust subjection to their earthly masters hut the enslaver is in a state of direct rebellion to his heavenly master for no man can make a of another man without a shameless an impudent defiance ofi that vrorldcompelb precept anew commandment gtv unto you that ye love one another one idea it would appear of the highest importance to communicate to slaves was one day conversing witha highly gifted and benevolent friend on antislavery subjects and made use of the teim dtgraxitil as applicable to the slave my friend objected to it saying that he greatly preferred using the term injured as nothing could degrade a man he lie who or what lie might but voluntary sin should not selfrespect he instilled into the mind of the slave on this very ground and should he no he taught that if he performs his allotted task well and his master is either brutal or licentious j he is the really degraded being lie is really the slave for ins is the bondage ot iniquity the desire the hope tlie expectation of freedom should constantly kept up while every feel ingot resentment against their masters jin the nitiitls of slaves should he as const anti v kept down the expectation would give an elevation to their thoughts which would tend to fit them fin that freedom wdicli the good time coming has certainly iu store for them while the absence ot resentment would justify the assertion to the truth of which no one more readily assents j to than myself that the african race are admirably qualified by the gentleness of their disposition to exhibit to the world a bright manifestation of i the milder virtues of the true christian j chaiacter how happy an illustraj lion we hud of this iu the conduct ol our own w est india slaves upon their emancipation and how cheering is it to read the numerous and well supported proofs of the kind politeness and religious sensibility which the cultivated african so very generally manifests that iod is no respecter of persons is a solemn bible truth and it their masters object to its being taught to slaves they ought in one instant to perceive that they are carrying on a system wholly at variance with bible truth the great apostle of the gentiles has declared that in christ there is neither male nor femule bond or free but that all are one in him and if any one objects to his slave being made a recipient of this truth let him ask himself the reason win the same apostle lias said remember those in bonds hs bound with them if tins passage too is tobe cautiously concealed from the slate may not the reason why be because the master fears that uti intelligent slave may discover the true meaning of tiiis exhortation does it not mean as spoken to the just man to the philosophical christian and to the devoted philanthropist of the year if ye remember those in bonds as bound with them break these bonds since ye do all prefer fieedom to slavery but ce to it that ye use no other means tor this purpose than those which god himself has put mtn

wherever it exists ayhen men become merchantable commodites or property as itis impinush termed they are subject to all its incidents to the degradation of sale and bequest and to the cruelty of separation from kindred and friends in the united states it is reported that hltmmt slaves change hands every year and in other slaveholding countries it is probable that a proportionate number suffer the same sad fate but though in some of its features nothing can exceed the revolting character of this traffic it yields in the sum of its horrors to the foreign african slavetradp which is carried on chiefly to supply brazil and the spanish colonies with slaves it is impossible to arrive with accuracy at the number of slaves exported from africa since threat britain under the influence of humane and feeling was led to abolish it throughout her dominions a tabular statement however drawn up with great care was laid before a select committee of the house of commons j appointed last year to consider he j best means lor providing for the final extinction of the slavetrade from which we gather the following particulars viz that from to n less than negroes were exported from africa of

this truly appalling statement the dreadful fact so clearly demonstrated by the late sn t f buxton in his work on the slave trade that for every slave embarked one is sacrificedin the wars connected

is said he estimates very highly of speaking ins mind to his master or in other words of saving what he pleases without the risk of being punished nipre than the regular twenty lashes cm that day from the whipping room we pass to the place of confinement where there are but few slaves kept as the master does not wish to lose their services for any length of time but herein solitary confinement from one to six months the negro is kept and not only as in the philadelphia prison are they not allowed to see or speak to the public but without the garden which is attached to the cells of the latter

remarks on the disgraceful treatment they experienced at the hands of the aptain and passenger on board the alidu corning down from albany to new york if have not kept to my story you must attribute it to the fact that urn a womanand you know the celebrated dr potts of st louis says that we have no power of connected reasoning and indeed very little solid intelleect of any sort and hence i could not keep to the point lie did say that we could write letters but lie must have meant short paragraphs made up of odds and ends and pretty sentiments consequent on the extreme amiability be attributed to us not i think he saida little lower than the angels the compliment is antiquated ive no doubt but isaac said the same to rebecca when be lifted her oft tbe camel but you would still advise gratitude would you not well of douglass and the ladies would observe to begin with that the latter are warm friends of frederick who in europe felt honored by his acquaintance and delighted to extend to him the hospitality of their home they are educated accomplished women having not only a genuine selfrespect but the additional strength and calm unquestioning sense of the right to independence which a superior position in society in england always ensures they have been lately traveling on tbe continent in austria germany fete and are now making a tour of pleasure in the united slates judge then my friend of what their first impressions were on reaching the model republic as the elder of the two described to ine m a most graphic and simple manner then journey across the ocean and first introduction to american prejudice in tbe franklin house in new yoi k i cannot do better than give you a brief sketch of the same only regretting that i have it not in my pow er to convey at the same lime the appropriate gesture and varying tones of voice in which this and to them extraordinary experience was related the captain then of the sarah sands was a delightful man juat theone to make the passengers forget the length of the voyage which was as you may remember very long from the fact that a cylinder hurst and they had no duplicate they were two weeks behind time the sateen cabin passengerswith their cheerful captain had what we call grand times notwithstanding the delay and laid many plans for social reuntoukc when they should have reached port one gen uqnab mr peuglu md w

am state was discussed in council during the voyage all went on swimingly and long before the ship reached new ork it was decided thru they sboulc all put up at the same hotel it was an undeiuood thing tiiat mr d was tc meet the ladies on tlh arrival of the steamer hut her tardy arrival disarranged plans and two or three days elapsed before they met the mutual interest felt in the character of douglass made him to a certain extent the theme of friendly conversation when lo it reached refined american eaia that a colored man oh shocking to re latei was expected lo call on some of the boarders in that hitherto unpolluted house there were side looks and whispers doubtless long before out unsuspicious friends became aware of the fact for they all uninspired as they werelabored under the impresses they should never realize any thing of this vulgar prejudice which they had heard of by letter and newspaper it did no doubt exist in some other and lower sphere but theytheir position was well known and as to mr douglass he ranked far above the boarders at the franklin houselie was a man of genius one of natures noblemenat last a faint rumor reached them cautiously and timidly expressed that it would not do herethat it was a question ifmr douglass would he admitted into the house that certainly he would not be permitted to take a meal at the table it was considered very much out of the way see you see they did not treat the matter after the manner of the n y express at first hut were very tender and as i said cautious milk for babes you know w hen they had been in the country six months they would view things very differently said old english friends whom they sought in their perplexity no insinuation could be more insulting than this as if six months in the model republic was sufficient to divest them ot common sense and common humanity oh but they persisted we had no more idea of the thing than you have when first we came we invited mr a most gentlemanly person to our house very frequently he was a most gentlemanly and intelligent person buthad be swindled his host jui of hia property o no lut they had gotten over all that felt quite other wiseit would not do as lie was colored in this country the darkness was becoming visible the fellow passengers who had entreated lengthy visits the delightful captain who had been a father to them became by degrees inoculated with the diseae or ratherinstead ofpresenting a bold front yielded to the american chimera called puplic opinion on board the steamer such views would have been ridiculed hut now they insinuatedin a hesitating apologetic tone reallymy dear madamloh i think it inexplicable but then i assure you that ismv dear friend the people here have most peculiar prejudices xe very well our friends answered we will change our boaidng house to where we can receive our guest in ihe wealthy and populous city of new ork such is the subserviency to the prejtij dice against color that was no easy matter meanwhile douglass ariived and was allowed to meet his friends not in the public parlor w herein they directed tie should he ushered hut in a private parlor which nevertheless was not private since two individuals were stationed there to report on the extia ordinary event of three friends meeting one of them being some shades darker than the others our english friends were not leaning persons to bend with the breeze tuey liver ihtough it ami improved m health alter the new york anniversaries they accompanied douglass lo u home and reluming to ihiladeljdiia where d was called to deliver an address they found themselves on board the alula on the ringing of the dinner hell they descended and seated themselves at the table soon murmurs of disapprobation filled the cabin soinei southerners weie on board to whom the proximity of a dark skm is on all oc castons peculiarly obnoxious the stew aid ordered douglass to leave the table he asked for authority ami after considerable insolence thefapain male and others came lushing down using foul language and declaring they would have no niggers eating with the white people on that boat resistance was in ram the ladies were indignant in the extreme and when douglas was refused a hearing the elder of the two stepped forw aul and aked will a lady he permitted to speakthere was a pause and she continued have long heard of the chivalry and courtesy of the americans with some incredulity but now am satisfied of the truth of it since you have even carried it so far as to deprive two english strangers of a meal may not have given the words but barely the sentiment conveyed they then left the cabin for of course thev would not remain if their friend was excluded and on their leiviug the vulgar crowd gave three cheers for them they had then to remain without food from early dawn fill night the toward even refusing them a cup of coffee and the bar tender refusing to sell them the smallest biscuit the

was denied me saw but few of them but such as i did see left a most favorable impression upon my mind they are from all can learn a really intelligent enter prizing and industrious people and in character and conduct they reflect great credit upon the oppressed and plundered class with whom they are identified their presence in any j community of whites must act as a killing confutation of the various slanders commonly preferred against the colored man shall long remember with sincere and heartfelt gratitude the cordiality and kindness i of mr anu mrs robert banks w ho cheer i fully

all belong to the oppressed class ot this community to be appreciated by them and such as they are is compensation full for all the hardships and privations to which am subjected in the advocacy of their cause i should have mentioned that the conduct of the steward on board the hendrick hudson duung my passage from detroit to buffalo was in every respect kind and gentlemanly he caused every attention to be paid and the waiters all appeared to vie with each oilier in their friendly solicitude for my comfort one of them made his bed by my side and kindly watched with me a night i remember

this late dateon the evening of the d of july in company with friend remond and two others ii took passage on board the steamer atlantic for detroit and immediately paid my fare tor first cabin passage and supposing that tins ticket pave me clear right to the comfort enjoyed by other first class passengers went into the saloon and seated myself with others i was however soon informed by the steward that could not remain there but must go forward i obeyed the order but not until i had seen the clerk and remonstrated against the palpable injustice of compelling me to pay an equal fare with white persons while he denied to me equal privileges he evidently felt the injustice and wrong dune i me and said for himself he had no objector to ray going into the saloon but that such were the rules and he was compelled to submit  asked for the presentation of the rules j and was frankly toll by the clerk that there were none such in existence but that they acted upon a common understanding and presume hat such is the case in every instance i have neve been able yet to see a rule whereby a colored man is compelled to pay an equal fare and to share unequal privileges vulgar and shameless as are the owners and conductors of steam packets there is not one of them who would not be ashamed to publish over his own signature a rule so mean and villanous as thatand yet they will practice with all boldness in accordance with that insulting ruleon the next day i received an invitation from a large number of passengers the captain himself consenting to deliver an address on the subject of american slavery w ith which i complied but instead of treating them to an exposure of southern slavery i called their attention to the oppressive customs of the north generally and those adopted on that boat particularly which at once commanded the attention of the ships company as well as passengersafter my remarks mr re mond being called upon responded in one of his happiest efforts recommending the north star to the patronage of every friend of freedom on hoard at the close of his speech five gentlemen came forward and subscribed for the paper the meeting altogether was a highly satisfactory one and evidently wrought a change in the feeling of all on hoard one of the officers and owners of the vessel subscribed for the paper and kindly gave me a free ticket to chicago but which has been rendered useless by my illness there was much discussion on board after the meeting and i doubt not that the effects of it will be useful and permanent hoping soon to be able again to resume my lecturing duties am ever yours faithfully frederick douglass dive the bible to the slavegive i him himself and a spellingbook the new york tribune publishes a report of the proceedings of a tneeiing of the liberty party held in cazenovia n y at which amongst the resolutions passed was one affirming that instead of sending bibles to the slaves it would be infinitely better to supply them with pocket compasses and a pistol the one to point out to them the land of free domthe other for selfdefence on their journey thither the compass would doubtless be useful of what use the pistol would be except to shoot himself when the dogs were at his heels and further llight impiacticable some may not be able to discover in this respect the pistol might be useful also for die he may if he cannot live a man assent into the world by god he ought not to live a brute in contravention of his creators will at the bidding of man but the part of the resolution which at present is nrincipall interesting is the opinion expressed therein that tt is inexpedient to send the bible to the slave against this resolution some seven members iwotesied they thought it was right that the slaves should have the bible the majority of them it is true say they cannot read but what of that give them the bible if you were to offer them the adventures of baron munchausenand call it the life of christ and they would not know the difference what of that give them the bible if in their ignorance and trusting to itas the means of their souls salvation they worship it as a kind of fetish or charm what of that give them the bible if they should be told that it is the word of god and their pious masters and mistresses take it and read to them out of it as they well know how to do such passages as servants obey your masters c and thereby lead them to believe that it is the will of god that they must be slaves and ought to be contented in their slaverywhat of that give them the bible if moreover their masters dont want them to have the bible and if given them at all it must be given secreily and kept secretly and stowed away out of sight like a sort of rachels idol musty and motheaten what of that i give them the bible if besides all this it j is rather a dangerous as well as unprofitable occupation to go into the slavestates and distribute bibles amongst the slaves and not one of all those who are zealous that they should make the very indispensable and to them soul saving acquisition of a book the first word of which they cant begin to read is bold enough notwithstanding his loudspeaking zeal to carry those bibles to the slaveswhat of that give them the bible i give them the bible how let it drop down from the clouds l sow it in the cotton held lok for a miracle to happen take the wild beasts and birds into your service and commission them to carry the bible to the slaves if not in some such way asthis how are they to get it when they get the bible what good will it do them it wi be worse than useless to the slave until he learns to read it before he can learn to read it in one out of ten thousand instances he must be a freeman this talk about giving the bible to the slaves is the veriest waste of breath and energy which might be usefully expended in asserting the slaves right to freedom those who advooate the measure no doubt amongst the unthinking get the credit of having a very h gh regard and reverence for the bible at the same time that tt gives them the oportf nity of bestowing upon those who do not see the propriety importance or prrticmbihty of tire scheme the epithets of infidel irreligi ousheretic ac and this is about all that it does or will do the affair will end as it has begun in smoke and bluster it will doubtless succeed for tune in getting up a feeling amongst the bigotted and unreasoning against the true friends of the slave but even this slight inconvenience will be of but temporary duration even they will speedily see their errot and discover how unj founded and absurd are tbe charges attempted to be fastened upon those who oppose the j measure give the alive hi liberty and a spellingbook and he will speedily get a bible and learn to read it meanness of the freest nation on the globe the utter and despicable meanness ot which this nation can be guilty it would seem has not yet been told when they were found j clinging at the bidding ot the slave power and making compromise upon compromise it was thought that surely the cup ot degradation was full when again at the bidding iof that power thev elected a slaveholding j blood stained warrior to the office of chief magistrate it was thought that they had drank up to the dregs their cup of shame j but there are still other and lower depths of infamy to which the cringing north must kneel if she would preserve the friendship and deserve the confidence of her brave chivalrous masters the pennsylvania freeman publishes a document from which it appears that the slaveholding executive ingreat regard for the weliare and the honor oi of this glorious republic have taken upon them to decide who shall and who shall not be considerd citizens and freemen not content with the declaration of new york oi massachusetts or pennsylvania that these several states acknowledge their ow n citizens and by thus acknowledging give them a right to all the privileges

very respectfully your obedient servant john m clayton a day oi fasting a hiroinmrndation hy the president of tin united states at a season when the providence ot god has manifested itself in the visitation of a fearful pestilence which is spieading its ravages throughout the land it is fitting that a people whose reliance has ever been on his protection should humble themselves before his throne and while acknowledging past transgressions ask a continuance of divine mercy it therefore earnestly recommended that the first friday in august be observed throughout the united states as a day of fasting humiliation and prayer all business will be suspended in the various branches of the public service on that day and it is recommended to persons of ail religious denominations to abstain as far as practicable from secular occupations ad to assemble in their respective places of public worship to acknowledge the infinite goodness which has watched over our existence as a nation and so long crowned us wiih manifold blessings and to implore the almighty in his own goodtime to stay the destroying hand which is now lifted up against us washington julyjj z taylor the following postscript has since been added and as it is further fitting that a contrasting godfeaiing people should know what is the nature of the fast which will be acceptable to the almkhty the following words of an old writer are earnestly recommended to be read with prayer and careful ness behold in the day of your fast you find pleasure and exact all your labors behold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness ye shall not fast as yc do this day to make your voice to be heard on high is it such a fast that i have chosen a day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the lord is not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the ojpressed go free and that ye break every voke is it not to deal thy biead to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house w hen thou seest the naked that thou coveifhnn artd that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh i then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thy health shall spriug forth speedily and fhy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the ixrd shall be thy rere wared then shalt thou call and the lord shall answer thou shall cry and he shall say here i arn if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke the putting forth of the finger and speaking vanity and u thou drawout thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rtae in obscurity and thv darkness be as the noon day and ihe lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought and make fat thy bones and thou shall be like a watered garden and like a spring of water w hose waters fail not and as this nation hare greiouly sinned in that the have held three millions of their brethren in bonds to show that we are sincere in our repentant for this our sin it is also earnestly recommended in accordance with the just views of the writer above that we break every yoke let the oppressed go free and undo the heavy burdens and asj it becomes the chief magistrate of this nation to show such an exunple of repentance i zachary i ayloi will on the day appointed namely the first friday in august release from their bonds cm slaves whom with shame and deep sorrow i confess have held in unlawful and unchristian bondage and in accordance with the promise of heaven that if the wicked shall turn from all his sins that he hath committed and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die i trust and believe that the destroying hand which ia now lifted up against us will be stayed a great inine at brag brave little south carolina noble

the eflect has been whatever the design was to secure to all its members equal rights to rob crush plunder and oppress the negroamerican a large portion of the compact is expressly framed to make such oppression legal and to bind all parties to its inviolable preservation that it has also been rendered an instrument of oppression and a curse to a very large proportion of the inhabitants of the south ir very apparenttor at thus moment upwards ol three millions of the southern population are kept under its deep and intolerable slavery the unton in its purity we would cling to it with filial devotion as now corrupted it is not worth preserving abolitionists have been accused of holding opinions very much in accordance with those of the south carolinians but some of them will be surprised to find so many points of agreement as there are between them the above assertion is most true the union now corrupted is not worth preserving nay more it ought not to be preserved cemented as it is by the blood and tears and agonies of the perishing slave it ought to be shattered it is a most unholy alliance on which the curse of heaven does and must rest take youiselves away say we rake with

both the north and the south in so far as they support the wrong are deserving of i condemnation and as all they can do jointly and separately cannot prevent the final prevalence of justice a slight amendment at the end of this sentiment seems desirable namely instead of so the south is safe say for the right is safe by dr j h morgan resistance to aggressions upon southern rights by the whole

overthrow the slave institutions of this country instead of liberty if we read slavery again how true the assertion is how well southern institutions are adapted to preserve a well regulated slavery every regulation in town and country is made with a view to this paramount object everything else is made subservient to it no difficulty is too greatno danger too terrificno shame too infamous to be encountered by the south for the preservation of her darling slave system and then the universal ruin which must overtake the south if the slavery question be not arrestedoh the keen irony of the speech must have been irresistible f course the orator meant to make an abolition address lie knows that south carolina is becoming depopulated of all but slaveholders and slaves he sees that the few free whites who remain there are gradually sinking into deep ignorance and barbarism he is well aware that the lands throughout the slave states are rapidly losing their fertility and that ere many years of the present improvident mode of culture have passed over they will be utterly exhausted lie hears the voice of the civilised world lifted up against slavery he feels in his own conscience that itis vvtong that the blasting curse of heaven is upon the slave states he can appreciate all this and therefore the speech quoted from clothed in irony it is true but none the less forcible on that account if he did not mean it to be understood thusif he meant it to be understood just as it reads with all its glaring absurdities sticking out of it we can but sav of hirn and his windy

when the oppresold and bondmen of every origin grade and hue under the despotism of the white race shall determine to strike the fatal blow and rend the yoke from every neck a colony of the spanish crown and isolated from the parent country several thousand miles in the cairibeean sea stands the island of tuba it is true that this island stands rather contiguous to and not more than fortyeight hours sail of a good steamer from the american coast but she is also contiguous to and surrounded by the innumerable antilles or other west india island each of which is well peopled w ith descendants of the african and indian race all of whom are save the danish colonies who are partially so in the full enjoyment of equal rights and privileges and in many instances forming the main force strength safety and dependence of these colonies offices of profit trust and honor and the executive chair in many of these colonies are now filled by this class of the inhabitants who of course will form no trivial opposition against the attempt on the part of the oppressors in the united states to lend their aid to the oppressors of cuba the revenue derived by the spanish government from this colony is immense twelve millions of dollars per annum chiefly derived from the commerce in slavesa certain percentage upon the valuation of each victim sold at the barracoons with an additional siun per head for each slave held and worked on the plantations i he slave trade is enhanced in proportion to the efficiency of the viceroy or governor of the island r lo this end he is allowed the extraordinary perquisites in addition to a fixed salary by law besides perhaps other emoluments of ten dollars per head on each slave imported i into the island whether or not such slaves are detained there hence the great policy of making cuba the great western slave depot here it will be observed that on the importation of five hundred slaves the large sum of five thousand dollars are realised by the executive of the island of course the interested party such as the governor and all either directly or indirectly under the patronage of the government will maintain its alliance to spain with unerring tenacity and fidelity and this party may be accounted by far the majority of the whites in cuba from the foregoing it is evident that the government or adhering party must be very strong and it might reasonably be inquired into how the suspicion ever arose or the expression found vent of a desire on the part of any portion of the inhabitants of cuba to annex to the united states the w hole population of cuba is one million two hundred and fifty thousand two fifths of whom are whites and of these there are probably fifty thousand either belonging to or formerly residents of the united states add to this the fact that citizens of the united states hold interests to the amount of forty millions of dollarsthese will at once explain the origin of the annexation party in cuba these fifty thousand americans are the source and origin of all dissatisfaction that has arisen against spain and in flavor of a separation from the parent country though f by far the minority as such and totally unable to accomplish their object yet this american party is sufficiently strong and influential to keep up an effective division and disuhion among the white inhabitants of the islahd and an eternal hostility in sentiment apd feeling toward each other the designed negociation on the part of the united states for the payment of the spanish debt to england in security for which a mortgage on cuba was tobe obtained as proposed by president polk is abandoned us a futile measure from its im practicabilitythe debt of spain to england being ascertained on investigation to be the enormous sum of three hundred and forty millions of dollars the interest of which alone at six per cent would amount to the sum of two millions one hundred thousand dollars a sum so great that the free and free domloving working people of the nonslave bolding states would resist it to the last his there need be no fears but they would oppose because it touches in the right placetlieii intrust it feels in their pockets but for this we should place no reliance on their opposition to the nefarious project but were cuba annexed to the united states knowing us they do that it must be effected for the interest ol slaveholders and that the slave slates art already a burden to the free of course the project will be exposed to an effectual defeat however much the slave party may desire it this is now a settled point at present the project of the annexation of cuba to the i united states must fail though this project fails as it may now be considered a cer taiuty still the strife will continue and tlx dissatisfaction theie increase the captain general as the viceroy it styled is evidently from his great authority the master spirit of the island and consequently from his immense wealth and powei is regarded with an eye of suspicion hatrec and fear and looked upon with more anxiety than the autocrat ol russia by his serfs invested with all the powers of government civil and military he is regarded as mort potent than the ciowned head of spain him sell his personage the tame alike wilt predecessors and successors is so determinec i on gain that not satisfied with the

ucatan the abongina mexicans who arc reduced to abject slavery and tins will explain the sale of the indtaj boy which recently took place in new or leansand the change of trade ard thii t novel article of commerce in human flesl be farther accounted for by the very recent scouring of the esteri coast ol africa by the british and instruction of all th slave factories known m that part of the con nnent with the continuance of an effective squadron iqi that purpose on the coast i is said that there are now six hundred of these asiatic or fongoban slates in the nolle citj of hanna ths number throughout the island is considerable as well as the number of yucatecnea and other indians these mongols and indians like the africans are obtained from their native country by kidnapping and purchase as prisoners of war ilut one fifth of the population being whites the colored inhabitants are seven hundred and fifty thousand strongone fourth or one hundred and eighty seven thousand and five hundred of whom are free colored people the sustenance of the colony and its loyalty to spain are dependant upon the colored subjects and the military the mainstay of the law the protector and defender of the captain general and his authority is composed of this class both bond and iree the slave of cuba has a right unknown to the american slave he has a right to purchase himself whenever he so desires and the slaveholder is obliged to grant him the time whenever he requests it to make the money w ith which to purchase his freedom hence the slave is continually obtaining his freedom and only remains in slavery therein consequence of his ignorance of his right in that respect by law hereout of a population of one million and upwards there are nearly eight hundred thousand of the oppressed nearly two hundred thousand of whom are freethe others a hardy race of natives from the coast of africa asia and centra americamen whose spirit is unsubdued and whose souls have not yet lost the panting aspirations of freedomwhose ma jestic forms and manly necks have not yet yielded to the degrading conditions of slaveryand others of like character still coming by importation this is the material ere long that shall form the unyielding timber in the political machinery of that countrys structure and henceforth become the master spirits of the island we thank god that the asiatic and indian have been brought to share the miseries of the african in cuba it must bea design of heaven let them now make common cause a oneness of interest harmony of sentiment concentration of purpose means mind and talent and concert of action only well devise these and but one stroke of their ponderous arm will lay the island in travail a fearful lamentationa terrible retribution a waits the oppressor at the bands of the outraged colored inhabitants of that misruled colony should it be argued that the w hole force of the white population backed by the military of spain would bo brought against the blacks in the event of a revolution we answer that tins can never prove effectual since an oppoitunity would at once be sought on the pait of the annexationists to take every advantage of the issue and knowing this as the government and loyalists do the spanish crown as has already been expressed by an otgan of that sovereign located in the city of new york for the purpose of sustaining the spanish claims to cuba would rather seethe island fall into the hands of the blacks than annnexed to the united states or in other words that rather than cuba should fall into the bands of the americans the slaves shall be armed and the island laid in destruction and blood this is the determination of spain backed by all the loyalists every officer of whom holding positions in cuba is from the parent conntiy hence their continual watchfulness trustworthiness and fidelity to the home government there is indisputably an irreeoncileable division existing aiming the whites of cuba a breach of earthquake portentionan obstruction as immovable as the limeaged and valleydeep glaciers that fill the vast depths in the mountains of switzerlanda barrier as insurmountable as the loftiest summit of the hammalavahs nor will the authorities dare the attempt to abridge the privileges and rights already provided by law and enjoyed by the oppressed of cubathe experiences of others have taught them a different lesson the emperor napoleon during his mad career alter having decreed the slaves of st homingo and other colonies of france free made the wild and distracted attempt to reduce them back to their former condition but to his utter astonishment and dismay they resisted to the knifethe knife to the death n ith sword in hand they defied the unequalled martial cohorts of france united with spain and directed by the skill of the man ol corsicathe renowned napoleon buonaparte the greatest captain of the age who j whatever ability he possessed as a military chieftain and director of armies certainly betrayed great ignorance of the philosophy of human nature indeed we have always conceivedin the history of this great warrior this to be the most defective trait in his character napoleon received far more credit in this respect than he ever merited there are instances recorded of great sagacity deep penetration and seeming great and unerring knowledge in this respect but it was noi derived from a thorough and searching knowledge of human nature but simply from a knowledge of individuals or classes of indi vidualshaving learned their characteristics national or local traits he could manage foi the tiipe such individuals or classes but rc farther napoleons great power was ic the strength of his military forces and his success in the policy ol eternal vigilance continually on the wingever moving irom place to place ard as frequently changing the form aud policy of his government napoleon was from lime to time consul i director president dictator king emperoi of the french and could not have ruled over any other people or nation and not even over these had it not been for his continual political revolutionsthe changes ol policy in his government napoleon was a soldier but not a civiliana general but not s magistrate power and skill may make a general but it requires talents and ability judgment and decision deliberaton and more than a slight know ledge of human na lure to constitute a good and efficient civil magistrate for the want of this napoleon failed totally failed in his attempt to subdue the blacks of st domingo

at present is in a state of political and civil revolutioncontending for equal privileges and constitutional liberty freedom is heard as the theme of every tongue ljberty is shouted as the watchword of the oppressed of every nation hen poland fell beneath the crushing weight of russian despotism american indignation was aroused to madness when greece dared to brave the power of the turks america

universal jubilee and now calls loudly upon all nations and people to follow these glorious examplesthrow off the yoke strike down the oppressor and defy the powers of despotism in this america is dishonest and hypocritical she does not intend to extend appeals and sympathies to the oppressed millions of colored races throughout the world with three millions of oppressed in her own borders she overlooks entirely these and sees clearly at a distance the oppression of the white race let the colored races look well to their own interestslet them act for themselves this we have determined ever to do tlitee millions of our brethren and kinsmen groan in servitude in the united states of america in bondage and degradation unsurpassed by any that ever disgraced the world and outraged humanity for these there are many moral agents now at work by which means we shall hope and trust for success and by whom we shall ever stand and never yield while the stench of their affliction continues to pollute the air administering to their necessities as far as in out power lies to reach them bv the balm of moral consolation until every fetter shall he riven and every shackle shall be shattered and the bondman of america is made every whit whole but the oppressed of cuba have not this moral consolation at handno moral agencies at work directly for them they must take there cause in their own hands and use the means adequate to the endsthe means within their reach these means they have let them hut remember the masterly and noble reply of henry christophe one of the oppressed ol st domingo who in answer to general le clerc the able captain and brotherinlaw of the emperor napoleon said it is needless to count on numbers or means my determination to be a man and fireman is the sum ot my arithmetic but let them come to this noble determination and conclusion and the colored races of cuba are free slavery must and will fallthe slaveholders doom is irrevocably sealed sealed forever

possibly her i sister for our knowledge of the patriarchal institution leads readily and naturally to that inference while in this situation she married it is lor the profit of the master that early marriages should be a law o custom the union contracted by ellen proved to a a happy one the husband williamslaves have no right to other numes has proved himself to be every w ay w orthy of her by his industry and by turning night into day he contrived to procure enough money to purchase n portion of his time from the man who claimed to own hun it cost william all he had but it procur ed him

ye who love the wife of your affections i thoughts of their condition their hard lot mingled with unavailing regrets without doubt were the principal ones exchanged between them but this condition they were constrained to endure almost joyfully in view of the greater deprivation and sufferings of their fellow slaves privileges like these however were destined to bear their rich harvest thoughts of liberty are never long ab i sent lrom a slave or prisoner hope beckons forever even through sorest ills this was the great subject between ellen and william in the long j lone hours of the night that w ere but ushering in to them another day ol bondage the spirit of liberty visited them not inappropriate to their condition is the exclamation of david jas the hart pantetli after the water brooks so pantetli my soul alter thee o god it is quite certain that they could have escaped from the city in which they were but whither could they flee r without a place without means of support hunted by every slave catcher like the partridge upon the mountains surrounded by enemies j their capture was certain and stripes separation accumulated woes would be their lot these considerations filled theii hearts with sadness but liberty ever bright and fair bid them to hope on for many weeks they thought over j every plan of escape which promised success but could find none j they had heard vaguely of the abo j litionists ofthe north but they had beer represented to them as monsters more to be dreaded than the slavedrivei i himself and their hopes led them nol that way still they would inquire concerning them and one day sutbcieni j was learned to determine their course they would tlec to the abolitionists their star in the east had indeed risen but how could they follow iti

though it be bui the faintest glimmer and that faith which overcomes mountains lifts the into the paradise he would gain flint lamh secures the boon it was decided that ellen sboulc personate an

sure to he discovered at the first glance by an accirate observer hence ellen practiced nightly in her new garb until she had become thoroughly trained but to the dress itself a slave cannot purchase a suit unquestioned as another person may therefore extreme caution became necessaiy else the cherished scheme of months would have been discovered and overthrown then they must die for it hope he dead why seek to live william was the purchaser at various places and different times under numerous pretexts lie bought the required articles the hat was a very high bell crowned or as he stated ita
