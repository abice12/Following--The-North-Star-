popular sins a tree soil sermon for the times by john t sargent woe unto him who buildeth ins houe by unright  eousness and his chambers by wrongjeremiah xxii there was some point certainly to the practical satire of the ancient phi j losopher who is represented as going j about the world with a lantern seeking j for an honest man it implied that the world was so far gone in the darkness of its intrigue that scarcely by torchlight could a strictly upright individual be found it implies that honesty is not a very common or popular virtue and of this our daily experience gives but too plain assurance the denunciation of the prophet in our text is capable of an application however beyond the knavery of individuals in every enlarged or christian view ol the subject the admonition might as well extend to the acts of communities corporations or the country at large for these are but the aggregate of the individual passions the dishonesty of the individual is not the only evil to be considered nor is tie dwellinghouse of the individual the only house that is built by unrighteousness there is perchance here and there the countinghouse the customhouse the gambling house and the house of illfame the meetinghouse the distil h use the statehouse the sen atehouse and the house of repre sentativesall of which might come in for a share of the warning and the woe here pronounced just so far as they may lack the principles of an uprighl morality or an even justice in their acts or their organization the expedition of diogenes it u said was unsuccessful it would probably have been equally so at the present day indeed we have reason tc doubt whether he could have gone far amid the crowd of cheats that infest our land in high places and low places without having his very lantern stolen or his lamp blown out so many are they who love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil southey in his life of wesley does indeed relate rather an extreme case ola conscientious individual who used to buy a pennys worth of parsnips every week and on them and them alone with the water in wliieh they were boiled lived for some time that he might save money enough to pay his debts rare virtue that surely and how many think you are conscientious enough uow to practice such an ascetic selfdenial as living on parsnips fot honestys sake very few i will answer for it and for one such case ol scrupulous integrity which subjects aman almost to the suspicion of insanity i might p int out to you twentyaye twenty thousand of those who are putting aside their obligations withoul any acruple whatever faring sumptuously every day at others expense covering their trauds beneath a false plea of insolvency and interposing every kind of mean pretence betweeu themselves and their creditors the columns of the daily press tecin with accounts of commercial duplicity and peculation you can hardly lake up the papers of a morning but you shall see the startling announcement of some disgraceful forgery or embezzlement the absconding of defaulters and the various conventional etforts to compasi the acquisition of property by dishonest means we almost wonder if a single day passes without tome new illustra the north star tion of this master passion and the worst of it is we are coining to be quite too easily reconciled to it allthe habit has so grown upon us and according to our prevalent social morals no man seems to stand ranch the worse nowadays in the long run for a little consummate knavery in matters ol business no very violent ostracism awaits him on that account he may walk on change as erect as ever so almost universal has become this j one idea that a mans selfipterest in a worldly point of view must be compassed no matter at what sacrifice ol right principle nor is this passion for j selfaggrandizement at whatever cost this reconcilement peculiar as i have said to the individual it lies no less grievously we fear at the heart of communities and nationsnor can i asa christian minister fail to apply my i subject in all its legitimate bearings must and will protest and remonstrate just so far as i may see the code of morals in any community becoming unchristian just so far as i may witness such a prevalent corruption of the national ethics as might lead the nation to build its own power and prosperity by the infringement of others rights seeking by its act to excuse or perpetuate so unchristian a system as that of slavery or aiming to immortalize the demon of war let us not think that because a nation does a great wrong it may therefore escape the righteous judgment ol god oh no there is a woe here as in the case of individualsa woe which eateth as doth a canker to the heart of the nations as to the heart ol individualsthe woe of finding that our progress is downward and degrading just according as we diverge from that which is honest and true the same principles apply to nations as to individuals in this matter of retribution and i will ask whether for the national soul any more than for the individual there is or can be any security short of virtuous principle and deeds of mercy to do justly love mercy and walk humbly is alike the obligation of nations as of individuals the true honor of a people is to be found only in deeds of justice the diffusion of knowledge the culture of peace but how stand we now before the nations and before the worldbranded and upbraided as a band ofpirates usurpers and traitors for so they have called us for the last two years the newspapers have been dripping everyday with the bloody intelligence of ty rannyour armies kneedeep in thered tide of battle thundering with our cannon at all the gates of the mexican cities god knows for what and with our iron heels on the panting breasts of more than three million slavesgod knows how longand so by our duplicate oppressions carrying the stringent hoop of our abominations clear round the body of christ oh i tell you it is a monstrous iniquity and how can we fail to see and deprecate the deeply interesting the inevitable connection between our present action and its ceming consequence the fates are justas one of our own poets has said the fate are just they give us but our own nemesis ripens what our hands have sown for god still overrules mans schemes and takes craftiness in its selfset snare and makes i the wrath of man to praise him j in the annals of nations we have seen how rome in her grasping career of conquest carried her triumphal car laden with the trophies of all climes clear round the globe and then fell at last crushed beneath her own chariot wheels how corinth was smothered beneath the weight of her luxuries how carthage came to be the prey ol suicidal factions and by what reversion of law can we hope for exemption from the same tragical end if we go the same tragical way believing as i do in the necessity of a loftier christian morality in society holding as i do the doctrine that never safely can justice and right be compromised or separated from the national any more than the individual soul i cannot withhold the expression of my concern in this crisis i believe a faithful and dispassionate analysis of our present moral j condition as a people will reveal to us the fact that we are in moral jeopardy that we have in our midst and all j around us certain elements of disorder which will tarnish what little glory weever had and take the jewels all out ol our crown prominent among these evilslying at the root of all the rest perhaps is that insatiable spirit of avarice which gnaws greedily into the very heart of the land what else is il which winds in serpent folds around the body of the poor african slave tt wrench a dollar more or less out of hit miserable toilworn flesh what is il but this that goes about roaring like e j lion seeking after his prey crouching in every covert of speculation anc j thence springing out with hungry fang r upon every passing opportunity foi i gam what is it but this that weave like a spider the subtle toil and the shining web of a dishonest purpose sitting within the secrecy of dark schemes for lucres sake concentrating the venom of knavery and still reconstructing with such endless patience and perseverance the broken threads othe unsuccessful snare what bu this is it whether in the ambitious ant greedy enterprises of a nation or the financial intrigues o an individual a the brokers beard which seeks to joii house to house and land to land se realizing the woe which is threatenee  upon all such monopoly one of thegyuncholy and momen tons symptom the days disease i the absorption of men the majority omen in the mere outward and selfish the material and the perishing lhi j constraint of tha soul with anxious con right is of no sextruth is of no color god is the father of rs all and all we are brethren si deration and toil from morning tonight aye and all through the night a to what are ahall eat and what we shah drink and wherewithal we shall ix i clothed out of this laboring for anc love of the outward there is every day growing an endless and turbulent com i petition a jostling of separate and personal interests invidious discords and collisions the abrasion of oar finet  sympathies and a fierce warring of all j the elements of society manifest in al the relations of business politics religion and social life e see this more especially in the common struggle for office among us a struggle which too often gives occasion to the lowest pas j sions and the meanest principles because founded upon the meanest mo i tires i mean the love of power and the love of place and the emolument of place and power merely for theii own sake without regard for any majesty of principle by which the duties othe place are to be discharged what is called the morals of trade and politics is a mere riddle to a majority oi those engaged in themthrown aside as a superfluity most men would laugh in your face if you were to talk to them about discharging the duties o their offige trade or position religiously morally hence as the emoluments of office are the main thing inmost cases we see all sorts of places scrambled for by all sorts of people in all sorts of ways hence the want oi harmony and composure we see iu the great forces which are agitating and upheaving society they are not controlled by any spirit of unity or assimilation jarring discontent and unrest must of course be the result where the spirit of society and the spirit of christianity are at issue when the angels of heaven and the demons of earth come thus to their wrestling and the last grappling though the issue may be more or less delayed it cannot be a doubtful one the spirit of righteousness must triumph and clash as we may with our scimetars of worldliness against the sword of the spirit we shall come off sooner or later prostrate fatigued and with the fragments of only broken blades in our grasp some future time will reveal the consequences of that fatal struggle and ol that resistance we now offer to the right aud though the end is not yet we may see it in the light of experience as if it were in the providence of god for a little while the unrighteous may seem to prevail while the cause of truth and the companies of the innocent are hindered or borne down by oppression but wait gods time and watch his workings and you shall see the tide of battle turning gloriously under his majestic leading while the injured are uplifting again their broken or falling standards god never yet suffered the righteous and truehearted to be forsaken or perish utterly and though such may often seem to be their fate smothered beneath a load of injustice yet sooner or later god himself will arise in the majesty of infallible judgment to redeem and to rescue iniquity may indeed triumph today but be assured itis only for today and its retribution will come rolling in like a thunderstorm tomorrow here for example is this iniquitous and mortifying war in which for nearly two years we have been engaged j victory upon victory it is true has followed the aggressive course of our arms triumphal issues without a parallel have attended the whole progress of oih misguided troops our flag of stripesfit emblem of the spirit of that people which it representswaves proudly over castles and fortresses until now deemed impregnable the jewelled furniture of mexican palaces and the golden crosses of their cathedrals are now mere playthings in the hands of our deluded soldiery success as they call it has perched so uniformly on our standard that we have come almost to believe in our folly and infuriation that the lord is on our side in this matter as if the lord could be on such a side we have thrown the lasso of our cupidity clear round the glittering prize but who is so blind as not to see that sooner or later in gods own time our day ol reckoning is approaching to the eye of our obscured conscience it may seem very distant or invisible or perchance no more threatening than the little cloud no bigger than a mans hand which elijahs servant saw in the horizon from the summit of mount carmel but if god is just and there is any truth in the doctrine of cause and effect it will come towering up and over us with the lightning bolt in its bosom and develop for us even as did that little cloud all the blackness and terrors ola great exterminating tempest with less than the vision of a prophet i can see something of the forthcoming melancholy harvest of this war to say nothing of the national debt which it entails the weight of which with all our cowardly fears of money pressure we have scarcely as yet be i gun to realize i see other woes ia the prospect behind its dark funeral pall the troubles which are coming out oi it today the immediate trials the fatigue the expense the loss of life th bereavements the mothers and widows tears these poor leturning crippled soldiers and their bloody rags annot all nor the worst the most lame stable of all the consequences growing out of it is the degradation of ou moral sense the depreciation of ou standard of right as another has said the people are demoralized wit boo i knowing it their standard of char rjacter sinks the moral tone of thei j discourse becomes lees firm and true i their principles grow lai and conveo jtiimal the effect is but the more de rochester n y friday november  i plorable that it is insidious men slide off from the position which they once held and with an accelerated speed tend to that place of morality on which the opinions and practices of the world attempt to meet the commandments ol godnot however by changing their own character a as to harmonize with those commandments but by interpreting the revelations of duty which are given through conscience and through christ according to the maxim of expediency license ot equivocation and compromise this is the moat dial astrous blight which war cun ever cast upon a land a blight upon the inoral perceptions and sensibilities of a people worse than defeat in arms worse than commercial embarrassment worse than poverty wowe even than political servitude for a nation would better remain faithful to god though it lose its civil liberties than retain its political institutions at the expense of its loyalty to the divine principle of rectitude better lose anything than lose character it is as true of a nation as of an individual power prosperity liberty is nothing without virtue w henthere fore we see a country deteriorating in character beneath the infliction of war we are justified in saying that the greatest curse which even this demon evil can shed upou it has taken effect i go on to say that we shall not belong in learning that anguish and wailing and disappointment are in reserve for us out of this conflict the territory which we have wickedly won seems already bristling with dragons teeth briars and thorns will grow out of the soil which our brothers have moistened with their own blood or the blood of their brethren all the nation will have gained there will be a graveyard where the serpert shall hiss and the wildbird shall scream the banners we have borne along through strife over that bleeding and desolate land will be as it were the windingsheets of our warriors and the eagle which surmounts them seems even now changed into a vulture to prey only on their hearts and after all what more or less than this can we expect if to irresponsible careless or impulsive men we delegate scr responsible a power as that of making war let me say further touching the motives of the people as to the chief office within their gift it is by no means an auspicious omen which of late years has been presented the disposition of the people to select for that station military chieftains and chiefly because of their military prowess their having won a battle more or lessthus making the office little better than a gladiatorial prize we may possibly find we are doing this thing once too often the principle is every way an objectionable one we may well question the expediency of elevating any mere warriors of the time those pagod tilings of sabre sway with fronts of braes and leet ol cay as another has well called them for in all probability their feet of clay will not support them squarely on their pedestal while their front of brass may come tumbling ruinously down upon our own fronts the scripture saith something as to the probable consequence of casting our pearls before swine they may trample them under feet while they turn again ard rend us and so in the history of past republics governed and grieved so b their tavorite military chiefs who turned at last and trampled on the very people by whom they were raised into power we may probably read a lesson of caution it is not alla fable how the idols so elevated with their fronts of bass have become all brass and towered up into a monstrous and overwhelming tyranny it is not all a fable that some of those rulers who begin by fighting for the dear people have ended by fighting against them the story of their blasting and bloodthirsty ambition is long euough and sad enough without our adding another volume or chapter to the tale it needs no supplement to be drawn from our experience let it have nonesuch let us rather seek it it be noti too late to prove ourselves an excep i tion to the general history of republics in their decline and fall happy for us will it be if there is nothing in our present tendencies giving indicalion ol our positive decline it may be that the mountain of our prosperity staudetfa strong as some deluded men are apt tu think how can it be so resting as it does on the scarred backs ot our enslaved fellowcreatures is past my comprehension to understand the caution is ever timely and quite as applicable to nations as to individuals i let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall though we have planted our cloven feet and bloody fla on the top of the cordilleras it u byno means so certain that we can keep our balance there pride cometh before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall and the fall i the inevitable consequence of the i haughty spirit then verily we are fai i gone out of our upright position for weare haughty enough heaven knows if we were not how in conscience could we stand before the world sc long trampling on the right ot tbi teak and ue enslaved when other na too have emancipated theirs of i truth our position betore god and tut j universe is shameful in the extreme why even the poor mexican genera pota to shame our boasted cbrntianitj i and civilisation by the very script j which be places at the

beves it could onlj be thisinstead of god and libertv the devil and slavery are those our gods is that our motto heaven forbid aud yet how car we escape the imputation of this hateful idolatry so long as we compromise jpo with these notorious wrongs slavery oh how shall i speak ot it you have had so many expositions of it evils from this pulpit that any details of that wrong by me may seem super fluous i will only say of that as satan ii the father of sin so slavery is the parent of all our social troubles the fruitful mother of all abominations the darkest shadow of all in the gloomy procession of proof that this nation is ungenerous and oppressive i say the darkest shadow of all is slavery because this lays the iron grasp of its withering hand not only upon the outward man his actions and liberty and limbs but on the inward spirit of its victims defrauds them of all intellectual and spiritual force wipes out almost the inscriptions of almighty god upon their souls and scribbles in their place the base ideas of brute force under hopeless inequalities it tramples on the mounting fires of the slaves intellect denies and damns the inspiration of god therein vetoes the magnanimous declaration which says all men are crented free and equal and flings contempt upon the collateral sentiment that life liberty and the pursuit ol happiness are the inalicnble rights ol all  know it is common for the south in vindication or palliation of that atro  ciou system of theirs to saypointing i to the north and to the depressed condition as they think it of our laboring classes physician heal thyself and it may as well be confessed we deserve the rebuke just so far as the poor among us are overlooked or forgotten just so far as an unrighteous monopoly or extortion or social exclusion crowds them out of our sympa thiesjust so far as they are oppressed or constrained by insufficient wages for their workjust so lar as by any selfish or unjust habits of trade they are brought low or made miserable do you say there are no such habits not ito mention others i will ask what means this wicked traffic in ardeut spirits still continued here at the north and so akin to slavery at the south by which so many are building their house i by unrighteousness and by which j countless multitudes all over the land are hurled down to wretchedness everyday will you call this justthis j to steep the brains of our fellowcrea tur s in liquid fire to strike them blind and take away their intellects and paralyze their immortal powers and physical strength only that we may steal their purses the more subtly and the more surely this justto cast the cloud of death over reason to stultify the judgment and then when our poori brother is reeling and sick and ready to fall in the pit to rob his mourning family of their last poor mouldering j crust oh is it just this to pour out upon the land so the whirlwinds of our iniquity aud selfishness those torrents of our torment while thousands of the widowed and fatherless are sending up their ceaseless and sharp wail from its oeep and yawning depths oh is it just ah friends there is a debt written against this nation such as i fear can be cancelled only by blood and tears ati the lasta debt written out upon the i anguishriven souls of the enslaveda debt recorded as by a pen of iron upon the spirits of the oppresseda debt such as the slaveholder will poorly pay when lie has filed off the iron chain from the africans wrist a debt which the rutnsellcr must answer for in the sight of god when he can as he can if he can in behalf of the poor drunkard who entered his grave through the oils of that traffic the score is along one and a black one but it must it must be wiped out as we hope for mercy or peace we owe to this land then let me sav to every individual in this land the blessed boon of liberty the love ol which god stamps on every soul as its prerogative and if we do not give it then i say the land is doomed yes doomed sooner or later to wear the very fetters which it forges we owe tc this land temperance and peace universal peace and universal temperance and so long as drunkenness throws the wide oershadowing curse of our degradation or ingratitude up to the heavens and so long as slavery belies and contradicts the liberty of which wc boast and so foeg as war makes havoc of all our comforts and goodly affections so roust there be for us only weeping and wailing and woes the more to be realized the further we ad vance if one act of charity coaid but covet and cancel a multitude of sms

disturbance in our city yesterday after the appearance of a succession of inflammatory articles in the liberator highly insulting to the feelings of a great majority of our fellowcitizens attacking

antislavery society would bold a meeting that afternoon when it would be addressed by several gentlemen in consequence of this notice and of the general suspicion that the notorious thompson would be present on the occasion a large assemblage ot citizens collected in froot of the building no washington street with the determination ol intercepting the foreign felon as he entered the door soon

why the wild beast and the reptile will hy from its enemy or escape if it can from its torturer will not man do as much has he loss feeling of wrongless love of liberty when his nature is reversed and

negroes are deemed offitnsive because they are not permitted to emigrate to or remain in the state they are allowed few privileges and subjected to heavy penalties for offences they are required to leave the state m thirty days after notice and in the mean time give security for good behavior and those of them who can law fully remain must register and carry with them their certificates or they may tie commuted to jail it would also violate a positive law passed by the legislature expiessly to maintain this settled policy and to prevent emancipation no owner can emancipate his slave but by m deed or will properly attested or acknowledged in court and on proof to the legislature that such slave has performed some meritorious act for the benefit of his master or some distinguished service for tho state and the deed or w ill can have no validity until ratified by the special act of the legisla lure the state of the case shows conclusively that the contract had its origin m an offence

the th oi october have spoken once in sptingficld once in lynn thiee tiroes in new bedford once in abington once in plymouth and attended the annual meeting of the rhod island state antislavery society i havi also had appointments sent on to several othe places but in consjuence of the great political excitement occupying the public mind and the monopoly of public halls by the political parties and the churches being closet against the subject of slavery i have failet to get meetings and have therefore had th pain of travelling without accomplishing much except in a private way it is absolutely impossible to interest the public mind with anything else than politics during a presidents campaign like that which has now teiminated it is one of the saddest things connected witl our institutions and national character tha we are so prone to magnify politics to th exclusion of everything of a moral and intellectual nature during a political canvass and that so much precious time is consumer in these unprofitable struggles admitting that it is necessary to agitate the public mint and enlighten the people as to the charactei of the men and measures presented for theii support it cannot be claimed that more that onetenth of the time usually employed foi that purpose is necessary the charactei and tosiiions of men and parties are generally as well understood two months after theii nominations as after six months of fierce debate and agitatiou fireworks burning powder discharging cannon torchligbt processions illuminations c appeal only to feelings and have nothing whatever to do witl bringing men to an intelligent opiniou on the questions involved in an election like the ont just passed yet what an important and precious amount of time of money of health to say nothing of morals have been saeri ficed to such dumb show and senseless display during the last few months these demonstrations would be less deplorable were they not attended with loss of life as w ell ashealtii and morals the eight men killed on the salem and marblehead railroad might now have been living a blessing to themselves families and fiiends but for being led away from their homes to attend one of those torchlight processions the newspapers teem with accounts of fights rencontres wounds and deaths growing out of these disgraceful displays in which pride and passion usurp the place of reason these we take to be their legitimate fruit to put an end to these scenes every lover of order ought to lend his aid it is an insult to die understandings of intelligent men to have such paltry and senseless appeals made to their feelings as were resorted u during the cauvaas but to the meetiugs that in springfield was called to hear an address from rev mr conklin on the singular subject of bible free soil the meeting was on sunday evening in the town hall rev mr church was in the chair the evening was dark and rainy but nevertheless a large meeting assembled as soon as the reverend gentleman learned that i u in the house be waived hu contemplated lecture on bible free soil for tbe purpose of allowing me to occupy the evening with such remarks as i might deem proper to make it wan awkward position to be placed in bm neither himself nor the audience would help me oat of the difficulty and i was tberafore rdoc untiy compelled ta take the stand end to oe jtosml

place much lew been invited to uke ok place of a popular clergyman when a meeting wan called especially for him the meeting passed off with good effectmany hearing radical antislavery doctrines advocated for um first time in tbeir lives and weald not bav beard at this time but that they had been teacher to bear discussed the unique object of bible free soil anything labeled with the bible good or bad seems to take well with the religious portion of tke public and this is especially the case with the people of springfield found lynn as usual in noth times wrapt in excitement oo the subject of free soil and like all other towns vrbeie much antislavery effort has been expended a large free soil vote was east leading both the old parties while here i had an opportunity ol heanng a few remarks from that once great but now fallen man daniel webster he was in lynn for the purpose of gaining the votes of the freemen of that city fur the slaveholder zachary taylor mr websters appearance made me sad in gating upon hun forgot his words in the contemplation ol himself a thunder sheered column stood before me there was just enough of the fim chiseling left to proclaim the wonderful skill of the artist but what a wreck what a magnificent ruin the outline of his formei greatness might be traced over the vast area of his brow while through the windows ol his soul might be seen large masses of his giant power fast mouldering to decay he has arrayed himself against god and ie broken he has trifled with his moral sense and destroyed his conscience once he was the seivant of freedomnow he is the servant of slavery his words go one road while his convictions go another and as a house divided against itself must fall so daniel websier has fallen his greatest service to mankind will be found in the loud warning which his ruin proclaims as liable to all who follow his dangerous example his case shows that intellect however strongthat genius however exalted that friends however numerousthat wealth however abundant can never fill up the chasm of a want of fixed moral principle my meetings in new bedford like all anti slaveiy meetings which it has been my privilege to attend in that place were very satisfactory there is something in old associations that always refreshes and cheers me when i stand in the midst of that community where not ten years ago i stood a stranger newly from slavery i never so fully realize the difference of my position now from what it was then as when i stand in the midst of anew bedford assembly what i was and am is known to them there are no doubts in the minds of my hearers with respect to myself to be removed they know me and hear me as a competent witness against the whole system of slavexy and all its abettors i was assisted in my meetings in new bedford by charles lenox romond a man who never fails to command the sympathy and attention of an audience in that place i missed one face from the meetings which detracted somewhat from the happiness with i usually look upon an antislavery audience there it was tnc face of that veteran laborer and faithful pioneer in the cause john haily he has moved from new bedford to lynn his house wa formerly the home of all those who devote themselves to the work of awakening the public mind to the sin of slavery what mr baily was in new bedford that be will be in lynnan untiring enemy of slavery and a friend to all who lajtor in freedoms cause the colored voters in new bedford almost to a man voted the free soil ticket and i believe the same was thb case in all parts of massachusetts but such was far from being the case in rhode island the colored voters i in providcuce almost unanimously supported the taylor ticket i should be ashamed to state this disgraceful fact without at the same time explaining some of the circumstances by which it was brought about the democtatic party in rhode island is known as the free suffrage party the party which six years ago adopted a constitution restricting the right to vote to white persons alone and excluding colored citizens from the exercise of that right this base insult offered to the colored people by these loud pretenders to liberty is freshly remembered fortunately the whig party then known as the law and order party defeated this infamous constitution and ui drafting another whether from principle or not left out of it the mean color condition of suffrage this circumstance has eiven the whigs almost complete control of the colored voters so that if the whigs should nominate satan himself they might calculate upon a large dark vote in rhode island i extract the following froma long address by the whigs to the colored voters of the state and the reader will easily see the effect such an appeal would belikely to produce on the minds of men circumstanced as the colored people are in rhode island now we say to the colored peope of rhode island and they will believe us for we have never deceived them and the only party of freedom is the whig party that the only way in which they can make their votes count for freedom in this election is to vole for the whig electors for william sprague george g king james t rhodes sad rouse babcock you know these men and yon know the party to which they belong and to which you belong the party which opposed the annexation of texas which opposed the acquisition of mexican territory which now opposes the extension of slavery over that territorythe party too which extended to you the right of suffrage and gave you a voice in the

should be glad to giro bis remarks in fall mix reply to them at length did time mid spot permit bat m the circumstances can onlj glance at the subject he commenced bt stating hie high regard for the slave end bit deep interest in the antislavery movement hot strangely enough went on in an effort t show that wages slavery is bad as chatte aiavervi and that if the slates were emand paled they would soon be as badly off as tlx paupers of ireland he recommended at enlargement of our objects as a means u bringing into our ranks the white working people and stated as a reason why they die not care anything about the anitslaven movement that they saw the abolitionist taking an interest in the cause of the black wujp they neglected and opp nwetmfe white lawrer these and many other views of th same stamp were put forth by the speaker it was difficult to think the speaker honest yet be seemed to be perfectly so he ap peered to be full of his cause and to give l his best energies so far so good then was however ooe great falsehood running through the whole speech which even th dullest could not fail to perceive the attempts to place holding property it the soilon the same footing as holding property in man was most lame and impotent and the wonder is that any one could listeu with patience to such arrant nonsense thailand monopoly is a great evil there is no ques tionbat to speak of it in the same age with chattle slavery is to lose sight of all the moral distinctions most obvious to common sensei would be ashamed to argue with a person such a questionbut that i believe there are soraegood men who honestly believe it to own the soil is no harm in itself it was given to man it is right that he should own it it is his duty to possess itand to possess it in that way in which its energies and properties can be made the most useful to the human familynow and always there is therefore no wrong in the fact of holding property in the soil itself and the question raised must therefore relate to the mode of holding and the amount heldand not to the act of holding the question then is as to the manner and the amount with respect to these various opinions may be honestly entertained what manner of holding property in the soil is the best which best secures the happiness of the whole human family the land reformers have one viewbut other men have views directly oppositeand as honestly entertained it is not therefore for either to denounce the other as criminals the question is one of expediencyabout which it is easy to err not so with slavery it is to sin against self evident truth to enslave a fellow man but i must hasten the meeting was addressed by mr buffum mr bradbum and myself and adjourned to meet on friday morning at ten oclock during the day and evening of fridaythe discussion was mainly on the proslavery position of the church anti the constitutional support given to slavery on the latter subject there was a long discussion mr brad burn contended that the constitution was an antislavery instrumentand made a long and ingenioys argument in support of his view which would have proved as conclusively that there is now no slavery in americaas it proved that there is no slavery in the constitution slavery is wrong and therefore is not in the constitution seemed to be the upshot of his reasoning he set out by laying down certain rules of interpretationwhich would i apply very well to the constitution of the united statesif there was any honest doubt as to its true intent and meaningthings which ido not hesitate to deny one of these rules is that any law susceptible of two interpreta tionsand about the meaning of which there is doubt that such law shall in all cases be construed favorably to justice this cannot apply to the constitution of the united states for no one is in doubt as to the true intent and meaning of that instrumentand it is therefore idle to talk about such rules we know the men who made the constitution we have their wordsas to what they meant by what are now called compromises of the constitution and to wrest them from their true intent and obvious meaninga forced process iis a most unfair mode of dealing with the slaveholder we had better own that the compact is a slaveholding one and declare i that we will abandon it but enough of this for the present ivc shall probably have a regular report

be bedimmed and clouded by the murky nuasma of vitiating influences it baa been often asserted that the free people of the south are ignorant we see auch assertions in newspapers every day it is rarely attempted to deny the fact it is indeed too palpable to admit of denial were it necessary nothing would be easier than to produce proof strong and incontrovertible one such illustration may be given just to show that those who say that the south i ignorant do not speak at random a cotre spondent of the concord n h democrat writing from georgia says in one county in georgia i was told by the

misrule to show itself in any oi those countries the righteous denunciations ol indignant republicans would be heard ringing throughout the land from maine to texas but it is not in any of those countries no in none of them would twelve men be summoned to sit on a jury nine of whom could not write their names it is reserved for enlightened america the model republic in tin nineteenth century

theie is no enemy to tyranny and oppression like inte ligence make a people moral and enlightened and you drive slavery iu all the modes of its manifestation from among them intelligent ami moral men cannot be made slaves themselves and as little do they wish to enslave others tin desire for power which has been said to be inherent in man is after all the impulse of uneducated and untrained minds it is a brute force in disguise it does not in the least affect the ability to possess power whether he who aims at it be enlightened or ig norantrefined or brutalmoral or vicious the more ignorant and brutal he who hold power is the more offensive and despotic i he in its exercise there is one kind of power which the intelligent man must and will possess and it is well that he ahonid possess it by a law of our being we are constrained to admire and to endeavor to imitate those whare superior to us this is a kind of moral magnetism by which the superior mind act upon and brings inferior miuds to its sway it is a kingcraft which there is no gainsay in no opposing all other kings beside those who rule in this way are usurpers their power is spurious it is not obtaine from m right source and there is no patent of nobility but this those who claim to b noblemen coder any other patent are men swindlers they have obtained their title deed by forgery it is not signed with th royal signature

end is the constrained confession of an enemy he is not liable tobe misled by the blinding partiality of attachment or prevented jy an unwillingness to give offence from speaking the true sentiments of his inind particularly gratifyingthen to colored men must be the following extract from the mobile tribune it is the involuntary confession of one who is far from having any partiality for the coloted race he will yet see greater things than these recently the colored people of the free states held a national convention at cleveland ohio they drew up and published an address to their brethren in those states which is rather remarkable for the exhibition of a great deal of earnestness and considerable ability to show what plans these men have to elevate themselves in the social scale we extract below a portion of the address the immediate tendency of these sentiments will inevitably be to array against the conventionists the white industrial population of the free states the colored people have made rapid strides in some respects at the noith and as we hold that the two races cannot exist together on anything like equal terms the result of their progress will be to array the stronger side against them and we may have such scenes at the north as the abolitionists in their fury are trying to stimulate at the south this editor however evidences a lamentable ignorance or misapprehension of the effect of education and of the state of society in the north an intelligent and moral man let his color be what it may cannot fail to command the respect and esteem of his fellow citizens it is not so much the prevalence of prejudicethough that also is sufficiently ram pantas the cowardly necessity which the majority of northern men imagine they are under to act fashionably and to hold fashionable sentiments the one is equally mean and irrational with the otheror rather of the two the latter reason is the meanest and most irrational he is a mean and ignorant man whose prejudice prevents him from discovering what right is but more mean and dastardly is he who knowing the right is deterred by the fear of getting into a minority from carrying it into practice the patagraph above quoted gives an illustration of the sort of bugbears of which the south either is or preteods to be afraid what a terrible picture of blood slaughter and fury presents itself to the vivid imaginations of these negrohaters how do they shudder and shrink at the bare possibility oi the two races existing together on equal terms a false education has filled their minds with the idea that the colored man is not a man or at least that he ia a man of inferior order puv it is that these boasters of their supeiiot intellects and supeiior race cannot now have an opportunity of conversing with their very intelligent and refined ancestors who a few hundred years since painted their skins to keep them warm for lack of abetter covering wonder if their ideas of propriety w ould permit of their claiming kin died with thoee piebald gentlemen wbat the scenes are that this timid writer imagines that the abolitionists in their fury are trying to stimulate at the south it ia rather difficult to imagine is it then such a very fearful and crying evil to teaeh men that they sat men to tell thrm that they belong to themselves and are the property of oo one elseto instruct them that labor has rights ard that every man who labors should be paid for hi kor are these very devilish or does the idea of all meo doing justly and loving mercy present such a horrible picture for contemplation ob the misery and madness of a perverted intellect could such writers see the appalling picture presented by southern slaveholding atrocity through an nnjaundieed medium they

l concern the charge to be founded i shall confine roj romarka exclusively to what has been aaid re pccting st thomas church in the attempt to show that church to b hostile it ha been affirmed in the meet unqualified terms that its doors arc bam against the cause of the slave and to iti pulpit are welcomed episcopalian slaveholder and slavery defenders this truly is avery grave charge it places the church in the attitude of ori hostility against the caused freedomshe is not even allowed the consolatory plea of neutrality but is represented a performing her servile task with all that fidelity and leal that characterises the pampered mental not content with boluog bui must see to it that her doors are also barret against the cause of the slave while on the other hand episcopal slaveholders and slavery defenders are with the most profound obsequiousness welcomed to hei pulpit now assertions like these ought not to have been made without being accompanied with something to support them but they have been made w ithout the least shadow of proof which we moot peremptorily demand these assertions are in perfect keeping with the general charge itself which is founded on assumption it is assumed in the first place that the p e church in the united states is hostile to the antislavery movement and that st thomas church is connected with her in that hostility hence i the illegitimate conclusion that st thomas church is hostile but has it been shown that the episcopal church either in her general or diocesan conventions has ever declared herself hostile to antislavery thi must be done first and afier that is done the particular link must be pointed out which holds st thomas church in the same hostile position all this must be shown before anything like a sirong case can be made out we shall wait patiently until an attempt ni this kind is witnessed it cannot be expected of us to disprove mere assertions in candor we must nevertheless acknowledge thai in the endeavor to expose our superstitious notions concerning the church and the absurdity of excluding irorn the pulpit all except regularly ordained ministers we think something of the form if we do not feel the force of argument and it may not be amiss j to pay due respect to it colored episcopalians as well as while ones excuse themselves for not opening their churches to antislavery meetings on the gtound that those churches are dedicated to the worship of god and that it would therefore be using the house improperly to throw it open for such purposes this is pronounced a superstitious doctriue and to prove beyond all doubt iflwt it is a superstitious doctrine we are told that the jew ish religion sanctified times and places and set them apart for certain forms and ceremonies christ found them ail in existence and left them destroyed quite anew discovery but i beg leave with due deference to submit the following queries was not the feast of pentecost one of the sanctified times and did not the temple at jerusalem occupy one of the sanctified places furthermore did not christ ten days after his ascension send down the holy ghost upon the apostles and brethren on that very day while they were all with one accord in one place how then does this historical fact agree with the assertion that christ found them all in existence and left them destroyed lit clearly appears that we have in this instance at least one of the sanctified times ot the jewish religion impressively marked by the divine author of christianity himself for it must be borne in mind that the petne cost alluded to happened to be on the first day of the week the lords day commonly called sunday having taken a view of the awful wreck and widespread desolation of the sanctifiec times and places that christ left i shall pursue my course in search of additional light on superstitious doctrines to show that consecrated churches were never contemplated by christ in the new dispensation which he established we are referred to the interesting conversation that took place between our lord and the woman of samaria one design which the lord evidently had in that conversation was to put to rest the question that existed between the jews anj samaritans at that time respecting the placx where worship should be paid whether at jerusalem or on mount genzzim the jews held to the former while the samaritans held to the latter place the saviour predicting the general spread of his religion when churches would be established in every quarter of the world and not confined as then to a particular place he said to her the houi cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in jerusalem worship the father god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth we arc told that the idea of temple worship is here clearly disclaimed this paragraph is aomew hat ambiguous lamat a loss which of two meanings to attach to it whether the worship of a church or the worship of god in a church be thee idea clearly disclaimed wc are not here informed w e have the precise meaning perhape in the following sentence the house which god requires is a spiritual one that is an invisible one his we are to understand was the sura oi our lord s leaching to the woman of samaria touching the jnt under consid matron the idea of dedicating churches to the worship of god is entirely scouted he designed no other than spiritual houses while say noting aga spiritual bouses i msy in behalf of visible ones ask how the conduct of the apostles is to be accounted fot in establishing churches in asia africa and europe were their minds enveloped in the darkness oi superstitious error with regard to the instructions of their master on this point t and if they mistook bis meaning t it not passing strange that this error was not rectified by our lord when lie appeared in vision half century afterwards to the venerable aposde john oo the iw of psubo bai fcr ll u firm rectifying the he coo finned the eocelied laptraiifioai actios ky uncling john m write not to the ievu ma but to the vwbla aagek of tin atvao ehurelaa w al h after film tin of wch high authority c shall surely be penloeed if we cootiooe to held to the so called superstitious notions of fcfatif churches to the worship of godill that has been said to the euetrary not withstood mg for we cannot but think that the holy apostles understood the iniruction of the savioor on this point a little better than those who would break our heads for being to shamefully de juded btf perhaps the greet superstition complained of lies not in the dedication of a church to god butm considering it too holy to plead the cause of injured man therein now i readily grant that if it were so considered it would indeed he superstition blind but deny that it is so the supposition that it is so considered could never be derived from a consideration jpf the form of consecration itself nor from the avowed sentiments of those who realise the sacred ness of the obligation imposed upon them by the act that do not consider the church too holy to plead the cause of injured man thereto is clearly admitted by my animadvertist when he refers to a canon of the church which prohibits all except ordained ministers from occupying the pulpit it is admitted here that ordained ministers may plead the cause of injured man in the church and not thereby be considered as using the house of god im properly this weak point being discovered and no other resource being at band to defend ita desperate attempt is made to fortify it by ridiculing the idea of ordination in the following witticism the devil in holy orders would be received while christ unordained would be rejected to hold up the ludicrous picture of the devil in holy orders before the minds of the frivolous might be quite conclusive from this summary processi such a one might be laughed into a full conviction that ordination is the grossest absurdity that can bo conceived of but the reflecting know how to appreciate an argument like the above they know that no just conclusion can be reached by supposing impossible events the above argument stripped of its extravagant dress of wit would amount to this abad man in holy orders would be received while a good man unordained would be rejected how conclusive against the idea ot ordaining any set of men with exclusive authority to minister in holy things wth the aid of his salanic majesty in holy orders ordained ministers are driven to the winds with one omnipotent sweep the bolts and bars of churches are now spiritualized their doors now opened as by magic at the stately approach of the unordained whoof course must be good because they are unordained the tables are completely turned should the man christ jesus whom god the father hath ordained make his appearance he must be rejected because heis ordained this is the new order of things that must be understood to prevent the devil in holy orders from occupying the pulpit and here i would say that while st thomas church acknowledges no bolts and aars against the cause of the slave while ihe does not consider her sacred edifice too loly to plead therein the cause of injured uan it is fortunate for her that she has a anon to guard against the erroneous notions that have passed in review before us the promulgation of which can have no other thanan injurious effect upon the young and thoughtless if the rising generation are to be taught that such passages of scripture as the following reverence my sanctuary holiness becometh thy house forever my house is the house of prayerif they are to be taught that such passages are all obsolete of no force whatever except in a spiritual senseif they are to be told that the idea of consecrated times and places is superstitious that we need meetinghouses notchurches lor there is a wide distinction between a meetinghouse and a church that an ordained ministry is only a form of human invention if these notions are henceforth to form the basis of their future practice then we instinctively recoil from the moral ruin desolation and misery that will thereby be the inevitable result to describe here would be vain to attempta limner is required that can trace bis lines with die from perditions gulf i drop the pen leaving the doleful scene to be sketched out in the horror stricken imagination of your numerous readers yours as ever for the elevation of our people w d nov sirs the history of the following production is simply this the principrl of a popular and flourishing academy in a small country town in new england desired a class of young girls to each produce an essay upon some distinguished man in massachusetts the writer of the following a young girl of my acquaintance innocently supposed that an essay upon the character of william lloyd garrison would be just what her teacher had requested she was however soor convinced of her mistake by the fact that be examined and corrected all the compositions for the rest of the class while he kept hers two or three days snd then returned it to her saying that he had not had time to inspect it and although previous to this he had been anxious for her to write s composition every week he then told her she might be excused from writing again during the term it was written about three years ago but being accidentally mislaid i was unable to get a copy of it until recently i for its publication in the north star not only because i wish to encourage the young writers of such essays who have had their productions slighted snd spurned but because i wish also to expose the contemptible meanness of that servile tool of a proslavery public opinion who oecupied the place of a teacher isaac c

drinking of the cup of prosperity and dwelling in the sunshine of earthly fame but he chose reproach and ridicule rather than be false to the convictioos of his heart i do not say that there are no

but it is much to be regretted that a man of such talents and such purity of purpose should allow himself to be carried away by a cause which cannot possibly be productive of benefit if the eloquence which he employed in denouncing past injuries raking up old grievances and exciting national animosities had been used to inculcate patience industry and forgiveness he might thus have done much to elevate the character of the mass of the irish people and at the same time to bring thcii selfish landlords to a sense of their duties and responsibilities there cannot be a doubt that the mass of the english people are mos anxious for justice to ireland and therefore only evil can flow from a course which tends to excite illwill between the two races the church of ireland is a grievous burden a perfect incarnation of robbery but the english church isan iniquity and ao is the church of scotland why then should blame be put upon saxon shoulders for oppressions which equally with the celt they

surprise at all upon the minde of the spectator who watched the progress of the game with great interest all at once the game was interrupted by the cry of murder in the streets and all rushed out to discover what was the occasion of the outcry some negroes were lighting and one who was getting rather roughly handled had raised the alarm a party of them had been playing marbles and a dispute arose between them which terminated in a fight the citizens were highly indignant on account of the violation of the sabbath and it was unanimously declared that the whole posse must be whipped they were accordingly taken into the jailyard to receive their punishment and mixed with the crowd who were highly elated at the prospect of fun they were made to strip themselves of all their clothing but their pantaloons and one of the rnen who had just been playing backgammon and who was also a city officer was selected to handle the whip this instrument was a rawhide twisted ridingwhip about three feet and a hall long and was to be applied to the bare back twenty lashes was the number decided upon and a manto count was appointed the blows were laid on heavily and almost everyone was followed by blood every blow that was struck the poor victim would ejaculate oh lordy do pray massa have mercy for the love of jfod massa strike easy re e one of them however a bright mulatto took bis twenty lashes without uttering a groan or hardly moving a muscle although his hack was crimsoned over with blood god damn him said u bystander cut him to pieces if he does not beg the whipping recommenced and about a dozen more blows were counted when the poor wretch threw himself upon hi knees with oh god massa i do beg this satisfied them and the crowd diepersed highly pleased with their sabbathday entertainment i do not mention this on account of the barbarity because i have seen negroes whipped much for a slighter offence but the idea of whipping these negroes for gambling upon the sabbath and selecting a man to do it who had been guilty of the same tiling was to say the least a little peculiar i have been made astonished since i have been in appalachicola to see so many white niggers and mulattoes creoles they call them the farther south you come the more white slaves you will find it would be alow estimate to say that threefourths of the slaves in the southern states have white blood in their veins and one sixth of them have more than one half white bloodmany attempt to justify slavery on the ground that the niggers are another and inferior race if none were slaves but full blooded africans there would at least be threefourths less than there now are this excuse however is one peculiar to the north i never hear il i given here men do not attempt to justify it on the ground of race oi color this would not do here j for if the slaveholders denied their slaves as belonging to the human lam ily of course they must deny that their children do also i do not make this insintmion without some knowledge i of the matter know and it is pub i ticly known that masters do cohabit with their slavesraise children by their slaves and sell their own jiesh ana blood as slaves no man who has ever lived at the south or knows any tiling of the southern character will attempt to deny it in towns of two oi three thosand inhabitants by towns i mean what would be called in new england villages almost every single man and many married ones keep ai black or mulatto woman as a mistress doit openly and unblushingly too the offspring become slaves tc the owner of the mother such things are common and well known and the reputation of such men rarely h ever suffers from such an imputation siill this is called a christian coinmuni ty and the government which tolerates an

of those nioety days my head turoed gray and i must hare died i but for the jew who did give me one i shilling down for my acknowledgement for lo on ahnand these wicked robberies have amonted to several hundred pounds every penny of which it bad to pay subsequently for since i my success at stafford not a man in england who can rend hot knows my address it cost am a to obtain the shilling with which i paid my admittance into the royal zoological gardens where i succeeded after teach mortification in getting the ghost of ftmodel made of the bridge the model although a bad one astonished everybody every engineer of celebrity in london was called in to decide whether it was practicable to throw it across the lake four or five of them at the final decision declared that the model before them was passing strange bat that it could not be carried to a much greater length than the length of the model this was the point of life or death with rne i was standing amid men ol the supposed greatest talents ns civil engineers that the world could produce and the point decided against me this one time alone were my whole energies ever aroused i never talked be forel was haggard nd faint for want of foodmy spirits sunk in sorrow ot toy mournful prospect clothes i had noneyet standing over this model did i battle with those men every word uttered catne from my inmost soul and was big with truthevery afthament carried conviction the elrect on those men was like magic indeed they must have been devils nott have believed under the circumstances succeeded my agreement with the proprietory was that i should superintend the construction of the bridge without any pay whatever but during the time of the building i might sleep in the gardens and if the bridge should succeed it should be called remingtons bridge i lodged ia an old lions cage not strong enough for a lion but by putting some straw on the floor held me very well and indeed was a greater luxury than had for several months the carpenters that worked on the bridge sometimes gave me part of their dinner on this i lived and was comparatively happy it was a little novel however to see a man in rags directing gentlemanly looking head carpenters the bridge triumphed and the c twas and was the greatest hit ever made in london the money made by it is astonishingly great thousands tens of thousands crossing it paying toll besides being the great attraction to the gardens not a publication iu  london but what has written largely upon italthough i have never received a penny nor never will for building the bridge i have no fault to find wan mr taylor the proprietor for he has done all fully that he promised to dothat is to call it remingtons bridge the largest woodcut perhaps ever made in the world is made of the bridge every letter of my name is nearly as large as myself the bridge to tiiis day is the prominent curiosity oi the gardens you cant open a paper but you see remingtons bridge soon alter it was built i have frequently seen hundreds of men looking at the large picture of the bridge at the corners of the streets and envying remington when i have stood unknown in the crowd literally starving however the great credit of the bridge gave me some success with a tailor i got a suit of clothes and some shirts a clean shirt any shirt was great but a clean shirto god what a luxury thousands of cards were left for me at the gardens and men came to see the bridge from all parts of the kingdom but with all iny due bills in the hands of the hellborn jews of course had to slope and comedown to stafford i first built the mill which is the most popular patent ever taken in england the coffeepot with many other small patents take exceedingly well the drainage of tixall meadows is the greatest triumph i have yet bad in england the carriage bridge of earl talbot is a most majestic and wonderful thing dnkes earls lords c and their lames are coming to see it from all parts i have now jtnore orders for bridges fropi aristocracy than i can execute in ten years if would do them indeed i have been so much among the aristocracy of late that what with high living being so sudden a transition from starving ii have been compelled to go through a course of medicine and am just now convalescent of course anything once built precludes the possibility of taking a patent in england but its merits and value are beyond all calcul ation a permanent beautiful and steady bridge may be thrown across a river half a mile wide out of the reach of floods and without anything touching the water at a most inconsiderable expense the american patent is well secured at home i know i shall continue to build a few more bridges ot j larger and larger spans and one of them a railroad bridge in order that i may perfect myself in them and commence fair when i reach america j have a great many more accounts of exploits since i came to stafford but must defer sending them until next jtirne i beg you will write me for now since a correspondence is opened i i h he able to tell you something i about england i have dined with earls and from that downdown down o where the knives forks and plates are chained to the table forfear they should be stolen i am my dear sir your obedieut servant j r remington
