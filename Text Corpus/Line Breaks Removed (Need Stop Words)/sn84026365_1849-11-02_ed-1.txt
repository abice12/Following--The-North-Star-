to the people of canada the number and magnitude ofthe evils that afflict our country and tlee universal and inci casing depression ot its material interests call upon all persons animated by a sincere desire for its welfare to combine for tht purposes of inquiry and preparation with a view nr ihenydopntm tf surch remediew ns a mature and dispassionate investigation may suggest belonging to all parties origins and creeds but yet agreed upon the advantage of cooperation for the performance of ajfommon duty to ourselves and our country growing out of a common necessity we have consented in view ofa brighter and happier future to merge in oblivion all past differences of whatever character of attributable to whatever source in appealing to our fellow colonies to unite with us in this our most needful duty we solemnly conjure them as they desire a successful issue and the welfare of their country to enter upon the task at this momentous crisis in the same fraternal spirit the reversal of the ancient policy of great britain vrhereby she withdrew from the colonies their wonted protection in her markets has produced the most disastrous effects upon canada in surveying the actual condition of the cdufttry what but ruin or rapid decay meets the eye our provincial government and civic corporations embarrassed our banking and other securities greatly depreciated our mercantile and agricultural interest alike unprosperous real estate scarcely saleable upon any terms our unrivalled rivers lakes and canals almost un uspd while commerce abandons oui shores the circulating capital amassed under a more favorable system is dissipated with none from any quarter to replace it thus without available capital unable to effect a loan with foreign states or with the mother country although offering security greatly superior to that which readily obtains money both from the united states and great britain when other than colonists are the applicants crippled therefore and checked in the full career of private and public enterprise this possession of the british crownour countrystands before the world in humiliating contrast with its immediate neighbors exhibiting every symptom ol a nation fast sinking into decay with superabundant water power and cheap labor especially in lower canada we have yet no domestic manufactures nor can the most sanguine unless under altered circumstances anticipate the home growth or advent fromjforeign parts of either capital or enterprise to embark in this great source of national wealth our institutions unhappily have not that impress ol permanence which can alone impart security and inspire confidence and the canadian market is too limited to tempt the foreign capitalist while the adjoining states are covered with a net work of thriving railways canada possesses but three lines which together scarcely exceedjfifiy miles in length and the stock tn two of which is held at a depreciation of from go to per cent a fatal symptom of the torpor overspreading the land our present form of provincial government ia cumbrous and so expensive m to be illsuited to the country and rkestary reference it demands to the north star a distant government imperfectly acquainted with canadian affairs and somewhat indifferent to our interests is anomalous and irksome yet in the event of a rupture between two of the most powerful nations of the world canada would become the battlefield and the sufferer however little her interests might be involved in the cause of quarrel or tjje issue of the contest the bitter animosities of political parties and factions in canada often leading to violence and upon one occasion to civil war seem not to have abated with time nor is there at the present moment any prospect of diminution or accommodation the aspect of parties becomes daily mere threatening toward eacli other and under our existing institutions and relations little hope i discernible of a peaceful and prosperous administration of our affairs but difficulties will to all appearance accumulate unth govewiment becomes impracticable in this view of our position any course that may promise to efface existing party distinctions and place entirely new r issues before the people must be fraught with undeniable advantages among the statesman of the mother countryamong the sagacious observers of the neighboring republicin canadaand all british north ameri caamong all classes there is a strong pervading conviction that a political revolution in this country is at hand such forebodings cannot readily be dispelled and they have moreover a tendency to realize the events to which they point in the meanwhile serious injury results to canada from the effect of this anticipation upon the more desirable class of settlers who naturally prefer a country under fixed and permanent forms ol government to one ina state of transition having thus adverted to some of the causes of our present evils we could consider how far the remedies ordinarily proposed possess sound and rational inducements to justify thur adoption the revival of protection in the markets of the united kingdom this if attainable in a certain degree and guaranteed fora long period of years would ameliorate the condition of many of our chief interests but the policy of the empire forbids the anticipation beside it would be hut a partial remedy the millions of the mother country demand cheap food and a second change from protection to free trade would complete that ruin which the first has done much to achieve the protection of home manui faqtures although this might encourage the growth of a manufacturing interest in i canada yet without access to the united states market there would not be a sufficient expansion of that interest from the want of consumers to work any result that could be admitted as a remedy for the numerous evils of which we complain a federal union of the british american provinces the advantages claimed for that arrangement are free trade between the different provinces and a diminished governmental expenditure the attainment of the latter object would be problematical and the benefits anticipated from the former might be secured by legislation under our existing system the markets of the sister provinces would not benefit our trade in timber for they have a surplus of that article in their own forests and their demand for agricultural products would be too limited to absorb our means of supply nor could canada expect any encouragement to her manufacturing industry from those quarters iv the independence of the british north american colonies as a federal republic the consolidation of its new institutions from elements hitherto so discor dantthe formation of treaties with foreign powersthe acquirement of a name and character among the nations would we fear prove an overmatch for the strength of the new republic and having regard to the powerful confederacy of states conterininus with itself the needful military defences would be too costly to render independence a boon while it would not anymore than a federal union remove those obstacles which retard our material prosperity v reciprocal free trade with the united states as respects the products of the farm the forest and the mine if obtained this w r ould yield but an instalment of the many advantages which might be otherwise secured the free interchange of such products w ould not introduce manufactures to our country i would not give us the north american continent for our market it would neither so amend our institutions as to confer stability nor insure confidence in their permanence nor would it allay the violence of parties or in the slightest degree remedy many of our prominent evils vi of nil the remedies that have been suggested for the acknowledged and insufferable ills with which our country is afflicted there remains but one to be considered it propounds a sweeping and important change in our political and social condition involving considerations that demane our most serious examination ihis remedy consists in a friendly and peaceful separation from british connection and a union upon equitable terms milk the irreat worth american confederacy of sovereign states we would premise that toward great britain we entertain none other than sentiment of kindness and respect without her consent we consider separation as neither pacticable nor desirable but the colonial policy of the parent state the avowals of her leed right is of no sextruth is of no coloroi is the father of us all and all we are brethren ing statesmen the public sentiments of the empire present unmistakable and significant indications of the appreciation of colonial connection that itis the resolve of england to invest us with the attributes and to assume the burdens of independence is no longer problematical the threatened withdrawal of her troops from other colo niesthe continuance of her military protection to ourselves only on the condition that we shall detray the attendant expenditure betoken intentions toward our country against which it is weakness in us not to provide an overruling conviction then of its necessity and a high sense of duty we owe to our country a duty we can neither disregard nor postpone impel us to entertain the idea of separation and whatever negotiations may eventuate with great britain a grateful liberality on the part of canada should mark every proceeding the proposed union would render canada a field for american capital into which it would euter as freely for i the prosecution of public works and private enterprise as of the present states it would equalize the value of real estate upon both sides ol the boundary thereby probably doubling at once the entire present value ol property in canada while by giving stability to our institutions and introducing prosperity it would raise oui public corporate and private credit it would increase our commerce both with the united states and foreign countries and not necessarily diminish to any great extent our intercourse with great britain into which our produce would for the most part enter on the same terms as at present it would render our rivers and canals the highway for the immigration to and exports from the west to the incalculable benefit of our country it would also introduce manufactures into canada as rapidly as they have been introduced into the northern states and to lower canada especially where water privileges and labor are abundant and cheap it would attract manufacturing capital enhancing the value of property and agricultural produce and giving remunerative employment to what is at present a comparatively nonproclucing population jyor woult the united states merely furnish the capital for our manufactures they tvould also supply for them the most extensive market in the world without the intervention of a custom house officer railways would forthwith be constructed by american capital as feeders for all the great lines now approaching our frontiers and railway enterprise in general would doubtless be a active and prosperous among us as among our neighbors the value of our agricultural produce would be raised at once to a par with that of the united states while agricultural implements and many of the necessaries of life such as tea coffee and sugar would be greatly reduced in price the value of our timber would also be greatly enhanced by free access to the american market where it bears ahigh price but is subject to an onerous duty at the same time there is every reason to believe that our shipholders as vell at quebec as on the great lakes would find an unlimited market in all the ports of the american continent it cannot be doubted that the shipping trade ot the united states must greatly increase it is equally manifest that with them the principal material in the construction of ships is rapidly diminishing while we possess vast territories covered with timber of excellent quality which would be equally available as it now is since under the free trade system our vessels would sell as well in england after annexation as before this simple and economical state government in which direct responsibility to the people is a distinguishing feature would be substituted for a system at once cumbrous and expensive in place of war and the alarms of war with a neighbor there would be peace and amity between this country and the united states disagreements between the united states and her chief if not only rival nations would not make the soil of canada the sanguinary arena for their disputes as under our existing relations must necessarily jhe the case that such is the unenviable condition of our state of dependence upon great britain is known to j the whole wond and how far it may i conduce to keep prudent capitalists j from masing investments in the country or wealthy settlers from selecting a foredoomed battlefield for tbe home of themselves and their children it needs no reasoniog on our part to elu cidate but other advantages than those hav in a bearing on our material interests may be foretold it would change the ground of political contests between races and parties allay and obliterate those irritations and conflicts ofrancor and recrimination which have hitherto disfigured our social fabric already in anticipation has its harmonious influence been felt the harbinger may it be hoped of a lasting oblivion of dissensions among all classes creeds and parties in the country changing a subordinate for an independent condition we would take our station among the nations of the earth we have now no voice in the affairs of the empire nor do we share in its honors or emoluments england is our parent state with whom we have no equality but toward whom we stand in the simple relation of obedience but as citizens of the united states the public service of tbe nation would be open to usa field for high and honorable distinction on which we and our posterity might enter on terms of perfect quality rochester n y friday november nor would the amicable separation of canada from great britain be fraught with advantages to us alone the relief to the parent state from the large expenditure now incurred ia the military occupation of the countrythe removal of the many causes of collision with the united states which result from the contiguity of mutual territories so extensivethe benefit of the huger market which the increasing prosperity of canada would create are considerations which in the minds of many of her ablest statesmen render oor incorporation with the united states a desirable consummation to the united states also tbe annexation of canada presents many important inducements the withdrawal from their borders of so powerful a nation by whom in time of war the immense andgrowing commerce of the lakes would be ability to dispense with the easily but ineffectual revenue establishment over a frontier of many hundred milesthe large accession to their income from our customsthe unrestricted use of the st lawrence the natural highway from the western states to the ocean are objects for the attainment of which the most substantial equivalents would undoubtedly be conceded fellow colonists w r e have thus laid before you our views and

ready for the sacrifice of blood and toll such a scene occurred here on sunday last oct in the year of our lord the cries ol the miserable wretches as they jolted over the rough pavement at a brisk

almighty power and retributive justice go forth to lift the pall of darkness from the world to unloose the shackles of the oppressed and open the eyes of mankind to light and truth how will some of the patriots and saints of our day call upon the rocks and mountains to cover them from that unsleeping eye which sees everywhere how long are we to suffer this reproach will slavery continue in the

seal of everlasting shame and guilt be burned deep on their frontor is there light abroad c jab haughton and father mathew we copy from the last liberator a passage in a letter of james haugbtoo of dublin commenting on the course which father mathew has seen fit to take in relation to the abolitionists of this country mr haughton aa probably most of our readers koow is one of the most distinguished and devoted advocates of temperance in ireland he m also a personal friend to father mathew and in company with him has addressed probably hundreds of thousands of people we had so doubt that the conduct of mr mathew would be condemned by the friends bs left behind him st home sad the testimony of all of them who profess o be abolitionists would we do not question be aa emphatic could we get at it as this of mr haughton he says i am truly sorry to learn that father mathew has acted a cowardly parton tbe question of slavery since he arrived in america i did not expect that he would have taken a prominent position among any section of your abolitionists but i did expect he would have honestly avowed himself an abolitionist and that he would have called on irishmen in america to be the friends of the black man it was his bounden duty as a truthful honest man to have gone thus far at least lam sorry he has fallen i am sorry he has bowed down before the slave power lam sorry he contemplates a visit to the slave states if he does visit them and that he continues to disavow or avoida manfully to avow his approval of the address which he signed with ready willingness at my request some years ago and which address has been lately republished in the liberator and the standard if he does not acknowledge the paper signed by oconnell and approved by his own conscience i hope he will take up his abode among slaveholders and never come back to ireland but i will yet hope better things of father mathew i wrote to him several weeks ago entreating him to be friendly and faithful to the colored man it is a sad thing that this most cruelly oppressed portion of our race should be nothing cared for bv even professed friends if father mathew shall raise no voice for them in america he will be despised even by the slaveholder and his name will become a reproach among honest men i do not know what he means by saying that signing the address brought some odium on him here it gained for him nothing but honor in ireland for however dishonest irishmen may act in this respect when they set foot on your soil not a man of them at home is to be found who does not exclaim agninst slavery if my voice could reach father mathew across the atlantic i would conjure him to be true to the slave for the honor of old ireland for the sake of his own fame and because such a cause is the only manly and honorable course he can pursue any other will bring disgrace to himself and injury to the great cause of temperance in which he is engaged and with which his name is identified a man must be something more than a teetotaller we dont want our people to stop there teetotalism is the foundation from it should spring every other virtue that can adorn the man testimony against coloniza tion weare gtarfra flird says theanti slavery bugle in the louisville examiner of the th ult a manly protest from that truehearted friend of freedom rev john g fee against the shameful injustice and wickedness of offering the slaves of kentucky their liberty only upon condition of banishment from the state this is a prom inent feature in the plan of emancipation which has been proposed by those who take the lead of the antislavery agitation in that state and it shows clearly enough that the authors of the scheme ai actuated by a selfish regard to the interests ofthe whites rather than by enlightened benevolence toward the oppressor and the oppressed mr fee talks like a man of principle and heart and appeals to the conscience with convincing power hear him is it christian humane or just that we require a poor unoffending man who has toiled to construct our roads clear our farms feed our children and clothe our own bodieswho has done us naught but kindness that we in return require ab a condition of his enjoying the boon of freedomthe inalienable right of humanity that he must be banishedbanished from the land of i his birthfrom a land where he is acclimated to one to which he is not acclimated and removal to which must result in disease and death to hundreds and thousands and all this too without his consent is this obeying christ rule whatsoever ye would that men provision is made for color or degree of intellectual capacity should do unto you do ye even so to them if the members of the central committee were slaves and the colored people had the majority and power in their hands woold the committee think it just and christian that they should be banished without their consent to the land of their forefatherslreland germany scotland or whatever that laud might be does the committee say there is a prejudice against the colored race and they should therefore be banished this position we see in almost every colonization address but is it a sufficient one is it one upon which christians and philanthropists should base their actionsa systematic and organized effort to continue through the lapse of many years if we ean judge from tbe returns from the polk in jefferson county aa well aa from all other counties in the state there is a prejudice against the mem hers of that committee themselves and no doubt many of the citizens would colonize them if they had tbe power but woold tbe committee think prejudice a sufficient ground for such ac tioo does the committee eey it would be for the welfare of the colored people themfeelvee we replyof this the colored people should bo the sole judges many of the perpetualieta of our stale are saying these emancipationists bad better give up the ship j and go to the free states where they could all be of a piecethey could get along better hew we think we ought to be the judges of this matter should he perpetualists banish or colonize the emancipationists merely because they had the powergiving as a reason it would be better for the emancipationists the emancipationists would feel it an act of tyranny worthy only of the autocrat of russia and shall we because we have the power assume the right to judge for a poor and longop pressed minority shall we as pro iesed republicans and democrats wearing the name ot christs followers be guilty of such tyranny could we expect the blessing of heaven upon us either as a nation or a party as we are proposing in the eyes ot god and the world to do a noble act that of proclaiming freedom to the downtrodden slave let it go the whole figure oftrue magnanimityextend absolute justice to every one and not stain the noble enterprise by remaining acts of injustice to gram an unholy prejudice this is the true spirit which alone can conquer the powers of despotism not until the antislavery of kentucky is pervaded by this spirit will it ever accomplish much toward freeing the state from its deadly leprosy slave

indeed he oev i tone of them up to im flogged that he lifu first read a portion oi ihe criptures io th slave and give him in addition a moral le rure he mr brown had heard tin nia ter tell a visitor that he believed ins slave weie more benefited by his moral lecture than by his flogging and one day when was himself tied op he ventured m say itu he would take it all out in moral lecture but the only answer lie received was a blot over the head with a cowhide few iiucl ins masters moral lessonlaughter h next alluded to the conduct of faiher l tbew in fefusmg to attend an antlnlr meeting america on the first ot august m celebration of the anniversary ot the aboh lion of slavery in the british west india ol orues but the slaveholders notwithstanding that would never forgive father mathew fu signing an address against slavery some year ago when he was m ireland and tha const siunee was tint he was now between twi fires he had no bad feel mg towards fathe mathew but as the advocate of three miluui of slaves in america he could not help con pasting tle conduct of father mathew nov it was in former yens the account of the meeting held tonight would circulate in the slsveholding states and wheo they saw that they were agitating io this country the hands of the abolitionists would be strengthened and they would be cheered forward in their labots he concluded by expressing the gratification he felt in being among there at the present meeting cheers mr g thompson m p addressed the meeting he said notwithstanding whet bis friend had stated as to the cruelties practised upon the slaves in america there is e moral pollution in slavery which it vn impossible adequately to conceive or desetibe what btamped the system in his estimation as being something more than infernal was that human beings placed here to live together ss brethren should one portion of them take advantage of their superior intellect or their pow dr and sacrilegiously seise upon other of their fellowmen as if they were like their cattle their own property he did not know wbat form public opinion might take to do away with this infernal system but they roust promote its progress by denouncing every man who should uphold or advocate tbe infamous practice no man could doubt that america was destined to take a leading part in human affairs and whit was now the reproach of that country slavery what the fertile source of discord slavery what made the south st variance with the north slavery what was it that engendered all of human tnsolenoe and human crime in the southern states why slavery and whtt he would ask would make the american citizen more welcome here than the abolition of slavery how could america sympathise with the struggles of the patriots in italy in hun r garv and in other parts of europe so longas she tolerates slavery and what would give point to her remonstrances and force toher appeals in favor of the suffering patriots of europe but the abolition of slavery loud cheering what he would ask would be the effect of this meeting in the united states a man had come among them wanting many recommendations which might aid himand yet he was received with open arms because he was a man of color and a slave he was not merely tolerated but he was cheerfully welcomed and treated as an equal in the advancement of a great cause like the present the best way was to speak the truth for if they did not speak the truth nobody would be able sufficiently to rec ognise that infamous practice they desired to abolish he wished that the religious com inanities of the united kingdom would speak out for much mischief was done when in any wav they acted with the slaveholders of america after alluding to what had been i staled regarding father mathew and regrel j ting that that gentleman had been induced toi take the course imputed to him he concluded by calling the attention of the meeting to the peculiar position in which mr brown was placed and recommending him to their extensive patronage mr thompson pioposed a resolution to the effect that the meeting deeply sympathised with the sufferings of mr brown while a slave in america and at the same lime expressed its regret that slavery was still permitted to be a blot upon the character of the united states mr henry clapp of america next addressed the meeting and said the present oc j easion was in one sense not an agreeable one toi him as he had to speak not of the institutions of his country which he admired but of that particular one which of all others he abhorred since he had been living in europe he had been living under institutions with which he confessed he had little sympathy but any objections he could urge against them had been silenced when he reflected on the blot which defiled his own country believing however as lie did that the experiment of free institutions in america would be successful contending as he did for the right ofselfgov i ernment he entertained no fears but that america would purge herself of the present j slain mr c continued at great length and j having concluded i the resolution was agreed to and immediately after the meeting separated the settlers on smiths lands in oneida coat a meeting of the colored emigrants held upon the smith lands in florence oneida co n y at the emigrant house on saturday octoberoth

organization in tbeee compromising and degenerate days may be innocently hailed with exceeding gratification for of all the aoos of men from whom a straightforward persevering and undeviating adheaion to principle ia to be expected there ate none less to be relied upon than the politicians of this country we say hi country because there is perhaps no country on the globe where political morality and honesty are held in such shameless contempt as in the united states political consistency ia treated aa the greatest folly when to be recreant and inconsistent present the strongest ground for hope of success in getting into power illustrations of the truth of the foregoing allegation are so abundant and familiar to all that it would be a wasteful expenditure of time and space to presentthem the history of the liberty party and that of the free soil party of this state are wellknown the former commenced by declaring tbe incapacity of either of the great political parties to perform antislavery work and to vote with either of those parties in ths estimation of joshua leavitt and h b stanton with the whole liberty party was to be guilty of sin against god and man the fact that these men are now to be found with their whole faction in this state in union and fellowship with the democratic party heeds only to be stated to make ita disgusting apostacy apparent the free soilers also of this state have shown their utter contempt for their principles and pledges bv whirling with the most indecent rapidity over the bulwarks of the buffalo platform into the foul abyss oi hunkerism with such examples of political profligacy and perfidy before us and with the gene eral political debasement which surrounds us on all sides it is excusable to look with gratification upon the present free soilers of massachusetts supported only by the half of a principle laboring to limit that which justice declares should bewholly and for ever destroyed loaded with the burden andincon venience of having to qualify and restrain the legitimate deductions of their entire logic and possessing temptations to recreancy and treason of the strongest possible description they yet cling to their organization with an unshaken tenacity and zeal which is truly amazing there must be something in ths metal of the men of massachusetts which differs in an important degree from that of those in new york michigan wisconsin and elsewhere theit free soil brethren are falling all around them their firmness therefore admirable in any circumstances is more admirable now they have nominated theii candidates in that state and havs brought to their support a zeal bordering on enthusiasm we always read with pleasure the freesoil papers of massachusetts conducted generally with great ability they possess a warmth and energy always refreshing and invigorating among these journals ws may mention the massachusetts spy tfu boston republican and the lowell amer ican it is not to be inferred from anything wt have now said of tbe free soil party of massachusetts that our opinion as to successful political action under the american constitution is at all changed we hold now as w have held during the last six yaars that ih only true stand to be taken by the north ia to repudiate the american conatitution witk all ita slavehol ding guarantees compromises and provisions and to adopt with full purpose of heart the doctrine of no union with slaveholders r n antislavery meetings nt west bloom fieldnorth bloomfield aad henrietta i spent thursday friday saturday and sunday in the above named placet endeavoring to awaken in these several communities an interest in the cause of ths enslaved with what success the future must determine i can only aay for myself that tha deepest and smeeteat wish of say heart was to plead the cause of the bondman earnestly and honestly and if by so doing i gave offence to any and made but few converts the responsibility must rest elsewhere than upon my devoted head the meetings were all very well attended especially those of north bloomfiald and henrietta i have no fault to find with tho amount of attention evinced by the different audiences a pleasing circumstance connected with all these meetings is that no difficulty was experienced in obtaining churches in which to bold them ia west bloomfield tha congregational church was thrown open in north bloomfield had tha univerealist church and in henrietta tha congregations chureh was as usual readily granted whoa tbe chureh throws open ha doors freely to the antislavery advocate its

these who seek the extinction of slavery and withhold their sympathy fellowship sad tha great sanction of the christian frees the buyers sellers and enslavers of man until this is done the farinas

however with pleasure aad gratitude note the slightest indication of program in any of their branches aad ahull never withhold the just meed of praise from individual churches because tbe majority are in tbe wrong to tbe minister of the congregational chureh in west bloomfield the rev mr fisher i am under especial obligation it was through his agency that tha free use of the church in that place was gran tad while in west bloomfield i shared the kind hospitality of mr sh ainsworth and familywhose many attentions will not soon be forgotten mr ainsworth is a horticulturist as well as an abolitionist and it was easy to see that inin the former department as well as ia tbe latter whatever his hands found to do he did witk all hi alight he has a large nursery of tbe moot choice fruit trees for which at this season of the year there is quite a ready sale should any of our friends wish to purchase fruit treee of a superior description i know no place to which they can more successfully apply than to s h ainsworth of west bloomfiald the antislavery meeting at henrietta on sunday evening was an occasion of much interest i was informed that a larger number were in attendance than on any former occasion in addition to my own speech james sperry a veteran in the antislavery ranks addressed the meeting with marked earnestness and eloquence this venerable friend took a very hopeful view of the present aspect of the antislavery cause and to some extent he differed from myself in the conclusions at which i had arrived on that subject i had been regretting the great diminution of antislavery effort in this state and the exceeding tendency to compromise on the part of many who had advocated antislavery principles and i had ventured to say that unless something was speedily done to reinvigorate the antislavery forces what had already been gained would soon be lost to this part of my discourse mr sperry replied by presenting the numerous obstacles which had been overcome by the antislavery movement hit presentation was sufficiently true and the sole difference between us consisted in the fact that i feared we should lose all we had gained by not using proper efforts to gain more and he hoped that we should retain all we have by some means that we know not of the truth is that our liberty party friend are at seaand are very nearly shipwrecked thoy have discovered the rickety character of their barkand despairing of human means for relief too many of them are quieting their consciences and excusing their inactivity by discussing learnedly on the behests of providence and by professing to rely upon this power instead of putting forth their own energies to gain the desired port would not be understood to class mr sperry with the inactive claaa which i have described but his philosophy of sunday evening sounded to me much like an apology for the want of earnest effort to carry forward the antislavery cause his practice however is that of a warm energetic and peise vering reformer and his apology was morean apology for his party and old associates than for himselfr o meeting of the pennsylvania antislavery society this annual assembly of the friends of freedom in pennsylvania seems to have been an occasion of unusual interest this year the attendance was very numerous and presented a most lively ahd cheering aspect the resolutions cover the whole ground of present antislavery duties among those who addressed the meeting at various stages of its proceedings were edward m davis c l remond thos vanranselaer wm l garrison lucretia mott thos hambleton miller mcking and sydney h gay a meeting having such an array of talent earnestness and exalted character to address it could not be other thsn highly interesting and instructive the presence of w l garrison always introduces an antislavery atmosphere which it is ever pleasant to breathe when he leads the way it is difficult to falter it is needless to say that to him the meetmg appears to have been indebted for alarge share of its success our pennsylvania friends among other of their noble resolutions have passed one earnestly inviting george thompson the greatest of antislavery orators to our shores to mske the invitation as emphatic as possible the vote wss taken by rising when impatient for the announcement of the question the vast sndience unanimously rose to their feet the rumor of george thompsons coming to the united states has been set afloat so frequently that it is difficult to pisce any reliance upon it we however think the friends of freedom may now repose m the prospect of soon seeing ones sgain among them the men who fourteen years ago when the cause was youhg helpless and hated forsook the land of hie birth and the enjoyment of the well earned laurels gained in the struggle for west india emancipation and epos our slavecursed ahoree dedicated himself aed his powers to tbo redemption of the and fettered

its members demonstrating the folly and wickedness of creating distinctions among equal citizens on account of complex ionand recommending the abolishment of the colored school on washington street and the free admission of colored children into the district schools on equal terms with white children we are sorry to say that this excellent report is rejected by the board of education and that they have adopted a course towards our children as cruel as it is disgraceful for some time past they have been at a lorn to find a place whereon to build a schoolhouse for colored children when almost wearied out in the pursuit and almost ready from sheer necessity to admit colored children into the district schools where they have a right to be we record with shame and confusion the scandalous fact that the trustees of the zion methodist orurch for the paltry consideration of two hundred dollars offered the use of the cellar of their meetinghouse and have thus become the servile tools of their own proscription and degradation for such base and cringing servility we have no language sufficiently strong to express onr indignation and contempt these trustees have not only sanctioned by this conduct the spirit of caste by which we are constantly haunted and tormented but for the sake of a paltry reward they have been willing to endanger the health and ruin the constitution of the whole generation of colored children in rochester the cellar of that church about as fit for a schoolhouse for tender children as an icehouse would be and we have been credibly informed that that has t been the use to which this cellar has been put the house itself occupies a piece of very ground and for three months in the year is surrounded by mud and water and into the low damp and dark cellar of this house these recreant black men have been willing to thrust the colored children of this community two hundred dol lus have proved a sufficient inducement to these trustees to sacrifice a vital principle and to peril the lives of their own children shame upon their narrow souls and let every colored child in the city cry shame it was to be expected that our white negro haters would seek our degradation it is their habit to do so but for colored men to become their willing tools is a depth of infamy scarcely to be apprehended we still hope however that this bribe will be withheld and that these methodist trustees will be shamed and scorned out of their ignominious pioposi tion by the justly indignant colored population of thiacityr a story and its

story the application of which we would specially commend to the negrohaling libertyequalityfrater nity men of this great and mighty republic we hear a vast deal in america about sympathy with rome and sympathy with ireland oh yes the southern men are great sympathisers it is not sober boston that takes the lead in sympathy with the oppressions of europe or in any struggle which may be going on on the banks of the danube or the seine or elsewhere but it is in the south that you hear these expressions of sympathy now the conduct of these slaveholders reminds me of an anecdote which i once heard a gentleman was making a morning call upon some ladies in the south and paming through the yard up to the door he saw a number of naked childrencolored of course or they would not have been naked and naked because they were colored running about in a very neglected condition when he got into the house he found the ladies of the family very busily at work making allsorts of garments it is not a very usual thing for ladies in the south to be particularly industrious in this wty like all the inhabitants of warm climates they indulge a little in idleness but this gentleman wished to know what made them all so busy at that particular lime when the lady of the house in a very tender sentimental tone informed him that they wme preparing some clothes to send them to new york or elsewhere for some poor distressed refugee poles you are working for the poles are you said he jhst so said they ah i saw a number of thorn as i was coming up to the house what said they you saw a number of poles near our house and they started up and ran to the door exclaiming where where where there there there aid the gentleman pointing to the naked children thooe are the poles i mean cheers and

th colored citixeos of rochester on tuesday evening th oct the following resolutions expressing the views and feelings of the colored people with respect to colored schools and especially in regard to the proposition of the board to open a school in th cella or zion chuecx were unanimously adopted resolved that ye will not send our children to the basement proposed to be fitted up for a colored school resolved that it is desirable that th means of education should be of th most cheerful and inviting character and that a schoolhouse of all others should be rendered attractive as well as suitsbls to the pretac tion and preservation of health and believing that these views have uniformly prevailed in the board of education we are all the more pained and grieved that they have selected the cod damp and gloomy basement of zion church for a colored school resolved that this meeting regards with pity bordering on contempt the weak and easily bought board of trustees of zion church who granted s lease of th basement of that chureb and thereby allied themselves with the proslavery irish faction in the board of educationand have grossly wronged the colored children in this city of their educational rights resolved that in the opinion of this meeting the trustees of zion church transcended the limits of their office when they granted the above mentioned lease since the money for building it was collected in the name of the citizens at large and with the express understanding that there should be a school io it for the use of colored children resolved further that as the trustees are only appointed by the church and are unknown as the representatives of the colored people their attempt to act for them in this instance is without authority and thtrsfore of no binding

of zion church on stevens alley your humble petitioners feeling much interest in the moral intellectual and physical education of their children consider the proposed location totally unfit for the proposed school a basement situated on s low spot withouts drain must of necessity be damp this would subject the children to constant colds and injure their constitutions for ever the low ceiling of

westers new york antislavery fair earnestly desiring the abolition of slavery iu this land and being deeply convinced that this result can only be accomplished by renewed efforts to change our present corrupt moral sentiment the undersigned members and friends of the western new york antislavery society again make their appeal to the friends of the slave in behalf of their annual bazaar which will be held in rochester on the th of january while we have been cheered and gladdened by the progress already made and the good already done and while we rejoice to observe that friends have been raised up to plead the cause of the bondman among persons and in quarters where we had least expected them we still see the harvest to be great and the laborers to be few and instead of relaxing onr efforts we are impressed with s sense of the doty of doubling our diligence and applying more closely onr energy to the means of advancing this holy causewe appeal the more boldly to our friends because those for whom we plead cannot plead for themselves while we are surrounded by our domestic circle with none to molest or make us afraid there are three millions of men and women in our own land doomed to abject slavery and chains robbed of every rightcivilsocial personal and political remembering those in bonds as bound with them we desire to plead their cause as though they were on our own limbs and the knottedjash were applied to onr own backs while to obtain means for enlightening the public mind is the strong motive for holding our annual fair it is not the only one agreat amount of good may be traced directly to such occasions many who are now active workers in behalf of this holy movement became first interested in it through the instrumentality of those annual exhibitions of antislavery industry tact and skill the present object of the rochester antislavery bazaar is for the general enlightenment of the public mind on the subject of slavery recognizing the north star published in this city as an efficient antislavery instrumentality we propose that the funds raised by the sale of articles at the bazaar on behalf of which we here appeal shall be mainly appropriated to the support of that important paper we gatefully acknowledge the prompt assistance rendered to onr last fair by our friends and coadjutors in various parts of our owo state wisconsin and michigan and we earnestly solicit their continued cooperation with us in the good woik that no time maybe lost we especially recommend to them the immediate formation of sewing circles in their various towns with a view to making articles for the rochester bazaar we would also in this connection render our heartfelt thanks to our british friends for the valuable aid extended by them to our last years fair sod we would again warmly solicit their generous assistance it is due to our transatlantic friends to say that for much of the interest felt in our last bazaar we were indebted to them and we are persuaded that their continued cooperation will essentially promote the success of our approaching december bazaar and the advancement of the cause of the slave in our land we hope that the foregoing appeal will commend itself te out philanthropic friends on both aides of the atlantic and that they will cordially unite with us in the effort here pro posed signed on behalf of the fair committee amy

to use the favorite phrae of the drill sergeant one his majss lys hard bargains he was not craivhe was nut an idiotno that mere was no way of getting i him difcchrgedfor at that petiod inspecting generals w ere very strict about discharges but lit w as h simpleton of the slheal the intelligence of a child was greater it was well for him peri haps thal he had been driven to enlist by ill treatment at home or inveigled by some adroit re criming sergeant who wanted to pocket the bringing money for in a regiment he was sure to be clothed fed taken care of and governed i poor kit to make a aotdierwof him was impossible however he had evea arms and legs and as he would not use these last to desert to get rid ol him was impracticable he had a slouch and he was a slven he never stood in the proper position of a soldier nor did he ever put on his clothes and appointments like one officers and drill aergeauts gave him up in despair he sunk into a sort of privileged character one who was unapt to learn and formed of stubborn stuff kit was in the company of which i was lieutenant for awhile my pupil but booh and for years my torment and my plague and oftentimes i write with a blush oftentimes my jest upon inspection and review days hid him as well as i could put him on a rear guard or in an awkward squad of lately joined recruits employed hirn for the day as a cook or on fatigue duty oras a line or barracks jrderly some outoftheway post or corner was found in which to conceal kit bu when owing to untoward circumstances such an arrangement could not be effected would get him well cleaned and his appointment weli put on by one of mv smartest corporals and then place him in the rear rank and a clever sergeant behind with his eye constantly on him to prevent him from discrediting the company by his blun ders it may be supportd that such a subject soon became the butt of his comrades they never wanted a joke when he was by they tormented him incessantly they played him tricks at which sometimes he himself gave the laugh of silftiiesr while at others he woud blubber like a baby on these last occasions i would rebuke him and punish the men but i too often shared in the laughter toor kit he went with us to the teninsula i remember him well in our marches there mv old captain who was the best tempered men ever met with would sometimes be provoked into a violent passion with him and while he punished half the company for teasing him lie would tifreaen in a voice of thunder to rifle down kus throat the only threat that ever effectually silenced him when he was in the mood to blubber aud bellow and the only punishment if a threat be a punishment he aver re ceived the silliness of the poor fellow wav incredible i remember on one occasion when the regiment was drawn up expecting to be immediately engaged aud i was iu charge of tho company as a simple act cf duty i placed him in the front rank lest by his extreme awkwardness he might do some injury in firing to the man who would otherwise lave stood in front of him it is a ludicrous tact that the poor fellow complained toth colonel as he wa riding down the line that had placed him in the front rank to get him killed is he not in the front rank himself vou fool was the colonels reply thisshows first alas that poor kit regarded all the world and me amongst them as his enemiesnext that he had not much of a hem in hia composition this little incident was never forgotten by the men of the company and they plagued him about it ti the end of the war but many a voice that gibed and jeered him was in succession silenced in j death he was one of the few survivors in the company at he termination of those memorable campaigns he was present in every battle and on every march the handsome and the happy and the hardy fell around him kit lived on at the close of the bloody battle of albuera when saw him safe upon that field of carnage l was gjad in my very heart and felt that i could have better spared a better man have said truly that kit was no hero as hia complaint to the colonel on a former occasion had proved yet ho had i apparently no fear of death he stood in his placehad a pouch full of ball cattridges and fired them away in the battle whether guilty or innocent of blood lie could not on that occasion kuow aud little heeded at the conclusion of the war and upon the return of the regiment home the battalion was reorganized kit was no longer in the same company with me anc except being occasionally throwu on du v nolr him almost lost sight of the manat length after a lapse of years he fell again under my nonce in india i observed about him avery remarkable changean evident improvement he was far cleverer than he was ever wont to be his awkward gait remained but hia took i was no longer the same his eye once so restless that used to be looking on every side as it constantly expecting either reproof or ridicule was now still aud placid aud a beam of content j ment shone in it he always saluted me with a look of kind and familiar recognition and if i occasionally stepped aud said a word to him replied as if pleased at the notice im puzzled and perplexed at first about

in behalf of the literature of her native country eo that translated copies of swedish poets aud historians now obtain a place on the shelves of our public as well as oar private libraries and are inquired for with avidity by the ordinary class of intelligent readers some alight notice of this accomplished writer as well aa of one or two of her literary countrywomen may not be unacceptable to our readers frederika bremer was born iu the year after the death of her father abe iuhabited stockholm for a while aud afterwards spent some time with a friend in norway she now dwells with her mother and sister close to the northern gate of passing her summers at a neighboring eatato called arta it is said that she has portrayed her parent in the venerable and singular lady who occupies the foreground in her recent tale entitled i he midnight sun wherein also her fair younger sister is beautifully sketched as the suffering yet lovely innermost this sister is watched over by miss bremer like some fragile plant which needs ail the bunshine of life to make it bloom in freshness and beauty and it ia from the outpouring of her own unselfish heart that frederika bremer has given such living pictures cf sisterly love and care it would be idle to speak here of her works for they are in every bodys hands and the merits of her principal personages are discussed with as much freedom in society as if they were our nextdoor neighbors or our intimate acquaintances but our readers will like to know wfiat sort of being in her outer aspect is the lady who has given us such charming pictures of other women that one who has already passed the boundary line of middle age should long since have lost the freshness of youth is selfevident to all but we wish it were allowed ui to add that some traces of loveliness were still visible about her perkon for we are conscioaso an instinctive disappointment when the whole human being is not at harmony with itself when a lofty intellect and a pure imagination are not embodied in a fair and noble exterior miss broiner however is decidedly plain her spare sallow features are however lighted up by a look full of intelligence aud sweetness and her meagre form is set off by the neat simplicity of hr attire there is perhaps somewhat of the teacher in her aspect a certain staid and measured glance winch is often perceptible in those who are accustomed to tvaich over and check the waywardness of youth yet this sort of formality does not destroy the intellectual kindness of her countenance she is quite aware of her own nn attracliveness and has therefore always positively refused to have her likeuess taken the picture cf her which is in circulation is only an imaginary cue invented by a german painter for the profit of some bookselling speculation it waa humorously reported last year in a swedish newspaper that the americans had just despatched a celebrated portrait painter to rome and stockholm for the expres purpose of taking the likenesses of the pope and the bremer la sweden her tale of home is preferred far above any of her other works it is allowed even by her gieaest admirers that while the authoress views with a poetic eye the narrow and tranquil com se of domestic life and therefore sheds a tender glow around its scenes she fails altogether in the gift of bold conception her female ekeichej are drawn with truth and spirit but when she attempts to portray a manly character her imagination pictures forth only some disjointed fragments abounding in mistakes and improbabilities her philosophy is also somewhat too transcendental for the fiction of everyday life and it is perhaps too frequently intruded on j the attention of her readers but fault fiading is lan ungrateful task wheu there is so much to admire and to approve of as in works of frederika bremer curiosities of literature frequent allusions have been made to a large collection of books said to have been brought from mexico by gen scott we were induced during a recent visit to washington to step into the state department and make some inquiries on the subject iu a room elegantly fitted up for the purpose and containing as we supposed about three thousaud volumes of various sizes aud descriptions we found l f tasistro esq busily engaged ia the task of analyzing and examining avast multitude of aucieut manuscripts which form a portion of the collection borne of these manuscripts are of great historical vciue and are said to throw more light on the early systems of legislation in mexico than all the published accounts with which the art of printing has made us acquainted they are chiefly the productions of learned jesuits who flourished in the seventeenth century the language and style being re j markable for that succinctness aud elegance i which characterize the productions of that class of writers we have been informed that in the course of his critical investigations mr tatiatro has made some very important discoveries aa to the peculiar agencies which have at all times been employed bv the rulers of mexico for keep tig the elements ot political melioration within specified bounds and in imparting to the
