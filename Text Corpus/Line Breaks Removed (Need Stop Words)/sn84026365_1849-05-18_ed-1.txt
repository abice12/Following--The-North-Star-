hut the subject presents a still more painful aspect how are slaves made better and from what rn tives are they made better in thiscountry it is no secret that am about to tell there arc certain virtues and sanctities which increase the pecuniary value of certain slaves and there are certain vices and debasements which increase the marj ket price of others if a master wishes to repose personal confidence in hiy slaves he desires to have him honest and faithful to truth but if he desires to make use of him to deceive and l cajole and defraud then fie wishes toj make him cunning and tricky and false if the master trains the slave to take care of his own children or of his favorite animals then he wishes to lave him kind but if he trains him tor a taskpr or a field overseer then he wishes to have him severe now it isin this way that some ot the christian attributes of character being directly j convertible into money or moneys worth enhance the value of a slave j hence it is said in advertisements that a slave is pious and at the auctionblock the hardened and heartless seller dwells upon the christian graces and religious character of some slaves with the unc lion of an apostle the purchaser sympathizes and only desires to know whether tiie article be a real or a sham christian if merebones and muscles compacted into human shape be worth five hundred dollars then if the auctioneer can wrftrant the subject to have the meekness of moses and the patience of job the same article may be worth seven hundred if the slave will forgive injuries not merely seventy times seven but injuries inflicted all his lifelong then an additional hundred may he bid for him if he possesses all the attributes of religion and piety the endurance of a hero the constancy ofa saint the firmness of a martyr the trustingness of a discipleall except those which go to make linn feel like aman and believe himself a man then that which as mere bone and muscle was worth five hundred dollars is now worth a thousand sir is not this selling the holy spirit is not this making merchandise of the savior is not this the case of judas selling his master over again with the important exception of the remorse that made the original culprit go and hang himseltr but suppose thecase to be that of a woman suppw her ability to work and capacity for production to he worth live hundred dollars suppose iu addition to this she is young and sprightly and voluptuous suppose the repeated musum of saxon blood has almost washed the darkness from her skin and suppose she is not unwilling to submit herself to the libertines embrace then too tiiat which before was worth but five hundred dollars will now bring a thousand and infernal as well a celestial qualities are coined into money according to the demands of the market and the uses of the purchaser now it is only m some such incidental wav and with regard to some individuals that it can he said that their condition is better here than it would be in africa and this improvement where it exists is not the result of any system of measures designed for their benefit but is the product o selfish motives turning godliness into gam and where more gain or more gratification can be obtained by the debasement the irreligion the pollution the north star of the slave there the instircts of chastity the sanctity of the marriage relation the holinesa of maternal love are all profaned to give security and zest to the guilty pleasures of the sensualist and debauchee there are individual exceptions to what i have said exceptions which amid surrounding iniquity shine like a jewel in an etbi ops ear but they are exceptions laws institutions and the prevailing public sentiment are as i have des cribed i regard the argument therefore of the gentleman from pennsylvania mr brows not only asutterly unsound and false in its premises hut as blasphemous in its conclusions common blasphemy seldom reaches beyond exclamation it is some fiery outburst ofj impious passion that flashes and expires hut the gentleman reasons it out coolly his is argumentatve blasphemy borrowing the forms of logic that it may appear to have its force bnd transferring it from the passions toj the intellect to give it permanency but the gentleman from pennsylvania retorts upon massachusetts and refers to certain things in her history which he ipgards as disreputable to her in this in has been followed by the gentleman j from v irginia mr bedinger whoj has poured out a torrent of abuse on my native state and who has attempted to fortify his own intemperate ac ousations from a proslavery pamphlet which has been profusely scattered about this house within a few clays past and which is not merely full of false j hoods but is composed of falsehoods so that if one were to take the false assertions and the false arguments out of it there would be nothing left but the covers sir lam very far from arrogating for massachusetts all the merits and the virtues which she ought to possess mourn over her errors and would die to reform rather than spend one breath to defend them the recital of her offences can fall more sadly upon no ear than upon my own j lint it is as true of a state as of an inj dividual that repentance is the first i step towards reformation massachui setts has committed errors but when they were seen to be errors she discarded them she once held slaves but when she saw that slavery w as contrary to the right of man and the law of god she emancipated them she was the first government in the civilized world in the whole world ancient or i modern to abolish slavery wherever she had power to do so this is an honor that no rival can ever snatch from her brow once i say it with huj rniliation she was engaged in the j slave trade but all the gold that could he earned by the accursed traffic hough spent in the splendors of luxury l iiid the seductions of hospitality could not save the trader himself from infamy and scorn and i am sure lam right ini saying that the slave trade ceased tobe conducted by massachusetts merchants and to be carried on in massachusetts j from massachusetts ports before it was abandoned by the merchants and discontinued in the ships and from the ports of any other commercial state ornation in the world this too is an honor which it will be hers through all the immortality of the ages alone to wear but massachusetts it is still said has her idolaters of mammon in other forms it is charged upon her that many of her children still wallow in the stye of intemprance that her spiritualism runs wild in religious vagaries and that something of the old leaven of persecution still clings to her heart in vindicating what is right j will not defend what is wrong i cannot denywould to god that i could that we still have vicesand vicious men amongst us there are those there as elsewhere who if they were to hear for the lirst time of the river of life flowing fast by the throne of god would instinctively ask whether there were any good mill sites on it there are those there aselsweherc whose highest j aspirations for heaven and for happiness whether for this life or

one thing is certain the moment the other i states shall imitate our preaent ex i ample they will cease to condemn us for our past offences the sympathy of a common desire for improvement will destroy the pleasure of crimina j tion and where i ask on the surface of the earth is there a population of only j eight hundred thousand who are striving so earnestly and doing so much to advance the cause of humanity andi civilization as is doing by the people of massachusetts where else where universal suffrage is allowed is a million of dollars voted every year by the very men who have to pay it for the public free education of every child in the state where else by such a limited population is another million of j dollars voluntarily voted and paid each year for the salaries of clergymen alone where else where the population is so small and natural resources so few and scanty is still another million of dollars given in charity the greater portion of which is sent beyond their own borders flows into every state in the union and leaves not anation on the globe nor an island in j the sea nnwatered by its fertilizing streams look into the statute hook ol massachusetts for the last twenty years and you will see how the whole current of her legislation has set in the direction of human improvement for succoring disease or restoring from it j for supplying the privations of nature for reclaiming the vicious for elevating all a comprehensiveness of scope that takes in every human being and an energy of action that follows every individual with a blessing to his home when others will abandon theii offences then let the remembrance o them he blotted out but sir i think it proper to advert to the fact that i have had other proofs during the present session of congress of the same spirit of crimination and obloquy which was so fully developed in the speeches of the gentleman fronr pennsylvania mr brown nd the gentleman from virginia mr bed inger j through the post office of the house of representatives i have beer in the regular receipt of anonymous letters made up mainly of small slips cut from newspapers printed at tin north describing some case of murder suicide robbery or other offence these have been arranged under th heads of the different states ohio pennsylvania new york connecti ut tc and accompanied in the margin with rude drawings pf a schoolbook oi a schoolhouse and all referred to common schools as to their source two only of the whole number thus collected originated in massachusetts and one of these was a case of suicide committed by a man who had become insane from the loss of his wife whicli of these events in the opinion of my anonymous correspondent constituted the crimewhether the bereavement that caused the insanity or the suicide committed in one of its paroxysms i am unable to say now what satisfaction even a bad man could have in referring offences against law and morality to public schools when he must have known that the very existence of the offences only proves that education has not yet done its perfect work i cannot conceive and what spite either against an educational office which i once held or against an institution which is worthy of all honor could be so mean and paltry as to derive gratification from referring me to long lists of offences only one of which was committed in my native state i must leave for others to conjecture surely the author of these letters must have known little of common schools and profited by them as little as he has know n had he referred to any considerable number of crimes perpetrated in massachusetts would gpke his letters borne and carry them into our public schools and make them a text for a sermon in which i would warn the children to beware of all crimes and especially of the meanness and the wickedness which feel a complacency in the crimes of others or can give a false paternity to them and sir i should be sure of a response for out of tcuo there is going forth a nobler of yojng men and young hfotaen thetr ever before conferred in leuigeoce wftue refinement and re lumrn upon my people or community jon the face of the globe he said in mitigation or in jfgpdemnation of slavery elsewhere tfefr are special reasons j wh vit should b discontinued in this j plitrfcc irhi district is the common i property of fhe nation having powi mfmwmfive legislation over it weam all responsible for the institution in it while slaves exist in it therefore it can be chargedupon the north that i they uphold slavery this is unjust to us because it places us before the world in the attitude of sustaining what wej condemn it wounds our moral and religious sensibilities because we believe the institution to be cruel towards men and sinful in the sight of heaven and yet we are made apparently to sanction it it is like that species of injustice where a man is compelled by ia tax to support a religion which hej disbelieves and to pay a hierarchy which his conscience compels him to denounce but the existence of slave rv here is not necessary to the faith or the practice of our southern brethren if they believe it to be a useful and justifiable institution then they evince the sincerity of that belief by sustaining and perpetuating it at home for this purpose there is fso necessity of a crusade to propagate it or sustain it elsewhere rochester n y friday may i look at the relation which we bear ito it in another respect i hare been i taught from my earliest childhood that j all men are created equal thia has become in me not merely a conrictioo of the understanding but a sentiment of the heart this maxim is my princi pie of action wheoerer i am called upon to act and it rises spontaneously to my contemplation when i speculate upon human duty it is the plainest corollary from the doctrine of the natural equality of man that when i see a man or a class of men who are not equal to myself in opportunities in gifts i in means of improvement or in motives i and incitements to an elevated charac j ter and an exemplary life i say it ia the plainest corollary that i should desire te elevate thoss men to an equality with myself however far my own life may fail beiow the standard of christi anitv and gentlemanliness yet i hold it to be clear that no man is a christian or a gentleman who does not carry about an habitual frame of mind which prompts him as far as he has the means to do it to instruct all the ignorance to relieve all the privations to minister to all the pains and to supply all the dei ticiencies of those with whom he meets in the daily walks of life and so far ashe is a inan who wields influence possesses authority or exercises legislative power he is bound to exert his i gifts aud his prerogatives for the amej lioration and the improvement of hisi feilovvmcn this is the lowest standard of duty that any one who aspires to bea christian ora gentleman can set up for his guidance now take the case of a man from the north who has incorporated these views or any similitude of these views into his character and who has occasion to visit this district suppose him to be elected and sent here as a member of congress or to be appointed to a post in some of the j departments or to visit this city on public business or to come here from motives of curiosity what is the first sight w hich is inflicted upon him when he first sets his foot within this common property of the nation when he first enters this household where the head of the nation resides and directs sir when he first alights from the cars which bring him within your limits and your jurisdictionhe beholds a degraded caste a race of men whom god endowed with the faculties of intelligence but whom man has despoiled of the power of improving those faculties squalid in their garb betraying ignorance in every worjjpljey utter uncultivated in their manned and their tastes fawning for a favor instead of standing erect like men wljo are conscious of rights or if they have outgrown servile and sycophantic habits then erring on the side of impudence and insolence as much as they erred before on that of cringing and servility he repairs to his lodgings and there too all his moral sensibilities are shocked and outraged by seeing a class of men and women hopelessly degraded cut off by law and custom from all opportunity of emerging from their debasement whom no talent taste or virtue can ever redeem to the pleasures and the rights of social intercourse he sees men and women who are not degraded on account of the services they performfor honor and shame from no condition risebut degraded by the motive and spirit from which the services are performed men and women who have no inducements to industry and frugality for their earnings will all be seized by another who have no incentives to selfrespect for they can never emerge from their menial condition who are bereaved of all the wonders and glories of knowledge lest under its expansions their natures should hurst the thraldom that enslaves them and all whose manly qualities all whose higher faculties therefore are irredeemably and hopelessly crushed extinguished obliterated so that nothing but the animal which the master can use for his selfish purposes re mains mr brodiiead would you advance the slaves to an equal social and political condition with the white race mr manx i would give to every human being the best opportunity i could to develope and cultivate the faculties which god has bestowed upon him and which therefore he holds under a divine charter i would take from his neck the heel that has trodden j him down i would dispel from his mind the cloud that has shrouded him iu moral night i would remove the obstructions that have forbidden his soul to aspire and having done this i would leave him as would leave every other man to find his level to occupy the position to which he should be entitled by his intelligence and his vir j tues i entertain no fears on the i muchdreaded subject ol amalgamation j legal amalgamation between the races will never take place unless in the changed condition of society reasons shall exist to warrant and sanction it and in that case it will carry its own justification with it but one thing i could never understandwhy those who are so horrorstricken at the idea of theoretic amalgamation should esj hibit to the world in all their cities on i all their plantations and in all their households such numberless prpol of practical amalgamation i never could see why those who arraigned and condemned us at the north so vebem ently because as they say we obtrude our prying eves into what they call a domestic or fireside institution should have no hesitation in exhibiting to the world through all their borders ten thousand living witnesses that they make it a bedside institution multitudes of the slaves of the south bear about upon their peisoae a brand as indelible as that ofcaio but the mark i has been fastened upon them not for i their own crimes but for the crimes of i their fathers in the complexion of the i stare we read the horrid history of the i guilt of the enslavers they demonstrate thatthe one race has been to the i other not the object of benevolence but the victim of licentiousness but to resume when the visiter to this city from the north leaves his lodgings and goes into the public streets half the people whom he meets there are of the same degraded class their tattered dress and unseemly manners deoote congenital debasement their language proclaims their ignorance i f you have occasion to send them on an errand they cannot read the direction of a note or a sign on a shopboard tbeir ideas are limited within the narrowest range they speak the natural language of servility and they wear the livery of an inferior condition the conviction of their deplorable state is perpetually forced upon the mind you do not need their color to remind you of their degradation color sir they are oftentimes almost as white as ourselves sir there is not a member of congress who has not frequently seen some of his fellowmembers in the spring of the year with a jaundiced skin more sallow and more yellow than that of many a slave who is bought andj sold and owned in this city i have seen members of this house to whom i have been disposed to give a friendly caution to keep their free papers about their persons lest suddenly on the presumption from color they should be seized and sold for runaway slaves a yellow complexion here is so common a badge of slavery that one whose skin is colored by disease is by no means out of danger to enjoy security a man must do more than take care of his life he must take care of his health it is not enough to take heed to the meditations of his heart he must see also to the secretions of his  liver but sir the stranger from the north visits the courts of justice in this city he goes into the halls set apart and consecrated even in the dark and half hfittienish periods of english history to the investigation of truth and the ad j ministration of justice blit if he secs any specimens of the colored race there he sees them only as menials they cannot go there as witnesses however atrocious the wrongs they may suffer in their own person and character or in the person and character of wife or children they cannot appeal to the courts to avenge r redress them it introduced there at alt it is as a bale of goods is introduced or as an ox ora horse is brought within their purlieus for the purpose of trying some disputed question of identity or ownership they go not as suitors but as sacrifices in the courts of law in the temples with which all our ideas of justice of right between man and man are associated where truth goes to be vindicated where innocence flies to be avenged in these courts an entire portion of the human race are known not as men but as chattels as cattle where for them is the magna charta that the old barons wrested from king john is a whole race to be forever doomed j to this outlawry are they forever to wear a wolfs head which every white man may cut off when he pleases sir it cannot be that this state of things will last forever if all the rights othe black race are thus withheld from them it is just as certain as the progress of time that they too will have their runnymcde their declaration of independence their bunker hill and their yorktown such sir are the sights that molest us when we come herefrom the north that molest us in the hotels that molest us in the streets that molest us in the courts that molest us everywhere but the week passes away and the sabbath comes the day of rest from worldly toils the day set apart for social worship when men eome together and by their mutual presence and assistance lift up the hearts of each other in gratitude to god but where now are the colored population that seemed to be so numerous everywhere else r have they no god have they no interest in a saviors example and precepts have they no need of consolation of faith in the unseen to help them bear up under the burdens and anxieties of life is tbeir futurity so uncertain or so worthless that they need no guide to a better country or that they can be turned oft with a guide as ignorant and blind as themselves we go from the courts and the churches to the schools but no child in whose skin there is a shadow of a shade of african complexion is to be found there the channels are so cut that all the sacred and healing waters j of knowledge flow not to him but by him sir of all the remorseless and wanton cruelties ever committed in thui world of wickedness and woe i hold that to be the most remorseless and wanton which shuts out from all the means of instruction a b ing whom god has endued with the capacities of knowledge and inspired with the divine desire to know strike blossom and beauty from the vernal season of the year and leave it sombre and cheerless annihilate the harmonies with which the birds of spring make vocal the field and the forest and let exulting nature become silent and desolate dry up even those fountains of joy and glad mmeoew that flow unhidden from the heart of childhood and let the radiant countenance of youth become dull and stony like that of age do all this if you will but withhold your profane band from those creative sources of knowledge which shall give everre newing and everincreasing delight through all the cycles of immortality and which have the power to assimilati the finite creature more and more nearly to the infinite creator to be cenimutd emancipation in kgnttxkv the cause of emancipation does not appear to be in so unfavorable a position in kentucky as th accounts sometime ago led us to believe indeed we have every reason to think that slavery is doomed in that common wealth perhaps in no stale of the union has the institution existed under milder auspices and hence the lormer apathy of so many good and excellent men there with regard to irs extirpation in a population of eight hundred thousand souls there are only one hundred and eighty thousand slaves very many of these are household servants and experience bondage only in th name even those who are field laborers know little of the real horrors o slavery and this is especially true ol the hemp district where the slaves are regularly requitted for overwork and it is not unfrequent fora master to have to pay his servant filly dollars at the end of a season it is thus not beyond power of the negro with economy and perseverance to earn sufficient to purchase his freedom and as a general rule the master is found favoring him in the endeavor as much as possible yve could cite numerous instances where owners have not only parted witha favorite slave for a low price but have given the command of heir own time for a specific number of years in order that they might amass enough to purchase their liberty in intelligence in the possession of comforts in moral standing the slaves of kentucky will compare favorably with any body of people black or white forming like them the lower class of the community no stranger of observation who has visited louisville can have failed to have noticed this the african baptists in that city have a large and elegant church with its mahogany pulpit its choir of thirty singers and all the other elegancies and refinements of the most intelligent eon gregations the pastor is or was ione of the ablest men of his color a far more able man indeed than the second and third rate white pastors who officiate over slave congregations in y ir ginia and other states where black preachers are forbidden by law to exercise their functions there numerous colored sunday schools city also indeed comparing the physical intellectual and moral condition of the kentucky slaves generally with that of the free blacks of ohio who though freeman in name are deprived of nearly every attribute of liberty any impartial mind would give a verdict in favor of the superior advantages of the slave in these respects and itis the knowledge of this which has made kentuckians generally so indifferent to the cause of emancipation had the condition of the seri been worse in that state liberty would long since have triumphed for the nonsiave holding sections out of pure sympathy with the oppressed black would havej carried an act of emancipation long ago vet in spite of these advantages enjoyed by the kentucky slaves they arc slaves alter all and the consciousness of this has long pressed remorsefully ion the hearts of their masters as well as of those who do not own servants that the children ofa serf and his chil drens children shall ho serfs also under that horrible maxim of the slave law partus nequitur rentrem a yl serfs down to the end of timeis a reflection that has stood between the conscience of many a master and has maker when he came to lie upon the bed of death all the possible cruelties that the slave and his descendants might undergo tn other handscruel ties which might have been averted if the servant had been emancipated have then risen up weird and gigantic phantoms to haunt the soul in its dark passage through the y alley of the shadow of death in that dread hour everv sophistry by which the fell system has been defended every motive of interest every suggestion of false philanthropy has been dissipated and the patting spirit has seen the evils of slavery revealed in all th ir magnitude and horror ihe reflection that such a day was coming with diin foreshadowings of its remorseful tortures has visited the heart of the slaveholder in the solemn hours of the night and almost persuaded him to unbind the serf but the apathy of human nature assisted by the suggestions of interest has in the end triumphed and thus thousands who are not averse to emancipation have remained indifferent heretofore a time has now come however when they cau do this no longer so far back as the friends of freedom and of slavery bad become so equally matched that a compromise was extorted from the latter in the passage of an act which forbade the in treduction of slaves into kentucky from other states tilts was consented to by the proslavery party tw cause it would increase the value of the slave but while it thus partially benefited slavery it favored the cause of freedom more by preventing the excesive increase of the slaves under this law the two parlies have remained silent if not contented for nearly eighteen years but at the late session of the legisla lature the proslavery party irritated at the movements in favor of emancipation took addflbtage of a temporary majority and repeated this act by this suicidal proceeding they have alien john hk pbm whole no forever from them that large party constituting a clear majority of the people of kentucky who were averse to increasing slavery and who being now forced to choose betweeu this and emancipation will take the side of the latterall those who own no servants together with all those who do but whose conscientious scruples have been hilled to rest heretofore will now be united and will come out in the approaching convention in favor of freedomadde to this the heavy slave counties which under the old apportionment ruled onefourth of the legislature will now scarcely command a twentieth the result is plain the course of liberty will triumph must triumph the struggle may be long and the victory not gained for many a year yet but it will be gainedthank uod kentucky has large a proportion of citizens who do not own slaves too intelligent and conscientious a population everywhere not eventually to follow the example

testimony and such as even if honest was trom the nature of the case extremely liable to mistake and such as would not have weighed u ith any jury to touch the life of a white man and since tite trial facts have come to light materially lessening uie credibility of the evidence which led to conviction the glaring unfairness of his mode of trial is of itselt sufficient ground for this protest the maxim w hich gives to the accused ai trial by his peers was t setitially violated ina community where sympathy with the colored tnan is a rare and unpopular sentiment the prisoner should have been tried bv a jury composed partly at least of his own race this violation of the principles of equal justice demands our solemn protest we claim also that the petition of more than ol otir

large city we propose now to give our patient readers a brief account of some things which we have seen felt heard and experienced since we parted from ihem two weeks awn no reformer needs to be told that ihe may meetings or anniversaries at new york bring together fiom year to year the most earnest men of the land and present to the world the most tangible test of the moral activity and the amount of moral excellence in the nation tobe found anywhere this is admitted the great light of nearly all the moral religious and humane movements of the age and nation may lie seen in new york during the week devoted to the anniversaries t e cause of the poor the halt and blind the sailor and prisoner the widow anil orphan the slave and the heathen all come up for o nsidera i tion benevolent societies of almost every desetlplion claim the attention and sympathy of the public eloquence is poured out like water m behalf of the peace antislavery and motal reform causes warm hearts and strong minds are at work among them all and all must and will he heard wej shall not pretend to give our readers any account of all these anniversaries it is impossible hu us to dost li is almost impossible to do justice to the proceedings of anyone of these societies they each in the short space of three or four hours pour out matter enough to fill volumes we shall only attend to the meetings of the friend of that movement nearest to our hearts because the most irtdical mcndless i hated and dleadedthe antislavery move incut the first of tliese was the anniversary meeting of the american autiaave ry society it assembled tuesday bth may in the tabernacle broadway and notwithstanding the increasing unpopularity of this society and the heavy ram its meeting was more largely attended than we ever remember to have seen it before the vast hall was nearly full there beiog perhaps not fewer than tweotyfive handled persons jeesent at ten oclock the chair was taken by william lloyd gabmsok

and powerfully brought against them mr pillsbury was followed by wendell phillip of boston lie cauie upon the platform with lus usual easy and majestic sir the audience appeared io expect much i ami received all they expected the man seemed to have been with his god teaming his duty immediately irom the lips of deity he spke as if lo stood alone in the world despising utterly all the wisdom of men trampling upon time hallowed but worthless institutions forgetting to conceal his real convictions in order to gain influence over those who differed from him in the spirit of a true man a follower of christ be rebuked all timeserving hypocrites all seekers aftet ioflu lence exclaiming that god did not send him into the world to get influence but to do hil duty he believed influence gained in any manner inconsistent with an honest discharge of duty to be worthless it is the faithful man even without a single follower that ii the truly influential man mr phillips madea long speech but he could not well hav been shorter to have done jutice to hie i subject or to have met the wishes of hit i audience we have often heard mr phillips i and sometimes when he was more eloquent than on the present occasion but never whet i he was more truthful and earnest than at this i time the audience must have received powerful impression from that speech fred erick douglass followed mr phillips but the ateness of the hour and the already exhaust j d energies of the audience led him to defei his intended remark for subsequent meet j in of the society the platform of this anniversary

that we have ever attended j and we have tm doubt that it will be longi remembered with sincere interest by the numerous antislavery friends who attended rj and participated in its proceedings f d anniversary of the amer and foreign a s society this body mei in the afternoon immediately after the adjournment of the american anti slaveiy society we were unable to be present t its commencement or to remain lurid its entire proceedings we heard only an abstract of its annual report read by ijewis tappan esq the documents seemed to give a minute history of events affecting the antislavery cause during the last year and will doubtless ire valuable after the reading of the report was finished the president announced that music would be the next thing in order thereupon four little boys known as the lucca family came upon the platform and sung an anttslavery song to tire tune of old dan much to the amusement of the audience they were encored and greatly gratified their audience by compliance this slopping at such a stage in the proceedings of so grave an assembly to have a tune performed by a boy on the piarrr truck us as rather wanting in taste to say the least at the dose of this song mr bibb took the platform u second a resolution proposing to give bibles to the made a long speech in fivorof this toast ah surd and extraordinary proposition the speech was as absurd m the pmgmuton it was intended to support we ftnfre adleif heard mr bibb and generally with flnww and profit especially when hthiolf to a statement of ins aa poicml sufferings as a slave arid those still in cruel bondage cpon mr bilb is always interesting lodiin g and powerful beyond lint he is and powerless his address on the present occasion was made up of a most illogical display of cant phrase about the bible its power to abolish slavery if given to the slave dte it was a poor thing which would do very well for that nambypamby aaae of persons in ooj country who care a great deal about the souls of men but care nothing for their budie there are many such in this country who would give a dollar towards giving the slave a bible but who would not give a cent to give the slave himself the epc ech might have been a very proper one for the anoiveraary of the american bible societymade op in part of slaveholders and slavetraderbat it sounded qeite j odd in an antislavery meeting we did not stay till mr bias finished hia speech but led him beating the air we were informed that mr wajuj followed mr bibb and made a speech which greatly relieved the audience of the stupor tadneed by listening o mr bine tpon this matter of giving btbiea to the slave we have a lew gpaarka to make and a few questions to ask the first is that from ih im ultte f tike relation f master and slave it does seen impose hie to give the wile to the slave without the coosent ef the j ter he m pmpcrty ta the eye af bis mmtrr not leaa than m the eye f ib law and it i doea ueemal obvious to comwoo acose tptj froftrty ran not iim praprry even n the i ahapeof a bible it is equally plain that the j slaveholder is not likely to give his consent to i aay measure which will in any waydestroy or decrease the value of bis property in human flesh nor is it less plain that the consent of the slaveholder to give bibles must be i obtained it obtained at a by some one in noway suspected ot abolitionism these positions being uue bow is it possible that the slave can have the bible while they remain under the power and eoauol of their masters it is all well enough perhaps to say that the slave might to have the bible to say that as a human being hr is entitled to it and that we ought to give it to him but the question of its practicability w ill still force itself upon the mind and demand how this thing is to be done the bible no more than any other book lias within itself the power of locomotion ami if it goes from the north to the south it must lie earned the question is who will cany the bible and give it toj the slave vv ill mr bibs will those who j encourage him to advocate the measure go thete and circulate the bible they mean to do no such thing at least im the present state of the public mind there the truth is slaveiy and the bible are at war with each other and the slave cinnot really have the bible while in r a slave our duty is therefore to devote all our energies to giving the j slave to himself as the only condition upon which the slave can have the bible v n  the new york vigilance committee this body held its anniversary at the fhil oah presbyterian church corner of prince aud marion streets on tuesday evening bth maythe secretary rev c ray made a very interesting report of the doings of the committee during the past year showing that more than two hundred souls had been ed from slavery to a land of freedom and imparting many interesting items of interest coo nected with their escape as an evidence of the interest taken in this committee we may state that gerrit smith who lias made his purse strings the common properly of the antislavery cause has recently sent his draft i to the committee allowing them to draw upon him lor five hundred dollars the present yeai and largo sums have been received from other sources after the report was read frederick douglass was called to the platform and addressed the meeting for nearly an hour he w as followed by dr win elder of philadelphia he took his text a single passage in the letter of gerrit smith to the vigilance committee treating slavery as a war upon the government of god and such a speech we never heard before and hardly ever expect i ta hear again it was neither fish flesh not j fowl but something more and better than i eitner clear as a sunbeam dispensing light and heal at the same time it was the most powerful biting withering warming melting and biilliant speech that we ever listened to it makes cues head ache to think of it he however took the liberty to use profane language in his speech w hich would not tic allowed iu any one jess a genius than himself and which he might well dispense with the meeting of the vigilance committee was one of the best which we attended during our visit to new york r n i kidnapping in caroline countythe denton md journal says that on the night of the sth inst an ttrocious outrage was committed in caroline co the circumstances are as follows three ree negro youths a girl and two boys were kidnapped and taken from the county with intent to sell them to the south their names are margaret davis harrison hubbard and james clarkson they had

learn j aught of their wheieabout a suspicion of their being forcibly kidnapped soon took possession of the public mind and inquiry being set on foot it was after some days discovered that they had been secretly carried through huntington reek toward worcester co thence to virginia we learn that the negroes are now in not folk efforts are being made to return them to their parents several others

not to see anything in our religion morals laws manners and habits worthy of commendation the notice on the credit of j which the boston reflector has formed this estimate is evidently a caricature

every prospect of happinesshis wife was said to have been extremely beautiful and no less lovely in her charac ter afler living with her in the most uninterrupted harmony for five years during which time two daughters were added to the family he suddenly resolved to resume his occupation which he had relinquished on his marriage and when ins youngest child was but three weeks old sailed once more for the west indie his wife who was devotedly attached to him sorrowed deeply at his absence and found ner only comfort in the society of the chil jdren and the hopes of his return hut month after month passed away and hei came not nor did any letters those insufficient but welcome substitutes arrive to cheer her solitude months lengthened into years yet no tidings were received from the absent husbandland after hoping against hope the unhappy wife was compelled to believe i that he had found a grave beneath the weltering ocean her sorrow was deep and heartfelt but the evils of poverty were now added to her afflictions and the widow found herself obliged to resort to some employment in order to support her children her needle was the only resource and for ten years she labored early and late for the miserable pittance which is ever grudgingly bestowed on an humble seamstress a merchant in new york in moderate but prosperous circumstances ac i cidentallv became acquainted with her and pleased with her gentle manners no less than her most extreme beauty he endeavored to improve their acquaintance with friendship after some months he offeicd his hand and was accepted as the wife of a successful merchant she soon found herself in the enjoyment of comforts and luxuries such as she had never possessed her ehildren became his children and received from him every advantage which wealth and affection could procure fifteen years passed away the daughter married and by their stepfather were furnished with every comfort requisite in their new avocation of housekeepers but they had hardly quitted his roof when their mother was taken ill she died after a few days and from that time until the period of which i speak the widower resided with the youngest daughter now comes the strangest part of the story after an absence of thirty years during which time no tidings had arrived from him the first husband i returned as suddenly as he had depart ed he had changed his sh w t another name and tlj v that long period on the ocean with i only transient visits on shore while taking in or discharging cargoes having been careful never to come nearer j home than new orleans why he had acted in this unpardonable manner towards the family no one could tell and he obstinately refused all explanation there were strange rumors of slave trading and piracy afloat but they were only whispers of conjecture rather i than truthwhatever might have i been his motives for his conduct he was certainly any thing but indifferent i to his family concerns w hen he returned he raved like a madman j when informed of his wifes second marriage and subsequent death vowing vengeance upon his successor and j terrifying his daughters by the most awul threats in case they refused to acknowledge his claims lie had returned wealthy and one of the mean reptiles of the law who are always tobe found crawling about the halls oi justice advised him to bring a suit against the second husband assuring him that he could recover heavy damages the absurdity of instituting a claim for a wife whom death had released from the jurisdiction ot earthly i laws was so manifest that it was ati length agreed to by all parties to leave the matter to be adjudged by five re ferees it was upon a bright and beautiful afternoon in spring when we met to hear this singular case the sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of i the court room and shed a halo around the long grey locks and broad forehead of the defendantwhile the plaintiffs harsh features were thrown into still bolder relief by the same beam which softened the placid countenance of the adversary the plaintiffs lawyer made a most eloquent appeal for his client and had we not been informed about the matter i our hearts would have been melted by his touching description of the return of the desolate husband and the agony with which he now beheld his household goods removed to consecrate a strangers hearth the celebrated aaron burr was counsel for the defendant and we anticipated from him a j splendid display of oratory contrary to our expectations however burr made no attempt to confute his opponents oratory he merely opened a book of statutes and pointing with his thin finger to one of the pages desired the referees to read it while he retired for a moment for the principal i citnctv we had scarcely finished the section which fully decided the matter in our minds when burr reentered with a tall and elegant female leaning on his arm she was attired in a simple white dress wuh a wreath of ivy leaves encircling her large straw bonnet and a lace veil j completely concealing her countenance burr whispered a few words apparently encouraging her to advance and then gracefully raising her veildiscovered to us a face of proud surpassing beauty i recollect as well as if it happened yesterday how simultaneously the murmur of admiration burst from the lips of all present ranting to the pbidttr mr barr uked in n cold quiet tone do you know this udjr answerl do barrwill you swear to that v ansl will to the beat of ay knowledge end belief sbe is ay daugh ter burrcan von swear to her

meeting the plaintiff hesitated a long penae ensuedthe question was repeated and the answer at length was on the th day of may when she was just three weeks old added burr gentlemen continued he turning to us have brought this lady here as an important witness and such i think she is the plaintiffs counsel has pleaded eloquently in behalf of the bereaved husband who escaped the perils of the sea and returned only to find his home desolate but who wili picture to you the lonely wife bending over her daily toil devoting her best years to the drudgery of sordid poverty supported only by the hope ol her husbands return who will paint the slow progress of heartsickcning the wasting anguish of hope deferred and finally the overwhelming agony which came upon her when her last hope was extinguished and she was compelled to believe herself indeed a widowr who can depict all this without awakening in your hearts the warmest sympathy for the deserted wife and the utterest scorn for the mean pitiful wretch who could thus trample on the heart of her whom he had sworn to love and cherish we need not inquire into his motives for acting so base a part whetner it was love ol gain or licentiousness or selfish indifference it matters not he is too vile athing to he judged by such laws as govern men let us ask the witness she who now stands before us with the frank fearless brow of truehearted womanlet us ask which of the two has been to her a father turning to the lady in a tone whose sweetness was in strange contrast with the scornful accent which had jusl characterised his words he besought her to relate brietly the recollections ol her early lifea slight flush passed over her proud and beautiful face as she replied my first recollections are of a small illfurnished apartment which my sister and myself shared with my mother she used to carry out every saturday evening the work which had occupied her during the week and bring back employment for the following one saving that wearisome visit to her employers and her regular attendance al church she never left the house she often spoke of my father and of the anticipated return but at length she ceased to mention him though l observed she used to weep more frequently than ever i then thought she wepl because we were poor for it sometimes happened that our support was only abit of dry bread and she was accustomed to see by the light of the chips which she kindled to warm her famishing children because she could uol purchase a candle without depriving ui of our morning meal such was oui povert y whoujny mother contracted a second marriage and the change to us was like a sudden entrance into paradise we found a home and father she paused would you excite my own child against me cried the plaintiff as he impatiently waived his hand for her tobe silent the eyes of the witness flashed fire i as he spoke you are not my father exclaimed she vehemently what call you my fathei you who basely left your wile to toil and your children to beggary nevei never behold there my lather pointing to the agitated defendant there is the man who watched over my infancywho was the sharer of my childish sports and the guardian of my inexperienced youth there is the man claims my affection and shares my home there is my r father for yonder selfish wretch i know him not the best years of his life have been spent in lawless freedom from social ties let him seek elsewhere for the companion of his decrepitude nor dare insult the ashes of my mother by claiming the duties of kindred from her deserted children she drew her veil hastily around her as she spoke and moved as if to with draw gentlemeusaid burr i have no more to say the words of the law are expressed in the book before you the words of
