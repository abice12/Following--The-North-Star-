present meeting in regard to the doings of congress at washington this was no ordinary time they may depend upon it the enemies of the colored race the proslavery men throughout the country ahd particularly at the southwere threatening it was however only threatening for calhoun meant no woe in his speech knowing well as he did that if matters went further than threats he would lose hie cherished institution and his cherished race of lt was intended to frighten the northern memj bers and particularly the free soilers into a compliance with his measures and the rejection of california as a free state calhoun had been long ambitious of the president s chair hut lie was killed oflfby nullification resolutions would be submitted to the mealing which would express better and more

their report whereas the constitution of these united states was formed to ensure a more perfect union than the articles of confederation afforded to establish justice and secure the blessings of liberty to the people of this country and whereas free and slave stales have banded together under it containing within their several forms of government the elements of disunion and whereas the power of legislation on all subjects involving the general interests of the people is vested inc ngress composed of a senate ud of representatives consisting vvl ablest men that can be elected right or no bkx tagrra of molor and lbe admission of new slave states and whow rwn tr has fctcr in voleed in wars and unjlione of th poblic treasure have been squandered and thousands of valuable lives hav been sacrificed for the purpose of obtaining more soil to augment ths productions of the south and increase tin commerce of the north and whereas mich have been the stupendous effort put forth akm ve newer of thi nauftu sow iodlsei ot the people of the nordi as well ai some in the south have become alarmed lest every other interest shal be sacrificed to maintain its ascendancy and whereas such is now the agitation in the councils of the nation in regard to the subject of slavery a that some of the ablest minds in congress aud out of it are racking theii brains to originate some compromise by which the whole question may be settlednow therefore resolved that in the deliberate judgment of the colored citizens of the city and county of new york no plan can be proposed or adopted to arrest the discussion or settle the agitation in regard to american slavery that does not aim to effect its entire abolition resolved that we must regard every admission of a slave state into the american union by congress as surrender of the principle which the constitution was established to pro tectnamely to secure the blessings of liberty and that the only way in which that instrument can be rightfully sustained is to refuse to admit slave states into the union and for congress to do ail in its power to abolish slavery wherever it has the constitutional authority resolved that the proposition of senator mason of virginia to pass more stringent laws for the recovery of persons owing service in one state and escaping into another under which all colored persons in the free states are subject to be arrested aud hurried into southern bondage destroys the right of trial by jury for all persons so arrested breaks down every safeguard of personal liberty and if passed by congress will have ntjmuilmg force upon s f and tnual be rsiristtflbf every wafts which mny beat our command fyy at the sacrifice resolvedjvbat the adoptipn by the senate f tfhe united states of mr clays propositions to settle and adjust all questions of controversy arising out of the institution of slavery so far from accomplishing the end designed by that distinguished senator must result in prolonging the difficulties by which the subject is now surrounded in disappointing the hopes ola large proportion of the people of this country in creating false issues in the discussions now in progress between me friends of freedom and the advocates of slavery in wasting the peoples money and in imposing upon posterity a responsibility which ought to be assumed by the present genera tionnamely of doing all in our power to remove the cause of difference between different sections ol the couotry and in restoring to life and vigor the great principles set forth in the declaration of american independence resolved that if our senators and representatives in congress desire to use the power delegated to them for the benefit of the people of this nation they must cease to propagate slavery and do all in their power to spread the area of freedom they j must withdraw the protection of the american flag from the foreign and domestic slave trade and let it untold itself as the emblem of liberty that its stripes he no longer emblematic of the scars of oppression but that its stars may shine in the light and glory of freedom they must obey the call for the suppression of domestic violence by which one man is made the property of another his wife and children torn from him and he stripped of every right his labor forced from him for the benefit of one who exercises ih right to violate the virtue of hisi wife or daughteft tneytnrisrtewßnrr liberty provide for the common de fence of the domestic relations of every inhabitant of the country and protect all in the pursuit of happiness they must take from the nation the festering canker of slavery and impart to it the health and beauty of freedom resolved that having hoped and struggled on under the union despite of prejudice and wrong we desire its perpetuity in view of our hopes and expectations believing that justice still awaits us that our country will shortly relieve herself of her present curse and stand forth preeminently the country of the world j resolved that the question ati present presented to the couotry is not that of liberty or the union hut should the issue he presented of liberty or the union we would as a matter of course he found on the side ol liberty s resolved that the noble and manly position taken by the hon wm h seward senator from new york in declaring that the newlyacquired territories should remain intact to freedom end denouncing the mason and webster project for the purpose of the le ehornblee of the i south j capturing the iymg fgitre kidnapping the colored ireeman i merits our commendation

similar legislative enactment that will have a tendency to harmonize with the sentiments expressed in the declaration of american independence and that free stains ought to be admitted into the unisnj

two resolutions viz that the congress of the united states possess the constitutional power upon the admission of any new state created beyond the limits of the original territory of the united states to make the prohibition of the further extension of slavery or involuntary servitude in such new state condition of its admission and that it is just and expedient that this power should be exercised by congress upon the admission of all new states erected beyond the original limits of the united states vote mr webster as the representative of massachusetts in congress does not consider that he has anything to do with the subject of slavery when it was ascertained during the war that new territory would be acquired and when it was openly avowed that it was to become slave territory the house of representatives passed mr wilrnots proviso expressly excluding slavery from the territory to be thus acquired this he as well as we know led to a violent political agitation what part did mr webster take in this agitation in he addressed a meeting of his own party and declar edthere is not a man in this hall who holds to the principle op the wilmot proviso more firmly than i do the principle of the proviso was the exclusion of slavery by act of congress from the territory to be acquired from mexico and that territory we all knew was none other than new mexico and california the agitation waxed fiercer and fiercer the whig party at the north pledged themselves to the proviso the legislature of massachusetts as we fiavc seen unanimously declared for the exclusion of slavery from new mexico and california and mr webster pubj licly thanked his statu and was proudi massachusetts nominated mr webster for the presidency and he stood before the country os the wilmot proviso candidate general taylor was ultimately selected as the whig candidate and was supported by the northern whigs on the pledges made by his friends that he would not vote the proviso i general cass on the other hand was the avowed antiproviso candidate and as such was opposed by the whole whig party at the north the great is j sue on which the election turned in the free states was the prohibition or permission by congress of slavery in new mexico and california after the candidates were nominated and while the whole country was convulsed with this issue what was the course of mr webster dissent from his northern friends did he tell them the issue they had made was a nonsensical one hear him once more on the th august l after new mexico and california were acquired he rosein the senate and thus delivered himself my opposition to the increase of slavery in this country or to the increase of slave representation is general and universal it has no reference to the lines of

slave representation when he well knew that the fiat of the almighty had rendered such extention impossible was be then acquainted with the law of physical geography which would render the proviso a reenactment of the will of god and did be purposely conceal the secret of this j law in his own breast when by revealing it he might have stilled the raging billows of popular passion which threatened to engtdf the uuioo to suppose all this would be to impute to mr webster a degree of trickery end turpitude rarely paralleled even among politicians hence we are bound to assume that the lew of nature on which be new relies is a recent discovery subsequent at least to the ihh august ms it is however extraordinary that a gentleman of his acquirements did not sooner become acquainted with this law f

mexico and california and i ceased in not by the law of physical geography but by a mexican edict thousands of slaves are employed in the mines obrazil and mr webster does not explain how bis law forbids their employment in tiie mines of californiamr webster ridicules the application of the proviso to canada in case of annexation i neither see nor feel the point of his witslavery is already prohibited by the local law of canada but were it not most certainly ought to be prohibited as a condition of annexation new y r ork adjoins canada and mr webster probably regards the prohibition of slavery in our recent constitution as the height of absurdity ing there were slaves in new york and on the th of july about slaves were emancipated not by mr websters law but by act of the legislature and the number would have been much greater had not laws for their gradual emancipation been in operation since for along period slavery flourished in new york undisturbed by abolitionists the absence of all antislavery agitation was as perfect as mr websters heart could desire stray negroes were caught with almost as much ease as stray pigs neither pulpit nor press ruffled the happy serenity of the slaveholders but this blissful repose was suddenly broken in by rumors of an intended insurrection courts and executioners were immediately put into requisition and in pursuance of judicial sentences thirteen slaves mere btumi alive at the stake in the city of vett york eighteen were hanged and sev distressed by the supposed unhappy influence of the antislavery agitation upon the condition of the slaves they were never better treated were never less miserable than at the present moment the more public observation is directed to the conduct ot the masters the less reprehensible will that conduct bethe promulgation of the law of physical geography seems to make no impression on the slaveholders as they contiune as ravenous as ever for the new territories but with one accord they unite with the proslavery democrats at the north and with our northern politicians and merchants eager for southern votes and southern trade in lauding and glorifying him j not for his discovery of a new law of nature but for his discovery of a national pledge to receive into the union three slave states to be formed out of the texan territoryfor his denunciation of the proviso and for his promised aid in catching the future latimers who may be found on the soil of massachusetts congress by the constitution may admit new states at discretion and hence new states have been admitted on various conditions the joint reso lutionaadmitting texas imposed restrictions on this power congress may with the consent of texas admit one state north of fdeg m but if admitted it must be as a free state congress may admit three states with the consent of texas south of that line but if admitted no restriction in regard to slavery can be imposed on them mr webster now finds in these resolu i tiona what bad escaped the knowledge of both the north and the south viz a national pledge to admit three j slave ititm as no state can be ad mttted without the consent o texas and as that consent will be withheld for a state north of deg fttlrn it follows according to mr webster that we have made a onesided bargain of the four contemplated states we must have rhree with sjavery but are to be cheated out of the one with freedom this discovery whten has taken the whole natiou by surprise is like the discovery of the geographical law of recent dste on the d march mr webster was ignorant of this national pledge lln bis speech in the senate on that day alluding to the joint resolutions he remarked if you refer to the resolutions providing for the annexation of texas j you find a proviso

excellent things th idea to which we have boye referred cun stitutes the chief peculiarity of his speech and forms the chief ground of offense du for this he might have passed unscathed calhoun would cot have denounced him as cutthroat nor would the republic have repudiated him as a member of the whig party for the utterance of that sentiment he is t be visited with political excommunicationaui to be branded as a political heretic all thi may be inferred from what is transpirinj around us and the wind naturally inquires what is to be the result of such a course to us a seems clear that a more

asked whit becomes of the constitutioi and of the oath to support it we answer that the oath requires that which is moral li impossible among the many truths which have beei elicited during the present discussions w ti have been impressed with none more that this that the whole framework of the arne rican government is radically at fault that ii is founded on a gross and scandalous fraud f that in it are comprised two distinct and hos f tile elements and that no jesuitism can evei f reconcile and render them consistent liberty and slaveryopposite as heaver r and hellare both in the constitution ant the oath to suppoit the latter is an oath u perform that which god has made impossible the man that swears to suppoit it vows allegiance to two mastersso opposite that fidelity to the one is necessarily treachery tc the other if we adopt the preamble with liberty and justice we must repudiate the enacting clauseswith kidnapping and slave holding it is this radical defect in this con stitutionthis war of elements which is now i rocking the land there is a deep reason for the singular attitude in which the straightforward opponents of slavery are now placed contending as they are for the very measure i a s a means of preserving freedom which the slaveholders threaten to adopt as the last resort to uphold slavery garrison sees in the constitution precisely what john c calhoun sees therea compromise with slavery a bargain between the north and the sdbth the former to free his soul from the guilt of slaveholding repudiates the bond and tha latter seeing the weakness of mere parchment guarantees whenfopposed to the moral scope oi ine pariwsiv smk wcehit diasqfle tion of the union a bia only means nf tiafefp this fundamental contradiction in the const tution is the real cause of the present storm tossed condition of the public mind the south have looked jo the constitution from i the ramparts of slavery and have seen in it their highest power of defense slaveholders have sworn to snpport it as such and hae pever sworn to support the whole constitution on tha other hand northern men have recognised in the instilment the princi pies of liberty and justice and have scarcely observed the proslavery principle cunningly wrought into the instrument the opposite view therefore of the constitution and its requirements is the primary cause of the present agitation the question arises as to who is right in this contest we answer so far as the constitution is concerned that all are wrong and necessarily so since neither party north nor south could if they would be faithful to the requirements of the oath toi upport the constitution of the united states ever y slaveholder in the land stands perjured i n the sight ot heave when he sweats his purpose to the establishment of justice the providing for the genrtal welfare and the preservation of liberty to fie people of this country foredfry such slaveholder knows that his whole me gives ja emphatic lie to his solemn vow and httanu case with our free iseii friend who swear to promote the constitution i why they differ from the slaveholder only jq motive they swear to prcmn the ciwsti tution as a mean of promoting tenement measures and under a certain svsmfe of reasoning based on alleged necessity they justify their oath they have our sympathies bu notour judgment they hakes theory of human wfclafc fni l liteecessarv to do evil that goodxm eoife e are uu convinced that that theorjy correct and we must continue jo for the present that the constitutyk being par with itself cannot

secured to us by that instrument regard the constitutional obligations of this fewsrds the institution of j slavery a too obvious to be misunderstood by statesmen the line of demarcation which separates the poops of the free states from the support of slavery lias been so plainly drawn that it would seem no intelligent unprejudiced mind could mistake it it is however true that much obscurity is thrown upon the surest by the ingenuity and the sophistry of those who profess io reason upon it much has been said about slavery being the creature of municipal law men it both political parties now urge that slavery cannot exist unless sustained by municipal law they say thal this is the doctrine of jurists tiiat the most profound judges have so decided otheis deny this doctrine now what is the fact history shows us that it was introduced into virginia and existed there for years without any municipal regulation or authority we know from history that it existed in each of the slave states of this union long prior m the enactment of any laws on the subject it found its way into oregon into california deseret and if weare to credit reports it has been in new mexico without any law it has been sustained in all those states and territories sot by municipal law but by the superior physical and intellectual power of the white over the colored people this was slavery in fact hut not in law for instance slavery continued in ohio even against the provisions of our constitution and in violation of all our laws as late as the jear it exists in illinois to this day slaves are there bought and sold not merely without law but against law but when those slaves become intelligent and claim their rights before any court the judges say that slavry is the creature of municipal enactment that there is no such enactment in illinois and therefore there is no slavery in thal slate the judge means by this there is no legal slavery there while alljare aware that segroes are there held into subject others to his will in that state however each possesses the right of selfde fence not so in slave states there the right of the slave to protect his liberty or his life is taken away by tbe laws of such state for instance if a slave in virginia lifts his hand against his master in selfde fence the master may at once slay him with impunity but this right of the master depends on the law of that state and the njotpept tfie master goes beyond the jurisdiction of that state this righf ceases tet him bring his slave to ohio and the moment they stand on our soil under the jurisdiction of our laws the slave becomes a man possessing the equal rights and powers and privilages with the master such is the case whenever they go beyond the jurisdiction of virginia into free territory these piuiciples have often been advanced tiiey were familiar to our fathers they bad been declared bv the courts of great britain prior to our revolution slavery at that time was discountenanced in all the colonies excepting perhaps south carolina arid georgia my colleague mr camebtllj has shown manable manner that the objects of the people of the south before anj at the pom mencement of the revolution were the enure abolition of slavery arid of ail slave laws these objects were proclaimed in language most direct and appropriate in when entering upon thd var of the revolution after the close of that memorable struggle the confederated congress in sent out an address to the people of the untied states penned by mr mdtson in which tfisy say luinbe remembered finally that jt hai been the pride and the hoaat of america that the rights for w hich she contended were the rights of human nature these sentiments teen prevailed tn all the states fach state at

hat proposition was rejected by the convention ihe supreme couit of the united states have placed a construction upon if i they hold ihat it refers to the individuals of the state imposing upon them the duty of permitting the master tojtake the slave m the same mannei that we surrender up our tilends to the officers of justice they have decided that tt is the duty of individuals nut to secrete or to defend the slave against bis master they admit that the individual niay act in aid of the master but deny tp the state all power of acting on the iuhject it is worthy of remark that this is the only instance in which congress is authorired to legislate in favor of slavery on this point it is conceded that we may pass jaws but bv this clause of the constitution we are i only authorized to legislate lor the arrest and return of fugitive slaves it does not make it oui duty to legislate for the further benefit o the master it is left for us to act agreeably to the dictates of our own judgment we have the power to pairs further laws or we may repeal the law of congress now inforce on that subject but it gives us no juiwer to go further in support of slavery and ui peas laws tor the

dawn which was to guide their steps to the guillotine the arms of the guard clattered along the stone floor of the gloomy corridors of the prison awakening the unhappy victims of the revolution who torn from homes of opulence and refinement were plunged into the grated cells from whence they also in their turn were to be dragged to the scaffold the acquittal of the girondists would afford them some little hope that they also might find mercy they peered through the grat ting of the cells upon the group moviug along by the dim light of a feeble lamp and learned their doom lamentations and wailings filled the prison the condemned now that their fate was sealed had nerved their ona ia anil muiuahy cheerskg one aaother prepared as martyrs to eucounter the last stern trial they were all placed in one large cel and the dead body of their companion with which they were to be buried on the morrow was placed at their side a wealthy friend who had escaped proscription and was concealed in parishad agreed to send them a sumptuous banquet the night after their trial which was to be to them a funeral repast or a triumphant feast according to the vordict of acquittal or condemnation their friend kept his word soon after the prisoners were remand ed to their cell a table was spread and preparations were made for their last supper there was a large oaken table in the prison where those awaiting their trial and those awaiting their execution met for their coarse prison fare a rich cloth was spread upon this table servants enterci bearing brilliant lamps which illuminated the dismal vault with an unnatural lustre and spread the glare of noonday light upon the miserable pallets of straw the rusty iron gratings and chains and the stone walls weeping with moisture which no ray of the sun or warmth of tire ever dried away it was a strange scenethat brilliant festival in the midst of the glooms of the most dismal dungeon with one dead body lying upon the floor and those for whom the feast was prepared waiting only for the early dawn to light them to their death and burial the richest viands of meats and wines were brought in and placed before the condemned asesot flowers diffused their fragrance and expanded their beauty where flowers were never seen to bloom before wan and haggard faces unwashed and unshorn gazed upon the unwonted spectacle as dazzling flam one oftef another until the board was covered with luxury and splendor in silence the condemned took theis places at the table they were men of brilliant intellects of enthusiastic eloquence thrown suddenly from the hights of power to the foot of the scaffold a priest the abbe lambert the intimate personal friend of several of the most eminent of the girondists had obtained admittance into the prison to accompany his friends to the guillotine and to administer to them the las consolations of religion he stood in the corridor looking through the open door upon those assembled around the table and with his pencil in his hand noted down their words their gestures their sighstheir weakness and tlieii strength it is to him that we are indebted for all knowledge of the sublime scenes enacted at the last supper of the girondists the repast was prolonged until the down of morning began to steal faintly in at the grated windows of the prison and the gathering tumult without announced the preparations to conduct them to their execution vergniaud the most prominent and the most eloquent of their uumber presided at the feast he had little save the love of glory to bind him to life for he had neither father nor mother wife nor children and he felt that posterity would do him justice and that his death would be the most glorious act of his lite no one could imagine troni the calm conversation and the quiet appetite with which these distinguished men partook of the en teitamment that this was their last repast and but the prelude to a violent death hut when the cloth was removed and the fruis
