and tbe necessity of activity at this time on motion a committee of five was appointed to prepare business for future meetings which committee was composed of j dickson s h ainsworth s c brown d m smith and s french a song was then given by mr gibbs mr remond occupied a short tune briefly recapitulating the points of dif lerence between the several sects of avowed abolitionists in the means tobe used against slavery and stating hia own position as in coincidence with that of the american antislavery so ciety mr gibbs spoke on the direct bearing of slavery rev mr brown in some observations on the formation of the constitution insisted on the antislavery character of that document elder millard alluded to the practical construction of the clause in the constitution concerning persons held to services french declared a recent state law to furnish ample security for the preservation jf liberty and referred to the debates of the constitutional convention for the opinion of its members on th e fugitive clause elder millard again brought up the p radical construction and supposed that an act of congress would be paramount to any state law alluding to mr masons bill now before the senate of the united states j dickson pronounced it questionable whether such an act of congress would not involve a suspension of the act of habeas corpus unless obtained of in united states officer mr french believed such an ncl unconstitutional mr remond made a few remarks and a motion for a finance committee of two which was carried and s h ainsworth and j f shephard appointed such committee on motion adjourned till oclock a m on wednesday morning wednesday morning march convention called to order at o clock prayer by mr c e fisher secretarys miuutes of previous meeting read rev mr brown as chairman of the business committee reported the resolutions that follow whereas god at the creation of man gave him dominion over the fish the beasts the fowls of the air and every creeping thing but no dominion over and no power to enslave his fellow man of whatever condition or color and whereas all men were created equal and equally entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and whereas power cannot give right and if all mankind but one mao unite to enslave him they have not tbo moral power to do it and such ut exertion of power would impose on right is of no sextruth is of no color the individual no obligation to obey it and would be a violation of the la nature and of god and whereas ou government has been from its commencement a compromise of righ with wrongof liberty with slaver and such compromises should be n further extendi d and whereas it is the duty of the north american unit to its citizens their posterity to mankind to universal justice and to th almighty to stop the further extensfcr of slavery and all persons in and out of congress who are exerting themselves to promote so noble an object are entitled to the hearty thanks of tht country and the world therefore resolved that law is an intelligible principle of right necessarily resulting from the nature of man and not an arbitrary rule that may be established by men will wisdom or power that there is a necessary allegianct due to that great paramount law fron human society independent of the legislation of man and from which n human tribunal can excuse a single individual of our race resolved thst being bound b the paramount law of nature and ol god to observe and obey its edicts ai all times and in all places we hereb proclaim our unalterable determination and disregard all the pretended legislation of man which forbids us tr do unto others as we would that others should do unto us in like circumstances which forbids feeding the hungry clothing the naked relieving the distressed or helping the oppressed to the recovery of their lost rights xnd liberties wherever occasion may require resolved that slavery exists in this country by no rightful tenure by no semblance of law having its foundation in nature but in defiance ol natural justice of revelation the law of god and ail the nobler sentiments of the mind of man and that hence desiring to secure to ourselves and our posterity laws and institutions founded upon the rock of immutable right to honor our creator and preserve our race an entity far above the brute creation we are in duty bound and will continue to oppose the system of slavery be the consequences what they may to us so long as one of its diabolioal features gives signs of life or a shade of its influence remains on our statutebooks resolved that the views sf law set forth in the foregoing resolutions are fully sustained by the history of our race and more than confirmed by the spectacle now open to the view of all men all over the states of this union the existence of slavery in that section of our common country having had its legitimate effect in impoverishing the land impeding the development of the human intellect dwarfing the moral sense and transforming the masses both black and white into serfs and bondmenthe one race the most abject slaves on our earth and the oilier free only to do the will of the wily demagogues who take advantage of their ignorance to control and render them available in enlarging the area ot the slave power and still farther subverting the rights of the nominally free slates resolved that having had the dictates of common sense so painfully and shamefully confirmed by our own experience hitherto with the slave system we are wholly and totally opposed to all schemes of compromise and all devices of politicians which shall tolerate the further extension of the system or recognize it as a matter over which congress can rightfully extend the protection even of our national government resolved that no act of congress provi iing for the arrest of any of our citizens of whatever color or however humble as fugitives from slavery would possess a particle of the elements of law or be of any binding force whatever that we would disregard and resist it ourselves and mark the man who shonld enforce it among us as an enemy of manon motion tbe resolutions were re ceived mr george w clark after some remarks gave a song preamble was reread and mr shepherd objected to such formal proceedings he preferred a more natural course of discussion such as was pursued last evening mr remond objected to the preamble as being too general being based on truisms he hoped it would be adopted without much discussion it will be adopted if the meeting is properly aroused in reference to present political events the necessity ol activity was apparent the antislavery cause is the most importaut ol all and its advance does not depend on the reputation of its advocates the poor white man is as much interested in its promotion as the black man when frederick douglass was in england he on occasion openly recog nised the chartists and when i was in england one day saw a bannei approaching me in the street it i the banner of a chartist procession and when it came along joined it and identified myself with them the slave is a wronged man and the pool white man who pays his taxes to support slavery shown his relation to the infernal system it is a heart rending shame that these poor mee should be compelled to go the rounds to make attention on this aubject the clergy should have called this convention the antislavery cause in thia country i bleeding at ever pore because he clergy are dumb doge in this matter end they are properly so styled those resolutions bring out th constitutional question which i hop viu be thoroughly discussed bu the business committee in report tag those resolutions have giv jp by to tbe church and th clergy no resolution touching th relation they sustain to american slavery has found a place among them i hope some one will introduce such t resolution on bis own responsibility the fact that staves cannot vote ant nave no representatives in congress synods general assemblies nnd tht uke speaks volumes to me thb american pulpit and its occupants are fearfully guilty that persons in thi land that members of their own churches are held in bondage and innocem ulood is tjp their garments there are men who are glad to heai of mobs and who use them to the overthrow of our cause it is an unpopular cause acid these men take advantage ot the popular side and seek oui destruction but believe our caust will triumph that triumph may bt retarded may be delayed it may noi come as we wish but come it will mr remond moved the preamble bt adopted seconded by mr clark who said that the people of this country do not believe the declaration ol independence they may admit its abstract truth jut their practical construction nullifies it the slaveholder live north but the slavewhippers live south we must come back to the first principle that ail rnen are created equal and then we shall reject as barbarism the wild and guilty fantasy that man can hold properly in his fellow men the people must be educated into its principle before we can look few any of its legitimate fruits congress not long ago voted down the declaration of independence kicked it out ot the house and the people the northern people made those congressmen mr c said he was glad the preamble was as full and general as it was and wished tbe whole series of resolutions thrown before the meeting mr brown thought best to take up the preamble first and afterwards the resolutions see had no objection however to mr clarks proposal but want of definiteness it was necessary to lay down some joints that might be rallied around and acted uponc approved of tbe action of his associates on the committee and said that they purposed to bring in an additional resolution touching the church stc hoped the relations of the church on this subject would be discussed and discussed properly the motion on the adoption of the preamble was declared open for de bate mr gibbs said the principles of the preamble were so self evident as not to need much discussion but mere declarations of principleshowever important or fundamental would not fulfil the objects for which this convention was call da simple assent to the enunciation of great truths was ineffectual a belief must be practically demonstrated c agreed with mr clark that the people bf this country do not believe the declaration of independence itis the duty of every one to rebuke slavery everywherelt is prejuduce at the north that sustains slavery slavery should be called by such names us its opponents helieve its most truthful description it runs through the national character it is seen everywhere in the church in the political anti social relations he hoped a resoluton would be brought in exposing the position of the american church and clergy mr gibbs closed by saying that the life of conventions the life of freedom was in free speech the conventions then adjourned till half past one oclock p m wednesday afternoon convention called to order at half past one prayer by elder millard songs and remarks by mr clark mr brown of the business committee reported the following additional resolutions  resolved that in the late humiliating renewal of his allegiance to the slave power voluntarily proffered by danial webster we are again warned as if by a voice of thunder ol the malign influence of that power in our government and are stimulated thereby to a renewal of our vows never to desist from active hostility to slavery so long as it exists and we have strength to strike a blow or utter a liap for its extinction resolved that as abolitionists we have great reason to rejoice in the present aspect of our cause by it weare are assured that slavery must fall that our political institutions will be regenerated that man will be freewill be intelligent and will eventually arise in knowledge and moral grandeur to that sublime attitude in the scale of being for which by his semiinfinite capacities he was evidently designed by hia creator resolved that confiding in god for the success of our cause for a filial triumph we nevertheless feel to hail every colaborer in the good work with all merited commendation and to rejoice that while the hideous chains of slavery are attempted to be sustained by a calhoun the recreant voice of a webster and the gasconading of the mississippi jack ketch freedom has for hr champions a chase a hale a rochester n y friday april seward a giddings a king and a root who are both competent and ready to meet mousiei in any ano all of his protean sharper resolved that foi furtherance if the cause of liberty as well as t ustain those men in congress who an manfully batting for the right wt urge the friends of freedom every when and at once to hold conventions and t wn and district meetings for the purpose of discussion to circulate petitions for tbe of slaver wtiaftpcbrigreas has aqt soil to prohibit its spread to territory now free  resolved that we regret the position of the american church and her ministry in not coming up in hei power to the help of the friends of liberty since she is set to be the light ol the earth and the salt of the world resolved that we rejoice in trie evidences seen on every hand of a willingness among the people to listen to the story of human wrongs anr would urge upon the friends ol freedom everywhere to act no tr slavery is doomed and as intelligence shoulo precede action on this as well as other questions all means in our power tin living agent and the press especially should be sustained in tireless activity to prepare the minds of all for the great duties before us resolved that those statesmen so called in and out of congress who supppose that they can devise any means to suppress the complaints ol freemen against the system of slavery short of its total destruction can never succeed in their endeavors so long as justice and mercy are constituent elements of the human mind the day ol trucesof compromise of respites even are over and oppression must henceforth he treated and as the master vicethe deadliest curse ol human society the resolutions were received mr brown moved the whole report of tbe committee be adopted second j elder millard said that some per i sons might think too hard words would he used in reference to slavery and asked it too harsh terms could be used when the atrocities of the system were before us as in an extract from a paper which he wished to read the extract which was the case of emily russell was read w h olin alluded to the case mr remond said a few words on the same mr goodbll said that we ace just what the institution is which is said tobe guarantied by tbe constitution why can we not say with the resolutions that slavery has no lawful existence in this country if the constitution guarantied slavery it should be amended if if can be preserved only by addmitting its sanction of slavery let it bo destroyed mr remond said the majority of the american people believed in the compromises of the constitution mr g replied the conscience of the people must he awakened to the right fuloess of such compromises we must persuade them of their power to clear it of suclt compromises and then use it he can unite on these resolutions he alluded to mr sewards re speech in the senate and said that though he had not much respect for his political action hitherto he gave him honor for that speech but he regretted that in it he had made admissions in relation to the constitution that are notin keeping with the other parts there are men who do not call themselves abolitionists but he wished to know if there was one man in that assembly in favor of such a bill as lasons if there was such a man there he wished him to rise that he might see him he did not believe there was one there mr remond said that the last remark was doubtless true with regard to this audience but not of the community he hoped mr g would give a speech on the constitutional question and that no objection would be to want of time as the convention was not necessarily to close today mr goodfll said he wonld not decline such a discussion under lavor ablo circumstances preamble as reread mr goodeil said the admission in the preamble of the compromises of the constitution did not meet hts views of that instrument and suggested an amendment to adapt it to the views of himself and others and which he thought would not be objected to by mr remond he therefore moved tbe second paragraph of the peamble be amended so as to read as follows arid wh t eas our government has been wielded from the beginning in supportoi slavery and such a perversion of its principles should no longer be tolerated hia motion was seconded and it being open for debate mr good ell said that such a aub ject cannot be properly treated in so short a time but he would endeavor tobe as comprehensive in his scope as conciseness would allow there are prejudice in favor of the constitutional compromises to be overcome the decisions of the united states courts are not irrevocable one generation is not to bs bound by another lord mansfields decision in the somerset case is an instance of justice overcoming precedent a belief had existed in england previous to it of the legality of slavery as strong as at present here the urt in england had decided in several oases simular to that of somerset in favor of tbe master god is the father of us all and all men are brethren igranville sharpe who was no lawyn i said it was wrong and brought th question before lord mansfield wh after several decisions in favor of slav ry declared it illegal and from that moment a slave treading the a il ot england was free we prejudge the matter when we rely on legal decisions that decisioi affected the colonies of england ai well and the reason why slavery war not abolished at that time de faclo as it was dejvre was that no man was found up boldly as granville sharpe and insist on the recognniuu decision in every place that english law was recognized the grounds of lord mansfields decision were ist that the spirit of tht british constitution discarded the idea of property in man d that it was inhibited by the english common law that law has been decided by the united states supreme court to be our law and its use for the overthrow of slavery is apparent no parliamentary acts are to go against it the court of kings bench has repeatedly declared that parliament had not power to make certain laws and among then no law to impiar the use of the common law let u look at the origin and legality of the slavetrade queen elizabeth gave the royal consent to john hawkins to go to africa and take thence natives but with their own consent and not upon compulsion bui hawkins did not confine himselfto his permission to take them with their own consent but soon employed what he was forbidden tocompulsion the british parliament after connived at it and queen elizabeth herself is supposed to have been a party to it but there was no power in the crown to legalize compulsion and notwith stand the long toleration of the trade it was manifestly illegal pressing seamen is another illustration of the power of the common law i at one time the laborers in the country were pressed and this was done by order of the lords of admiralty the liberation of these men was demanded and obtained for the lords did not dare to bring the question before the courts parliament passed laws regulating the slavetrade and in them was one express clause fusing those who took africans compufsorly one hundred pounds yet this statute was a mere farce and so viewed at the time the decision of looked back and saw all wrofkg saw that slavery and the slave trade never had a legal existence the slavetrade was carried on in england years after the decision through technicality sharpe wrote two letters to the prime minister urging him as executive to put down slavery in the colo nies in they began the regular siege unremitting action against the slave trade was determined on and wilberforce clarkson and others pressed it till when deferred till and finally through great excitement the the bill for its abolition was carried in and because slavery was not abolished in brazil and the united states the slavetrade has doubled since v after years of effort in a discussion in parliament while mr dundas like a good many of our ova statesmen was urging the compromises of the constitution and growing pathetic in their support mr pitt for the first time springing from his seat and taking down the statute read it and declared hat the very aot used as a guaranty was in fact to destroy it and on such a discovery was the slavetrade declared to be piracy and the united states in the same year passed a law declaring it piracy it had been declared illegal once in the court of kings bench and once in parliament edwards in his history of the west indies admits that hawkins was a murderer and that the slavetrade was a horrible one a clause in the declaration of independence that was objected to by georgia and stricken out recited as a ground of complaint that the slavetrade was allowed by the english government if slavery was not legal before the constitution when did it become so when negro slaves were brought to the colonies there were no enactments there to hold them as such they had nearly their whole stock of slaves before any laws were passed declaring any one to be a slave was slavery legal under such circumstances and when the laws were passed they did not specify with sufficient care who were to be slaves virginia passed a law declaring all to be slaves who were descendants of slaves this was afterwards amended but who could tell whether such were slaves georgia which was founded by gen oglethorpe was opposed to slaverybad a charter that declared slavery impossible yet slaves were introduced by hiring from south carolina for a longterm of yearslor years or in that way and they went to importing slaves thus infracting the character in consequence oglethorpe went to england and joined sharpe is his endeavors on slavery slavery waa unlawful because contrary to british constitution under that constitution the colonies had no power to enact slave laws if their charter were silent concerning it if they were blanks so far as its prohibition went the constitution repaired all omissions the colonies had charters and in etch t clause providing that nothing in them should conflict with th british constitution those charter were our constitution before the revolution and they provided that the inhabitants of the colonies should bt allowed the privileges of english zens does the declaration of independence ins itute slavery we cjm then to our constitution its preambli is to the purpose declaring that it order to establish justice promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity we do ordain c wh this we the people of thr united states aua mm r r lx n nf people the slaves were a party to tn compact massachusetts passed an act declar mg that slaves should be held according to gods law as in the kingdom israel this act would have freed th slaves as in the laws of moses a ycai of jubilee came once in fifty years when all the captives were loosed one of the old laws of new hampshire declared that no person sho i be held as slaves but such as were brought in by their own consent thi act created no slaves as the consent ono slave would be given if he was a slave as a chattle nit consent on an question was not procurable at the formation of the constitution what afterwards took place was not contemplated the form of slavery in the northern states was very different from that in the south the idea that labor was to be confined to one class did not obtain and caste did not predominate at that early period chief justice parsons of the massachusetts supreme court decided that no legal slavery was there the declaration of independece was not repealed by the constitution it was adopted by the convention and ratified by the states it had been decided by highest judicial authority that the declaration was the supreme law of the land inthe articles of the confederation no one had been able to discover anything recognizing slavery in this constitution the word tcfofe was voted out we see that there was no legal slavery down to the formation of the constitution suppose we admit that the constitution was intended to sanction and support slavery suppose we admit that in several clauses slavery was recognized suppose that in this the convention made a mistake and assumed that there were slaves in the conntry when there were not does the constitution create slavery does it make it legal but we must look to the constitution itself we are told that the intentions of its framers were undoubtedly to recognise and support slavery and various clauses are brought forward as embodying those intentions but we learn fiom the madison and other papers that the idea of property in man was objected to be introduced in a provision of the constitution it was thought wrong that it should be introduced and this feeling was shared by slaveholders the constitution as it is was the re bult of fheir deliberations and to that alone we are to look the fugitive service clause might be construed to mean appreuticies elder millard inquired it it might not mean slaves mrbrown said it might include children mr g assented to the latter and said that no service was due to the master by the slave the clause provided that service should be due what might be conjectured is not allowable we must go by the words every witten document when brought before a court is to be construed i possible in unison with equality ana justice this rule is to be applied to the constitution what does the word persons in the clause mean under the common law the competency of all persons of legal age to make contracts is recognized and confiimed and the constitution prohibits any state from passing any bill of attainder or law impiariug the obligaiton of contracts as granting titles of nobility the slave states have passed a law declaring that a slave cannot make a contract ot course then the word person cannot apply to slaves and rfo contract existing no service is due in the use made of the secret debates in endeavoring to ascertain the intentions of members of the convention it has been taken for granted that the framers of the constitution were the people were those who finally adopted it their intentions had nothing to do with the adoption by the people admitting that they intended the constitution as the support of slavery to make such recognition legal it is necessary to prove that the people intended so too the fugitive service clause was first reported to the convention with the word the word was changed to pertont on a motion by a southern man that it might not tolerate the idea of property in man the preamble is declared in the name of the people of the united states not the white people nor the black people but the people mr remond inquired if the colored people bad any voice in the convention mr g replied that they had as much voice as agreat part of the people as much aa the womenas the aliensor as the minors aod all these were included in the word people i now pass from the question of guaranties to points sbsoiutely incompatible with slavery the constitution declares that the uuited states shall secure to every state a republican form of government this demolishes john dick punt whole ho slavery mr jenerson aennes slavery to be the most unremitting despotism on the one part and the moat degrading submission on the other h that provision of the constitution were enforced the slavery that exists in fifteen states ot this union would be de stroyed in congress protested against the shvetrade and the feeling against it was general at the south as well as north the ordinance of is one of the evidences that there was belief that slavery would soon terminate gen heath of massachusetts told the people of that state that the form r adopted by the convention was republican awe abolish slavery in pennsylvania ohio and other states the same belief was found benjamin frauklin was the president of an antislavery society about that timeand drew up a petition to congress against slavery it spoke generally tobe sure but desired measures to betaken to abolish it virginia and other states sent in similar petitions but the action against it was procrastinated and it gathered strength another provision of the constitution fatal to slavery is the one that no person shall be deprived of his liberty without due process of law every slave now held as such is deprived of his liberty without due process of law as such process to be effectual must specify distinctly and separately every indi vidual the famous dr hopkins wrote a dialogue agaiust slavery and did not admit in it the compromises of the con stitution we find no difficulty from what has been said in concluding that slavery has no legal or constitutional existence in this union n p rogers in or first broached the idea that the constitution contained no compromises with slavery alvan stewart took it up in and from that time the members of the abolition party up to the free soil movement held it h b stanton now in the stats senate and formerly of the abolition party believed it and acted on that belief several years king and other lawyers hinted at in congress when was writing my book on the constitution had occasion in the search fort books c to apply to some of the firs lawyers in the country and the doctrine was acknowledged at one time i went to the arcade to discuss the matter with some lawyers there the morning after the discussion a prominent democratic lawyer said in conversation that the argument against compromises was unanswerable only one lawyer in the united states had undertaken to answer mr spooners book and my own there are lawyers no oue doubt able to write a heavier article than wendell phillips why do we not hear from them elder mullard saidthe matter was not as clear to him on ail points ashe was anxious it should be c was not convinced the construction was an antislavery document c adduced the practical construction olthe instrument it was not until that laws were passed in the northern states to confine the action in the matter of fugitive slaves in united states officers the proslavery constitution began immediately after the addoplion of the constitution ifitwasa wrong constitution why did not those then on the tage rectifies it in relation to the declaration that the people adopted the constituion he said their veisvs were determined by those of the time mrshephard insisted on the words of the instrument the amendment to the preamble was adopted mr clark said it was a common error of men in believing that legislative enactments were law there is a necessity of discrimination between what is law and what is not in answer to a suggestion the we must be obedient to the powers that be be said that the powers that be are ordained of god and those are not he then read some extracts fro mr sewards speech mr brow made a motion that the convention hold over tomorrow car nea adjourned till half past six oclock p m free neoros or virginia the following says the richmond whig are the provisions of the bill making

aforesaid to assist id removing those who are willing to be removedthe north defeated the miscalled scheme of compromise proposed by the mississippi harlequin has been in the preliminary contest triumphantly carried in the senate the north is defeated by the votes of its own representative as she always has been and perhaps always will be we hear already the notes of triumph from northern doughface journals some bold and outspoken like the new york herald and journal ol commerce who pio elaim it a defeat also of the administration while others knowing and fearing the overwhelming sentiment of the north against this base surrender of the cause of freedom to the tender mercies of the south give expression to their joy in balfsuppiessed but significant tones that a majority of the committee of thirteen will agree upon a plan that will suit the south there is very little doubt it is composed of eeven members from slaveholding slates and six from the free states onehalf ol whom will be ready to submit to any terms a majority of the southern members rosy require ihe southern men holding the most extreme opinions on the question are messrs mason mangun king downs and berrien nearly all of whom promptly dissented from the propositions of mr clay when they were first presented to the senate and along with them the south will have cass and dickinson while ihe north containing a large majority of people of the union who are almost unanimous in favor of a law prohibiting the extension of slavery has but two or at most three out of a committee of thirteen who will represent her sentiments and from such a committee we are assured of a compromise which will command the undivided support of the south and enough votes from the north to ensure its success we wilt not say it is imoossihio majority or mis committee a fair settlement hut we frankly confess that we have no confidence scarcely a hope of such a result the public will now be anxious to know what compromisefor such it is to becalled no matter how onesided it may be this committee will present one of its provisions will no doubt be to admit california but her admission is not a proper subject ol compromise she is ours already we have won her on the very field selected by our adversaries the so ith had all the advantage she claimed but having been worsted she insists that the north shall allow slavery togo to new mexico without resistance the remaining subjects in dispute are new mexico the boundaries of texas the erection of one oi more slave states from the present state of texas slavery and the slavetrade in the district of columbia and the bill for the recapture of fugitive slaves in order to get california the north is called upon to yield on all the other points in dispute step by step we have been yielding and one by one have northern representatives been seduced from the principles which they were elected to carry out until the south has been able to triumph in nearly every conflict and the doughfaces who adocate and vote for these surrenders tell us that it is necessary to prevent dissolution this nobody believes and they do not believe it themselves it is an insult to offer an excuse w hich implies that the existence of the union depends upon the perpetuation and extensiou of slavsry the dangers which the south assures us are so imminent are not to be lessened by the unjust measures she is attempting to force though congress the agitation of the lavery question so vehemently deprecated and denounced is not thus to be quieted itis easy for those who have been for months in washington to say and possibly believe that the sentiments of the people of the north have undergone a change but all this will be found to be utter delusion the great mass of the northern people are in earnest on this question and he who supposes that an edict against its agitation w ill quell the storm will find that it only renders it more uncontrollable we have heretofore expressed a concurrence in the plan presented by the president we concur in it now and the north is ready to support it it is wise simple and effective it requires no surrender from one section ot the oiher which cannot bo made with consistency and safety but it has been treated as it deserved by but few members ot congress it has been repudiated in the senate in a manner that indicates a desire to thwart it if possible the locofocos of that body opose it because it is the administratien planweeks perhaps months aie likely to passs before we can know the disposition of a majority in the other house the prospect is not flattering but until we see the yeas and nays we will not give up all hope that the members of that body who were elected as friends of free soil and freedom have made up their minds to succumb to the dictation of the south democrat fare of slaves on plantations a more loathsome and disgusting place cannot be imagined than the huis in a negro yard of a plantation they ate generally about twenty feet square and the hands on a plantation are divided into families each of which occupies one of these pens the families number from five to twenty and the arrangements for sleeping are miserable in the extreme and what is used for their beds is seldom if ever washed or cleansed in any manner and is used until rotted or worn into shreds the same practice is pursued with their clothing it consists of a coarse wrought fsbric of cotton and wool and also of linen the men wear pantaloons and a heavy stout frock the women who work in the field wear only a long ftock without underclothes of any kind these are put on and never changed or cleansed or taken off night or day till they are worn out the provision for clothing the slaves is usually one suit a year to ea h negro and tney are generally obliged to make this last or go without but many cannot and you will ofien see negroes with only the tattered and torn rags remaining on them as evidence of a slight degree modest and shame that is manifest in keeping them abound him and thus they live in the most fiihy degraded and beastly condition that can be vrtceived and there is not single provision o a kind either in food clothing or cleanliness or tor beds or dwellings or labor but what is calculated to debilitate exhaust and destroy the physical rjwers and produce disease and death and make the assurance without the fear oi contradiction that there is scarcely a plantation in the whole range of the sugar and cotton growing districts if examined by a competent board of health that wouldnot excite their astonishment that human beings could live even an average of seven years in the first place it wtll be found that many herds of slaves are kept on short rations having allowed to each one from three to three and a half pounds of meat a week with only cornmeal which they wet with water and roast on the fire this is their regular daily food and the meat is often the most loathsome disgusting rotten mass that can be imagined on this point am aware it will be said there are but few very few indeed of such cases but it is not true and every produce dealer in the city of new orleans if he has not the fear of the planter before his eyes will bear testimony to this fact for i have seen it myself and know that they self thousands or packages weighing from eight to ten hun dred each of smoked hams and sides of j oork that were so rotten that the bones had become loose and separated from the meat and when they were opened for the examination of the planter the maggots would rollover the side of the cask upon the floor an instance of this kind saw in the store of a produce dealer in the winter of a planter from mississippi bought eleven casks of smoked meat from a tuer chant in lafayette elieet which he had purchased the day before for one and a half cents per pound he sold it to the planter for one and threefourth cents and when the casks tl

human being for he knew that a dog in new jersey could not be found but what would turn frni asked the planter why he bought such food for his negroes the planter replied that it was pretty hard times and cotton was low and the boys do about as well on it as any now in view of this i know it will be said again that such are rare cases but the reports of sales of meat in new orleans tella different account for there are hundreds and thousands of such packages of rotten putrid meat sold to planters every year and the negroes are obliged to eat it or starve and at the same time the planters tell

commencement of the antislavery enterprise have ae devoted zeal and earnest effoits of its advocates been more needed than at this the american society stands now as it did at the beginning the sole enemies through all the united states to the system of american chattel slaverythe magnitude of its work and the importance of the obstacle in the way of its rccomplishment are yearly made more and more manifest as every party and organization that have hoped to struggle against the slavepower by consenting to compromise with it successively retire from the contest either glorying in in successful treachery or submitting to shameful defeat a contest of near twenty years has pioved that the only hopeful issue with slavery is the demand for the immediate and unconditional emancipation of every slave and that such a consummation can never be attained so long as we maintain apolitical union with slaveholders the northern boundary of the slave states is the same today that it was when the american society came into existence its southern is extended westward and southward embracing vast and fertile sufficient to insure its existence for centuries to come it is something to be thankful and hopeful for that this extension has not been without a struggle and that that struggle becomes daily more and more earnest and detormined it will be entirely successful when the north is awakened to the conviction that the abolition of slavery will alone determine its extensionthat a southern and weitern boundary will no longer be contended for when its northern is destroyed the

any of our friends desire to see the whole proceedings in print we would suggest that they make arrangements at once to have them published in pamphlet form r d since our last publication a most disgraceful scene has occurred in the senate of the united states that wordy cataract hangman foote commenced his usual round ot personal abuße toward mr benton when the latter rose from his seat and approached mr foote evidently in no conciliatory spirit whereupon the supple hotspur retreated from his place into the arena in front of the clerks desk and assassinlike cocked his pistol and prepared for the bloody work of a murderer the two dignif ed senators were kept froma worse than bulldog encounter by some of their less hotheaded honorable northern brethren of course we have no american pride to be mortified by this degrading senatorial ruffianism but as a member of the human family we must deplore such demon strationsf d here is another evidence of tire decline of american prejudice

delegates to the nashville convention slavery again victorian if at any time there bare been thoee at the north silly enough to believe that in the conflict growing out of the slavery question northern politician would ultimately be successful that time has certainly transpired the recent appointment of mr footes committee of thirteenthe men of whom it is composedtnd the circumstances attending its appointment must at once put an end to all such vain and delusive hopes the event shows no contradiction to past experience northern men have ever been and we fear will ever continue to be too weak to cope with their southern superiors they ire now beaten upon their own issue and in a case where the south had scarcely a pretence to stand upon that issue is the admission of california singly and unconnected with any measures now in dispute the reasons in favor of this policy were most striking and forcible those against it feeble and farfetched yet the north has yielded and the south has triumphed california had grown up to the dignity of astate and had adopted a constitution settling for herself in a manner the least objectionable to the soaih the question of slavery or no slavery within her borders she had done so on grounds which southern men had generally declared to be the true basis notwithstanding this the south contend that r au nos no right to come into the union separately and independently as a free state without she at the same time shall drag into the union by the force of her owr claims some vast region which shall be open to the foul and withering curse of human bondage and most strange to say the first step in this unreasonable unjust and wicked exaction has received the sanction of the american senate and has been carried bj fourteen votes we scarcely know whu language to employ to express not our disappointment but our indignation at th conduct of northern men in this controversy they have basely betrayed the cause of free dnm turned

borders whose constitution shall tolerate slavery he is in favor of abolishing the prac lice of bringing slaves ihto washington oi the district of columbia to be sold for thi new orleans market but is opposed to abolishing the slave trade between the states slavery in the district of columbia he i in favor of passing a law requiring the citi sens of free states to aid in the arrest anc return of

to play he hae cut himself off from massachusetts no longei speaks in her name nor desires to represeni her views in respect to northern anc southern grievances the north is to blame northern legislators have not faithfully performed their constitutional pledge to returr the fugitive to bondage and he avows hit intention to vote for masons bill converting every stripling of a post master

into the good graces of the slave powef and the nexttell it not is bright of indiana who in every contest between freedom and slavery since he had a seat in congress has been found the ready ally of the human fleahmongers we repeat can anything favorable to freedom bo expected from this committee such an expectation would be the height of folly a committee could not have been well selected more hostile to the cause of free soil and free men there is not a man on it who will expresa the mind of the liberal portion of the north not one in whom the north has the slightest confidence they are every man ol them candidates for southern approbation and none among them believe that the insulted north has the manliness or spirit to chastise them for their treason and in thi they are perhaps right for it ha always seemed that those who stand best with the south are the most lauded at the north hence wily politicians have sought first the approbation of the south as a means of gaining and holding places of power and emolument at the north it is impossible to say what thi committee will dowhat scheme of compromise they wilt submithow far they will presume upon the avarice stupidity and corrupt moral sentiment of the northand to what exent their plans maybe opposed remains to be seen but of one thing there need be no doubt and that is that the north in this mstauce ms in all previous ones will be driven to the wall she has not the elements of character in her representatives to withstand the assaults ol her southern masters she fettered by the alleged guarantee and compromises of the constitution she is entangled in the network of past legislation and she rolls under the horrid nightmare that the union isin danger she goes therefore to the coo flirt with the certainty that she shall eventually yield the contest she goes without energy and to have her ranks speedily confused humbled panicstruck and finally defeated r d mcgrewrille college this institution appears now to be on the full tide of auccessful experiment we believe it is at present the only institution of the class in this state baaed upon the principle of human equality at its very commencement it placed its heel upon the ven omoua viper of american prejudice against color by electing a colored gentleman to fill one of its most important professorships weare happy to learn that that gentleman has thus far discharged the duties of his profession in a highly creditable manner and at this time he commands the respect and esteem of the entire institution it is easy to see that a college established on such a foundation is far more entitled to support han any which may offer education to the colored man on terms which must exclude him from the society of white persons and stamp him as a king of a different if nota degraded class it may sometimes be necessary to establish schools for the especial education of colored young persons but this necessity can never be pleaded where free access can be had to school open tor the accommodation and instruction of all we certainly wish every success to mcgraw ville college and we would suggest to auch of our readers as have sons and daughters tobe educated that they cannot do better than patronise mcgrawville colleger d separate school system we are grieved to have to state to our readers that notwithstanding the vety powerful plea of charles sumner esq and the many efforts made by our colored fellowciti zens in boston and elsewhere to have the odious and needless separate colored schools abolished the supreme court of massachusetts has made a decision leaving the question of the continuance or discontinuance oi such schools to the option of the schoo committees in the several towns of that commonwealth thus practically refusing a jurisdiction in the matter and leaving oui colored brethren in that state without the slightest protection of law against the ignorance caprice and prejudice of auch personi as may happen to be appointed on the common school committees the following remarks on this decision are from the neu englander prejudice goes a great way in preventing the acknowledgment of the rights of the col oied citizens and on this point we are fret to say we do not believe any practical inconvenience will experienced from the distribution of the colored children in the bchooh of the city such has not been the result in other cities and towns of the state nowhere in the commonwealth save in boston are they excluded in salem where the colored people are nearly as numerous as here their children attend school with tht white children so in new bedford and lowell and without inconvenience or difficulty the same is true of worcester cambridge roxbury charlestown and ol all the towns of the state in very many ol which there are more or less colored people several colored men have been educated ai our highest academies and colleges and havt graduated with the fullest honors but wt need not further speak on this point of one thing we are certain were we ir colored resident sharing in the responsibili i ties of citizenship contributing our proportior to the support of the municipal government we would give no cessation to our efforts anc our agitation till this stigma upon our socia position this violation of our undoubtet rights was removed and atoned for tn the equal privilege of our children with tht whiles to all the advantages which the citt affords in its system of public education correspondence we are highly gratified to state that weare receiving letters from friends in man directions expressing their deep interest ir the north star paper and offering their cooperation for the extension of its circulation we select one or two extracts the first is from the pen of an aged lady in ohio she says i have taken some pains to scatter my papers the north star and the practical christian and i hope they will prove as bread cast upon the waters found after many days i have from my childhood been a friend of the colored race always sympathising with them in their innumerable woes and sufferings which can neither be told by tongue or pen nor conceived of by the imagination when i think of the tears the sighs the groans of the oppressed which no doubt react to high heaven ido not marvel that jefferson should thus express himselfl tremble for my country when i reflect that god is just and that his justice cannot sleep forever i do not expect to see the day when the blest jubilee shall be sounded being now in my th year but expect to die in the full faith that it will be done i have no mors doubt ol it than i have that the israelites were released from their eruel bondage in egypt mary watson the second is from a gentleman in connecticut he says your paper the north star has accidentally fallen into my hands of late i am much pleased with the paper i believe that it is intended to do much good as the northern polar star is to the bondman of the south a beacon to liberty so this paper isin my estimation designed to kindle within the bosom of the colored people the spirit of liberty and to make the oppressor tremble t shall encourage our oppressed people to subscribe for your paper as far as i possibly an j cogswill another friend writes from north dighton mass permit me to express my full and hearty approval of the manner and ability with which the paper has been conducted during the past year and to expresa a hope that it will be conducted in fpture in the same fearless and independent spirit and provo the means under jdivine providence of restoring our much injured colored brethren to their just rights for it is a time of all others to stand firm when our able northern statesmen are recreant to their duty and quite under the influence of that cursed system slavery jxivrs shove we have a number of other highly gratifying testimonials to the same effect which it is needless to publish we feel assured tbit if our friends in different parts of the country will make suitable exertion the ivorta star paper can be easily placed upon a permanent foundation r d wt copy the following address from the associated baptist churches of yorkshire england that our reader may see in what light those churches and ministers tegard slavery and the malignant prejudice against the colored man it is highly gratifying to receive such testimony from those who are beyond the contaminating atmosphere which here surrounds the system of human bondage the churches and ministers of this land are so entirely under the dominion and power of this abomination that they possess not the requisite morel energy to battle for its overthrow the pulpit is dumb and the church is drunk with the blood of the slaver d the associated baptist churches of yorkshire england to their brethren of the same faith and order in the city and country of philadelphia and in the free states of noith america generally send christian salutation dear brethren jyaßw a coloied brother and ththlmer of christ ftom amongst you mr jeremiah asher has visited us to solicit rrintritlijuiii lull ujj discharging the debt on his chapel cordially responding to your highly respectable recommendation and to the claims of his case we have contributed as we trust you will think liberally towards it we feel constrained however to embrace this oppoituni ty of remonstrating with you our brethren inyhrist on the strange inconsistency of the treatment which our and your colored brethren receive at your hands and the strange difference between their treatment here in england and in ihe free states of the union ws have listened with interest to his preaching and he has been gladly welcomed everywhere both tcaur pulpits and to the firesides of every class of society we think that you brethren must agree with us that we owe a debt to our colored brethren which it is not only our dutybut highly to our honor to discharge and that in no way can we better discharge it than by showing to them our love as brethren in christ and by avoiding every word or deed and even suppressing every feeling which could make them painfully sensible of the grievous wrong which our progenitors have done to them brethren we ate confident that you must as christians often feel that you bring no small guilt on your consciences in allowing yourselves concur wtth the children of this world in keeping your moat injured brethren in christ at so great a social distance and in so depressed a condition if the world can without compunction refuse them equal social intercouise and practically hold them down to servitude though not in slavery it must violaie brethren your conscience and every christian feeling to do likewise brethren we earnestly exhort you to breakthrough these meciy conventional yet sinful habits and to honor your master by your treatment of his servants be not ashamed of the brethren of christ because the world is so but let your light on this subject shine before men worthily of your profession happy indeed should we be to see our baptist brethren foremost in america not only ir the emancipation of the colored people from personal slavery but in the emancipation of freemen of color from social degradation in educating them and elevating them by every possible expedient and foremost too in emancipating themselves from a specie of pride so iriaiional so vujgar and so unchristian as that of pride in difference of color although brethren you assign your libe rahty to voluntary emigrants from europe as the cause of your inability to aid mr ashers case we must beg to remind you of twu things first that colored men now in america are in the land of their birth therefore in their home and that charity should begin at home and next that their color attests that they are the children of compulsory emigration whose ancestors were dragged by yours from their fatherland and that your fathers heavy debt to thus unhappy emigrants it is surely a sacred duty on your part to repay to their ciijdfep we trust therefore that our heartily expressed sympathy with mr asher will m t induce you to send to us other colored brethren on a similar errand it would assuredly lead to disappointment we hope on the contrary it will only stimulate you to contribute yourselves in aid of your eolored fellowcountrymens spiritual wants and also to elevate yourselves to the measure of the stature of the fulpesa ofcbrist by elevating these his brethren and your brethren to your ewn social standing we are beloved brethren yours

and american people slaveholders and slave traders and all are particularly anxious to make haiti appear before the world as feeble indolent and falling to decay these representations are generally received through new orleans papers and they reach the northern mind through the new york herald and kindred publica tisns yet facts do occasionally leak out even through these channels quite contradictory to the dilapidated pictures which they are wont to draw we see it stated that that government has lately purchased two brigs one danish and one swedish and that bufc ess is improvingthat there is a great deal of logwood in the market and that coffee has begun to come into portauprince in laige quantities but these items are not allowed to reach the american public without a fling at his imperial highness faustin ist he is said to delight in show and parade rides round the city attended by some of his principal officers and a bodyguard of dragoons and the citizens receive his black majesty with uncovered heads as he passes now what is there in sll this peculiar to a black sovereign what evidence is there in it of an especial love of show does it indicate any greater love of parade than the raeie etiquette would do in the case of a white sovereign those who would make such conduct appear ridiculous might find illustrations on a more uragnifleent calein every european

our best acknowledgments to the hon w h seward and the hon john p hale for valuable congressum documentsr we copy the following extract containing a portion of the debate which occurred in the senate on the th inet on mr benton motion to instruct mr footes committee of thirteen to consider the admission of california independently and unconnected with all other questions arising out of the subject of slavery this debate shows that mr clay has not forgotten bow to play the dictator and that be is practically whatever may be the character of bis hpavt the most dangerous foe with which the cause of human freedom in this country has to contend r o mr miller wish to make a suggestion in regard to the amendment of the senatoi from kentucky it appears to me to be ou of order and net coming within the rules oi the senate the senator from missouri proposes to amend the original resolution by the adoption of certain instructions to the committee proposed to be raised the senatoi from kentucky moves to amend that amendment by striking it out and to declare in substance that no instruction shall be given to the committee so that the amendment not only btrikea out the amendment proposed by the senator from missouri but if adopted it declares that no further instructions on any other point shall be given to the committee now can that be done if it can i mistake the rule in regard to a bill suppose this amendment is offered to a bill and a senatoi movea to strike out all of the amendment and to substitute in lieu thereof a declaration that no further amendment shall be made to the bill can that be done the amendment goet further than the amendment offered by the senator from missouri for it not only strikes out his amendment but declares that no further instructions shall be given on any othet point now by the rules of the senate when a resolution or bill is under consideration it may be amended at any time and we cannot declare by an amendment that no further amendment shall be made to the bill neither can we declare that no other or further instructions shall be made to a committee we can strike out these instructions but we cannot by an amendment declare that there shall be no ether amendment mr clay of all unprofitable subjects these questions of parliamentary law and usage are the most so i have had sir in anothei branch of this legislature some little experience on this subject but sir what is the objection which the senator from new jersey makes upon the ground of order to my proposition the senator from missouri proposes to affirm certain instructions which propose to negative now are we not at liberty to vole in the negative upon those in sttuclions well if we have a right to vote against them have we not a right to put that negative in the form of an amendment and vote for it but i will state a case which every man of three days service in a deliberative body understands perfectly well a report is made by a special committeefor example on a claim it concludes resolved therefore that the claim ought to be allowed now is anything mor common in a legislative body than to strike out the words ought not to and to insert the words should be every man at all acquainted with parliamentary laws knows that if a new subject is propo sedone which has no connection with theone under coneideraiionit is not in order but whether thev are substitutes for the amendment or propositions to amend it they theyate precisely the same they relate tc instructions to the committee the amendment of the senator from missouri pioposei to give such and such mstiuction to the committee my amendment says that the senate will give none and n is perfectly germane to the subject and perfectly consistent with all parliamentary law that ever heard of in any deliberative body mr miller ido not make this point ol order in any captious spirit and the senatoi fm kentucky has not understood the point i make ido not object to this motion that itis a negative of the proposition made by the senator from missouii the senator is per fenlly correct there but his amendment goes further and cuts off all furthet instructions that the senate may think proper to give tc the committee that is the point six mr clay that is the design of the amendment and i ask of the senator from new jersey who i am glad has given up half of his objection mr miller i have not given it up for i never made that a which the senator re fers mr clay i understood ihe senator from new jersey to object first that my piopoai tionjwas a negative to affirmative instructions now i undetsiand him to say his objection is not that it comprehends all that was offered by the senator from missouii but that it laps a little over that in other words it declares we will give no instructions to the committee and has not the senate the right to da thatto say that it will give no such instructions and has it not a tight either through the medium of an amendment or in any othei form there cannot be a doubt on the subject mr miller that is the very point i wish to raise before the senatewhether the senate by an amendment to a bill or resolution can declare that it will not give any instructions to a committee mr benton in bis seat thats it sir mr miller that is ihe question cana senator when an amendment ia offered toa bill move to strike out the amendment and declare subsequently that no amendment shall be offered to the bill can you in a resolution where an amendment is offered tp instruct sttike out these instructions and declare that no other shall be given why we have on the table several other instructions offered by the senator from missouri and are they to be cut off mr foote in his seat they have not yet been offered but merely suggested mr miller i may think proper to offei instructions or other senators may so intend and it cannot be done if this amendment u adopted the vice president the chair will consider the point of order aa raised mr king i hope the chair will decide it the vice president the chair is ol opinion that the objection is not well taken the amendment which proposes to restrict the action of the committee is moved to be stricken out by another amendment that is clearly in order it is then proposed to substitute in lieu thereof the declaration that the sanate do not deem it necessary to express in advance any opinion or give any instruction either general or specific for the guidance of said committee the utmost that can be said of the amendment is that it decides nothing and if it expressed nothing but the mere motion it would leave the matter just where it was left before the amendment was proposed therefore lliough it may be a consideration to induce a senator to vote against it it is sot a question upon which to raise a point of order as to ka reception mr benton this which is called an amendment and which strikes me as being nothing bat a rule of action which the senate ia called upon to adopt for itself was objected to by me aa being nopai liamentary at the time it was offered but i was so onfor oate as not to make the point of my objection fntelligibie i will endeavqpr to do so now sod let it be seen that here is mr king if the senator intends to discuss the question of order he must appeal from the decision of the chair in the absence of any such appeal the decision is binding upon the senate and every senator ia bound to acquiesce in it the senator from missouri therefore if be is dissatisfied with the decision must take so appeal before he can discuss the point of order mr benton what i say is for the sen lit sad not by way of appsal the vic president dow tbe senator ppmit mr bn row i am speaking merely toth senate and not by way of appeal f w speaking on the proposition submitted by tbe senator from kentucky and i mean to give re ip n i tt p r b surewhy uahould not be adopted take that to be in the vtc pafiaidemt ye j r mr wh thing it i cannot teach i can be ta üb ht yes air here is a proposition which is jjjl ed an amendment that the sepate does not deem it necessary to express in advance any opinion or giro any instructions either gen or specific tor the guidance of said committee now here is a declaration rery proper perhaps lo be adopted in a caucus but not belonging to the senate at all by which ihe senator asks that the senate shill cut it mi kr uu y ok ing amendments to bills and resolutions whiu going throughthe body all this might do in caucus but it wih not do in the senate the senate does not deem it necessary whv not deem it necessary to giro any inatruc uona at all on any subject to the commie it is a committee as is frequently proclmpi edthough its appointmentia not yet enteßdßk on the journal composed of distinguished and leading men and it may be that they have all the wisdom of the senate in their ha n d l an a u at rhen j u ey nothing will be left behind and all the rest of the senate pul together can give them no information all this may be so but it is the first time that tbe ameiican senate was ever called upon to make such a declaration jt j not toduit m advance why not do it in advance has not the senate been in tbe practice of giving instructions to committees from the foundation of the government to the present day is it not done in regatd to alt committees whenever senators choose and was it ever proposed before to tie up the hands of the senate by a previous declaration that they will not give opinions in advance they may give them afterwards and may agree to what may be done but beforehand the body of the senate is to do nothing itis not to give any instructions either general or specific for the guidance of the said committee sir the objection is well taken by the senator from new jersey that this goes beyond the amendment which i have offered and which is before the senate it goes beyond what is before the senate and declares at once that no mattet what amendments any senator may have in his bosom no matter what may be offered the senate will not consider them this sir is a new declaration to be made in the american senate and one of those which if it pass will pass after going through such parhamentaiy forma as will matk it as an epoch in our parliamentary history sir it is a new method of applying the previous questiona question never applied in this body it is a new method of applying the gaga thing never done in this body it is a new way of stultifying the whole body of senators except thsse who go out on the committee sir all this is new and is it not as impotent as it is new supl pose it is adopted suppose the senate restore itself into what seems tome to be nothing more than a caucus and adopt this resolution what next the moment these have adopted it has not every member here a parliamentary right to offer amendments on the spot regardless ot what the senate has decided upon the attempt is impotent we have a right to offer instructions after inatruc tions and when offered the only way for the senate to do if it will not adopt themis to refuse them that is to vote them down when presented that is the only waythe only sensible method li the senate adopts this lesolution that it will not give any instructions they cannot get rid of the question we have the right every one of us while wa remain senators to offer our piopositioos for instruction and i presume there will be enough to offer those instructions and test their parliamentary right to do so and senator will be brought to the point on each in inst action for itself while there is enough to call the yeas and nays to vote on each for itself ah this must be apparent and now sir why persevere in endeavoring to get ai declaration from the senate which is to cutoff a parliamentary proceeding when you cannot do it it will end in impotency of that gentleman may rest assured it is the first time that ever such a thing was attempted in the american senate it is cutting us off from deliberation it ia cutting us off irom our right of instruction and it is forestalling debate it is an assumption the like of winch never before was known in this body now bir this great committeewe have had their names in the newspapers though they have not yet been elected by the sentie grant that they have ail the wisdom of tbe senate aud will carry it out w ith them yet the senate is not to declare upon this proceeding that it could give them no instruction they are not to adopt a resolution which admits that the senate cannot enlighten them at all it is not for the senate to say that they would sit here in egyptian darkness until the committee comes in aod illuminates the chamber and now if it should be the fact that everything ia ready that the report ia ready and that the committee have nothing to do in the world after it goes out but to come back againlike the french king who marched up the hill and down againif such should be the case would it not better become the ameiican senate that it should produced and let us have the illumination at once would it not be better to produce the report at onceand act on this bill for the adtmasion ofcajilornia as it came along sir the going out of that committee from this chamber might excite alarm throughout the country what do we suppose if we see a physician hastening to the hquse why that somebody is sick there but we ate not yet alarmed but if we see two doctors going there we suppose the case its difficult one and if we see four fivesixor seven doctors collecting at the house we conclude iramedi aiely that somebody is dying at that bouse now sir if this great number of political doctors are to sit on the body of the republic what will the country suppose but that the poor republic is at the last grasp and that it take thirteen doctors to sit upon the case and save the patient sir it is to alarm the country i tell you from this proceeding there must be an alarm or there must be a laugh one or the other there must be from the sublime to the ridiculous is only ooe step and what in this case must have convulsed tbe country in the beginning has now got where a step wouid cover it with ridicule sir suppose this committee goes oot and comes back with a report and suppose it is nothing more nor less than o convert this senate into the old ijjacksmith shop at gretna green and making them join parties together whether god ever sanctioned it or not suppose the committee comes back with a report cut and dried for the purpose of joining to california four or five measures which the senate and tbe house have been talking of for four or five months past suppose they bring back nothing but what ia already prepared and which is upon all our tables in wbat position will this great committee be we have read of the mountain that was in labor and that was delivered of a mouse but it was at least a live mouse for tbe fable says it but heie it seems that gentlemen are to bring out something that has been lying on oar tables so long that it is deada combination of measures which has been so longhorn that they are lying helpless in their cra dles sir there ia no medium the country if not alarmed moat laugh but lam against making what is equivalent to a proclamation declaring tbe country in danger the sending out ol such a committee as tbw is precisely equivalent to tbe senates tasking a proclamation in solemn form thst the republic ml in danger and then almost giving jhe dietahirial power of mamg tht republicattained to a committee i am again making this proclamation ido not belien the republic it in danger today i believt there has been aome danger but that danger has passed by and to be providing a remedy now would be the providing of a remedy for what has past i do not hold that the country is in danger now and i do not think that we ought to undertake to alarm the country by the solemn form of setting thirteen physicians to consult over the critical and dying condition of the stale and tocome in with a nostrum to save her w hy air it will be a very ludicrous thing if this committee shall come in with our old nostrum if they should come in with a scheme to join all these bills together it will put us in a ludicrous position and one in which we ought not to be placed if gentlemen wish to unite other measures with california lei them take up the california bill and then offei those propositions and the opinion of the senate can be taken upon them as the senator from kentucky intimated some days ago when i complimented him upon proceeding in such a manly and parliamentary manner that is the right way to do now sir ibis thing which is called an amendment but which is nothing but a declaramn an independent resolvesuch a one as would b perfectly proper to be adopted in a cause but which cannot be adopted in the senatethis independent resolve that we will give no instructions of any kind whatsoever to guide the committee why siralthough the senate may vote it they cannot prevent us ftom undertaking to give instructions to guide the committee and although in point ol fact no one of us may be able to suggest an instruction that could guide this great committee yet in the parliamentary sense we canun der the parliamentary law we have a tight to offer instructions to guide the committee and who is it mi president that makes this motion that the committee shall not bs guided i hope no one of the thirteen where to be on that committee undertakes to maintain this resolution for sir although ii may be true true as gospel that they are superior to the rest of the senate and that we cannot guide them at all yet they should not tell us so it is we who should disqualify ourselves and no one of that thirteen in my opinion should vote delicacy reserve decorum should make them btand off and refuse to vote for a resolution which would stultify all the other members of the body they should leave it to ourselves to sluitily ourselves i have taken up more time than i intended on this preliminary point i consider wholly nugatory that after whal is called an amendment but is nothing but a tesolve to govern the action of the senate shall be voted upon and adoptedas it may be though i think if the thirteen gentlemen who are to compose the committee will abstain from voting it will not be adopted and really delicacy think should forbid them to vote after all that is done i say it is nugatory for we shall undertake to exercise our parlimen tary right of offering instructions and we think that some of us have been here just about long enough to know how to do it and to get a vote upon every instruction in some form or other that lies upon the table and upon every ina ruction that ntay hereafter be offered  mr clay i am very sorry mr president for this unneessary consumption of the time of the senate but their are two or three remarks which the honorable senator from mistouii has made which seem to require aome notice the honorable senator has spoken of a caucus and intimated that there hsajbeen one on w hat authority does the set ator make such an assertion i now pronounce it a mistakean absolute and entire mistake there has been no caucus that i know of although god knows would attend a caucus of any and everybody to settle this most unhappy question which is now distracting the country and i would attend it without any feeling of reproach from whatever quarter it might be ventured to be hurled the honorable senator speaks of his rights yea tr and other senators have their rights also and other senators are just as well ptepared as the senator from missouri is to assert their rights and the senate has its tights now sir i put it to the senate and the country what has been the progress of this matter the senator from missouri proposes an amendment embtacing our pmpoaitions and ass sort of menace suppose he shells out eight or ten others and speaks of his having others yet in reserve well rny dear sir mr president i mean has not this a right to protect itself has not the majority of tins senate a right to say whether they will or will not create a committee withoutaoy instructions the resolution will be adopted the senator offers his set of amendments for the purpose i will not say because i have no right to go into the intention of the senator but the effect of them would be delay procrastination embarrassment and that effect it attempted or will be attempted to be pronounced against these distinct and emphatic expressions of the opinion ot the majority of this body the question then comes to thiswhether the senate shall or shall not have the powerl speak always of the majority of the senate to act say sir it ought to have it and i care not by what name you call it the previous question ah sir not many years will elapse before you will find the indispensable necessity of pis valuable mode ofterminating a useless and nniecessary debate in this house in my reflections upon the past in respect to my par hmentary careermy congressional career look back to none with more satisfaction than the introduction of that previous question in the other wing of this building but sir it seems that all at once there has been some extraordinary violation of the rights of the senator and w hat is it t that we create a committee witijou tgiving that committee anv inflectionsa thing which happens everyday and sometimes two or three limes a day of the session either in this honse or in the other now sir is it not known that if you tefei a subjdkt to a committee you must to some extent confide in that committee un trammelled unshackled to the exercise of its best judgment for at lautwhen it does anything it is reported back to you subject to your decision to your power to your control sir what was dene with the committee proposed in the caee of the very state which the senator represents appointed in the other hojse in the year l t were any instructions given to that committee not one was any embarrassing mode of procrastination attempted on that occasion and afterwards in relation to the constitution of the committee that happened which had never happened before and which perhaps will not happen again for many years when proposed in the houaesof representatives the constitution of a joint committee to consist of twentythree on the part of the house and s suitable number on the part of the senate to consider the question of california of missouri i mean why sir it is not at all extraordinary that i speak of california for if we listen to the honorable senator on the other side of the house their are no united slatescalifornia has absorbed everything laughter when proposed a joint committee of twentythree on the part of the house and a suitable number on the p rt of the senate was there any motion in other body to instruct to manacle to chain down that committee no sir they were left free as sir to explore through the whole region of patriotic intellect for the purpose of devising a mode by which that unhappy question should b settled sir bat i proposed the hon orabte senator has several times talked and presented in his wtuy and humorous manner the figure of a horse borne dowo by a grievous weight cast upon its back why air the senator kaowa perfectly well that the whole amount of whatis intended by anybody is to connect and combine together the government of territories acquired in common and establish for these territories a form of government adapted to their respective situations and sir what is the condition of the ease let us look at the facts there is a certain portion of this body that is for california give u california california and nothing bnt california there is another portion of this body and of congreaa that says we sre willing to give you california but we want something more than californiawe want to establish governments for a people thrown by the vicissitude of war and of political events under our care and to my utter surprise i have heard senators upon this floor express theop inion that we should leave all new mexieo and all utahnew mexico with a population of and a militaryyes i have heard whigs express the opinion that we should leave the military government which is in operation in new mexico to continue whigs who denounced the existence of the milittry government established under the authority of the late administration during a season of war and yet now in a state of profound peace it is proposed to pass cslilornia and leave new mexico and utah to take care of themselves sir it is contrary to every obligation of duty resulting from the treaty resulting from the constitution resulting from the position and character which we hold as american statesmen and legislators and as soon as leave new mexico and utah without government of all others the portions of that country the most in want of governments i would as a father as lief turn out tny son at the age af fifteen into the streets of a corrupt city and say to him go my boy take care of yourself until you are twentyone and then come back to me and i will tell you what honorable vocation in life to select sir it is our duty our bounden our solemn duty to make at least an attempt to establish governments for utah and new mexico and if we cannot do it after making the effort we shall stand reproachless for not having done it if we cannot do ii it will be the tesult of difference of opinion unfortunately existing amongst us which will prevent its being done ths error of thoes senators who talk of leaving utah and new mexico to their fate is exactly this they begin where they ought to end begin to discharge your duty try to make governments for these territories and if you fail to do it you will stand unrepruached in the eyes of god and man in having made the effort to discharge your duty have said ihat one portion of congress wants california and nothing but california another portion whilst for bringing in california says let us settle this distracting question let us establish territorial governments without the proviso and connect them with california and why shonld not we doit i have heard the dignity of california alluded to as if all the gold and dignity of the nation had sought refuge and sought an asylum on the shores of the pacific i have been utterly unable to comprehend this dero fation irom the dignity of california sir go for both measures both ought to be carried both in iqv opinion ought to be associated together and do not see the slightest evidence of disrespect to california or to anybody else in doing it sir i tramed rhis lesolution deliberately and framed it for the purpose of getting rid the unnecessary instructions which the sen of ator from missouri has proposed and to dispose of any other instructions which his in genuityand no man possesses greater amount of it than he doesmight suggest to be brought before this body let my amendment lie adopted and let the senator offer his other instructions from one to uinlynine if lie pleaces and we will see whether the question of order will not silence them all mr mr president the state ol california is not here and unless somebody stands up for her it seems likely that she will go to the wall for she not only gets hard knocks but she gets also what is called thumps she is spoken of today as absorbing the whole united slates so far as see she only wants to get in among the united statesto be one of the thirtyone and to be the last of the thirtyone that is all i can see in her wants but the senator from kentucky not only presents california in this aspect but he presented her some days ago in an attitude which did not then remark upon and which should not do now but lor the manner in which he has brought her up today it was said by the senator from kentucky lhe oilier day that california had made a runaway match and now turned up her nose at her unmarried sisters welt sir if she did make a runaway match she did not marry a runaway negro and if her unmarried sistera should marry ipto that family it may be that when they come about her and into her company she may noi only turn up her nose but biiub their noses california has made a constitution for herself and in that constitution she has left out slavery in every form and ihe proposition now to unite her with the fugftive slave bill mr clay will the senator allow me to say that there is no such proposition m benton the senator form kentucky it is due to him to say has in his speeches disclaimed it but the senator from kentucky eminent as he is and leading as he ia is not the record the motion is to refer two sots of resolutions one is the honorable senators own set of resolutions and the other that of the senator from tennosaee mr bell and those two sets of resolutions do include the subject of runaway negroes and the oiigina motion now pending wilt cairy with it all these subjects here is a proposition then to unite california with a subject of w hich she has washed tier hands and which has already delayed iher is now delaying must continue to delay her and may m the end lead to her rejection she will have nothing to do with the slavery question there is nothing in her constitution about slavery because she did not wish to have it impede her admission into the union but if the territorial measures are to be added and those measures are to have the question on slavery mixed up with them then we shall have a question brought up by which the whole admission of california after being delayed for such a length of lime may be lost in disagreement between the two houses sir i cannot be driven off the tiack by hearing it urged that there is nothing in this proceeding injurious or derogatory to california in my opinion it is both injurious and derogatory injurious already in the delay it has created dangerous in the conjunction which it may make of questions which may result in a disagreement between the two houses and by which she may be lost we all remember the oregon bill and the contest between the two houses on that bill the honorable senator from kentucky says that it may become necessary toinuoduce the previous question here whenever the senate by resolve shall introduce the previous ques tnn here though i shall struggle against ths adoption of it as have done heretofore fo the utmostfor i go for full debate in this chamberyet whenever the senate adopts the previous question shah submit to it but until the senate adopts it will resist its unauthorized and disguised execution upon this body sir we now have it admitted that here is the previous question in a different form from that which is known to the pailimentary law that here is ths previous question intended to cut off all amendments everything in the world which the previous question contains except the form and except the rule of the house which leads to it it is now a bastard rule surreptitiously introduced and attempted to be forced upon ua by a declaration that the senate will not pass upon any amendment it is the previous question sir and t is moat revolting and if it were anybody else then the eminent senator from kentucky who had proponed it should av that it was a most uuparlimentary motion but mr president this committed ia togo out for compromise now what is a compromise and how long are such things kept what was the validity of toe compro miae made between the senator from kentucky and myselfhow long was it inviolable i offered a aet of resolutions which i deemed good ones the senator from kentucky got up and moved to have them amended by stituting another aet i did not think nia equal to my own at all but in the s p mt compromise i accepted them and did whata compromiaev ought to do immediately give up his own and yet what is the state of the case today i thought then that the senator from keutucky was going to vote for his own amendment i thought he waa going to accept the compromise which he had made and yet today sir lie flies from that amendment he does not stand to it he objects to the whole of his own amendment which i accepted the other evening in a spirit so conciliatory that it ought to have brought us all to harmonious conciliation now sit we are going to have another compromise a plan of compromise with this experience of compromising before our eyes i have no great faith in compromises at any time there are compromises in the constitution they are fundamental they are premanent they are obligatory weare sworn to observe them and these compromises i wish religiously to keep but as for these which seem to me like the compromises of lovers made one evening to be broke the next morningas for these compromises which i referred to really after this exper iencethis i would say flagrant experience in the face ol the senate between myself and the senator from kentuckyl do think tha the idea of bringing a compromise into this body ought to be abandoned altogether mr president we ask the yeas and nays upon this motion and if the senators resolu tionfor i can call it nothing hut a resolution for the guidance anctconduct of the senate shall be adopted we shall immediately undertake to test it and to see whether the rules in your book are not in forcr which allow senators to offer instruction and we are entitled to a vole upon this resolution and which cannot be laid on the table without carrying the whole subject with it the yeas and nays having beenordered on the amendment of the senator from kentucky was carried so the senate refused to instruct the committee the antislavery bugle has the following classification of parties elected to the constitutional election of ohio the democrats will have a decided majority in this body the parties will stand democrats whigs freesoilers the democrats claim to be the friends of equality now let us see if they will allow all the people without distinction of sex or color equal rights at the polls if there ia anything more hollow or knavish than that democracy which deprives women and negroes of all voice in the making of laws to which they are held amenable we confess we dont know where to find it congressthe senate was engaged throughout yesterday in discussion a resolution offered by col benton

the suspicion that he waa deceiving the girl with the intention of carrying her off to virginia and selling her as a slave the girl on being questioned said that sheformerly lived with a gentleman in columbiana miles east of salem and had been at olierlin at school the man was a citizen of the latter place named taylor who being under the necessity of going to columbus for his wife had agreed for a consideration to come this way for the purpose of conveying the girl toher old home according lo the girls story he had offered her the grossest insults on their way to this place and her statements were confirmed by his indecent behavior toward her while here some of the colored people becoming acquainted with the circumstances interposed to save her from his brutality and perhaps from being kidnapped and sold as a slave the name of the girl is caroline white and we will thank any friend at oberlin who will give us such information as will serve to thiow light upon the character and plans of taylor if he is a kidnapper the people of that place ought to know it we know enough already to pronounce him an unfit companion for any respectable woman anti slavery bugle emily the beautiful

weeks paper may we not hopa for a continuance of such favors f dmadame roland before the tria and execution ofthe girondists m roland had effected his escape and taken refuge with some friends at rouen madame roland had been informed of the place of his retreat aud found the bitterness of her imprisonment alleviated jiy the joy she experienced in reflecting that her husband was surrounded by faithful friends her heart was also tranquilized in the midst of the perils which had gathered around her by the tidings that her daughter had found a home with one of her most devoted friends and that thus in the bosom of a happy family she was encircled by almost maternal love the girondist party though their leaders had been guillotined was still powerful in france madame roland was its idol and a kind of chivalrous enthusiasm rallied many generous hearts around her the jacobins with robespierre at their head deemed it necessary to confirming their power that this idol should be destroyed when robespierre first came to paris a modest young man madame roland met him and discerning his talents took him by the hand and his republican zeal he often met with the little circle of distinguished men who surrounded the table in madame rolands library in their long evening conferences and the next day he would speak eloquently in the convention when his companions could not fail to perceive that his ideas and his expressions even were those which he had gleaned from the eloquent lips of his distinguished female friend but gradually he withdrew from the girondists in the waning of their power and took an undisputed position at the head of the jacobin party now so rapidly in the ascendant robespierre was a stoic and had steeled his heart against every kindly sympathy with no ap arent relentings he signed thewarrant which jvas to bring that friend who had so beneficently smiled upon him and before whose attractions he had so often bowed to trial and as he wel knew to the guillotine madame roland was now committed to the prison of iabbaye to wait her trial notwithstanding all her fortitude and the heroic composure with which she was able to contemplate the violent death which was approaching she could not refrain from yielding at times to floods ot tears as she reflected upon her long imprisonment and her cruel separation from her husband and her idolized child the personal beauty and the fascinating intellectual and moral endowments of madame roland soon won the hearts of her jailers and they did all in their power to alleviate the bitterness of her imprisonment the merciless commissioners had consigned her to a dungeon which no beam of light might penetrate but the compassion of her keepers induced them to assign to her a cell where a few rays of the morning sun could struggle through the grated windows and where the light of day though dimly might still in some degree cheer those eyes so soon to be closed forever the soul instinctively appreciative of beauty will under the most adverse circumstances evoke congenial visions she was indulged with flowers of which from childhood she had been most passionately fond flowers seem to comprehend and requite unaffected love and the plants at the iron window ofthe prison appeared to grow with the luxuriance ot gratitude with interwining leaf and blossom they concealed the rusty bars till they changed the aspect of the grated cell into a garden bower where birds might nestle and sing and affection might love to linger a few particular friends were occasionally permitted to visit her and with books and her nev erfailing resource the pen she beguiled the weary hours her highly mind with such philosophic resignation yielded to the pressure of misfortune that many hours and days even of calm and pensive enjoyment illuminated her cruel imprisonment there is something cold and chilling in the support which pride and philosophy alone can afford madame roland had met with christianity only as it appeared in the pomp and parade of the catholic church and in the openly dissolute lives of its ignorant or voluptuous priesthood while her poetic temperament was moved by the sublime conception of a god ruling over the world of mind revealed religion asher mind had encountered it she could not but reject her natural temperament was serious reflective we can almost say devotional but she beheld in the pomp and pride and barefaced deception of the roman catholic system but a collossal monster oppressing the people with hideous superstition and sustaining with its superhuman energies the corruption of the nobles and of the throw in rejecting the papal system she had no friend to reveal to her the warm and sheltered and congenial retreat of evangelical piety she was conducted almost inevitably by the philosophy of the times to those chilling barren storm swept hights where the soul can find no shelter but in its own indomitable energies of endurance these energies madame roland displayed in such a degree as to give her a name among the very first of those who by heroiim have shed lustre upon human nature many hours of every day rite beguiled in writing the memoirs of her own life it ia an eloquent end touching narrative written with the expectation that each sentence might be enterrupled by the entrance of the gens darnes to conduct her to trial and to the guillotine in this unveiling of her heart to the world one aees a noble nature generous and frong animated with instinctive benevolence and nerved to resignation by fatalism the consciousness of spiritual loftiness constiuted her only religion and her only pn sent pleasure the anticipation of high reputation among men after death her only heaven the christian must pity while he must admire no one can read the thoughts she penned but with the deepest emotion now her mind wanders to the hours of her precocious and dreamy childhood and lingers in her little chamber gazing upon the golden sunset and her eye is bathed in tears as she reflects ot her home desolated by death and still more desolated by that unhonored union whicn the infidelty j of the times tolerated where one look the position of the wife unblest by the sanction of heaven again her spirit wings its flight through the gloomy bars of her prison to her beautiful rural home where she spent her happiest years and she

by the execrations of the mob of paris to the most revolting death womans nature for a moment triumphs over philosophic fortitude and she finds momentary relief in a flood of tears the hour for her trial arrived she was prepared to meet it conscious that any attempt at defense would be entirely unavailing she submitted without resistance or expostulation toher fate she was led before her inexorable judges and accused of being the wife of m roland and the friend of his friends she smiled proudly as she admitted the truth of both of these charges the serenity of her eye was untroubled and the composure of her disciplined spirit unmoved save by the exalation of enthusiasm as she noted the progress of the trial which was bearing her rapidly and resistlessly to the scaffold she heard the sentence condemning her to immediate death with apparently as joyous a spirit as if it were her passport to a glorious immortality with a light heart and elastic step she rose to leave the courtrooin and slightly bowing to her judges said with a bitter and ironical smile thank you for considering me worthy to share the fate of the good men you have already murdered with the agility of a child lighthearted and happy she tripped down the stone steps which led to her dungeon in the conciergerie as she passed along the corridor fellowprisoners haggard with confinement and despair came from their cefls to meet her she smiled upon them and drawing her right hand across her throat gave them the significant sign that her deliverance was at hand her friends who had no tears to shed for their own fate wept bitterly over hers the morning of the th of november dawned gloomily over paris it was the darkest hour of that night of terror which enveloped the metropolis so long in its gloomy shades the carts of the condemned that morning were burdened with an unusual number of victims as they rolled heavily along to the scaffold madame roland was placed in the last cart by the side of a weak and infirm old man whose trembling nerves entirely failed him in this severe hour of trial she wain a white robe which she wore she said as the emblem of her innocence her black and glossy hair fell in rich profusion to her waist a keen november blast swept the streets under the influence of which and the excitement of the scene her animated countenance glowed with all the ruddy bloom of youth she stood firmly in the cart looking with a serene eye upon the crowds which lined the streets and ever addressing words of encouragement and support to the feeble old man at her side she bent over the weeping sufferer with filial tenderness and by her pleasantry succeeded even in winning a smile from bis pale and trembling lips the excretions of the mob who believed that she was a traitor to the republic filled the air and they shouted franticly to the guillotine to the guillotine i am goinp she replied to the cuillotine a lew moments and shall e there they who send me thither will ere long follow me i go innocent they will come stained with blood you who now applaud our execution will then with equal zeal applaud theirs they arrived at the guillotine the ax fell rapidly upon her associates and head after head dropped in the basket the executioners approached the cart wnere madame roland and her fainting companion stood with an animated countenance and a cheerful smile she was all engrossed in endeavoring to infuse fortitude into his oul the executioner grasped herby the arm stay said she slightly resisting his grasp have one only that is not for myself i beseech you grant it me then turning to the okl man do you precede me to the scaffold to see my blood flow would make you snffer the bitterness of death twice over i must spare you the pain of witnessing my punishment the executioner gave a surly refusal stating that his orders were to take her first surely she replied with one of her most winning smiles and with that grace which was almost resistless you cannot refuse the last request of a woman the hardhearted executor of the law yielded and the poor od man more dead than alive was placed beneath the fa fa ax madame roland without the slightest change of color or the tremor of a nerve looked on and then unaided with a firm and elastic step almost of joyousness ascended the scaffold by the side of the guillotine there stood a coliossal statue of liberty bowing before this statue she exclaimed o liberty liberty how many crimes are committed in thy name she then surrendered herself to the executioner her slender and fairy form was bound to the plank the plank fell the glittering steel glided through the groove and the head of madame roland was severed from her body a race for life presence of mind is a life preserver which although never patented is not yet to be possessed by all men presence of mind is the power of maintaining the operations of the mind in the midst of dangerand against the assaults of fear and surprise it is invaluable to the possessor as a personal safeguard and gives him the power to protect the lives of his fellow men as an instance of this latter power we will relate a little incident told to us by one who had seen much of the world in various lands he was at aport in the vvest indies with two friends he went down to the water to bathewhile he remained upon the dfcore and his companions were sporting with the waves at a considerable distance he espied an enormous shark making straight for the unconscious swimmers the first impulse ot a hasty and inconsiderate peison would have been to alarm the bathers by loud outcries of danger but our friend knew that such a course would by i frightening them deprive his companions of all power of escape he therefore preserved his unconcerned appearance and playfully shouting to them bantered them to a race and to increase the rivalry between them promised the one who should first reach the shore a slight reward nothing loth to try their powers of speed the two swimmers struck out for the shore with all the swiftness at their command all this time the shark had been silently nearing his prey and as they turned for the shore he shoi through the waves with increased rapidity the race for life uncounsiously on the part of the pursued was now fairly begun the swimmers strained every nerve in their friendly rivalry while yet the shark gained rapidlygipon them our friend upon the shore although inwardly tortured with anxiety still preserved his calm and smiling appearance as he continued to throw out incentives to increase the speed of his unfortunate friends they were still a long way from the shore when one of them sho ed signs of fatigue and was ap piently about to relinquish the race that was a moment of great agony for our friend still he preserved his presence of mind and shouting encouragingly to the tired swimmer induced him to continue the contest for the victory on came the shark nearer and nearer his fins flashed in the sunlight the swimmers approached the shore the shark was so near his victims that he turned upon his back to begin the work of death our friend rushed into the water and dragging hi amazed iriends upon the bank pointed to the baffled sea monster now lashing the waves with his fins then the swimmers comprehended the imminent danger from which they had escaped and one of them fell fainting to the earth they never forgot the unconscious race with the shark nor that it was to admirable presence of mind of their the friend that they owed their lives portlada transcript this
