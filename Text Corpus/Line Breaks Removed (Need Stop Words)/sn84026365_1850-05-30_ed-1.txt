horace manns reply to hon daniel webster in a chronological order i must now consider some vitally important views which have been submitted by some members in the house and by mr webster and others in the senate in mentioning the name of this great statesman and in avowing that am one among the many whom his recently expressed opinions have failed to convince it is due myself however indifferent it may be to him or to his friends that i should express ray admiration of his powers my gratitude for his past services and the diffidence with which i disseuted at first from his views but j have pondered upon them long and the longer i have pon dred the more questionable they appear i shall therefore venture upon the perilous task of inquiring into their correctness and while i do it with the deference and respect whichbelong to his character i tjhall do it also with that fidelity to conscience and to judgment that belong to mine he is great but truth is greater then us alli shall confine myself mainly and wholly perhaps to mr websters views because he has argued the cause of the south wilh vastly more ability than it has been argued by anyone among themselves if his conclusions then be not tenable their case is lost mr webster casts away the proviso altogether he says if a resolution or a law were now before us to provide a territorial government for new mexico i would not vote to put any prohibition into it whatever p the reason given is that slavery is already excluded from california and new mexico by the law of nature of physical geography the law of the formation of tha earth p california and new mexico are asiatic in their formation and scenery they are composed of vast ridges of mountains of enormous height with broken ridges and deep valleys p now this is drawing moral conclusions from physical premises it is arguing from physics to metaphysics it is determiuing the law of the spirit by geographical phenomena it is undertaking to settle by mountains and rivers and not by the ten commandments a great question of human duty it abandons the secondcommandment of christ and all bills of rights enacted in conformity thereto and leaves our obligations to our neighbor and all human rights to be determined by the accidents of earth and water and air to ascartain whether a people will obey the command of christ and doto others as they would be done by it looks at the thermometer what a problem would this be required the height above the level of the sea at which the oppressor will undo the heavy burdens and let the oppressed so free and break every yoke to be etermined barometrically alas this cannot be doneslavery depends not upon climate but upon conscience wherever the wicked passions of the human heart can go there slavery can go slavery is an effect avarice loth pride and the love of domination are its cause in ascending mountain idee at what altitude do men leave these passions behind them different ll fuy quotations fr mr wbsur an

and far above them all the line of perpetual snow but in regard to ionocence and guilt where is the whiteline how high up can a slaveholder go and not lose his free agency at what elevation will the whip fall from the hand of the master and the fetters from the limbs of the slave there is no such point freedom and slavery nn the one band and climate and geology on the other are incommensurable quantities we might as well attempt to determine a questionin theology by the cube root or a question in ethics by the black art slavery being a crime founded upon human passions can go wherever these passions are unrestrained it has existed in asia from the earliest ages notwithstanding its formation and scenery it labors and groans on the banks of the ural mountains now there are today slaves in russia not one rood of which comes down so low as the northern boundary of california and new mexico sould it be said that slavery will nto go into the new territories because itis unprofitable i ask where is it profitable where is ignorance so profitable as knowledge w t here is ungodliness gain even for the things of this life how little is the hand worth atone end of an arm if there is not a brain at the other does not maryland virginia north carolina and other states lurnish witnesses by thousands and tens of thousands that slavery impoverishes yet with what enthusiasm they cherish it generally ignorance is a necessary concomitant of slavery of white persons over years ago unable to read and write there were according to the last census in virginia in north carolina in tennessee and so forth i have a letter before me received this morning dated in indiana in which the writer says he removed from north carolina in when he was years old and at that time he had never seen a newspaper in his life can there bo genius the inventive talent or profitable labor where ignorance is so dense can the oppression that tramples out voluntary industry intelligence enterprise and the desire of independence conduce to richesyet this is done wherever slavery exists and is part and parcel of its working is any other form of robbing profitable yet individuals and communities have practiced it and lived by it and we may as well rely upon a law of physical geography to arrest the one as the other it is not poetry but literal truth that the breath of the slave blasts vegetation his tears poison the earth and his groans strike it with sterility it would be easy to show why the master does not abandon slavery even amid the desolation with which it has surrounded him there is a combination of poverty and pride which slavery produces on thejdoctrine of natural appetence and which therefore it exactly fits the helplessness of the master in regard to all personal wants seems to necessitate the slavery that has begotten it all moral and religious principles are lowered till they conform to the daily practice custom blinds conscience until without any attempt to emancipate or ameliorate their victims man can preach and hold slaves as yorick jests and sings over gravedigging but slavery cannot go into california or new mexico because their staple productions are not tobacco cane cotton or rice p these are agricultural products but is slave labor confined to agriculture suppose that predial slavery will not become common in the new territories cannot mental if slaves cannot do fieldwork cannot they do housework there is an opening for slaves today in the new territories for purposes of domestic labor and beyond this let me ask who possesses any such geological vision that at the distance of a thousand miles he can penetrate the the valleys and gorges of new mexico and say that gold will not yet be found there as it is in cali fornianot in sand and gravel only but in fortyeight pounders and fifty sixes this is the very kind of labor on which slaves in all time have been so extensively employedthe very labor on which a million of slaves in hispaniola lost their lives within a few years after its discovery by columbus gold deposites are now worked within miles of santa fe the last account which i have seen of a company of emigrants passing iron santa fe to california by the riveftlfeila announces rich discoveries of gold upon that river a fellow citizen of mine has just returned home who says he saw a slave sold at the mines in california in september last as yet the distant regions of the gila and the colorado cannot be worked because of the apaches the utah and other tribes of indians but admit slavery there and the power of the government will be invoked to exterminate these indians as it was before to exterminate the cherokees and seminolenot to drive them beyond the mississippi but beyond the styx a few days since a letter was published in the papers dated on board a steamer descending the mississippi which stated that a considerable number of slaves were onboard for california under an agreement with their master that they should be free after serving two years at the mines we know too that the reasod assigned for incorporating a provision in the constitution of california au thorising its legislature to pass a law for the exclusion of free blacks from the states was that slaves would be brought there under this very form of agreement and by aod by the country would be overspread by people ot color who bad bought tbeir freedom the sagacious men who framed the california constitution came from ail pitii of the territory and being collected on the spot having surveyed all its mountains having breathed its air at all temperatures and turned up its golden soil these men had never discovered any law of physioal geography which the fell spirit of slavery could not transgress slaves were carried into oregon ten degrees of latitude higher up its colonists reenacted the ordinance of before congress gave them a territorial government in the territorial government that was given them the prohibition was inserted and president polk signed the bill with an express protest that he ratified this exclusion of slavery only because the country lay north of the missouri compromise linebut that had it embraced the very region in question he would have vetoed the bill gen cass never took the ground that slavery could not exist in the new territories and no inconsiderable part of the opposition made by him in massachusetts and in other states was placed expressly upon the ground that he would not prohibit it mr webster in his marshfield speech sept  opposed the election of gen cass because through his recreancy to northern principles slavery would invade the territories this was expressed with the usual clearness and force as follows he gen cass will surely have the senate and with the patronage of the government with every interest that he as a northern man can bring to bear cooperating with every interest that the south can bring to bear we cry safety before we are out of the woods if we feel that there is no danger as to those new territories yet mr webster now sas that to support the proviso would do disgrace to his own understanding p  during the same campaign also the hon rufus choate one of the mosi eloquent men in new england and known to be a personal friend of mr webster delivered a speech at salem in which the following passage occurs it is the passage of a law to say that california and new mexico shall remain forever free that is fellow citizens undoubtedly an object of great and transcendent importance for there is none who will deny that we should go up to the very limits of the constitution itself and with the wisdom of the wisest and the zeal of the most zealous should unite to accomplish this great object and to defeat the always detested and forever to be detested object of the dark ambition of that candidate of the baltimore convention who has ventured to pledge himself in advance that he will veto the future law of freedom and may god avert the madness of all who hate slavery and love freedom that would unite in putting him in the place where this thrice accursed pledge inay be redeemed is there a whig upon this floor who doubts that the strength of the whig party next march will insure freedom to california and new mexico if by the constitution they are entitled to freedom at all is there a member of congress that would not vote for freedom you know there is not one did not every whig member of congress from the free states vote at the last session for freedom you know that every man returned home covered with the thanks of his constituents for that vote is there a single whig constituency in any free state in this country that would return any man that would not vote for freedom do you believe that daniel webster himself could be returned if there was the least doubt upon the question mr choate then addsupon this question alone we always difler from those whigs of the south and on that one we propose simply to vote him down mr webster now says he will not join in voting them down under such circumstances it is frivolous or captious to ask for something more than dogmatic assertion that slavery cannot impregnate these new regions and cause them to breed monsters forever on a subject of such infinite importance i cannot be satisfied with a dictum i want a demonstration i cannot acceptthe prophecy without inquiring what spirit inspired the prophet as a revelation from heaven it would bn most delightful but as it conflicts with all human experience it requires at least one undoubted miracle to attest the divinity of its orgm according to the last census there were more than eight thousand persons of african blood in massachusetts abolish the moral and religious convictions of our people let slavery appear to be in their sight not only lawful and creditable but desirable as a badge of aristocratic distinction anda a political social moral and religions blessing and what obstacle would prevent these eight thousand persons from being turned into slaves ton anj day by the easy cheap and rochester n y thursday may shorthand kidnapping of a legislative act africans can exist here for th best of all realonathey do exisi here k state af slavery would not stop their rospiidtion nor cause then to vanish intofhin air think foi a moment of this complaints we constantly hear in certain circles of th difficulty and vaxatiousness of commanding domestic service if no mora or religious objection existed againsl holding slaves would not many oi those respectable and opulent gentlemen who signed the letter of thanks to mr webster and hundreds of other indeed instead of applying to intelligence offidfs or visiting emigrant ships for domestics as we cell them go at once to the auctionroom an buy a man or a woman with as little hesitancy or compunction as they now send to brighton ior beeves or to tattersalls for a horse if the cold of the higher latitudes checks the flow ol african blosd or benumbs african limbs the slaveholder knows very well that a trifling extra expense for whips will make up foible difference but suppose a doubt could be reasonably entertained about the invasion of the new territories by slavery even suppose the chances to preponderate against it what then are we to submit a question of human liberty over yast regions and for an indefinite extent of tine to the determination ol chance with all my faculties say no let me ask any man let me respectfully ask mr webster himself if it were his own father and mother and brothers and sisters and sons and daughters who were in peril of such a fate whether he would abandon them to chance even to a favorable chance would he suffer their fate to bedetermiied by dice or divination when positive prohibition was in his power asd by what rule of christian morality or even of enlightened heathen morality can we deal differently with the kindred of others from what we would with our own he is not a christian whose humanity is bounded by the legal degrees of blood or by general types of feature but mr webster would not taunt the south neither would i i would not taunt any honorable man much less a criminal still when the most precious interests of humanity are in peril would not be timid i would not stop too long to cull lovers phrases standing under the eye of god in the forumof the world and before the august tribunal of posterity when the litigants are freedom and tyranny and human happiness and human misery the prize they contest it should happen to the sworn advocates of liberty as quin tiilian says it did to isocrates not to speak and to plead bnt to thunder and to lighten mr webster would not taunt the south and yeti say the south were never so iusulted before as he has insulted them common scoffs jeers and vilifications are flattery and scophancy compared with the indignities he heaped upon them look at the facts the south waged war with mexico from one and only one motive for one and only one object the extension of slavery they refused peace unless the surrendered territory that territory must be south of the abhorred line of deg min the sumc president who abandoned the broad belt of country on our northern frontier from deg to deg m to which we had in his own words an unquestionable title would allow no prohibition of slavery to be imposed upon the territory which mexico ceded though she would bury it a foot deep in gold the proviso had been resisted in all forms from the beginning southern whigs voted against the ratification of the treaty foreseeing the struggle that was to follow desperate efforts were made to smuggle in an unrestricted territorial government against all parliamentaryrule and all constitutional implication the whole south as one man claimed it as a describabie weighable estimable tangible and most valuable right to carry slaves there calhoun ber rien badger mason davis the whole southern phalanx whig and democrat pleaded for it argued for it and most of them declared themselves ready to fight for it and yet mr webster rises in his place and tells them they are alt moonstruck hallucinated fatuous because an ordinance of na iure asd the will of god had settled this question from the beginning of the world mr calhoun said immediately after this speech give us free scops and time enough and we will take care of the rest mr mason said we have heard here from various quarters and from high quarters and repeated on all handsrepeated hereagain today by the honorable senator from illinois mr shields that there is a law of nature which excludes the southern people from every portion of the state of california i know of no such law of naturenone whatever but do know the contrary that if california had been organized with a territorial form of government only and for which at the last two sessions of congress she has obtained the entire soutnern vote the people of the southern stetes would have gone there freely and have taken their slaves there in great numbers they would have done ao because the value of the labor of that class would have been augmented to them many hundredfold whv in the debates which took place in the convention in california which formed the constitution and which any senator can now read for himself god is the father of us all and all men are brethren after the provision excluding slaver was agreed upon it was proposed t prohibit the african race altogether free as well as bond a debate aros upon it and the ground was distinctly taken as shown in those debates thai if the entire african race was not excluded their labor would be found st valuable that the owners of slavet would bring them there even thougl slavery were prohibited a under contract to manumit them in two or three years and it required very little reasoning on the part of those opposed tc this class of population to show that the productiveness of their labor would be such as to cause that result an estimate was gone into with reference to the value of the labor of this class oi people snowing that it would be increased to such an extent in the mines of california that they could not be kept out it was agreed that the labor of a slave in any one of the states from which they would be taken was not worth more than one hundred and fifty dollars a year and that in california it would be worth from four to six thousand dollars they would work themselves free in one or two years and thus the country would be filled by a class of free blacks and their former owners have an excellent bargain inbringing them there yet mr webster stands up before all this array and says gentlemen you are beside yourselves you have eaten hellebore you would look more in character should you put on the cap and bells in sober sense in seeing his object clearly and in pursuing it directly don quixote was dr franklin compared with you the dog in the fable who dropped his meat to snap at its shadow is no allegory in your case i see two classes around mewise men and fools you do not belong to the former the chancellor who keeps the kings idiots should have custody of you such is a faithful abstract of what mr webster said to southern senators and through them to all the south here certainly was u reflection upon the understanding and intelligence ol the south such as never was cast on them before but the balm went with the sting they bore the affront to their judgments because it was so grateful to their politics and pockets think it no injustice to those senators to say that they would have nearly torn him in pieces for such a collective insult if it had not added fifty percent to their individual property and secured and perpetuated their political ascendency to help our conceptions in regard to mr websters course on this subject let us imagine a parallel case or rather an approximate one for there can be no parallel suppose a contest between the north and the south on the subject of the tariff to have been raging for years the sober blood of the north is heated to the fever point the newspapers treat of nothing else public meetings and private conversation discuss no other theme hundreds of delegatee wait upon congress to add if it be but a feathers weight to the scale which holds their interests petitions flow in in thousands and tens of thousands it is announced that mr calhoun will pour out his great mind on the subject expectation is on tiptoe all eyes from all sides of the country are turnedfowards washington as the muazzius is to mecca the senate chamber is packed and the illustrious senator rises after ahistoric sketch of existing difficulties after reading from the speeches which he made in and in he proceeds to flay that he withdraws all opposition to a tariff to any tariff he will not offend the delicate nerves of northern manufacturers by further hostility were a bill then before him he would not oppose it take the schedules says he scornfully to northern senators and fill up the blanks from a to z with what percentages you please for ad valorem rates put in nunimums and maximum at your pleasure will taunt you no longer i am for peace and the glorious union i have discovered an irrepealable and irreversible law of nature which overrules all the devices of men you cannot make one yard of woolens or cottons in new england there water has no gravity steam has no force and wheels will not revolve in vermont and new york wool will not grow on sheeps backs i have penetrated the geology of pennsylvania and through all iu straiio tions there is not a thimblefull of coal nor an ounce of iron ore and if there wrre combustion would not help to forge it for oxygen and carbon are divorced as massachnsetts contributed onethird of the men and onethird of the money to carry on the revolutionary war i am willing to compensate her for her lost blood and treasure to the amount ofhundreds of millions of dollars with which she may fertilize the barrenness of her genius and indulge her insane love for churches and schools had the great southern senator spoken thus think that even idolatrous manworshipping south carolinaa state which mr calhoun has ruled and moved for the last twen tyfive years as a puppetshow man plays punch and judywould have sent forth through all her organs a voice of unanimous dissent as much as freedom is higher than tariff so much stronger than their dissent should be ours mr websters averment that he would not reeffirm an ordinance of nature nor reenact the will of god p has been commented on mor pungently than am able or willini to do it has been said that all lav and all volition must be in harmonj with the will of the good spirit with that of the evil one and if w will not reenact the will of the former theu either all legislation ceases pr w must register the decrees of the latter but one important and pertinent consij belongs to this subject which j have nowere seen developed it is this endless doubts and contradiction exist among men as to what is the will of god and on no subject is there a wider diversity of opinion than on this very subject efslavery whose law wasjreenacted by of whose when the african slavetrade was prohibited whose when it was declared piracy true it is useless to put upon our statute books an astronomical law regulating sunrise or high tides but that is physical and beyond the jurisdiction of man while slavery belongs to morals and is within the jurisdiction of man cease to transcribe upon the statute book what our wisest and best men believe to be the will of ged in regard to our worldly affairs and the passions which we think appropriate to devils will soon take possession of society in regard to slavery piracy and so forth their are multitudes of men whose fear of the penal sanctions of another life is very much aided by a little salutary fine and imprisonment in this look at the noble array of principles which is contained in the declaration of rights in the constitution of massachusetts is it not a most grand and beautiful exposition of the will of god a transcript as it were from the book of life so of the amendments to the constitution ol the united states yet our fathers thought it no tampering with holy things to enact them and in times of struggle and peril they have been to many a tempted man as an anchor to the soul sure and steadfast i approach mr websters treatment of the texas question with no ordinary anxiety having been accustomed from my very boyhood to regard him as the almost infallible expounder of constitutioual law it is impossible to describe the struggle the revulsion of mind with which i have passed from an instructed and joyous acquiescence in his former opinions to unhesitating dissent from his present ones i must premise that i cannot see any necessary or beneficial connection between the subject of new texan states and the admission of california and the government of the territories the former refers to some indefinite future when from its fruitful womb o slavery texas shall seek to castf forth its untimely birth in this excited state of the countryat this critical juncture ef our affairs when there is sober talk of massacreing a majority of the house ol representatives on their own floor and a senator instead of threatening to hang a brother senator on the highest tree provided he could catch him in his own state now draws a revolver of six barrals on another brather senator on the floor of the senate in mid sessionat such a time i say when however few abels there may be at work in the political field there are cains more than enough would it not have been well to have said sufficient unto the day is the evil therefore as the basis of this argument mr wsbster quotes the following resolu tion new states of convenient size not exceeding four in number in addition to said state of texas and having sufficient population may hereafter by the consent of said state be formed eut of that portion of said territory lying south north latitude commonly known as the missouri compromise line shall be admitted into the union with or without slavery as the people of each stale asking admission may desire and in such state or states as shall be formed out of said territory north of said missouri compromise line slavery or involutary servitude n except for crime shall be prohibited note here first that only four states are to be admitted in addition to said state of texas and second that such state or states in the plural as shall be formed from territory north of deg min shall be free if two or only one free state is o exist on tb wsult mi am mf tbs lino then how many will be left for the south side should expose myself to ridicule were to set down arithmetically four minus one equal to three yet mr webster says the guaranty is that new states shall be made out of it the texan territory and that such states as are formed out of that portion oftexas lying south of deg min may come in as slave states to the number of four in addition to the state then in existence and admitted at that time by these resoiu tions p here mr webster gives outright to the south and to slavery one more state than was contracted lorassum ing the contract to be valid he makes rdonation a gratuity of an entire slave state larger than many a european principality he transfers a whole state with all its beating hearts present and future with all its infinite susceptibilities of weal or woe from the side ot freedom to that of slavery in the legerbook of humanity wlfat abridal gift for the harlot o john dick funtb whole no was not the bargain hard enough according to its terms must we fulfil it and go beyond it is a slare state which dooms our brethren of tha human race perhaps interminably to the vassalsate so insignificant a trifle that it may be flung in as small change on the settlement of an account has the south been so generous a copartner as to deserve this distinguished token of our gratitude why by a parity of reasoning could he not have claimed all the four states in addition to said state of texas as free states the resolutions divide the territory into two parts onu north and one south of the line of  deg min could not mr webster have claimed four states lor freedom with as sound logic and with far bettor humanity than he surrendered them to slavery when texas and the south have got their slave states to the number of four inte tho union whence are we to obtaiu our one or more free states the contract will have been executed and the consent of texas for another state will be withheld notwithstanding all this mr webster affirms the right of slavery to four more states in the following words know no form of legislation which can strengthen this i know no mode of recognition that can add a tittle of weight to it catching the tone of his asservation i respond that i know no form of statement nor process of reasoning which can make it more clear that this is an absolute and wanton surrender of the rights of the north and the rights of humanity but i hold the texan resolutions to have been utterly void and proceed to give the reason for my opinion i begin by quoting mr webster against himself in an address to the people of the united states from the mass antitexas sfate convention jan th the subjoined passage which is understood or rather i may say is now well known to have been dictated by mr webster himself maybe found but we desire not to be misunderstood according to our convictions there is no power in any branch of the government or all its branches to annex foreign territories to this union we have made the foregoing remarks only to show that if any fair constitution could show such a power to exist anywhere or to be exercised in any form yet the manner of its exercise now proposed is destitute of all decent semblance of constitutional proprie ty thus cancelling the authority of mr webster in by the authority of webster in i proceed with the argument though the annexation of texas waa in pursuance of a void stipulation yet it is a clear principle of law that when a contract void between the parties has been executed by them it cannot then be annulled if executed it becomes valid not by virtue of the contract but by virtue of the execution i bow to this legal principle and would fulfil it but any independent stipulation which remains unexecuted remains invalid such is that part of the annexation resolutions which provides for the admission of a brood of texan states the resolutions themselves say in express terms that the new states are to be admitted under the provisions ot the federal constitution and the constitution says new states may be admitted by the congress into this union by what congress t plainly by the congress in session at the time when application for admission is made and by no other the fourth texan state inay not be ready for admission for fifiy years to come and could the congress of bind the congress of the congress of and all future congresses will derive their authority from the constitution of the united states and not from any preceding congress put the case in a negative form could the congress of bind all future congress not to admit new states and thus protanto annul the constitution positive or negative the result is the same no previous congress on such a subject can enlarge or limit the power ofa subsequent one whenever therefore the question of a new texan state comes up for consideration the congress then in being must decide it on its own merits untrammelled by anything the predecessors have done especially free from a law which while im spirit fa tnousand times more odious in principle than aftntuea of mortmain admitting that a future congress on such a subject might be bound by a treaty answer that here was no treaty while the fact that a treaty clause was introduced into the resolutions in the senate for the sake of obtaining certain votes that would never otherwise have been given in their favor and under an express pledge from the executive that the method by treaty should be adopted which pledge was forthwith iniquitously broken leaves no element of baseness and fraud by which this proceeding was not contaminated in the name of the constitution then and of juaticp let every honest roan denounce those resolutions as void alike in the forum of law and in the forum of conscience and admitting texae herself in the union yet when application is made for any new state from that territory let the question be decided upon the merits k may then possess there is another objection to any fu tare claim of texas to be divided into states which grows out of her own neglect to fulfil the terms and spirit of the agreement in the territory north of the missouri compromise line slavery or involuntary servitude except for crime shall be prohibited so reads the bond but if texas suffers slavery to be extended over that part of her territory then when it becomes populous enough for admission and is overspread with slavery a new state may present a free constitution be admitted by congress and before the slaves have time to escape or to carry the question of freedom before the judicial tribunals presto this free constitution will be changed into a slave constitution under the alleged right ofa state to decide upon its own domestic institutions and thus the word of promise which was kept to the ear will be broken to the hope if texas meant to abide by the resolutions of annexation and to claim anything under them it as her clear and imperative duty forthwith to pass a law securing freedom to every inhabitant north of the compromise line in this way only can the resolutions be executed in their true spirit that territory is now in the condition of an egg it is undergoing incubation from it a state is hereafter to be hatched but before promising to accept the chick it would be agreeable to know whether a viper had impregnated the egg but there is a still further opjection of whose soundness i have no doubt but should i be in error in regard toit the mistake will not invalidate any other argument tho parties to that agreement stipulated on the ground of mutuality without which ail contracts are void some states were to be ad mitt id to strengthen the hands of slavery and some of freedom a line of demarcation was drawn now on iovestication believe it will most conclusively appear that there is notan inch of texas territory north of the stipulated line it all belongs to new mexico as much as nantucket or berkshire belongs to massachusetts it was a mistake on the part of the contracting parties if on the part of texas it was something worse than a mistake the mutuality then fails the contract is nudvm pactum texas can give nothing for what she was to receive and is therefore entitled to receive nothing but what she has got in regard to the business of seeing that fugitives are delivered up mr webster says my friend at the head of the judiciary committee mr butler of south carolina has a hill on the subject now before the senate with some amendments to it which i propose to supptftt with all its provisions to he fullest extent we published this bill a few weeks since and all who read it will remember its main features it will be observed that the first section of the hill after constituting the judges of the courts the seventeen thousand postmasters the collectors and sofqith as tribunals without appeal for the delivery of anybody wti is sworn by anybody anywherp t be a fugitive slave refers to the before mentioned officers in the words residing or being within euch statt where such seizure or arrest is made that is the judge postmaster collector c need not to he ar inhabitant of the stale or hold his office in th state where the seizure is made but it is sufficient if he is such officer an where within the united states mr butler or mr mason therefore maj tend the postmaster of his own city village into massachusetts with an agent or attorney who brings his affidavit from south carolina or virginia in his pocket the agent or attorney may arrest any body at any time carry him before his accomplice g through with the judicial fotros am hurry him to the south the officer after his judicial functions are discharged turning bailiff protecting the pre d speeding the flight still further this bill derides th tiwl by jury secured by the jonstitu tion a man may not lose a hors without a right to this trial but hi may his freedom mr webster speak tor the south and for slavery not fui the north and for freedom when in abandons this right such an abandonment it would be impossible to believe of one who has earned such fami as defender of the constitution ii would be more reasonable to suppose the existence of some strange misapprehension had not mr webster with the precision and strength which art so peculiarly his own declared his determination to support this hideous bill with all its provisions to tht fullest extent when at the sam moment another bill of which he took no notice wa pending before the senate introduced by mr sewkrd ol new york securing the invaluable privilege of a jury trial disdain to avail myself in sober argument of the popular sensitivenets on this subject and i acknowledge mv obligations to the constitution while it is suffered to last but still i say that the man who can read this till without having his blood boil in bis veins has a power of refrigeration that would cool the tropics i cannot doubt that mr webster will yet see the necessity of reconsidering his position on this whole question mr webster says it is my firm opinion this day that within th e lasi twenty years as much money has been collected and paid to the abolition societies abolition presses aud abolition lecturers as would purchase the freedom of every slave man womap and child in the state of maryland and end them ail to liberia the total number of slaves in maryland according to the last sensus amounted to at apiece which ia but about half the value cl btm tly assigned to the southern laves by southern menthis woilld be allowing o each for transportation to liberia without any provision for them after their arrival there and the whole sum would be in round numbers twen tyfive millions oi dollarsmore thana million and a quarter in each year and about five hundred dollars perl had sot supposed the abolition j sts had such resources at their com mand i have dwelt thus long upon mr websters speech because in connec ion with his two votes in favor of mr footes committee of compromise which votes bad they been the other way would have utterly defeated the committee it is considered to have lone more to jeopard the great cause of freedom in the

never since the day i entered the field of public effort in the cause of my enslaved brethren have i been called to endure persecution more bitter insults mors brutal violence more fierce acorn aod contempt more malicious and demoniacal than that heaped upon me in the city of new york during the past three weeks i have been made to fee keenly that i am in an enemys landsurrounded on all aides by

been enormous as they are alleged to be do not shrink from looking them full in the face and gloiying in having committed them my crime is that i have assumed to be a man entitled to all the rights privileges and dignity which belong to human nature that color r is no crime and that all men are brothers i have acted on this presumption the very head and front of my offending hath this extent no more i have not merely talked of human brotherhood and human equality but have reduced that talk to practice this i have done in broad open day scorning con j cealment i have walked through the streets of new york in company with white persons not as a menial but as an equal this s was done with no purpose to inflame the public mind not to provoke popular viol eitce not to make a display of my contempt for public opinion but simply as a matter of course and because it was right so to do the right to associate with my fellow worms of the dust on terms of equality without regard to color is a right which i will yield only with my latest breath my readers will have observed in the t vorth star of last week an account of ai most cowardly assault made upon tne iu the battery at new york like most other r statements wiiich emanate from the american press this one though partly true is false in several particulars it is not true tbit is walked down broadway with two white female resting on my arm in the case alluded to although i insist upon the right te do so it is not true that the ladies in company with me placed themselves under the care of the gentleman ruffian who assaulted me nor of any of the villanous party nor of anybody else it is not true that i sneared or spoke to the loafing assailants the facts briefly are these myself and friends were going to philadelphia and supposing that the johns potter departed from new york at twelve oclockwe rode down a quarter before twelve but found on our arrival that we had been mistaken the time of starting being halfpast one oclock the intervalthereforewe passed in the battery when about to leave for the steamer five or six men surrounded us assailing us with all sorts of coarse and filthy language and two of them finally struck the ladies on the headwhile another attacked mei warded off the blows with my umbrella and the cowardly creatures left without doing any personal harm thinking that we should not be disturbed by them again we walked slowly toward the steamer one of the mob observing that i was off my guaid ran up liehind me and before i could put myself ina position to ward off the assassins blow was struck in the face these are the whole facts in the case never was more calm or selfpossessed than when under his beastly assault i felt no indignation towards the poor miserable wretches who committed the outrage they were but executing upon me the behests of the proslavery church and clergy of the land doing the dirty work of the men who despise them and who have no more respect for them in reality than they bave for me shall have sayon my visit to new york and philadelphia next weekf d from the north star extra published in philadelphia shameful abandonment of principle inequality sanctioned colored men degrading themselves selling the cause of freedom for popular applause and playino into the hands of their op pressors it becomes my duty as an humble advocate of equal rightsas a defender of the principle of human freedomto record my earnest testimony at this crisis against what appears to me to be s most disgraceful concession to the venomous hatred so strongly cherished in this city by the white against th e colored people when principle is sacrificed in high placeswhen high and important trusts have been scandalously abused it becomes those who suffer from such epos tacy to repudiate both the traitors and ih treachery this is their duty to do boldly and earnestly and at whatever cost of popular applause to perform this duty i hav thus promptlysent forth the north stun fjtira hoping that it may be the means o opening the eyes of many who might els remain in darkness and perhaps be allured from the cause of our common liberties should this good result be secured it will lx high compensation fur all the abuse and misrepresentation to which i shall probably b subjected but without further preface i lay before the reader a complete copy of s handbill which has been widely circulated it thig city and under which a large meeting has been held the federal constitution versus v negro slavery f a committee of white cithteos bavin been appointed at the meeting at frtaklii their church forthal purpose the lower requested to attend sl evening may lth st halfpast even oomkk and itsten to one of the moot eloquent powerful men in thtr country whether yfips or black wo are convinced that those hating a prejudice against the race after heariiif him wilt snrrender the same you have read tlhmiiiidbijl and you ah ready see in it that upon which beg to offer a few remarks and against which i would bear my humble but not the lest honest testimony ynthavt it here first stated that a white committee wjs appointed at franklin hall to sedm a place of meeting for mr ward niv why was a white committee selected fronts meeting composed of both white and colored personal was it because a committee imposed in part of colored persons would htvor too much the idea of social equality aa it merely an act of courtesy towards the whites and a mark of humility on the pact of the colored people there assembled i ipr whatever fpa son the measure was adoptm am opposed to all such measures and heartily repudiate this away with sb compromises to secure goodwill when condition upon which it can be attained n a sacrifice of selfrespect and acknowledgment of our own inferiority in the very first announcement then in this handbill i find cause of complaint and although the basis of that complaint standing alone mighty pass without animadversion standing as is does in connection with other and more obnoxious fea tuies f hate felt in bestowing upon it this word of oflpfent the reader is next informedby the authors of this handbill that they hare labored in vain to secure a halt in whph mi ward might hold a meeting and llege as the reason of their failure the prejudice against the negro race this was undoubtedly the true reason the prejudice against the negro raceaye the this unnatural unreasoning and raaligdffht prejudice is the secret of most of our sifriai troubles and misfortunes by it we ati proscribed plundered and oppressed this it is that has shut us out not only froqj hallsl from hotels from steamboat cabins from the ballotbox from lyceums from places of amusement from churches from almost eviy honorable employmentbut even from decent burial grounds in this city yes it is this venomous prejudice that stands as if armed with a thunderbolt to btrike dead any black man who dares to seek his own and the true elevation of his race this prejudice it is which we are to meet encounter and subdue before any essential change for the better can take place in our condition this is the goliath which at present defies all the armies of israel and alas at the very moment when the colored people of this city had reason to hope that an effective blow would tie dealt upon the head of this arch enemy the very principle for which we are bound to contend has been most cowardly and shamefully abandoned here it is in these significant lines read it again the lower saloon w he ai propriated exclusively thlmlu white fellow citizens who are respectfully requested to attenj it is not easy to conceive of a more slame ful concession to the spirit of slavery and prejudice than this it is colonization sanctioned by the very men who profess to loathe and detest it separated from the circumstances it is a violation of the very first principles of hpman brotherhoodfor which the friends of freedom have contended for more tlian twenty yearsit is the wholesale adoption of the mean and unchrielian negro pew system which has been everywhere regarded as the strong bulwark of slavery and oppression but taken in connection with the declared object of the meeting ihe well known character of the gentlemau for whom tle meeting wa convened and the complextion of the people who own the church in wnich the meeting was heldit is the mostcowardly contemptible and servile specimen of selfdegradation which has ever come under my notice itis literally admitting that all that has been said by our enemies of our unfitness for the possession of equal rights and privileges in the relations of life is true and that it ought tobe reduced to practice what use will the revilers and slanderers of our people make of this concession why this and none else than this that we are sensible of our own inferiority that we know our place that we are conscious of our own unfitness for the society of white people that itis quite proper we should be separated from them in the house of prayer that the two varieties of the same family ought not to be allowed to occupy an equal footing that the lower and commodious part of the churchthe house ot worship should be reserved for white people exclusively and that colored people should be separated and sent up stairscol onized such then are the inferences which our oppressors may naturally draw from this open and palpable abandonment of the doctrine and practice of human equality imo which the colored people of this city have boon wantonly and scandalously betrayed let me ask those colored men whtf have sanctioned this disgraceful transaction to show if they can wbat difference there isin the principle of caste and exclusiveness involved in this caseand the principle upon which mr ward and colored men in general are excluded from the chinese museum is there any are not the two things founded on the same basis mr ward was excluded from the chinese museum because tie was a colored man colored men by this notice were excluded fro the lower pari f st marys street churchbecause of their color the principle was that the same in the one ease as is the other and it is equally te be reprobated io both cases he who approves the one has no right to condemn the other out of thine own mouth will i condemn thee thou that sayest a man halt steal dost thou steal thou ths sayest that god is impartial art thou partial will you condemn in others that which i you justify in yourself how long will ii t take you to convince thswoild of human equality and brotherhood by preaching whik you openly violate the piinciple in youi practice la precept stronger than example will men redace practice that which the preaeher himself tacitly admits tobe impracticable alas for human weakness and the spirit of compromise which is here displayedpurchasing the oppress ori fovor by selling our birthright to liberty this seeking our elevation in the ray pathway to selfdegradation will end only in disappointment shame and confusion the question will naturally arise as to how mr ward and hi friends will dispose of this handbill and justify his speaking and their assembling under its provisions r upon this subject cannot speak positively have understood from respectable sources that mr ward denies being tbe author of tbe handbill thia is goodso far as it goes but to my apprehension it falls far short ol exculpating him from just and severe censure lie does not and cannot deny that he was apprized of the infamous arrangement before the meeting took plaoe he knew all about the matter beforehand hit anawer to one friend was that white men wrote the bill and if there wu anything wrong in it white men must make it right now this answer is anything than creditable to tbe honeaty consistency and good sense of him who made it it is evasive unsatisfactory and a mere quibble whict will only sink its author deeper in disgrace than the act which he deaigned to shitlc from condemnation in a matter of this sorta man like mt ward cannot be allowed neutial ground he is here as an apostle o hbetty and equality he is jealously it watch over and boldly to defend the cause o human freedom what if mr ward shouk throw off all responsibility in the matter slavery and give up the contest under the ridiculous pretext that if there he any wrong in it white men have committed the wrong and white men must mend it would any man regard him in any othei  light than as an apostate i the answer in question shows to what vile and paltry shifts a man in a false position willtesort he was rem inded of the nature of this bill by another friend who pointed outthe objectionable feature which it contained and made no answer at all now why was this course pursued by the eloquent samuel r ward where was his sense of justice where was his impartiali  ty where was his manly indignation why did he not denounce the whole transaction ai once and declare either that he would not speak under such a call oi that he would take this handbill as the basis of his discourse and show the improprietyof sending forth such a handbill but he made no such declaration he manifested no sense of the insult offered to colored citizens and worse still attended the meeting made an eloquent speech treated his hearers to any quantity of fun and never raised a whisper against the in famous handbill now this leaves mr ward without excuse his silence at such a time was a sanction of the whole proceedings he is responsible for the insult and degradation offered to the colored citizens of philadelphia he mighi have cleared himself of all blame in the matter by disclaiming the contents of that handbill in the presence of the white committee who are supposed to have framed it this it seems he lackeo the manliness to do he could not so far test thestnceiity of bis new c converts and risk their applause as to tell rthem that they were yet in the darkness of slavery and under the influence of prejudice but glazed the who e matter over in silence now if this be fidelity what is treachery i it is now no time to mince mattersno time i to ran with the hare and hold with the hound the colored people of this city andi country have had enough of this playing f fast and loose and the time has come unless i i mistake the signs of the limes when they i will demand of thotw who stand forth as their advocates an inflexible adhesion to the principle of equal and impartial freedomr o letter crou geo w golaes frederick douglass sir l attended ai

right the executive was charged with having violated in a manner in his opinion most unjustifiable and inexcusable in conclusion mr yulee declared that while he had no previous information with reietence to this eipednion h a sympathies were wth the republicans who were endeavoring to release j themselves trom tyranny and oppression mr webster regretted that mrwalker bad thought necessaiy to move the amendment he had offered because it was rather offensive in its terms and was not exactly regular as il enquired under w hat authority a certain alleged act had been done befoe any evidence of the execution ot that act had been furnished he imped the amendment would be withrawn but if it was not he would vote lor the resolution even as amended he had beene xceedingly surpiised at some of the propositions asserted by the senat who had said among other things that ihis s ipposed act of the president looked like ftn act of warwar against whom whil country what colony what province it was important that we should govern ourselves by some distinct undeislandmg of the neutral duties of the government ano of all her citizens as defined by the law ot if we mean to be neutral we were to consider oui treaty stipulations everybody knew that out stipulations with ispain ihe executive jiower ol ihe united slates has over and over again assured spainas far as the executive could give such assurance that it ahe would not voluntary give up iter possession of cuba to a european power the united slates would do all in their power tu aas st spain in maintaining her possession he did not intend to say how tar these stipulations were binding on congress bui simply to remind the n te that such stij ul ti ms had been given as tar back as jacksons administration and made for the purpose and with the view of inducing bpain not to part with cuba to the advantage of an european pow er and the consequent detriment ot our imer asts and these views and acts of the exe utive had been published again and again and no objection to idem had ever been beard but what was it that had been complained about it was said that the president had directed a portion of the naval armament ol the united states to go to cuba fi r certain specific purpose and if the facts were as stated and supposed to be those purposes were not only legal right and constitutional but the course ascribed lo the was made hit duty by positive statute this was a military expedition fitted out in the us to act against cuba il that was ihe fact as the law forbade and was designed to prevent the fitting out of such expeditions in the u s whatever the president had done was eoriect whatever had been done had leen placed upon the giound that the expedition wav a military one and that it had been projected and coinmeneedjin the united slates if so the executive ws by law directed wherever he could withinand under the jurisdiction of the united siates to exert both the military and naval power to supprtss the expedition if an ameiican vessel was found on tire coast of cuba in me execution of the purpose of the expedition it was as much under our jurisdiction as if laying at one ot our harbors for it was a generally admitted fact that the jurisdiction of the u t onboard of american vessels extended wherever our flag floats the senator had also said that tf a landing was made upon the island ol cuba under a revolutionary flag that was a breaking out of a civil war in which wc must remain neutral between the parties engaged in it that he admitted to be true but when autfh civil commotion was aided on the one side cr the other by tire fitting out in tins country lf an armament that was against ihr law of rind what that law was expressly designed to prevent the senator had also thrown out a general remark that hew as afraid this act of the president was another of acveral acts calculated to lead to the suspicion that the policy ol the administration is antirepublican mr webster thought the remark gratuitous and unfounded ht believed the president designed to execult ike law honestly fairly and firmlyhe knew of nothing in ins hie or acts to lead to the supposition that the president was not agood a republican as the rest of them mr clay looked upon he movement i altogether premature and did not design u enter into its discussion he httped that thi senate would not have their attention turner from the admission of califoroa by any exp diton fitted out in the south against cuba he moved that the resolution be laid on thi table fvt the puipose of taken up tbs specia order which was agreed to be senate then resumed the consideration oflne nimbus bill and mr soule addresser the senate in support of the amendment sub milted by jefferson davis against the proposed

to consider the nature and extent i ihe compensation given to the south in lh establishment of territorial government reading the tenth section of the bill whici prohibits the tetritorisl legislatures from passing any law hi relation to slavery he asked what was this compensation nothing mor than the statu quo of mexican lawthe stat quo of mexican law with a vengeance first the report declared that slavery doe not exist by mexican law and next the bil prevented the legislature lrom even recog mzing slavery mr davis amendment dii nut surrendei the docttine of noninterference it merely protected rights which belong h citizens of the territory under the consiiiu lion the tenth section was a oounterpaito ihc second resolution submitted by mr clay which was met with such a burst of indignation and alarm the bill instead of leaving the question of the existence of slavery ji mexico to be deiermined prohibited the territutial legislature from passing any law on the subject and gave to congress the power ot voting any territorial law he also considered the question of the existence ul slavery in new mexicohe admitted that a constitutional congress in mexico in abolished the slavetrade the measure was considered by mexicans as belonging to i hat class of legislation which is cal ed organic it was consdered by the mexican authorities that the mexican law was superseded by american law thus a law prohibiting burial rights to protestams w as abolished and su persfded by ametican law but there was another kind uf slavery in mexico peonage and if the mexican law prohibiting alri can slavery prevailed then the law establishing peon slavery also prevailed it would iollow that an american citizen might become a slave to mexicans ermont established the same kind of slavery by the firsi section of her constiiution it existed as an institution in mexico but he maintained that be did not himsell approve it mr soule closed his remarks with an eloquent ana impassioned appeal against the compromise measure mr clay said the debate had been conducted thus far with great irregularity the question before the senate was upon an amendment involving a single point in the discussion of which senators have launched out upon every branch of the whole snbjcct in vindication of the action of the committee he felt bound to answer some of the objections which had been urged by the senator lrom louisiana the senator objects to this scheme of compromise would the senator bring forward his scheme of compromise his proposition which should give peace to the distracted country it was his duty to sry what he wanted the senator had objected that the compromise committee had brought back the fugitive slave bill burdened with restrictions instead of improvements it was a little remarkable that the objections to the fugitive slave bill came from those stales who suffered little or none from the escape ol slaves while it was entirely satis tactory to those states which suffered most lrom that cause mi clay proceeded to defend the bill from the objections which mr soule had urged lu the course ot his remarks mr soule interposing admitted that slavery was abolished by the mexican law hut contended that the constitution of the united states set aside the law of abolition e o instanti mr clay resumedlf the senalor so believed what more did he wantwhat did he askwhat would he have would the senator say mr soule expressed his readiness to answer he was willing to abide ny the tenth section it amended os proposed by his friend from mississippi mr davis and had no objection but would go for the bill with important but reasonable amendments mr clay w as glad to hear the senatoi so express himselfthere was some hope of him afier all he had supposed from nis speech that he was committed irrecoverably against anv measure of compromise would mr soule be satisfied with the section if the clause objected to was stricken out alio gethet mr soule would be satisfied with the amendment of mr davis m claybut the senator knew that they could not agree to that because it assumed a tact winch he denied that slavery already exists in mexico and a so that the constitution ol the united stales carried slavery there if however he would he satisfied w ith a provision that the legislature shall neither establish not exclude slavery he mr clay wuuldftssent to it li was time that the troubles in the country should be composed he had not been among those who believed the immediate danger to the union existed but he w as one of those w ho believed that if this agnation was continued a year or two longer there was no telling w hat danger might ensue if the dissolution of the union in terms did not ensue that w hich was next to it to be dreaded wouldthe dicsolution ol the ties ofcbmtian brotherhood which bind us together as a nation lie also expressed the belief that if this compromise bill or some measure of the same character did not pass nothing would be done for california the territories and a fugitive slave act noth ji mg to soothe the agitated feelings of the country and to save the effusion of blood and even if congress should pass any one eri more of these measures it w ould have no beneficial effect upon ihe country because one section would continue biiterly to reproach the other for having secured its own ends without making provision fur the others he also again contrasted the presidents plan of settlement with that which the committee had presented and called upon the friends of i the former in preference to the latter to stand up face to face in its defence he challenged the contrast all agreed that it was necessary to restore peace and harmony to the country by some means what then were the measures proposed fur that purpose there were five gaping wounds all and each bleeding and threatening destruction what was the plan of the presidentlo heal all thee wounds no but to close up one ol them only and leave all the rest to produce certain death instead of proposing a plan comprehending the whole subject he had pioposed one which was at most a feeble palliative he mr cay had seen with surprise and regret the rebalance made by the chief magistrate to the scheme of the committee the president had come here with his plan recommending the admission of california the senate agreed to that aa far aa it went but thought it necessary to go further and so proposed the president ought then in ihe spiritbl compromise which should prevail in both ends of the avenge w hen the committee proposed additional enactments to heal np these wounds he should have hailed the measure with joy and given it his sanction and support instead of opposing it it in any mauner whatever mr clay also again commented upon the evils of a military government in a time of profound peace as applied to the teriitories and ridiculed the idea of any action by which the south should maintain the equilibrium of power in the union slavery was nut the only interest in the minority in this country the mauulac luring fishing commercial and other interests were alt in the minority and yt the

whig of va had taken his position before the assembling of con gress in favor ol the admission of california and had seen nothing to change his views i he defended the president from the charge of

disunion there need beno fears for the old dominions pairiotbm the disunionists in that commonwealth could be put to rout by her sxity clerks in office here mr gerry dem of maine said that the people of the north in common with the civilized world have no sympathy with slavery and with a few inlamous exceptions will sacredly and religiously discharge the duties they owe to the uuion and slave

seized the negro who had sufficiently recovered to stand upon his feet and with the blood streaming down his sable cheeks they began to push him toward the river the captive was a mulatto much belter dressed than his raptors and looked much more the man he was slim and tall and straight as an arrow lie had diank at the fountain of fteedom and appreciated its worth he had resided for years in ihe

lives has called the name of providence to be given to more than one coral reef and desolate island in the indian seas rarely perhaps has it been more appropriately bestowed than if was on a small rocky islet which lies to the northward of the mozambique channel a few days sail from the isle of bourbon this story is scarcely known even to mariners of the nation to which the hero of it belonged and therefore to make it familiar to our readers may not bethought undesirable in the year of m cremacy the captain of a bourbon trading vessel resolved to visit the little island of providence in order to obtain a cargo of cocoanut germs for planting in the colony to which he belonged the appliances for navigating the eastern coast of africa were at that time very rude chain cables were not known but were made from the fibres of the plain simitar to teose which are called goumonton in the belebeo coir on the spanish main these cables are very liable to be cut by the sharp reefs and coral bottom which abound so plentifully in the indian ocean and in order to spare the anchors a wooden frame filled with stones called a pe gase was the frequent substitute immediately on his anchoring in this manner at providence m cremasy went on shore and sent back his boat with her crew to the ship while he explored the island he had thus been occupied for sometime when the cable of the pegase broke and the vessel was carried out to sea by one of the violent currents which set off these shores the mate made sail as speedily as he could to regain the anchorage but he was unable to head the current and the night fell while he was endeavoring to do so the captain left on shore by this accident had on at the time nothing but a jacket and a pair of white trousers and for his sole weapon a manchette a kind of short sabre used in boarding when he found himself condemned topass the night in this desert island his first care was to construct a place ol shelter and with the broad leaves ol the cocoa tree he built up an ajoup or hut and made his supper of cocoanuts eating the fruit and drinking the milk he did not sleep over soundly for he was tormented by ajvague apprehension concerning his vessel the sense of loneliness oppressed him and he was somewhat in fear of rats and other noxious animals at daybreak he was on shore anxiously looking out to discover a sail on the horison bul nothing was visible through the misty morning air the sun rose and dispelled the mist but his rays fell upon a wide expanse of azure sea unbroken by any vessel he sat down on a reck and began to meditate upon his future destiny there was but one course open to him to bestir himself for the supply ol his daily wants with his manchette in his hand he set out once more to explore the territory of which he was the unwilling sovereign he got nothing but cocoanut for his breakfast and dined also upon the same fruita luxury to a schoolboy but held not inequal estimation by a hungry sailor though he thought himself lucky that the island produced anything eatable by dint of prosecuting his researches m cremasy succeeded in making an addition to his vegetable diet in the shape of some wild cucumbers but he was unwilling to eat them raw and had no means of cooking them by fire a native if the island had been peopled would have lit one for him by the friction of two pieces of wood he remembered the method of the savages and procuring a sort of light wood made a hole in it with another piece ofa harder kind and by twirling it rapidly endeavored to kindle a flame but whether from accident or want of skill he wasnot successful in his attempt and when the sun went down he was once more left in darkness on the following day he again looked out for the ship but again without success he therefore redoubled his efforts to procure fire and by dint of perseverance at length produced alight smoke upon the wood he then hastily collected some fibresbres of the cocoa nut and placed themin contact with the ignitied substance and at last was rewarded by a brillianj spark which presently broke into ablaze he now got together a sufficient quantity to keep the fire all night heaped it with branches and dried leaves and watched it with interest until the third moruing broke tired out with his exertions he at length fell asleep but he had not been asleep long before he was awakened by a singular noise as if some one was slowly creeping towards him he opened his eyes and looked wishfully into the obscurity of the dawn and presently saw a large object stealing across the sand he grasped his manchette and waited nervously for its nearer approach at length he discovered an enormous turtle come according to the habits of that animal to lay its eggs above highwater mark the turtle always selects a situation that catches all the rays of the sun they make a hole in the sand cover up the eggs and fifty days afterwards without fail their instinct brings them back to disinter them at the moment when the layer of sand which covers them is removed the young turtles break their shells and follow their dam to the waters edge and when they reach the waves they make themselves fast to her belly and are towed out to sea to qualify them jn time for the feasts of the aldermen as soon as m cremasy ascertained who his early visitor really was he walked stealthily towards her and turning her over kept guard over her till daylight came and dispatched her it was a task of some difficulty to cut her up but when he had succeeded he found himself repaid for his trouble the turtle was capital he boiled the meat which he thought excellent and preserved the fat which he disposed of in the shells of the small turtle on the shore and oat of the fibres of the cocoa nut be made wicks in this manner constructing a very notable sort of lamp antique in fashion and moreover highly useful to season bis turtle be then procured salt from the evaporation of sea water and converted the shell of his visitor into a caldron with these civilized means of cooking he ceased to enjoy his cocoanut milk and laid in a stock of freshwater obtaining it by sinking a well into the sand it soon became necessary to wash his linen but he could not bring himself to the resolution of remaining a siogle instant entirely naked he therefore would wash one garment at a time wearing his shirt until his trowsers were dried and vice versa he next burnt a clear space round his hut to keep off the rats and fortified himself within a ditch well fenced against intrusion by sharp palmetto branches and the stiff leaves of prickly pears in the course of his walks he had seen a number of pigeons who allowed him to get tolerably close to them he therefore set to work to hunt them down on foot with a long pole and thus added a very agreeable dish to his repast for when roasted they proved extremely tender and succulent with flesh and fowl to supply his table it was not long before he got a third requisite of good dinner on the south side of the island was a coral reef upwards often leagues in length which the tide when it went out left high and dry at low water the fish hid themselves in the hollows where the water remained and our solitary islander discovered in this fact a new source for employment every day at low water he went out to the reef sought for the reservoirs which contained the greatest number of fish and then harpooned them with his boarding sabre some of these he salted and the rest were immediately cook ed but however earnestly m cremasy labored to improve his position on thought dominated over all othersthe hope of finding the means of escaping from his solitude when not employed in procuring and preparing food he passed his whole time on the lookout for any vessel that might shape her course within sight of providence his eyes were ever turned towadrs that point of the compass where his own ship had disappeared anda thousand painful apprehensions disquieted himthe dread of its having been wrecked on some of the sunken rocks of that dangerous archipelago being the most paramount but he was not one to give himself up for any time to inactivity he knew the value of the proverb which tells men to assist themselves if they look for aid of others and accordingly resolved upon constructing a beacon which should be visible at the distance of several leagues it was without difficulty that he succeeded in collecting a sufficient quantity of heavy wood to make a pile he heaped it a mass of dry leaves and placed dry branches in alternate layers with the trunks of the cocoa and the palmetto this accomplished his eyes wandered toward the ocean to seize the favorite moment for lighting up his beacon but da followed day and his solitude grew more and more dreary his only pleasure consisted in watching the frigate birds as they chased the gulls and robbed them of the prey they brought home from the great waters it was after all a mel oncholy sort of pleasure for the screams of the tarnished sea birds did not tend much to enliven the solitariness of the shore m cremasy at length began to get uneasy about the condition ofhis wardrobe how could he manage to cover himself he asked when his shirt and trousers were torn to tatters the necessity of the case suggested an expedient he manufactured a kind of cloth out of the threadlike substance of the interior ol the palm wheth he wove together as well as he was able it was not a firstrate production but it served at all events to prevent the sun from scorching and the night air from chilling him and then he had the ineffable satisfaction of admiring his own handiwork he managed also to fabricate a pair of sandals out of the ropy bark of the cocoanut tree in this primitive costume he determined upon examining the island thoroughly the task was not difficult for providence is little more than two leagues in circumference and the surface is nearly level about onethird of it the part which lies to windward is covered with a forest of cocoanut the currents and the prevailingwinds have cast innumerable seeds on the eastern shore where they have germinated taken root and in the lapse of ages created the forest we spoke of the remainder of the island is merely a sandy plain with stunted shrubs scattered here and there but little grass and what there is course in touch and salt to the taste a more desolate spot altogether can hardly be imagined and here it seemed probable that mr cremacy was destined to end hia days deliverance came however when he least expected it he was one evening returning to his ajoupa in a very pensive mood absorbed in thoughts of the home he feared he should never revisit whenas he stooped to gather some shellfish for his supper be fancied that something like the sails of a ship glittered on the horizon in the rays of the setting sun he had been so often deceived by the clouds which assumed the same form that he was afraid to trust to his first impression he watched the object steadily and noted that while the aspect of everything else changed this alone preserved its first appearance and moreover that it was nearing the island he could no longer doub that it was a ship his heart beat high between fear and hope was if his own vessel or a strangershould he at once light the beacon at the risk ofrapidly and perhaps uselessly consuming what it trad given so much trouble to collect but the sail gmw closer he resolved to take his chance ind the moment it became dark enough for his purpose he set fire to tie pile a pyramid of flame shot up in o the sky tod a minute afterward the report ofa gun assured hi that the signal had been seen he ow listened intently and the next sosnd that reached his ears was the noiii of the oars in the rowjodks as with measured beat thej urged the boat as ore the keel grated on the rocky bottom but he bad already hailed the crew and in the joyous answer ttyri floated over the breeze he heard jhis own language and recognized the voices of his shipmates the vessel in the ofling was his owu and the mate had come back to look for him carried away by the violent currents and water and provisions failing the former had been obliged to make for anjouan near ma gotte to vitual the ship he then returned in search of his captain the exile wrote the history of his thirtytwo days imprisonment and placed it in a bottle which he hung upon one of the most prominent treeß on the coast an english vessel passing by a few months since happened to send a boat on shore for a supply of cocoanuts and thus discovered the narrative the sailors also tound that the island was overrun with wild poultry for when m cremasy took leave of providence he lefthehind him a small stock which multiplied as he desired it was an offering of grateful remembrance for the mercy which had sparred him pork eating the jews turks arabians and all they who observe the precept of avoiding blood and swines flesh are infinitely more free from disease than the christians more especially do they escape those opprobria of the medical art scorfula gout consumption and madness the turks eat great quantities of honey and pastry and much sugar they also eat largely and are indolent yet do not suffer from dyspepsia as the christians do the swinefed natives of christendom suffer great devastations from a painful tubercular disease of the bowels dysentery than from any other cause under my own observation and in my own experience those persons who abstain from swines flesh and blood are infinitely more healthy and free from humors glanu lar diseases dyspepsia and consumption while in those districts and among those classes of men where the pig makes the chief article of diet tubercle in all its forms of eruptions sore legs bad eyes and abscesses most prevail it is a remarkable coincidence that prince edwards island has a climate exactly similar to great britain yet the inhabitants are not consumptive neither is the pig here culti vatedparry on diet a pleasant occupation a correspondent of the albany express has furnished the annexed account of an individual residing at lake george whose employment is thst of catching and taming rattleshakes the staple commodity of the principal mountains in the vicinity of the lake during my rambles i fell in witha queer old covey apparently about sixty years of age who profers the sport of catching rattlesnakes to the more pleasant and less dangerous one of shooting deer and other wild game or catching trout i was shown six or eight ofthese amiable creatures which were safely secured in a strong cage made expressly for their accommodation i his man sells large quantities to itinerant showmenothers he kills for the purpose of obtaining their oil which is said to be very valuable being an excellent remedy for rheumatic and other complaints the modus operandi of catching them is as follows a strong leather loop or noose is attached to the end of a pole eight or ten feet in lengthwith this pole he cautiously approaches the den in front of which the snakes bask in the sun placing the noose over the head and neckthe noose being so constructed that when the snake struggles the tighter he is held rendering escape impossible when the old fellow wishes to tame them and render them harmless he extracts their fangs in the following manner he lays the head across a log of wood then places his foot on the neck pressing it until his snakeship throws back his upper jaw the mode in which they bitehe then applies a pair of pincers and with the coolness of an experienced dentist pulls out the fangs one by one he has been twice bitten by these reptiles and at one time came near losing his life his body being swollen in a horrible mannerbut he fortunately discovered a weed of spontaneous growth on the mountains which has proved to bean infallible remedy for the bite of the rattlesnake it is said there is no accounting for tastes this mans employment is a pretty fair illustration of this saying english law lord brougham n a speech on may drew the allowing picture
