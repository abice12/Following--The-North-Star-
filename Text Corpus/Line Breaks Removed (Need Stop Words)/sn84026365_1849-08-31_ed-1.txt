this sacred anniversarywhose every return proves more conclusively that principle and policy are one and inseparableis tho fitting occasion tor flinging to tho breeze the antislavery flag it would be a pleasure to speak of thd triumphant progress of emaneipa tion in the english v est india islands and to bear a tribute of honor to the successful ehurts ot our colored countrymen to assume their rightful position industrially socially religiously in the free states of the union but the urgency of the times presents other topics the end of this article is simply to take ground on the question of slavery extension now forced upon the people of this nation and to open one plain path of political duty facts and probabilities the pouring in ot a flood ot treemen upon california the professed desire of the administration to devolve upon citizens already there the responsibility of forming institutions for the new state the growing expectation that this state will apply to congress next

another on the assurance inn tome atonement has been made for the the north star nations crime of conquest and usurpation and some pledge of practical penitence offered to mankind by hypocritical professors of republicanism whose free institutions are based upon oppression but let us not be sluggish or selfcon fident for then the tragedies will he consummate d in a catastrophe more dark and dreadful even than the tri urnphs of absolutism in europeby spreading over the once free regions of mexico the black and bloody shroud of slavery prospective policy if one could believe that the administration are really impartial if there w as not ground for fearing that the dubious phrase of general rileys proclamation several times repeated laics not inconsistent icith the constitution and laics of the united states is meant to cover the slaveholding compromises if there was reason for supposing that the people of california would be left free to organize their own institutions and to apply in their own way for admission to the union or if in the event that such application shall be found premature next winter the naked question of slavery extension or slavery limitation could be presented to congressthe way would be plain then it might be briefly settled that slavery shall bring its long tolerated aggressions to an end but it would be childish credulity to expect that any such simple problem will be offered for solution no the slave power knows its own weakness too w r ell for straightforwardnessreckless haughty presumptuous though it is its policy will he to complicate the question wrap it about in a web of constitutional sophistries mix it up with party issues overlay it with all manner of delusive projects and hide the single aim of slavery extension amidst specious professions of regard for national interests what pathos indignation logic paternal love of california protestations of patriotism conservative appeals in behalf of the violated constitution c will the walls of both chambers of the capitol echo next winter and beneath what tons of printed twaddle will stages steamboats railroads groan on every mail route true wisdom is to be prepared for any possible crisis are we prepared let us look at some of the combinations which may be offered to the deliberative and decision of the people and statesmen before six months are over california offers itself with a slaveholding constitution or what amounts to the some a constitution not positively prohibiting slavery what shall the party of freedom do reject it instantly uncompromisingly are we ready for that course with all the consequences before answering let us consider what these consequences are  congress cannot be brought to reject such a constitution what shall the party of freedom do retire senators and representatives announce to their respective states and constituencies that the union is broken and summon in legal modes private assemblies of the people to form a new union of freemen congress will not pass the antislavery extension proviso what shall the party of freedom do declare that the old state l will he in no way participators in the crime of slavery extension over new states call upon the californians to preserve their free institutions and if necessary take measures as in the previous case for organizing a yeic union including california congress accepts california witha free constitution or else passes the antilavery extension proviso and one two three of the slaveholding states nultify or secede what shall the party of freedom do take them at their word proceed instantly to conform and and carry out a decisive policy of slavery limitation and admit the self exiled states again only on condition of their adopting constitutions based upon emancipation equality and justice the simplest combinations have been purposely presented for the end of bringing dearly out this one thought that any successful attempt to extend slavery over the territories newly submitted to our guardianship should be treated as a virtual dissolution of the union unless the party of freedom is prepared to take this firm ground of principle it is to be fearedand it would be false to hide the fearthat once again the freemen of this nation will find themselves cajoled browbeaten and entrapped into suicidal and criminal subservience to the faction of a slave bolding oligarchy which has tyrannized over the united slates for a half century slavery must on no consideration be allowed a hairsbreadth of standing room in these new countries it would be fatal folly to talk of abolishing it if once allowed to show its head there let not repeal of slavery extending legislation be dreamed of or mentioned as a possibility the proviso or a free constitution should bo the calm unflinching inexorable demand his course is the only conservative ne and throws the blame of destructive policy where it rightly belongs on he aggressive slavepower it is the only righteous one according to the acknowledged principles of our government the religion professed by our nation the plain dictates of humanity and the law of god had freemen been deliberately firmly oady at the time of the annexation of lyxas and the mexican war to say to tie slavepower put your plots in xecution at your peril their consuio nation will be held by uf to be a virtual of the old l won nod wc right is of no sextrrth is of no rgod is th father of vs all and all we are brethren shall straightway summon the people to form a new unionthis nation never would have been plunged upon its infamous career of robbery and murder vote at last then let us be prepared let the people in their primary assemblies let legislatures and mate conventions let representatives and senators in congress announce their abso  lute resolve in the brief words slarery limitation or the mat i nion of freemen l fmm uie rinuioliam eng mercury i american courtesy and lib erty most of our readers know the name we presume of mr frederick doug j lass the man of color who escaping from slavery published an account of his own and his masters doings during his bondage under a citizen of the freest country in the world andi afterwards traveled through our less favored land giving lectures on the state of the blacksslaves and freedmen of north america probably some of them may have heard him speak in the townhall here nav have gone so far as to shake hands with him and remain seated within a few yards ol him do they remember any thing strikingly unpleasant in such close contact with this specimen of the highest race of monkeys do they think they could possibly have taken any meal in l his company yve presume they will surely say no to the one and yes to the j other especially after reading the following account received from our own correspondent who be it well marked was on board the steamer mentioned at the time on thursday may the thwe like to be particular in order to aid the memory of any passenger concerned in our storymr frederick douglass in company with two english ladies left albany by the steamboat alida capt i fred w strue for new york the i breakfast of the party was early and hurried as the steamer started at a m there were many passengers on board chiefly americans we must say we hope there were not many englishmen soon after starting a presbyterian minister from cincinnati who had become acquainted with mr douglass the day before joined the trio seeing a notice posted up passengers can be accommodated with meals at any hour of the day the ladies wished for luncheon about a i but agreed to wait and order dinner for four in about an hour including coffee mr douglass wet below to order it the steward took the order but nothing being forthcoming in half an hour he went again and came back with the news that they must yet be patient about p m a bell sounded and forthwith the passengers all turned towards the saloon lr douglass and his three companions descended and seated themselves at a table spread for dinner but not yet furnished with guests several american gentlemen seated themselves at the opposite end but on glancing up the table suddenly seemed to have forgotten something and rising went to another in a few minutes a small man came up to mr douglass and tapping him oh the shoulder said you mustnt sit here yy r hat did you observe asked mr d say you must nt sit here you know you mustnt its against our rules against what rules pray who are you for i dont know asked mr douglass im the steward and say you mustnt be here well said mr d show me your rules i should like to see them saw it written up on the captains office that passengers can be eccommodated with meals at any hour of the day i am a passengerlve paid my fare and i wish for my dinner now and here the small dignitary replied you know its against our rules and i command you to leave the table and so saying he strutted off to fetch the captain meantime at two long tables sat some forty or fifty lean lanternjawed americans bolting away and looking onhow shall we say down came the captain the first mate the cook and the small steward to drag mr douglass forcibly from his seat not wishing to create more disturbance than was necessary to bear testimony and protest against this conduct mr douglass rose and with his three indignant friends went to the stairs leading to the deck on which the civilized and white americans ceasing for a moment their voracious repast favored them with three cheers and clapping of hands whereupon one of the english ladies could keep down the steam no longer and approaching the table said will you allow a lady to speak gentlemen yve are english ladies mores the shame muttered a few we have heard much in england continued she of the courtesy of the american gentlemen yve have now had an opportunity of witnessing it as english ladies we thank you for the demonstration we have received at your hands and we will take care that the br tish press shall tell of the steamboat alida and her passenger this day yyhen the guests came up the steps concluding their rapid dinner by that elegant finale picking their teeth some of them showed a curiosity to see the faces of the halfstarving four but it they expected tears or crestfallen looks tbev were disappointed for the party were rather iorlined just then to march up and down the deck a little more haughtily and to laugh more merrily than before but nature by r m began to assert her right and the ladies felt so faint for want of food that mr douglass went below again and asked for some coffee for them well now jnjr friend id mr d f tbit ie realjjr rochester n y friday august bad we come to voa at dinnertime and you wont let us bave anything and now you refuse because it is noi dinnertime those ladies want sotm coffee well are you to hare any said the little man why said ml d i should like some very much yytell yon cant have it who an you are you the servant of those ladiesr if you are you may taxc theni some coffee on deck ves lam those indies servant replied mr i but the lurking provoking smile on his face prevented the faith ot tne little stewaid in this statement and he ordered him off with muttered impre cations alter a while the cincinnati minister tried his luck as messenger but he was not to be trusted not to give a share to the man of color and his errand was vain not having provided anything to eat but a few lozenges the four friends were not sorry when at p m they arrived at new york and left the river hudson and its steatnei alida may its memory be henceforth intamously notorious among oui readers and let them allexpressing their opinion on these and such like occurrences how otherwise they please follow our example and resolve never to dirty their feet with the dust ol the alida but wait if they must go up or down the noble hudson for the confidence yve omit our correspondents remarks as perfectly superfluous and have scarcely any words to express our own yy t e only vouch for the veracity of the narrator lowa to old zach greeting resolccd that the administration ol general taylor as far as it has proceeded upon its mission has unblush inly falsified every promiseand grossly violated every pledge given before the election by its nominal chief and that a party which can go before the country upon one set of issues and immediately after its installation into power enter upon the practice of another set is more than ever deserving of the reprobation of the world and of the coniinuedand uncompromising hostility of the democratic party resolved that general taylor for the part which he has played or has been made to play in this digraceful game of deception has displayed a want of honest principle of a weakness of mind and character which equally disqualify him for the place he holds and fully justifies the worst predictions ever made qgainst hi fitness for the presidency and that although we may once have admired the soldier in the tented field we are now reluctantly brought to condemn and to repudiate the cypher in the cabinet of the country from the herkimer freeman anniversary of british emancipation at worcester here i am in the heart of the commonwealth of massachusetts at the great passover of freedom on the green earth under a golden sky yvm lloyd garrison who first agitated the question of emancipation in this country has taken the stand his baldhead and bright spectacles hine under the glowing sun whilst his eloquent lips give utterance to thoughts that have hearts in them he reads appropriate passages from the bible showing the weakness and wickedness of men bowing their heads like a bulrush whilst they continue to smite with the fist of wickedness now he whips the man who whipt the mexicans i shall not attempt to report the speeches for that ladyfaced fairheaded young man with spectacles on who is driving a quill yonder is employed as a reporter ani he will give the addresses verbatim et literatim et punctuatim et spel latim after singing one of the odes which had been printed and distributed among the audience charles c burleigh with his long beard and flowing ringlets ascended the platform and after gazing at the throng before him for a moment he thrilled that vast assemblage with a lucid and logical address which won the admiration of all if this talented reformer had more faste and less vanity with respect to his personal appearance he would wield the club of a hercules in the cause of abolition he replied to those who inquire why americans celebrate the triumphs of british emancipationists if you desire to know how charmingly and beautilully he did so procure a copy of the proceedings of this jovous jubilee and read his speech mr garrison remarked that he pronounced an eulogy on the next speaker when he announced his nametheo dore parker mr parker is not an eloquent speaker he is an ordinary looking man and has a low voice his eyes are dull and his features coarse but he has a magnificent head although his manner is ungraceful his matter is glorious those who did nt hear it and who may enjoy the intellectual treat of reading it w ill probably regard it as the speech of the day among other good things he said that col benton was a thermometer held up in our political weather and that it was the heat of antiala very agitation that raised his mercury so high he said the abolitionists had kindled a fire in the rear of tne doughfaces of the north sent to yyashington another ode was sung and the meeting adjourned lor one hour on my way to the hospital grove this afternoon i heard one ot the lemale inmates of the asylum for the insane making loud lamentations looked but could not see her i listened but coaid not lesrn the cause of her trouble at the meeting again adin ballou is making a musical speech which con siais mainly in rephe io the response of men in the crowd whoee heart are brimful of humanity he took for his text an imaginary proclamation which is to be sent to the president of the tinted states wendell phillips having been called for came forward and although evidently laboring under bodily indisposition made as he always docs an effe tive and eloquent speech he alluded most beautifully to wilber forces ascending to heaven bearing in his hands the fragments of a million ot broken fetters affording proof that he was at hi masters work during his sojourn on the earth when mr phillips mounted the rostrum i overheard some ladies observe he is a handsome man they spoke the truth and exhibited good taste he is not a bandbox beauty gloved brushed and perfumed he is not a parisian dandy with mustache and imperial he is what may be termed an intellectual man bearing on his form and face the impress of manly beauty and unfaltering integrity he furnished his hearers with an eloquent history of emancipation in the west india islandsafter which ralph waldo emerson came forward he is an indifferent speakerhesita ting stammering and stumbling through a disconnected speech like a drunken man in the dark he is ali intellect but cannot make an improptu speech read his essays and there you will find glowing eloquence thrilling poetry and mighty thoughts clad in a rich regalia of language mr emerson appeared to great disadvantage because he was afflicted with a hoarse cold and follwed phillips oi america who is not excelled by phillips of ire land a white man with a tinge of african blood in his veins was next called tc the stand so that the people present might see what kind of slaves they have south his eyes are blue his hair straight his complexion fairer than that of many europeans in fact he escaped from bondage in company with a white man none mistrusting that he was a southern man with northern principles g w b august from tlie pratiral christian the celebration of british west india emancipation and observance oi general taylors fast went off well the abolitionists mustered in clusters which seemed a pretty conclusive refutation of the fib that jthey are dying out the multitude assembled in hospital grove where at half past ten oclock a m the meeting was organ lzed by choosing win lloyd garrison president seven vice presidents anti three secretaries completed the organization richard s edes of bolton offered prayer garrison then read and commented on taylors proclamation and also that of gov briggs he then read appropriate portions of the scripture from matthew gospel and from the books of isaiah and jeremiah singing followed led by the friends from hopedale letters from gentlemen invited to attend but who could not convenintly do so were next read viz from john g palfrey charles sumner and parker pillsbury father matthew neither attended nor excused himself by letter it apnenrs from credible testimony given on the occasion that this distinguished friar though a great abolitionist three thousand miles off in old ireland ignores the whole antislavery agitation here in this land of slaveholders he expects to go among them and be their guest as the apostle of teetotalism and a genuine catholic priest therefore heis determined to know nothing amongst us but temperance and the catholic religion his conduct in this matter reveals such a want of uncompromising moral principle such unmanly narrowness of philanthropic feeling and such calculating servility to the oroslavery of the landthat truehearted abolitionists must turn awav from him with sorrowful disgust happily they are veteran teetotalers and do not need either his pledge medal or benediction and as to his popery most of them can do without that for our own part we should despise ourselves to be caught doing homage either in public or private even to the temperance preeminence of such a man to be sure he was under na obligation to go to the worcester meeting but he was under the highest moral obligations to declare the same hostility to slavery on this side of the atlantic that he had on the other is there no end to this generation of timeservers and popularity seekers it is well that there are tests whereby the essence of mens moral principles can be ascertained but let the prudent friar husband his iniiuence and fame in his own way the world will go forward to a hopeful maturity just as we had written to this point the chronotype of the th came to hand with an elaborate editorial leader panegyrizing matthews conduct and denouncing garrison as a man who does not care the value of a copper cent for the cause of freedom or temperance except so far as it will buildup his own fame we have nothing more to say of this article at present than that in relation to both parties itis the most reptilelike of any tiling weever read in the chronotype but to return numerous addresses from devoted friends of the aatisla very cause were delivered forenoon and afternoon interspersed with appropriate songs by the singers mr park hurst the celebrated phonographic reporter was in attendanceand we understand most of the remarks made on the occasion are soen to be published in the liberator if toy portion of the american people observed president zacharys fast acceptably to god or beneficially to man it was dooe by this f antislavery mass meeting its wholesome fruits will be seen and acknowledged in the good time coming speech of theodore parker sir kohcrt feci in a speech which i he has recently made widely read in england and more widely here has declared that he has no faith in disinterested philanthropy mr palfrey in his letter alluded to some gentle menperhaps not present whoin the antislavery enterprise spent a sum agreat as they spent on their own families every year i take it those mer believe in disinterested philanthropy i hope there is not a men before m that does nt believe in itl know tbert is not a woman applause w e have come here today to cotn memorate one of the most remarkable acts of disinterested philanthropy evei performed by a nation an act of whole jiy disinterested philanthropy of plain justicewhich is only philanthropy in short of that i need not speak have sometimes thought that antislavery menwhile they eulogised england on the one hand and while they spoke reproachfully of america on the other a little overrated the antislavery feeling there would not speak willingly with disrespect of our motherland but i think had those slaves been on the fastan i chored island of england they woulc i not have been freemen in b the would have been slaves today there is nothing in the past history there is nothing in the present condition of england which leads a man tc believe or to be certain at least tba had the british people american slavery to deal with they could have born themselves more nobly than ourselves recently they have done some noble i things taken a long step in an important direction abolished the corn laws a good thing repealed the navigatior laws a good thing but if a man shoulc stand up in england and lift up his voice against the most tyrannous institutions there he would meet the same opposition that he encounters here he lifted up his hand and his voice and spoke in behalf of the millions ol men who till the fields and tend the ooms of manchester he would encounter still stronger opposition and denunciation yet more ferocious if that be possible still this was a great act and a nobie act and when it was first performec there were some earnest and sanguim men here who in the passing belle west india slavery heard the funera knell also ot american slavery sanguine men said that also must sooi fall and perish but now when elevei years have passed by men look anc say that we have done nothing thai there has been antislavery agitation i but not antislavery pi ogress i know as we look at the matter a first it seems as if there was nothing that had been done since bb throe administrations of this nation have begun two serve out their time and the third is in the full tide of successful experiment laughter successful has its meaning there all these were administrations of slaveholders mr tyler the whig slaveholder if whi ihe were mr polk the whig slaved holder a voice democratic deni i ocraticexcuse me the whigs have not the monopolymr polk the democratic slaveholder who became a christian on his deathbed a voice better late than never ay better late i than never if it w ere so a very orthodox christian no doubt who declared that he did not expect to go to heaven for his morality but to go thereby the sprinkling of water from the priests hand two administrations of slaveholding presidents have begun and ended and the third call n whig or call it democrat which you will my friends is in the full tide of successful experiment there lias been added to this family of states florida a slave state w ith a constitution perpetuating slavery there has been added a new territory formed free from this institution a territory big as the whole kingdom of france and slavery established reestablished there made perpetual so far as constitutions can bind there has been a war fought in behalf ol slavery to get new soil and now a territory larger than the old thirteen states lies there and the bold slaveholders modest now no more k bui grown insolent as they have grown proud and proud as they have grown rich insist that freedom shall not set her foot in that place vv e know that the north seeds mento washington the whig party sends them and the democratic part sends them ready to extend this institution over that soil unless you say them nay great men have cornc up and great men have gone down bul not one of the famous and mighty men in polities of this land has come forward as the avowed and unfliuching champion of this antislavery enterprise men look at this and they say that we have done nothing look at it in another way and you will see that tiiere has been something done in every great movement there are three periods and the fint is the period of tenluntnt meu feel that there is something wrong they feel that there is likewise somewhere something right the antagonist of thew rong and its antidote besides bui all it vague all is uncertain sometimes in the period of brntiment men rush iostantly into action the action is always a failure after the period of k comes tb period ot ideas then bat feeling hu beta trtptitted tato oh dirk prrufhc whole no i bought and men arc striving to make the idea perfect representing facts to make it complete representing every ot this is a long period and a period ot hard and earnest and stern w rk idea is brought into collision with idea scheme with scheme plan with plan and the two ideas struggle each for victory both for existence after the period of ideas after the idea becomes perfect and complete then men pass to the period of action e arc at this moment in the period ot ideas ihe period of action has i not yet come men that have the idea seek to gain the sentiirait they seek to diffuse the idea and when the sentiment has kindled wide and deep in the nation when the idea has been dilfused perfectly among the people then conics the period of action but while men are without tiie sentiment or with it slave not the idea if you propose to them your plan and you say no more sin rc territoni they cannot understand you you say tmi or annihilate the slave trade between the states t ey cannot comprehend that ibolish slavery in the terriloriesand the distinct they cannot take in even that you say to them no union with slaveholders of course they cannot understand that they have not been through the preparatory stage oi sentiment and idea to grapple with the harder practical lessons that come afterward and yet during this time vastly much has been done in the way of j kindling sentiment and spreading the idea lookattiie state of feeling not long since it is nt a great while since the representative of middlesex i edward everett on the floor of congress justified slavery out of the new testament declaring also that if any caase would lead him to put on j his knapsack and shoulder his musket it would he to put down an insurrecli u of the slaves that was the voice that went from lexington and bunker i hill was it no lexington and bunker hill have since sent another man there mr paifkey made ot other stair and who makes other i speeches teo since that time say there has been a great change a little while after that when the anli  slavery of massachusetts was incar noted in one man other prophets there were other apostles but i am not doing more than historical justice j when i say i was incarnated in one man and that one man so obscure j and so unknown to lame thut tho mayor of boston could ipt find him until he called in the police to aid and then tho only visible auxiliary of antislavery was a negro hoylaugh ter and applause since thut day there has been a little ciinngc in nnti alavery feeling in antislavery ideas it is not long since the governor of massachusetts mr everett sug j gested to the legislature whether it was not proper thut they should legislate to prevent antislavery discussion we have changed that a little and during this time what have we lost that we had before one man john quincy adams standing in his place iti the house of representatives the beargarden of the nation as some mun says it isboldly and earnestly lifted up his voice old hut eloquent in behalf of mankind hun we have lost but in his place we imve bent there one mightier than he with inoro power of intellect though far inferior in years with more power of sentiment and of ideas with more power of jus  tice and without the alloy of passion one known by heart to all of you i doubt not aid who is an honor to tho name he bears the name of manx applause look and sec some of the signs ay some of the proofs of this waking of antislavery sentiment of this diffusion of antislavery ideas this morning the boston post becoming moral on the subject of slavery the boston post reads a sharp lecture to the editor of the villas and rates him for being proslavery laughter who would have dared to promise that ten years ugo no man see too the grow th of this great this mighty free soil party all over i the noitli the antislavery sentiment i has been knidled all over the north the antislavery idea has been diffused i know the sentim nt dies not burn strong and the idea has not taken hold deep of the whole mas of men hut j there are spots where it burns like afire in the woods where the idea sends out its light into the daikness and it is heeded even at noonday might cail to witness a recent convention at cleveland as one proof of it i might point to the numerous newspapers avowedly antislavery i might point to the clergymen whom i see thinly indeed scattered throughout this assembly and you all know that the clergyl myself am one of them are not the first t move in any christian or public enterprie where popularity is not ensured beforehand a voicetruth true i know it to be true i consider the presence of these men thinly scattered one proof and not one of the least striking and sgnffi cant proofs but here i another they say perhaps a fable i cio not give it a a isct tluy say that scorpions when gr about by a ting of fire which they cannot breakthrough turn upon each other and join fang to fang and poison cornea to poison ee those gentlemen to wnorn allude shall have all the benefit of the comparisonso w e see two mighty southern politicians surrounded by a ring of antislavery fire winch they cannot break through benton and calhoun joining fang to faag and poison tooth to poison tooth this is not without its significance a mr benton is a democrat will you av that mr benton abhor alswv h mat i s so and before i wlb might bo true but it is not the ein of pn tti oans to bo righteous over much ai k ts j and applause there is nothing that know in the past history or present character ot that distinguished man whom eertainly i honor tor manv wise counsels and some noble deed nothing m his past history or pieeni character which would lead me euppose th o he sets a higher estimate than su robert ivel on disinterested philanthropy i lake him therefore as a mngnrficant sign of the times and for the present purpose he is inure valuable as an indication ot the times than if he had all the heroism of some men whom will not name look on him as agreat thermometer hung up in our olinca weaher and he shows the antislavery heat it is that which makes his mercury rise up to the free soil point renewed applause these my fnenda are signs not to be mistaken signs not to be sken against if may speak out ot my own profession which show that the antislavery sentiment has got kindled and the antislavery ideadif iuaed these men have not labored m vain mr calhoun tells ut m that famous lettei emanating from the slavery committee ru washington mr calhoun tells ns that the anti slavery men have done a good deal towards effecting then end it is a great confession bet h la not fully hue they have done a good deal towards their beginning noi towards their end for the end is not yet these men will not be satisfied with having no more slave territory not be satisfied wit restricting the slave trade between the states not be satisfied with abolishing slavery it the capital and in the territories no they witl rend it ft ora the constitution they will tread it out ol the land and write tht words freedom and liberty making a cross therewith in great broad letters horn tht bay of fundv to the gulf of california and backwards from ape sable to the lake of the woods and they will not be satisfied until they have done that a voice never j never io let ns ail say icei f ap plausej men uit work in very different ways do not expect all men to work in tny wav i should be sorry il they tried no one manis so wise as millions of men the freesoil party has done much already they may not come up to the standard of my friends here behind me rut they have done much already and i thank god and ihtmk them for what they have done one at least they have done they have set afire in the rear of our doughface representatives that we send to congress applause still there is much to do now is not the tune to relax oui energies now rather is the time to push and bj active tor the first time since tinadoption of the federal constitution the slave power has trembled lias recoiled has been defeated and ha turned back the president of the united states ha asked us to come together today and this think is the first time that an antislavery meeting was ever called by proclamation ol the executive laughter will not be so unjust to the intellect of the cabinet ot general taylor or of that gentleman himself as to suppose that lie really partakes ol the motives w hich seem to animate the proclamation have lug tier respect lor the intellect of those men than to believe ijiat they share the superstition so apparent in their proclamation and so apparent in the proclamation ol our own governor ret in old times on a fast day there vre two things to he done one thing was to repent wo are told that the cholera has come as a judgment lor national sins the national sin is slavery the national sin iros the mexican war hut that is ended slavery then is the national bin to be repented of rut the proclamations invite us to ask the almighty to withdraw his hand they do not ask us to repent of our sin et that is the put pose of a fast such as the lord loveth such as our friend the chairman read out of that grand significant md testament well then repentance is the firsi duty here let us all repent us of slavery let us repent us of our coldness in this ami slavery enterprise lei us repent us ol cowardice in having sent cowardly men u represent us where cowards should not go applause rut the next object of a day ol fasting was after ihe lepentance the resolution and the vow here than let us make tin vow to oppose by

its triumph was the first time that the heart and thought of the common people had been markedly arid peaceably felt tn that government their hand weie felt at naaeby in you heard their hearts heat our friend parker said with a great deal of until that the antislavery sentiment of great britain was often exaggerated that some seemed to suppose very erroneously that it embraced all daaaea in great britain he was undoubtedly right the nobility the highchurch conservatives proslavery party in the house of lords and the house of commons were activepowerful overwhelming doubt whether they had not to the last it not a majority at least a very large rninonlv of the english people upon their side it was at lat the earnest god fearing men treading down the craven afraid or ashamedin the ituh century to act out the opinions he was not ashamed to hold certainly he was correct tto in saying that the antislavery enterprise was different in e gland from what it is here still tny opinion ia that taking all things into eon sderation emancipation though a different work was not in any gieat degree an eaier one there than it may be here they had some aid we want hut again they lacked manv advantages we possess certainly there was great truth in his remark that if you now stir in england iho rights of her lower classes you are met as fiercely as we are hereon this slave question he might even have gone further and have said that many of those who had borne the burden and heal ot the antislavery da would be among your j sternest opponents there vs a truth enough to make it a libel in byrons petulant cry when p eadtng vainly for the weavers o that my clients were black then theyd get a heating if recollect right our friend thought that the english people wouid not have so soon aboished slavery if the slave had been in their island i have no doubt liiai it la true if the slave had resided in london if the slave nad been m the county of kent the enterprise would have been moreexacily like i ours still if the slave at a distance is some advantge it has its disadvantages also they had their latimer but no william and ellen crafts no bx brown this irresistible appeal to that sentiment which mr barker made the first wave ol the agitation was trom the nature of the case impossible or neatly so again the situation of their slave population was such that they nad no douglass and could hardly have had one besides evd the slave himself wasm the west indies the slaveholder was in the house of l iras the slaveholder was in the house of commons hen the abolitionists argued ihe question they argued n with slaveholders for their direct personal opponent much of the wealth of england was pledged to that side the plantations of the west indies were owned in the house of lords and that of the commons some of these ownersto the honor of england be it spoken stood by the abolitionists though they were not abolitionists in our sense ol i the word and not think in any proper sense for they did not lree their slaves tne illustrious head of the house of fox was possessed at the commencement of the emancipation movements of westindia property and yet stood side by side with the antislavery lords and was actively engaged with the antislavery committee in behalf of their enterprise true english s avery was abolished in spite ot the west indians still the law which abolished u passed through two houses which like our own contained i many slaveholders it is common to say tho antislavery suo cess of great britain was easier earned than we cnt expect to have it here because parlia merit had sovereign power over the colonies i as if the parliament of great britain was not at that time itself as proslavery abody as our congress the north is to abolish southern slavery by the same means at the same odds lias over the subject gene i rally the same power as the freedomloving dissenters and churchmen of great britain had over the islands to be sure the north lias not the same technical legal powers but law lorms are only parchment hearts thoughts dollars truth rule the world give the american people give the north the wish and any unptincipled democrat or w lug perhaps the adjective is superfluous j will find tlie way great as was the political and official influence brought to bear against the movement u is cheering to observe the maiked contrast between the conduct of british siaiesmen and that of urn hale men here who claim that title from down to no man there blessed with a name which has any t claim to live dated to go down to his

were only to read the list of the tenants of westminster there is no time here to analyze the reason why lit did not at once succeed the lact is i believe as i state it there is one great and i confess most j important support to the slave system in una country which was wanting in england social prejudice against color this is tobe sure a most important item to show that mr parkers estimate is in a degree correct south carolina is in one sense as dependant on massacuhsetts as jamaica upon england lhai important slate wastes to be s ie agreat deal of veiy excellent indignation on this subject still while she can say her little speeches and move her little motions it is northern inind that rules this land northern enterprise has subdued its millions ol acres it is northern reputation that gives weight to our public acta it is northern trade northern commerce fills our lieasury it is the not them voice that is to pronounce the end of slavery but does not me veiy prejudice which heat oiee astonishes and surmounts give some additional weight and effect to the eloquence ol dotigiass it is one of a despised race whom they were hardly willing io reckon men that

which england tried for us the expeument f freedom i do not know but the larger part of my audience are acquanted with the circumstances of west india emancipation hut do not believe that you have all reflected upon the complete proof which that experiment affords of the safety and duty of immediate emancipation reflected that the experiment never can be tried again in u h unfavorable circumstances as it was tried then men say it is not wise to free the slaves immediately men say it is not safe to free he slaves immediately men wav that a great political revolution like that must take half a century for its accomplishment that it cannot be done in a single year or a single generation now the slaves in the west indies were about m number there were about whites in those islauds there were nearly ten blacks to one white in some of the m in one small island there wefe ihree hundred blacks to two white men in jamaica there were ten blacks to one white man those islands were miles irom the civilization and order and government of europe if the black man had risen in i his strength if he had remembered for one moment the century ol oppression which be had suffered if he had wished to revenge i the wioiigs to which he had been subjected long belore the tale could have been told in europe the white race might have been trodden down under the very feet of the people of the west indies without a wpapon i they might have been trodden down by the masses of emancipated men walking to the sea shore and treading the puny pale face beneath their feet this experiment of justice was to be tried j now with a w holly uneducated race ten timer outnumbering their white oppressors ii is and thousand of miles off from the very i possibility of hope or help the first ui august came the slave fretted with tbt long delay deceived again and again by promises of emancipation which had not been tulfilled by the trckeiy of the masters who had once and again deleaied the honest intentions of the british governmentslowly saw this eventful sun about to rise the be iiever injustice the believer in the safely of obedience to guds government mighi well be allowed to tremble for a moment though ever so sanguine at such an hour to the honor of the colored race to the hopt of humanity to the joy and gratitude of every believer in a just ruler of me universe weare able to look back upon that eventful scene in the history of the race and recollect that ii was not sullied by one smgie act of ven i geance by one single expression of unkindness by one single drop ot bloodshed when slaves whom white malice and ingenuity and lust had done their utmost to imbrute were made men in a day here and j there was a regiment of british troops it is true but what were they to the proud force of men in the first movement of liberty look at st domingo how long did the veterans of napoleon how long did the i choicest tioops of ihe english government stand before naked unarmed hay tiens when they were told at midnight in the french cummissioners alfiight and dismay that they were freemen and might defend how many of the english tioops ever set foot again on the english strand the same thing would have been repeated if the slave had but dreamed for a moment of vengeance upon the first of august say nevermore can the experiment be so liried never again can such a conjunction of circumstances take place when man can even plausibly distiust so much the policy of giving immediate freedom to masses of slaves god seems to have given to us a nation our i beloved mother country willing to believe that justice was expediency he seems to have placed in its hands the problem in the ugliest of aliapes and most dangerous of ciicuinstances and then to have blessed it toa most successfclul issue the antislavery cause is deeply the debtor ot this day for the pioudestand noblest lesson humanity has ever learned faith both in the white race and m the colored j it is a sad commentary upon such an event i to look at the spoil will which it has been i criticised almost eveiy book which has been written referring to the subject labors most as to the number of pounds of sugar or hogsheads of rice or puncheons of ruin the quantities of this thing or that tiling that are exported the west india experiment was it succisaful ask the american clergy and people throughout oh yes and why because the exports did not fail the slave f w oiked on the second day of august hei went out to the plantation and made as many sugai cane holes as ever there is as much sugar in the liverpool market from those islands as before they were treed as if there was nothing but sugar in gods world as if man was made to work and for nothing but work as if the american people were to testa great moral event by hogsheads of sugar and puncheon of rumi do not care whether the slave worked oi out ido not care whether ihe slave made one ounce of sugar or one pint of rum it j would not gneve me much to learn that hei lay lazily under the graceful palm of his native land i do not care much to know what he did there is nothing worse than j slavery if he did not cut his master sj throat if there is a white man living in ja inaica today the experiment was successful tnere is nothing but anarchy that is worse than slavery tell rne that anarchy does not exist in the british west indies and you tell i me that the experiment has succeeded some say that hayti is a prof that eman  cipatmn will not do for the slave llayti has been alluded to often it is a monaichy they say grant it so it is it may be a despotism what then what is despotism lit is the baby step of civilization despotism is the first ground that man touches in hi ascent from anarchy to liberty monarchy is the second step well the haytiaus have reached monatchy and that is two steps from slavery which is nothing at all noih uig at all to the moral man i othing but tm brinn g the irtelleciual nature of man this is looked upon as a great effort in the british people i njoubtedly it was but m this country strong as it is nothing i compared with the energy of the american j jieople nothing at all twelve hundred millions of dollars i know are lending to slavery their influence i know that the poii j ics of the country are mortgaged to the slave system i know lhat the northern church infected to th c

oclock when addreses were made by the following gentlemen rev charles avery and passavant messrs j b yashon m r delany james jones and several others after the delivery of the addresses the meeting adjourned until the evening when the grove was very prettily and tastefully illuminated by lights being placed among the trees the addresses of the rev messrs avery and passavant were exceedingly eloquent and altogether the day passed off very har moniously the north star rochester august the labors of the past week we were absent from our post most of last week attending antislavery meetings and fairs which were held at macedon farming tun and palmyra of the meeting and fair at macedon oui readers have alieady been inj foimed on tuesday the th instant we held a meeting in the orthodox friends meeting house at farmington which wasi attended by a large audience faimington has long enjoyed the reputation of being an antislavery town but with what propriety itis difficult to determine there is evidently very little active antislavery there of any kind at this time there seems to be a general falling off of effoit on the part of those who formerly acted in favor of the abolition cause we attribute this change to the impatience and want of faith which too often display themselves in the movements of enthusiastic reformers instead of waiting for the slow but sure and certain results of the foolishness of preaching they have sought after what they conceive to be more efficient instru mentalitieshave been disappointed and disheartened and at length have become apathetic and indifferent starting with wm l garrison on the broad platform ot the ante riern antislavery society they with few exceptions have deserted and have united with the liberty party and that party being swallowed up by the free soil party they have now no distinct plan of operation against slavery but appear to be waiting for some other and more feasible mode of acting out their anti slaveiv principles as an evidence of the proslavery influence of the place we may mention the fact that the large meetinghouse of the hicksite quakers is closed against antislavery and all other reformatory meetings it is hereafter to be exclusively devoted to religious purposes this house was applied for a few weeks since by joseph dugdale a man of spotless purity of character and of deep devotion to the cause of freedom and not only was a refusal given to this application but one of the professed followers of elias hicks went so far as to nail up the doors and windows when will men learn that mercy is above sacrifice that true christianity is not to be advanced by the shutting up meeting houses against reform and turning a deaf ear to the cries of gods poor on monday evening we had the privilege of addressing a large audience in the baptist church of palmyra on tuesday the ladies of the w estern new york antislavery society held an antislavery fair in that place by which they realized the sura of a larger sum might have been received but for the limited character of the notice a series of antialavery meetings and fairs in connection with the western new york antislavery society are to be held during the autumnwhich we have no doubt will be found highly beneficial in awakening and keeping alive an interest in the cause of the slave f d the national league e suggested a few weeks since the idea of an organization under this title which weare happy to find has been well received j among our people so far as they have been heard from and we are encouraged in the hope that some efficient steps will be taken to carry this idea into effect it is certainly high lime that the oppressed colored people of the lmted states should awake to the impoi tance of presenting a united front to this nation w e have too long allowed ourselves to remain obscure separated and scattered w e are not seen by the world nor bj the american people scarcely contending against oppress on for our own rights and for our elevation we present no tangible form of opposition to siavery and are known only to the world as a divided and apathetic people submitting without effort to wrongs which if endured by others wonld nerve them to the adoption of almost any means for heir redress it is quite true that we have occasionally j held colored national conventions passed resolutions trained addresses and published our proceedings to the world and it is also true that these conventions have been of great service a directing public attention to our wrongs and in awakening an interest in our improvement and elevation but even these conventions have been lttle better than failures for want of previous organization io the various localities of the delegates hat we now want and what we niutt hare is a national union baaed upon broad and well defined prmciplao which shall unite the free people of color throughout this country in an undivided effort to promote their own cause it w a shame to us that while men are struggling for freedom throughout the world even with carnal weapons we are comparatively indifferent spectators of our own degradation and oppression and do not even put forth a united moral effort in the cause of our own freedom too often forgetting that selfahttaemcm pave the way to villain hoods and despotic way we call upon our brethren to commence at once to organize branches in their various localities with a view to the formation of the national league if but five persons in a town village or district can be found in favor of a union we would have them imme diateiy band together atid give notice of the fact through the columns of the north star f d father mathew the invitation extended to this gentleman to attend the celebration of west india emancipation an event grateful to every true british heart as well as to the heart of every j lover of mankind has called forth a flood of the most malignant and bitter denunciation against win l garrison and the gentlemen who acted with him in presenting it father mathew must if he has not lost all power of discernment see that he has thrown himself into the arms of a hass ot men who are as hostile to the cause of human freedom as the most inveterate despots on earth his reasons lor declining to attend that celebration were bad but the spirit which characterizes his defenders is incomparably worse among the last whom we expected to see arrayed in his defence are george bradburn and the editor of the chronotype for although we know them to be most violent and biller haters of w l garrison we yet supposed that their clear perception of truth and duty and their great admiration of straightforwardness and independence would have lifted them above the paltry position they now occupy both messrs bxadburn and wright well understand that the celebration of west india emancipation in massachusetts is not a party demonstration and no men know belter than they that the entertainment of disunion views is not made a sine qua non toa welcome to the platform on such occasions j yet ihey adduce the revere of all they know on this point in defence of father mathews refusal to attend the celebration in question straws show which way the wind blows a chip may tell the direction of the tide mr bradburn who lectured us sometime since on the ground that we declined to discuss atheological question in our columns because the paper is especially devoted to the antislavery cause would now defend father mathew from rebuke on account of his being especially devoted to the cause of temperance times have changed mr bradburn has changed with them suppose daniel oconnell had lived to tread our soil and to speak to the people of thjp country in favor of j repeal and had owned himself opposed to committing himself on the subject of slavery would george bradburn and mr wright have defended him with the contemptible excuse that he came here especially to promote repeal j udging from their present j course we have reason to believe they would so have stultified themselves the following extract from a speech deli j vered by mr bradburn in faneuil hall seven years since on the presentation of the antislavery addiess signed by father mathew daniel oconnell and otheis will show the high point of detestation of slavery from which he has fallen f d slavery strikes at the interest of every laboring man i want the irishmen to know this i wish father mathew or daniel oconnell were hereto give this fact fit utterance let me tell you daniel j oconnell said in a speech w hich i heard him make last yearone of the most noblehearted men that god ever created for he makes moral conduct not color the test among men he had long desired to visit america but he would never do so as long as its soil was i polluted by the footpiints of a single slave the american republican he regarded as the vilest of hypocrites and the greatest of liars such is his abhorrence ol slayery that he will not shake hands with american slaveholders with what scornful j intonation does he pronounce the very word j he considers them as they are the basest among the base again does he send his j voice thundering against the westerly breeze j pointing to the address and it rings through our meeting tonight he asks you to join me abolitionists to destroy this accursed sys tem failing him out mt ward in a letter addressed to the rev henry highland garnet calls upon that gentleman to state whether he holds the views we attributed to him in our remarks upon hi mission to england or not we shall be as happy as mr ward to have mr garnets affirmation or denal of any pari of the article in question we aim at all times j to give a fair and candid statement of the views of an opponent and if we have misstated him ihe columns of the north star are open to him the impeachment of mr garnets motive was derived legitimately from well defined premises and the latter must be overthrown before he can escape the charge of hollowness and hypocrisy f d henry highland garnet is about to visit great bntain where be is to be employfia in lecturing to promote abstinence from ted production of slave laybor mr gametthe one of the few colored men of this country who lias been fortunate enough to acquire a classical education he posesse a vigorous mini and i an able and energetic speaker but heis filled wuh the spirit of violence and is withal an incorrigible priest he has done every thing in his power to injure the reputation and destroy the influence of frederick douglas by echoing the charge oflnfidelity brought against him by a proslavery church many of the colored people unfortunatelyare bitter sectanans and mr garnet has done hi worst to array this class in hostility to the eloquent fugitive that he will misrepresent and malign douglas in great bntain we have no doubt and therefore we anticipate that he will do vastly more harm than good s but a slave

out the inconsistencies of mr garnet although we defercntitllv accepted one of our friends corrections substituting either by precept or by example for either by precept or example we by no means regard jus criticisms as just perhaps we evince an uncaled for sensitiveness in noticing at all what mr bradburn miv say of our grammar for we believe he plays the schoolmaster to the whole nation he asks in last weeks paper what is the reason that so few of our american officials can write like lord elgn or can write english at all liis vanity on this point reminds us of a story he used to tell

commencement lest we should be almost immediately compelled to announce their discontinuance why will not our brethren unite in supporting one or two papers which shall be a credit to them instead of squandering their mosey and misapplying their energy on a multitude of papers which can never be supported and the failure of which serves only to abase us in the popular estimation t f d he executive committee of the western antislavery society ha issued a very urgent and eloquent call for a grand convention of the young men and women of ohio it is truly heartcheering to observe the spirit and perseverance with which these western abolitionists apply themselves to the work of emancipation convention after convention is held in most rapid succession and the whole face of the antislavery movement in ohio wears the most lively aspect the convention now recommended to meet at berlin mahoning county on the st dand d of september next will doubtless bea brilliant and powerful

although not disheartened we feel greatly the need of fellow workers in this j part of the antislavery vineyard f d we observe with pleasure that the disgraceful and dastardly treatment which we received in company with two english friends at the hands of captain frederick stone onboard the alida some months since is widely exposed and suitably commented upon by a most respectable part of the british press our skindeep aristocracy whose only sense of its superiority is found in it ability to insult colored persons wuh impunity receives a well merited rebuke from the tranaatlantic press the description of this brutish outrage found in another column copied from the birmingham mercury i in every respect true out upon the miserable pretence of the american people to liberality and

this place replied to mr l defending the motives and to some extent the measures of the abolitionists though disapproving the particular act that gave birth to the articles above mentioned vjz mr garrisons mission to invite father mathew to attend the antislavery festival at worcester this brought out the i a in a long explanation withdrawing his censure of motives and only censuring the measures of messrs garrison and douglass he says that wm lloyd garrison and frederick douglass are the greatest enemies to abolition and the greatest friends to the continuance of slavery in america of all i living men one threatens the dissolution of the union fot this he should be attainted as a traitor frederick douglass threatens a slave insmreclion together with an invasion of all the colored races of the west indian and south american islands to tear up and destroy everything american and slay without remorse every white man the writer of this heard him more than once broach this doctrine we would like the irish american to point out one recorded speech of f ds containing an avowal of such doctrine we confess we have never heard nor read such threats coming from him and hardly think that it can be produced it is very convenient to assert now for the proof mr ls recommendation that mr garrison be attainted as a tiaitor besides being unconstitutional and antiiepublican comes with an ill grace from him being himself an exile for advocating a dissolution of the british union great biitain and ireland and speaking ashe does in the most eulogistic terms of obrien mitchell meagher and others who are attainted as traitors and doomed exiles for threatening the british united kingdom with insurrection and an invasion of all the race of sympathizers it is a fact that a parchment union exists i between england and ireland it is also ai fact that a written compact exists between the north and the south and it is equally a fact in morals that tbe support of good mento such unions depends upon wheiher they promote civil social and rekgiuua liberty and secure individual and conventional rights it was ard is the opinion of messrs obrien mitchell meagher and compatriots that the union of england with their native country was and is fraught with evil that it enables the few whom they rightfully denounce as j traitors to their country to trample upon andi tyrannize over the many for which they re j ceive the title of good loyal subjects to their i rightful soveieign they believe that the union is abominable and intolerable and that the people have a right to dissolve it by any ineaus providence has permuted them to have control of and if failing it shall not be lor want of their support to the death if necessary as a sacred duty to their country to their countrymen and to their god how noble what exalted patriotism even he who holds that no reform is worth the spilling of one drop of human blood for must feel m the inmost recesses of his heart an admiration for that devotion with which they offer up themselves upon the altar of their countrys hcerty for my part i love to dwell upon their memories whilst they yet live and believe that they will be honored for their heroism as long as there is a heart to leel a head to dictate a hand to write an eye to see ori ail ear to hear the english language whatever may lie the views of its possessor in relation to mural or physical suasion who believes them to be fanatics who that they i are enemies to or obstacles in tbs way of their coentry enfranchisement the nobler heart give the lie to the baser tongue of the loyalist who uttera it where ia the irishman who dares say that they should be attainted as traitors they might troly say to suchno we are not traitors but in our ardent lote to our country we proclaim him one messrs garrison douglas and compatriots believe that the unhallowed and iniquitous union entered into between the north and south is fraught with evil that it enables the few slaveholders to traro t pis upon and tyrannize over the many non slaveholders and slaves they want no other weapons than truth the coals of which they scatur broadcast over the na lions heart together with the influeuce and testimony of good humane men such as they believed father mathew to be who hate slavery as well as other evils and are wil ling at all times to give their voices and influence against it regardless of indignant frowns or any amount of odium that may be cast upon themmen who would rather be right than popular consistent than comfortable they also believe that this union is abominable and intolerable and by hypothesis that if the revolutionary fathers of this country were right in throwing off by physical force an oppression which when compared with american slavery one hours endurance of the latter is more than ages of the former then ate the slaves and all sympathizers without respect to color or division of race justified in using the same means all others failing to remove slavery these are parallel cases they have points j parallel and equidistant are situated in the same plane run parallel equidistant and therefore must be equal can you approve the one and condemn the other can you adjudge mr obrien and compatriots as worthy of all praise for advocating the dissolution of oppressive ties and condemn mr garrison and compatriots for the same thing can these be fanatics and those escape can one party be enemies to what they profess to desire without subjecting the other io the same charge the mercenary timeserving truculent scribbling suppliant must be aware of its falseness whilst he pens it the memory of the fearless champions of universal freedom whose exalted patriotism impels them to be loyal to right to humanity

in regard to the particular of the boston abolitionisis i differ alike from the editoi of the i a and his correspondent from the previous writings of father mai thew they had a right to invite and to expect j him to be present at their gathering and repeat his testimony against slavery they j had no right to presume that one bearing such a reputation as a reformer and a christian would he deterred either by indignant frowns or any amount of odium that he might have been subjected to from advocating anything that his convictions urged him to subscribe to and bate his breath and cringe his knee

speak the truth and what care we for hissing and for seem whilst some faint gleaming we can see of freedoms coining morn let liars fear let cowards shrink let iraitors turn away whatever we have dared to think that dare wc also say mr lynch while condemning mr ocon j nell for bringing the antislavery question into repeal associations admits his right to have gone on the antislavery platfoim or to have called meetings for that special object if j mr o had such rights why not father mathew did the abolitioniets ask father mathew to introduce the subject of slavery in a repeal temperance or any other thanan antislavery meeting they simply invited him to attend and partake of their hospitality and thns throw the weight of his in fluence against slavery was this asking too much of the man who called upon his brethren jin this country to identify themselves with the j abolitionists was this entrapping or at tempting to inveigle him into snares i love i the temperance cause as much as mr lynch and others who seem so solicitous about the singleness of father mathews mission but i love to see it advocated by men who are so convinced of its beneficence that they cannot be frightened by the frowns of lumsellers or seduced by the smiles of rumdrinkers into silence or indifference in reply to pluleleutherus would remark that it is not enough that father mathew breakfasted f douglass in ireland took him by the hand in brooklyn or received a deputation of colored gentlemen at the irving house any slaveholder on a like mission might do the same without impairing his standing with mr calhoun co i well remember how kindly i have been received and taken upon the knee and by the hand and breakfasted by slaveholders when a boy at the south this although an evidence of the absence of prejudice against color was not more effective testimony against slavery than the roost labored denunciation such as mr garrison would approve suppose that father mathew has no more prejudice against a black coat or black boots than slaveholders have against the same or white slaves it is worthy of remaik that mr l is opposed to inconsistencies yours for liberty and reform j c h joseph barkfr most

of the duty of doubling our diligence ana applying more closely our energy to the means i of advancing this holy causewe appeal the mote boldly to our friends because those for j whom we plead cannot

determined there are moments in the experience of every soul in which the whole past seems to be presented at a glance when all the events of life its loves and hatea hopes and fears joys and sorrows sins of thought and deed daguerreotyped upon its inmost circle by the unerring light of conscience are passed segment after segment before the startled soul in colois too distinct to be msitaken after long years of case and self delusion this hour had come to dame dudley and she could not escape its power as she gazed upon that picture it seemed slowly to vanish or rather slide aside and give place to a series which awoke in her strange feelings of terror and remorse one face one figure occupied the foreground to them all that of her only on there he lay in his cradle and her hard withered bosom trembled at the memory of that proud hour when they told her that she was the mother of a noble boy another slide and she gazed upon him at his studies his dark thoughtful eve bent eagerly upon the pages of his book then the book was flung aside with a smile of triumph and she almost seemed to hear again his clear glad voice echoing through the rumbling passages ot the old mansion ashe played with his sister isabel then he stood before her in the flush of early manhood a graduate of eng lands oldest university and wearing the splendid uniform ot an officer in the service of george long did the old dame contemplate this scene long did she gaze upon her noble and accomplished child and darker and darker gathered the frown on her brow as she thought of the failure of all her proud hopes and bitterer than ever were the curses that her shrivelled lips muttered against that impious and rebellious spuit ol liberty that infaiuated even the heirot her house and brought as she deemed it shame and disgrace upon their name and lineage slowiy she dropped the miniature upon her lap and covered her face with her hands fain would she have closed her eyes against the scenes which she felt must follow but the spell was upon her again memory drew the slide and conscience with stern finger pointed to the figures of a young man and lovely maiden the british uniform had given place to the continental blue and buffi but the face was still the same save that the ixpression was puithed and intensified by the influence of the highest and the holiest sentiment that ran move the heart of man love in its widest and best significance as the young officer drew tue fair girl to him ai d gazed earnestly for a moment into her dewy eyes the shade of anxiety that had dimmed her features vanished and both young faces glowed with the bright hopes and still brighter dreams uf the future it was a beautiful picture that such a one as ever fills the heart of youth with sweet prophecies and that af age with sweet regrets the dame cast ono glance and turned angrily away traitor and trull a fitting match would to heaven he had died in his crudle she muttered sternly woman whispered a still small

become exasperated to fury by his firm dignified but always respectful bearing then a scene of unmitigated infamy in which that young girl was seized gagged and consigned to the keepiog of a british officer who had long marked her as tne prey of his licentious passions ah but too well did she know at whose suggestion the devilish plot had been contrived instinctively she cowered m her chair and

he listened to the eager remarks of a gentleman near him a few paces distant supported in the arms of one whom she well recognised as the dearest friend of his boyhood lay the dead body of her son

same moment came again that clear distinct whisper thou shalt do no murder a few hours later that ancient mansion was a scene of terror and confusion groups of tenified servants and neighbors crowded the room and repeated to each other in low whispers the strange terms of the learned physicians as they talked of apoplexy and its cause for dame rachel dudley had looked her last upon the scenes of earth crossing the isthmus i laid back under the palm leaves looking out of the stern of the canoe on the forests of the chagres river there is nothing in the world comparable to these forests no

between walls of foliage that rise from its very surface all the gorgeous growths of an eternal summer are so mingled in one impenetrable mass that the eve is bewildered from the rank jungle of canes and gigantic lilies and the thickets of strange shrubs that line the water rise the trnnks of the mango the ceiba the cocoa the sycamore and the superb pahn plantains take root in the banks hiding the soil with their leaves shaken and split into immense plumes by the wind and rain ttie zapote with a fruit the sized of a mans head the gourd tree and other vegetable wondeis attract the eye on all sides blossoms of crimson purple and yellow of a form and magnitude unknown in the north are mingled with the i aves and docks of paroquets and brilliant butterflies circle thruugh the air like blossoms blown away sometimes a spike of scarlet flowers is thrust forth like the tongue of a serpent from the heart of some convolution of unfolding leaves and sometimes the creepers and parasites drop trails and streamers of fragrance from boughs that shoot halfway across the river every turn of the stream only disclosed another and more magnificent vista of leaf bough and blossom all outline of the landscape is lost under this deluge of vegetation no trace of the siil is to be seen lowland and highland are the same a mountain is but a higher swell of the mass of verdure as on the ocean
