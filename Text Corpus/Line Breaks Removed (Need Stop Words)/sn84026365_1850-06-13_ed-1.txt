from the massachusetts spy politics and the pulpit rev henry ward beecher has been recently engaged in a controversy with the journal of commerce concerning the propriety of introducing the topic of slavery into the pulpit that paper has lately had its sensibilities wounded by an allusion made by dr lansing to daniel websters position and by mr beechers article in the independent the journal has therefore conceived agreat horror for free soil sermons although it seems to have no objection to a clergymans writing a political pamphlet in defence of slavery as aided and comforted by webster in the last number of the independent mr beecher publishes a stirring article justifying the introduction of the topic ol slavery as a moral question into the pulpit and also urging it as a duty he says in a strain of indiguation three million men against natural law against every fundamental principle of our state and national government are by law thrown over lire pale of the race and dentil et err mm this is not fitfor the pulpit to mention it is allowed nevertheless to preach about china and india every year thousands of children are snatched from the parents bosom and remorselessly sold everywhither the pulpitis not the place for mentioning such things though it be allowed to snatch children from the ganges and to mourn over infanticide in polynesia every year husbands and wives are torn asunder christian or no christian and the journal of commerce browbeats that pulpit that utters a word about such politics when it should rather be busy in expostulating with eannibals in malaya or snatching devotees from under the wheels of juggernaut every year thousands of women are lashed for obstinate virtue and tens of thousands robbed of what they never have been taught to prize and the journal of commerce stands poised to cast its javelin at that meddlesome pulpit that dares specie of such boundless licentiousness and send it to its more appropriate work of evangelizing the courtesans of paris or tbe loose virtue of italy and it assures us that multitudes are thanking it for such a noble stand some of those clergymen we know the platforms of our benevolent societies resound with their voices urging christianity to go abroad stimulating the church not to leave a corner of the globe unsearched nor an evil unredressed but when the speech is ended the steel is behind the journal of commerce to give it thanks for its noble stand against the right of the pulpit to say a word about homeheathen about their horrible ignorance bottomless licentiousness and about the mercenary inhumanity which is every week selling their own christian brethren baptised as much as they often preachers of the gospellike themselves praying to the same savior listening to snatches of that same bible whose letters they have never been permitted to learn out of which these reverend endorsers of the journal of commerce preach it requires distance it seems to make a topic right for the pulpit send it to greenland or to nootka sound and you may then practice at the far away target and the reason of such discrimination seeins to be that preaching against foreign sin does not hurt the feelings nor disturb the quiet of your congregation whereas if the identical evils at home which we deplore upon the indus or along the burampootra are preached about the journal says that it will risk tne ministers place and bread and butter and it plainly tells all northern ministers that tf they meddle with such politics the wilt have their coats rolled in the dirt and the experience which we have had of that operation at the bands of tbe journal assures us that the process is full dirty enough will tbe journal tell us how many leagues off a sin must be before it ia prudent and safe for courageous ministers to preach against it our laws scarcely recognise a crime against man save murder and violence gain to it that is not legal under sieve vol no laws there is not a sensual vict which we are taught to abhor whicl slavery does not monstrously engender there is not a sin which religion condemns that is not garnered andsown reaped and sown again by americar slavery among freemen the road o honor lies away from animal passion fiom sensation towards conscience hope love and spiritual faith bu slavery sharply turns the wretch downward and teaches and compels him tt aibuive the task of life from such motives as are common to him with the ox the ass and tbe dog the slavet pleasures are our appetites his motives are almost of necessity those from which religion most earnestly dehorts us to our chldren labor it honorable because it is gods ordination of mercy because it is an education because it is the road alike to health and temperate pleasure because it is the parent of wealth because by it the cheerful laborer builds bis house rears his children and gives them the means of knowledge by labor the north has subdued nature chunged a parsimonious soil to fertility built dwellings for almost her whole population raised the schoolhouse established the church encircled the globe with her bhips and made her books and papers to be as blades of grass and leaves of sumtger for number but in the south as if unredeemed from the primal curse labor a badge of shame is the father of misery the slave labors with no cheer it is no the road to respectability it will honor him with no citizens trust it brings no bread to his family no grain to his garner no leisure in after days no books nor papers to his children it opens no schoolhouse door builds no church rears for him no factory iays no keel fills no bank earns no acres with sweat and toil and ignorance he consumes his life to pour the earnings into channels from which he does not drink into hands that never honor him but perpetually rob and often torment this vast abomination which see hes and smokes in our midst which is en nervating and demoralizing the w tite by the oppression of the black in which adultery fornication and a concubinage so awful exist that in comparison to it a turkish harem is a cradle of virgin purity which every hour does violence to nature to the sentiment of justice and to the embodiment of that sentiment into national law a system which makes n home impossible and the word family as mucha misnomer as it would be to a stable or sheepfold which subsists only by keeping the subject ignorant which is obliged to rank and treat the qualities which our community most esteems independance ambition selfreliance thirst for knowledge selfrespectas most punishable crimes in the slave a system whose practice requires what its laws recognize that manhood must be subvertedfethat the slave must be intelligent only for work and religious only to the extent of obedience a system which taking away all inducements to labor natural to man is obliged to by suffering or the fear of suffering which denying to the faculties of a natural expression forces the miserable wretch to cunning and craft to lying and subterfuge whose whole natural tendency is i to produce labor upon compulsion and laziness by choice lying and thieving under a sense of justice and truth and honesty with a feeling of their injustice and which at length m its worst and most damnable result so subferts that instinct of liberty which belongs toman the world over that the slave agrees to his condition grows fat and laughs and sings preferring slavery with indulgence to eat and drink i enough to liberty if he must pay the price of that liberty by sustained exertion this huge infernal system for the destruction of meir soul and body j must not be mentioned in the pulpit i lest the sabbath be desecrated and the peace of the congregation be dis turbed we shouid be glad accoruing tohe patent method of the journal to teach men how to act upon christian principles in their political position without saying a word about the subject we should heartily rejoice if we could in i spire christian honesty in commerce without ever discussing mens coinmer cial duties the journal evidently knows how this may be done will it not bless the world with the secret it has in mind doubtless some gospel that will tree men from evil and not disturb them that will snatch away their sins while they are aslep some i chloroform gospel some gospel that will convert the african slavetrader without saying a word about the slave trade that will send bruin and hill to the altar and the communion table without saying a word about the slave pens and their weekly purchase and tale of christian girls and church members that will convert the thief and by some charm lead him to abhor stealing without saying a word about theft j bat will make men intelligent in all their relations to their fellows without saying anything of their duties that will turn the heathen from idolatry from fornication and incest from infanticide and cannibalism and the whole retinue of abominations which we name heathenism without one word said except about the literal christ crucified which the journal says must be preached whether men will hear or lorbear it must be preached in its puniv and power whoever may be offended it is not mans message but right of is no sex truth is of no color gods and must be delivered faithfully the sabbath is eminently the day am the pulpit the place for this solemn acl it must be a gospel of doctrine o abstract truth but by no means a gh pel to disturb him from practical sins and we almost believe lowell to hav stolen his doggerel from the journal im wilting a man should go tollable strong agin wrong in tbe nbatrnet for that kind o rooj i always unpopular and never get pitied because its a crime one ever committed if the excellent editor of the journa of commerce were doomed to be member of our congregation we doni know how we could reconcile our sense of duty with his notions of the gospel unless he would conserxto take his hai and slip out while w were discussing his real sins and comt back in time to hear our opinion ol total depravity and the doctrine ol original sin the pulpit is the dispensatory ol societythe minister a physician preaching a prescription of medicinal truth for heart evils there is not an evil which afflicts life nor a temptation proceeding from any course of life which the pulpit should not study the sources of right conduct the hindrances the seductions of business the influences of public life the maxims ol society its customs its domestic commercial and public institutions inshort whatever directly or indirectly moulds the human character is to be studied by the minister and its benefit or its danger made known from the pulpit lu this work it is to deal first and most faithfully with the evils of its own age its own country its own city its own congregation wherever men go the pulpit is to follow them with its true light whatever invades its pro vincethat province is right humanity puritybe it fashion commerce politics they are tearlessly to be met grasped apd measured by the word ol goj not only may the pulpit thus explore life hut il must or else prove bankrupt to fidelity it is not to follow the camp but in spiritual things to lead the people it is not to wait till foes are slain before it raises its spear nor go asking of political cabals what it may say nor cringe to any supercilious men ol commerce but occupy itself with only this twin thought how best ta please god and benefit man therefore against every line of the cowards ethics of the journal of commerce we solemnly protest and declare a minister made to its pattern fitter to be sent to the pyramids and tombs of egypt to preach to oldworld mummies than to be a living man ol god among living men loving them but never fearing them god be thanked that in every age hitherto such pulpits have been found the ally of suffering virtue tbe champion of the oppressed and in this day after the notable examples of heroic inen in heroic ages when life itself often paid for fidelity the pulpit is to be mined and sapped by insincere friends and insidious enemies and learn to mix the sordid prudence of business with the sonorous and thrice heroic counsels of christ then o my soul be not thou found conspiring with this league ol iniquity that so when in that august day of retribution god shall deni punishment in flaming meusurc to all hireling and coward ministers thou shall not go down under doublebolted thunders lower than miscreant sodom or thricepolluted gomorrah the congress fugitive billmen resist oppression or seek to escape from it because they are men endowed with a sense of personal inalienable rights an inextinguishable love of liberty and the capacity to enr joy it that tbe victim of slavery should flee from its horrors is no new thing and that the fugitive should find sympathy among those not interested in perpetuating his enslavement can excite no surprise among those who understand the instincts and laws of human nature by the mosaic code this sympathy found a sanction for its manifestations in the law which protected the fugitive servant from being seized by his master and secured to him the protection and hospitalities of the community in which he had taken refuge the modern law of nations regarding slavery as a municipal a merely local institution does not bind one state to surrender fugitive slaves from other states at times conventions or treaties of extradition have been made between neighboring powers in disregard of the dictates of humanity in obedience to reasons ol state policy a friend has handed us the following translation of an article in a treaty of peace entered into in the year between leon alexandre v constantine greek emperor a constantinople and oleg regent of igor second king of russia on the occasion of the first invasion of the greek empire by tbe russians under oleg if a russian slave take flight or even ilhe is carried away by any one under pretence of having been bought his master shall have the right and power to pursue him and hunt for and capture him wherever he shall be found and any person who shall oppose the master in the execution of his right shall be deemed guilty ot violating this treaty and be punished ac cordingly on occasion of a second invasion ol the greek empire by tbe russians another treaty was formed in in which it was stipulated as follows if any slave shall fly from russia into greece or ehall escape from tbe rochester n y thursday june russian merchants residing iit constantinople the russia mg gir have the right to punfatjli nd tc hunt for and captur f hkt nd it h cannot be found the j oath that his slave la ir which case thegreelb abu pay the said master according to enter treaties two pieces of cloth forjmtry slave thus escaping into grejcq and if a greek slave escape intojßilsiajn the nothe fowd shall be the duty deliver up which he shall rave ere upon the master shall pay to the lerson so delivering up said slave two pieces ol gold by way of reward of course the execution of the duty thus imposed and tho munnef of executing it were left to the parties severally contracting there was no common tribunal for the adjudication of such cases it is remarkable that after the lapse of nearly nine centuries we fini a barbarous stipulation between two barbarous nations reproduced in the compact of union of the most civilized end humane republic of the nineteenth century we are familiar with the provision referred tono person held to labor or service in one state under the lays thereof escaping into another shall ia consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor my be due the language of this clause of the constitution like the phraseology of the articles above quoted is that of astipulation no power is conferred upon congress by the language of the clause expressly and we havs never been able to see how it could be fairly implied it bears the aspect of a stipulation between the states and i would seem as if it were left for the states severally to provide measures for carrying it into effect such if we recollect aright was the decision cf chief justice shaw of massachusetts some years ago and such was the opinion of many eminent jurists until the decision of the supreme court in the case of prigg that decision sat aside and denied the right of all state legislation on the subject asserted the exclusive power of congress to means lor executing tbe provision jbut asserted too the right of the garter to seize his slave wherever he imglifbf found and bear him back to the state whence he had escaped without process of law the free states finding fceir right to act on the subject denial by the highest tribunal of the country discontinued all such action some of them in view of the decision of tbc court that congress could impose no duty on state officers in relation to the matter passed laws forbidding their magistrates and officers ta issue or serve process in the case of escaping slaveslaws clearly in harmony with said decision nd not in conflict with the rights of slave claitnans some states too in consideration of the fact that as the court had asserted the right ot slave cl mantb t seize their slaves wherever found without legal process the liberties of portions of iher own free popult on might be put in peril by sinister or mistaken claim passed laws securing to persons claimed as slaves the right to have the question legally determined whether they were not free and no nglitmind ed man will pretend that buc laws were unconstitutional or violative of the rights of slave claimants that the barbarous russ should be permitted in the dark ages to hunt and seize by violence in the territory of a smibarbarous empire any one ol its inhabitants whom he might choose to claim as his fugitive slave do not surprise us but the masses have emerged from degradation since th tenth century personal rights are now deemed sacred and no guaranties against their violation are held to be too stringent the state that would deny to any person within its limns the writ of habeas corpus in order to test whether he was entitled to his freedom or not would be wanting in the first duty of a sovereigntythat of the just protection of those within its jurisdiction no free state has passed any laws to discharge from service or labor persons fugitive from other states where such service or labor may be doe but many of the free states have severe enactments for the prevention and punishment of kidnapping the man then who seizes in one of these states a person whom he claimed as his fugitive slave does it at his peril if the person seized be a fugitive from service or labor within the meaning of the constitution he is secure against punishment but should it turn out that he has seized a free person the law visits him with its penalty it may be said that this makes it perilous for the owners offugitives to assert their just rights be it so astate is derelict of duty which does not protect its inhabitants against danger to their liberties even a slaveholder must admit that it is more important to protect the liberty of the free than to perpetuate the slavery of the bondman the laws of the free states deprive him of no rights hut are intended to guard every portion of their own people from wrong and to put him on his guard in the exercise of what he or bis agent may deem his rights the trath is the decision of the supreme god is the father of u all and all men are brethren court so far as it affirmed his rihgt to seize and bear off without legal process an alleged fugitive is justly chargeawt with the collisions that have since taken place in the recapture of fugitives from service and also with the laws remedy injury from illegal seizures pi which the slave states complain the reclamation of slaves in states holding no slaxes and hostile to slavery is ai best so offensive to the opinions and feelings of their people that slaveholders themselves tnust admit that it ought to be conducted with as few irritating concomitants as possible when legal process is issued when it is served by the officers of the law when the pretensions of the claimant are made under shelter ot the authority of the unit id states there is no danger of collision or violent interference americans are distinguished for ther respect for legal forms and they will submit in the hope that no unconstitutional aggression or claim will be tolerated but it is a very different thing when n stranger with a band of armed men appears in a free state community and proceeds without authority or law to seize by violence another stranger under pretence that he is a slave know ng neither and nothing of the relations of the two parties the people see brute force put forth by one to deprive the other of his liberty would they not be less than men did they not interpose to see justice done state law is resorted to for the unknown claimant many be a kidnapper the unknown claimed a free manno community however low in the scale of civilization will endure the open display of violence against an apparently unoffending individual some of the judges of the supreme court did foresee and predict precisely the consequences that have come to pass we repeat then that for the collisions that have taken place in the reclamation of fugitives from justice the supreme court of the united states and not the legislation of the free states is to beheld responsible southern men irrtated by the consequences of the decision of this court without stopping to ascertain their true cause have suffered themselves to become inflamed against the north indulge daily in their denunciations of rhe bad faith of northern men and insist upon additional legislation by congress to remedy their supposed wrongs although some of them admit that to the states rather than to the federal government the work of providing means for executing the fugitive clause of the constitution belongs of the justice of their denunciations and the reasonableness of their demands we may have something to say in our next national eia eroin the n y tribune effects of abolition in jamaica we take the following from an able and interesting letter from jamaica in the evening post the writer it maybe seen does not think the main cause of the decline of the island to be the abolition of slavery his account of the change among the black population is most satisfactory it strikes us that the hundred thousand cultivators of their own land are much better product of gods earth than as many slaves living at the mercy of an owner the letter begins by stating the causes of the present state of the island as follows first the degradation of labor in j consequence of the yet comparatively j recent existence of negro slavery upon the island which excludes the white population from almost every department of productive industry and begets it public opinion calculated to discourage rather than to promote industry among the colored population ninetenths of the improved land is owned by absenteeswhich implies unskillful tillage an extra expense on an aveargo of three thousand dollars a year for attorneys agents and overseers great improvidence in the management ot the property and few or no laborsaving improvements m bthe estates under culture were all mortgaged for more than they were worth when the emancipation bill passed this measure increased the embarrassments of the residents made them the easy prey of their nonresident creditors and left them no means or capital to conduct the cultivation of the land to any advantage the magnitude of the estates and the principles upon which they have been cultivated prevent the free circulation of real property tend to accumulate the lands in the hands of a few to exterminate the middle classes or men of little or no capital and to beget a constant and unnatural antagonism between capital and labor these causesin my judgement would have conducted jamaica to inevitable ruin had the tariff laws never been altered nor the slaves been set at liber ty but i think i hear you ask how long is this state of things to continue or is it to be perpetual to this i will answer in brief that it will continue until the land gets into the hands of people who are not ashamed to till it so long as it is held by english landlords f think it will continue to depreciate in value i say this with all possible respect for them many of whom i know and greatly esteem it will continue to depreciate in their hands i say because they will not cultivate it personally nor can they whole no  command the capital fidelity and skill necessary to cultivate it with profit b agents it will continue to depreciate until the landholders will consent to ell small fragments of their estates to he poor classes who are willing to work the land with their own hands that process is now going on constantly the colored people are rap dly becoming proprietors it is the highest aspiration of most of them to get a piece of land sav from three to five acres which entitles them to vote and with two or three months labor during the cropping of the sugar enables them to live in comparative ease and independence on five acres they can raise almost everything they re quire upon these tracts they raise not only what they require for their own consumption but a surplus which they take to market usually in small pan niera upon donkies or upon their heads most every colored proprietor however has n donkey which costs from seven to ten pounds upon which he packs all his property and under the custody of a woman often sometimes of a child he sends it to town tobe converted into money with which he purchases such articles of necessity or luxury as his land does not produce and he can afford one of the most interesting spectacles to be witnessed about kingston is presented on the highroad through which ther maket people with their donkies in the cool of the morning pour into tho city from the back country they form an almost uninterrupted procession of four or five miles in length and what strikes the eye ot a yankee at once is their perfect freedom from care neither poverty nor desire of gain had written a line upon their faces and they could not show less concern at the result ol their trip if they were going to a festival ou will readily perceive how strong and universal must be the desire of the poor laborers to exchange their servile drudgery at less than a shilling sterling a day for this life ol comparative ease and independence of course it is very hard to get anything ahead upon the wages now paid in jamaica and it requires no little selldenial and energy to lay up enough to purchase one of these properties with but when they do get one they never part with it except for a larger or a better one the planters call them lazy for indulging in this feeling of independence but i never could see anything in the aversion of the negroes hereto labor which was not sanctioned by the example of their masters i think the readers of the evening post will be surprised when i tell them that the number of these small nroori etors is now considerably over and is rapidly increasing their properties average i should think about three acresthey have a direct interest in cultivating their land economically and intelligently the prac ticeof planning their own inbor encouraged by the privilege of reaping its rewards themselves exerts the most important educational influences which will goon be much more apparent than they are now when one reflects that sixteen years ago there was scarcely colored proprietor ol land upo n the island and that now there are a hundred thousand it is unnecessary to say that this clas of the pi u ation appreciate the priviliges ol ree abor and a homestead far more correctly than might be expected more especially when it i borne in mind tf a t seventenths of these propriety w ere begotton in slavery and spent many years of their lives as bondsmen it is very obvious to me that the best estates of the island are to undergo this process of division before its real productive capacities can beknown their prices must fall to a level with the means of those who cultivate themthe laboring population which being all colored imports that the land is to pass from the whites to the colored people before the islund con prosper this i think inevitable if it remains a british possession it is objected here that if the estates are so minutely subdivided the cultivation of the great staples sugar coffee and the manufacture of ruin must cease because the works upon sugar and coffee estates are very expensive and require large capital and the estates must be very large to compensate for the outlay in that direction for example a good range of sugar works could not be erected for less than the proprietor of twenty five or fifty acres could not afford to keep such costly buildings for the manufacture of his limited stock much less could the smaller proprietor of three five or ten acres the answer to this objection seems perfectly obvious and yet no one here seems to understand it they have only to observe one of the most familiar principles of economical science and the whole difficulty is obviated let them do what is done universally in the norheru states of our republic separate the functions of the agriculturist from those of the manufacturer and then both departments of industry will be better conducted upon at least onetenth the capital now required there is no conceivable reason why central sugarmills for example should not be established where the planters could take their cane to be ground fora toll or to sell for a return of a given quantity of sugar or molasses orrum or money or whatever might be agreed upon corrupondwh of tift triton rights of mic if ijt oregon tet washington wed may ou will have learned with pjeasttse ere this reaches you that the senate has given its sanction to a branch ot the mint in your city and also one for california this is more favorable than was generally anticipated tha whole day was consumed upon this important subject but it was a day better spent than any other dajr of the session perhaps one or two excepted for the details i must refer you to your regular report of proceedings the bill from the senate providing for the appointment of a surveyor general of the public lands in oregon and donations of lands to actual settlers elicited an unusually stirring debate in the house today the particular point of dissention was upon the amendment excluding free colored settlers from the lands proposed to be donated mr giddings lod off with ahold and truthful speech against tha exclusive policy he alluded in terms of deserved approbation to the moral worth as well as intellectual strength of frederick douglassand samsel r ward having drawn a very striking portraiture he then desired to know on what principle of justice gentlemen proposed to exclude such men from a participation in these land grants he referred to the free colored population as embracing many who were descended from tue fathers of the nation including even washington himself he put a poser to the democrats who advocated the exclusive policy by asking with what consistency not to say gratitude disciples of jefferson could conset to keep from oregon those in whose yeins coursed the blood of thomas jefferson there was some sneering and jeering on the southern side x as the loco side might be called with injustice to very few members all things considered while mr giddings was speaking but nothing like the degree of that sort of feeling once so common there was indeed a remarkable and gratifying spirit of tolera tion bat this was too tempting an opportunity for two or three of the representatives of the chivalry to lose conrad of louisiana fired a sneering shot at mr giddingss taste btc he complained that he had represented that the caucasians were inferior to the colored men referred to mr giddings replied that he had admitted that the whites were quite ns good as the blacks mr conrad opposed the exclusion of the colored settlers on the ground that the south wanted to have the colored population diffused what do you suppose he assigned as the reason ot this wish why that it waa everywhere admitted to be a curse of course then he is quite willing to diffuse a curse bayly took the same view as conrad and contended that the course of the territorial legislature of oregon in excluding free blacks from citizenship had acted in violation of the spirit of the law of their organization ns a territory in applying the principle of the antislavery ordinance congress did not anticipate that the south would be thus cut off from an outlet for her redundant free black population in that direction which he alleged to have always been the chiefobstacle to emancipation to hear him talk one would really have supposed that the south had assented most graciously to the application of the proviso principle to the oregon bill but the richest feature of this debate was a speech in particular reply to mr giddings by col mcmullen of virginia he was very personalso much so that he was called to order by the chairman mr strong he indulged in a number of those polite lingual missiles whose points have been worn off by his chivalrous predecessors through frequent use he complained of a grievous want of gratitude on the part of mr giddings in thus insulting his constituents after the favor he did him some time ago in moving the floor for him when he appealed to his frinds to make that motion the redoubtable virginian then launched forth into a stream of grandiloquence in the midst of which the hammer fell leaving as his last words the declaration that he had no doubt the negroes referred to by the gentlemen from ohio were descendants of the first families of virginia i t the f f vs the gallant colonel sat down with an evident feeling of self satisfactisn it is true there was considerable laughter but he appropriated this to himself of course as induced by his wit i should almost regret to disturb his feelings it is understood that it is mcmullens intention to reply specially to mr hay mond of wheelingthat he has been waiting for his speech so you see that there is at least one treat in store another important question arose in the course of the long exciting and decidedly disorderly debate on this oregon bill the detestable serpent of yativeism shows its head frequently it was resisted by mr sackett of your delegation and others in a spirit of praiseworthy manliness ou the question of destruction of color in giants of land the vote was mainly sectional the exceptions were for the most part among the western locofocoa some of these voted openly for th southothers remaining in their seats when the process of going through the tellers presented a test ot their predilections the vote on the insertion of the word white stood yeas to nays jrom a thin house a general and informal understanding was had before the committee of the whole as to the resumption of the oregon land bill at an early day out of which a scene of great confusion grew when the committee rose it got mixed up with the california question which excited not a little jealousy the chair having decided that it required unanimous consent to entertain a motion to fix a day mr giddinga objected and consequently the house adjourned without an understanding on the subject after all this cl adits doings and undoings for tht week the spring cleaning will commence tomorrow sioi a wife who loses her patience may not expect to keep her husbands heart xxxiit

it enacted that as soon as california shall have passed in convention an ordinance providing that ehe relinquishes all title or claim to tax dispose of or in any way to interfere with the primary disposal by the united states of the public domain within her limitsthat she will nocinterpose her authority and powei so as to disturb or impede any contrel which the united states may deem advisable to exercise over such district in the mining regions either now discovered or to be discovered hereafter as may be included in any lawful grant made to private individuals or to corporations prior to

disposition on the part of those who opposed the bill to present their contra project instead of objecting and saying that because they are in the minority they will make no proposition the vice president stated the question upon mr chases amendment amending mr daviss of miss amendment permitting the territorial legislatures to pass laws protecting property ot every kind which now exists or may hereafter be introduced in the territories conformably with tbe constitution and laws of the united states so as to declare said amendment shall not be constructed so as to imply that slavery exists or can be introduced in said territories by the said constitution and laws mr douglass opposed both the amendments upon the ground that they violated the principle of nonintervention declared in the niichoiwn letter if either of these amendments were adopted he did not see how those who had heretofore assumed the position stated in that letter could vote for the bill mr downs said that if the interpretation of the nicholson letter given by mr douglass was the true one it took away the whole ground upon which the south supported it the amendment submitted by mr chaae was in effect the wilmot proviso mr chase defended his amendment it wa not the wilmot proviso as had been stated by several senators but really an explanation of mr daviss amendment designed to render its terms definite and not liable to diversity of interpretation according to the section in which interpreted mr davis said his amendment was not destined to carrv any implication as to what species of property there was very little difference between deciding the rights of property and protecting them when they exist in reply mr douglass said that the difference between that senator and huuseli was simply as to who were the people the senator applied the term to the inhabitants of the territories while he mr davis applied it to those inhabitants only alter sovereignty had been given them by congress mr douglass in concluding a tew words in reply declared that if the question of slavery was touched in any way manner or shape in the bill it could not pass the seriate after some further debate by mr walker and jefferson davis mr butler defended the amendment submitted by the latier neither you nor the senator proposing it declared that slavery exists in the territories or shall go there the senator never said it should go there he did contend however and propose by hie amendment that if slavery should go to the territories or if it should prove already to exist there the slave owner may be protected in his right to try the validity of fits title to that properly under the constitution and laws mr butler said he designed at a future time to express his views generally upon the bill when he would take occasion to say candidly explicitly and distinctly what he thought would satisfy him as a representative of one of the southern states mr king expressed himself opposed to mr davis amendment because it would embarrass the bill in teply to mr douglass he denounced that senators remarks asa free soil wilmot proviso speech so fsr as the argument went because it contended that coogreas had all power over the subject pf slavery mr douglass responded with considerable warmth mr webetet thought the amendment waa very little moment or effect in any way if he understood tbe object of its mover that object could be readily obtained by another mode he understood that the amendment had it foundation in nothing but a disposition to prevent tbe legislatures of the territories from passing any law perpetually excluding slavery therefrom he n amendment the other day ir the hands of the senator from indiana which would meet that object the bill declared that tbose legtsla tutes shall pass no law respecting slavery the amendment to which be referred declared that the territorial legislature shall have no authority to pass laws establishing or excluding slavery thia was certainly a municipal question and there could be no impropriety in adopting such an amendment as he had suggested although he must say that in his opinion this whole class of amendments were unnecessary considering the actual state of things in the country to which they were to be applied mr hale was unwilling even by silence to admit that the question before the senate was of practical indifference we had grownup from thirteen to thirty states and the experience of the past was that in every instance in which new states had been admitted into the union without an express prohibition of slavery no matter what theii latitude or longitude slavery had gone into and been irrevocably established in those states on this subject he wanted no other guide than the light of the past this question then was one of great practical importancea question ot the establishment or exclusion of slavery no question had ever been agitated in congress since the declaration of independence involving so important and lasting consequences as that now pending and it was a libel upon the intelligence of the free states to tell them that it waa a question of indifference mr webster said it was io his opinion no question at all of slavery or no slavery it was known to be his opinion that there was no reasonable human probability that slavery would go to the territories and that there was no substantial necessity doing anything in establishing territorial governments in relation to its prohibition or exclusion believing it as he did to be already excluded by causes not under human control after some further debate mr cass again explained and defended his nicholson letter and after a few remarks in relation to the policy of nonintervention declared that he should vote against both pending amendments as well as against the original restriction contained in the bill upon the territorial legislation respecting slavery without taking any question halfpast four senate adjourned the nashville convention the following resolutions have been adopted by the nashville convention it will beseen that the missouri line is insisted upon a southern political party recommended to give its support to such party in the north as will submit to its terms and the th of june fixed as the time for a southern convention to nominate candidates for the presidency and vice presidency resolved that california is peculiarly well adapted for slave labor and that if the tenure of slave property was by recognition of this kind secured in that part of the country south of deg min it would in a short time form into one or more slaveholding states to swell the number and power of llisse already in existence resolved that it too plain for argument that the slave holding states would not lose and the nonholding greatly gain by the surrender to the latter of the half of texas and that the payment to texas of ten millions as price however it might minister to ber distress for money would be no compensation to them and the more especially as the most of the money would come out of their own pockets resolved that the people of the slaveholding states by becoming a unit as respects political or party organization separate from the people of the nonholding states would place themselves in a position of great advantage in as least three particulars first to enable them to account to the political party ot the north by putting it in their power to throw undivided might into the scale of whichever party then showed the best disposition to them m justice second it would enable then to turn to account the potent sentiment of love for the union cherished by the north out of their desire to terminate the existence of the uiion promptly and without any internal discord whenever the north came to disregard their right third it would enable them at the worst to defend themselves to the best advantage and therefore it would be in the highest degree conservative of union and of the best sentiments of fraternity between the people of the north and those of the south resolved therefore that the people of the south ought to drop old party distinctions in organization and for the future let the test of meiit in the different candidates for office be this only which of them is likely to do the most good friendly and frateranal part by the south and to this end the conventions both for the nominations of state officers president and vice president ought hereafter to be held without reference to theii past party relations resolved that we therefore invite a convention of the slave holding states on the th of june for the purpose of determining which among the various aspirants for the presidency and vice presidency ought to receive the suffrages of the south resolved that unless the nonslave holding states at the next session of their respective legislatures repeal the laws which they have passed obstructing the recoveiy of fugitive slaves and also to take effectual step fur the practical observation by their citizens of the constitutional stipulation for the surrender of such slaves the slave holding states ought without delay to adopt measures of retaliation and nonintercourse resolved that we have htte confidence in the efficacy of any law which congress may pass to secure tne observation of this clause of the constitution because public opinion at the north is so much opposed to such laws that it could not be enforced we look chiefly to the states themselves who are parties to the stipulation for the observance but any laws passed by congress which gave to the fugitive a trial by jury in the stale to which he fled would as a remedy be mere mock er resolved that in a case a majority of the clear rights of the south pass any law which should deprive her of the part of california situated deg north oi cut off from texas any part of the territory line within the boundary which she claims as her own ot interfere with slavery or the trade in the slave district of columbia then this convention on themonday after the passage of such act should assemble at for tbe purpose of considering the remedy to be adopted for redress of the wrongs thus perpetrated the hutchinons a circumstance has come to our knowledge in relation to the hutchinsona which reflects so much credit on them that we think it our duty to detail it year ago when they were about to commence their career they arrived at a neighboring city in a wagon with two hosaes they gave one or two concerts and failed unable to leave the city they were about to sacrifice their horses to be enabled to return home a gentleman in the city persuaded them to remain and give one mote concert making himself responsible for their debt th result was that they did well on a recent visit they found this gentleman poor and tick absolutely in want after providing for hia immediate wants they feet him aaidefor his benefit the proceeds of their first concert which restored comparative comfort to his home they cei tainly deserve tfaeii successv y exprtjt the north star rochester june  tbs nobth stab is sometimes mm to friend who do not take the paper in the hope

n prejudice against color let qo one imsgine that we are about to give undue prominence to this subject regarding as we do the feeling named above to be the greatest of all obstacles in the way of the antislavery cause we think there is little danger of making the subject of it too prominent tbe heartless apathy which prevails in this community on the subject of sla verythe coldblooded indifference with which the wrongs of the perishing and heartbroken slave are regardedthe contemptuous slanderous and malicious manner in which the names and characters of abolitionists are handled by the american pulpit and press generally may be traoed mainly to the malign feeling which passes under the name of prejudice against color every step in our experience in this country since we commenced our antislavery labors has been marked by facts demonstrative of what we have jus l said the day that we started on our first antislavery journey to nantucket now nine years ago the steamer was detained at the wharf in new bedford two hours later than the usual time of starting in an attempt on the part of the captain to compel the colored passengers to separate from the white passengers and to go on the forward deck of that steamer and during this time the most savage feelings were evinced towards every colored man who asserted his right to enjoy equal privileges with other passengers aside from the twenty months tghich we spent in england where color is no crime and where a mans fitness for respectable society is measured by his moral and intellectual worth we do not remember to have made a single antislavery tour in any direction in this country when we have not been assailed by this mean spirit of caster a feeling so universal aud so powerful for enil cannot well be much commented upon we haws used the term prejudice against color designate the feeling to which we allude nm because it expresses correctly what that feeling is but simply because that innocent term is usually employed for that purpose properly speaking prejudice against color does not exist in this country the feeling or whatever it is which we call prejudice is no less than a murderous hellbom hatred of every virtue which may adorn the character of a black man it is not the black mans color which makes him the object of biutal treatment when he is drunken idleignor ant and vicious black bill is a source ol amusement he is called a goodnatured fellow he is the first to touch his hat to the stranger approaching the hotel and offer his service in holding his horse or blacking his boots the white gentleman tells the landlord to give bill something to drink and actually drinks with bill himself while poor black bill will minister to the pride vanity and laziness of white american gentlemen while he consents to play the buffoon for their sport he will share their regard buuet him cease to be what we have described him to be let him shake off ihe filthy rags that cover himlet him abandon drunkenness for sobriety industry for indolence ignorance fox intelligence and give up his menial occupation for respectable employ mentlet him quit the hotel and go to the ehurch and assume there the rights and privileges of one for whom the son of god died and he will be pursued with the fiercest hatred his name will be cast out as evil and his life will be embittered with all the venom which hate and malice can generate thousands of colored men can bear witness to the truth of this representation while we are servants we are never offensive to the whites or marks of popular displeasure we have been often dragged or driven from the tables of hotels where colored men were officiating acceptably as waiters and from steamboat cabffis where twenty or thirty colored men in light jackets and white aprons were frisking about as servants among the whites in every direction on the very day we were brutally assaulted in new york lor riding down broadway in company with ladies we saw several white ladies riding with black servants these servants were welldressed proud looking men evidently living on the fat of tbe landyet they were servants they rode not for their own but for the pleasure and convenience of white persons they were not in those carriages ss friends or equals they were there ss appendages they constituted s part of tbe magnificent equipages they were there as the fine black horses which they drove were thereto minister to the pride and splendor of their employers as they passed down broadway they were observed with admiration by the multitude and even tbe poor wretches who assaulted us might have said in their hearts as they looked upon such splendor we would do so if we could we repeat then that color is not the cause of our persecution that is it it not our color which makes our proximity io white men disagreeable the evil lies deeper than prejudice against color itis ss we have said an intense hatred of the colored man when he is distinguished for any ennobling qualities of head or heart if the feeling which persecutes os were prejudice against color the colored servant would be as obnoxious as tbe colored gentleman for the color is the same in both cases and being the same in both cases it would produce the same result in both esses we are then a persecuted people not because we are colored but simply because that color has for a series of yean been coupled in he public mind with the degradation of slavery and servitude in these conditions weare thought to be in oar place and to aspire to anything above them is to contradict tbe established vkjw of the communityto get out of our sphere and commit the provoking sin of impudmtt just here is our sin we have been tvsbre we have passed through all the grsdseef servitude and have undergod secured ofe freedom sod if we have become the apedsi object of attack it is because we speak and tl among our fellowmen without the slight regard to their ot our own complexionm id further because we elaim and exercise tl e right to associate with just such person ai aie willing to associate with us and who ai l agreeable to our tastes and suited to our ns ml and intellectual tendencies without refaneace to the color of their skin and withourgivisg ourselves the slightest trouble to iaquiici whether the world are pleased or pspleaed by our conduct we believe in hojpao equality that character not color should be the criterion by which to choose associates and we pity the pride of the poor dust and ashes which would erect any oihtr standard of social fellowship this doctrine of human equality is the bitterest yet taight by the abolitionists it is swallowed wah more difficulty than all the other points of the amislavery creed put together what makes a negro equal to a white men nb we wfi neter consent to ihat no ibat wont do but stop a moment dont jffmt a mgdn lreep cool what is a wttnßsm that youdo so revolt at tbe idea of making a negro equal with him who made bin is he an angel or a man ia man jery well he is a man and nothing but t manpossessing the same weaknesses liable to the same diseases and under the sanm necessities to which a blackman is subject wherein does the whiteman differ from the black why one is white and the other is black well what of that does the sun shine more brilliantly upon theone than it does upon the other is nature more lavish with her gifts toward the one than toward the other do earth sea and air yield their suited treasures to the one more readily than to the other in a word have we not all one father why then do you revolt at that equality which god and nature instituted the very apprehension which the american people betray od this point is proof of the fitness of treating all men equally the fact that they fear an acknowledgment of dur equality shows that thw see a fitness in such i an acknowledgment why are they not apprehensive lent the borsfc should be placed onan equality with man simply because the horsis not a man and no amount of reasoning can coavince the world against its common sen that ihe horse is anything else umpa horse so here all can repose without ijfecr bui not so with he negro he stands f erectupon his brow he bears the seal of manj hood from the hand of the living god adopt any mode of reasoning you please with respect to him he is a man possessing an immortal soul illuminated by intellect capable of heavenly aspirations and in all things pertaining to manhood he is at once selfevi dently a matt and therefore entitled to all the rights and privileges which belong to human naturef di colonizationfree colored people and the new york tribune we shall now briefly conclude the examination we somntenced last week of the colonization doctrines recently put forth by the new york tribune tbe reader will find the ari tide containing mr greeleys views on the third page of list weeks north star in that article he institutes a comparison of the free blscks and he mormons making the latter to be more talumniated traduced and persecuted than the free blacks and he points us for an example to what these plundered mormons have sheeted in the last three years so far as the comparison will have the effect to whip our people into more activity and greater enterprise than they have hitherto exhibited in that proportion we may rejoice that it has been written but to declare that the mormon or any other white people in this country are more persecuted and traduced than the free slacks as we ate called by the tribune is to utter that which js contrary to what eveiy one has the means of knowing to be the facts in the case it was but the other day that we heard of a circumstance that very aptly illustrates the relative position of the white and colored people of this country a white man had been declared to have negro blood in his veins he at once brought an action against his accuser and laid his damages at ten thousand dollars but suppose we should adopt the example of the mormons and go out into the wilderness and do just what they have done what assurance can mr greeley give us that the same treatment would be extended to us by this government that has been extended to the mormons none whatever he knows or ought to know that while slavery is permitted in this country colored men will be hated and despised by their enslavers throughout the world we are told to go to the west coast of africato strike out a bold path of danger duty and selfsacrifice as a means of winning the worlds respect and the admiration of posterity this is a very grand flourish what has the united states done for these who have already gone there she has done nothingworse than nothing while england and faance have both acknowledged the liberian republic and have extended to her the right hand of commercial fellowship the republic from whose shores that people were driven by oppression have yet to perform this simplest act of justice what has our government done in the case of haiti it has scouted with the most provoking contempt any act looking toa welcome of the biack republic into tbe sisterhood of nations until at length that republic disgusted with the very name of republicanism abandoned all show of it and put on the robes of imperialism finding as she has found far more justice honor sod magnanimity among european despots than she has been able to find among american democrats it makes no difference mr greeley where the black man rosy pitch his tentwhether on this or on the other sid of the atlantic tho people of this country will osver do him justice while they continue to enslave his race between sixty and evenly colored men have embarked from the single point of new bedford to california and large numbers have gone from boetoo new york and other northern and atlantic pons they have struck oat a path of dangeraimi selfsacrifice a largeportion of them will probably return to this oeantry with abundance of gold but who does not know that the meanest and laziest white man in the community may move about the country with greater freedom from iaault and abuse than can the wealthiest and most respectable of those who return from this fid ofdanger and selfsacrifice while slavery continues to exist the coored man will continue to be despised in this land nor will he escape being so despised by leasing his brethren in the land of bondage to the inheritance of whipe and chains and selfishly seeking a place of rest for himself to our apprehonsioo it is far more noble on the part of the free colored people to remain here struggling agaiust the adverse winds of prejudice and slavery than selfishly to quit the country with a view to bettering tbeir own condition let mr greeley com plain aa much as be may of ourdetermination to emain here it shall go hard with us before we shall consent to leave these shores while three millions of our countrymen are in chains we me resolved to fell or flourish with themd a doubtful compliment r ward speaks of our remarks at the recent anniversary of the american antislavery society as follows after raving and roaring for a while mr douglass acquittedjrimself before them and against them as thotecenppapers represent and as the indecent papers misrepresent we are entirely unconscious of having raved or roared on the occasion referred to but will not insist upon being judge in our own case and therefore must allow mr ward to have it all his own way in the same letter mr w ard says of his meeting held in st marys street church philadelphia had not the gettersup of this meeting in their handbills declaied that tbs body of the house would be reserved for white persons an arrangement that was not could not be carried out because unfit to be made it would have had no other defect than the first speech now mr ward must pardon us but we do think that this seeming reproof of the getters up of the meeting in question is about as equivocal as the singular compliment to which we have just alluded the former may be easily traced to an accidental grammatical error but we fear that the latter must be set down to a cause far less creditable to its author the men who got up the meeting at st marys street church were guilty of t very disgraceful piece of truckling to the negrohating proslavery spirit of philadelphia they very discreditably gratuitously and contemptibly yielded themselves the menial servants of the scornful spirit of caste and this too at an antislavery meeting mr ward very gently calls this a defect and that defect he deems to be about equal to his own speech f the cringing serviles who sent forth the proscriptive handbill will easily pardon mr ward for this very equivocal rebuke especially as he so far spared their feelings and forgot his duty to rebuke them publicly when he had them before him at the meeting where the delect was wore his eyes you are seen samuel ringold wardr d celebration of west india

a mass meeting on the subject of african colonization and that the said meeting was eloquently addressed by colored americans this is a sad slate of affairs but you will not let auch opposition i hope cause your hands to hang down or retard your efforts but rather let all auch preslavery actions be means for you to nerve your arm and increase youi fiimneas sad argumentyour fixed determination in writing printing and pleading the cause of the poor slave and the elevation of the free colored man and telling in burning words to this land of professing christians and to the world the sin of slavery and that you may never cease pouting floods of living light m the mind and conscience of the oppressor till you change their guilty prejudices feelings sad actions towards us as men and citizens of the united states and i do hope that you will advise snd urge our fellow jountrymen to avoid all participation in any meeting of the colonization society as it is antichristian in its actions and i have ever relieved that slavery and colonization are winsisters and that the main desire of the friends of colonization is to drain the free rolored people out of these united states so hat the chair of slavery may be riveted more ightly upon its victims and it is very clear hat colonization has long been fostered and attained by the murderous spirit of slavery tnd prejudice i such being the character of the society it its neither the confidence nor the respect of he free ooloted people and i think it the i luty of every colored mao to despise the name if the colonization society because that society has published to the world s libel on the name and character of my people by saying that we were a nuisance degraded and vicious ac in conclnsiou this is the land where we all drew our first breathwhere we have grown up to strength and manhood hers we have cantracted the most sacred engagements the dearest relations of life here we have found the companions of oar childhood the friends of our yoatb the gentle partners of oar lives here are the haunts of oar infancy the scenes of every endearing hour ina word this is our own nativc land and we love our countrywe love oar fellow citizens and we consider every colored man who allows himself to be colonized in africa is an enemy to the slave and a traitor to the antislavery cause yours ac j b vashon petebboro june frederick doublers my outraged and affltcted brother have just read in the last norths star the article io which you inform your readers of the insults and violence and threats of assassination which you encountered in your recent visit to new york j this article stirs the lowest depths of my sympathy and love i sympathized with you and loved you before more now ah this cruel and outrageous treatment you suffer because ycu are a colored man or rather because nothwithatanding you arc a coloredjman you presume to demean yourself as a man and to let your lips and pen give expression to those rare powers with which you are endowed were you ignorant andvile you might go to new york or elsewhere evety month without being molested but being intelligent sod eloquent and refined and highaouled you are a shining mark that cannot escape the notice and cannot fail to provoke the jealousy and wrath of a people educated to depise and hate the colored race it will be long my dear brother before you will be able to travel in america uninsulted and unharmed so long as the conventional and sham christianity which builds negropews and which qualifies and limits social rights by complexion shall bear sway in this land so long you will be exposed to insults and injuries it is this spurious christianity which subjects you to discomforts and insults and exposes you to violence and murder it is this which educates and lets loose the mob upon you it is this which moulds the websters and dickinsons of the senate and the morses of the new york observer and the bennets of the new york herald and which makes expediency instead of principle the governing motive of them all this spurious christianity is indeed a murdei ous and a develish thing would that all its i churchesbut that they would be rebuilt might be burnt up and that all its ministers i might be huddled together where they could repent and do no harm a negropew church a church of christ what a misnomer i would not honor it sofar as to call it the church of the devil the devil is not so unreasonablel was about to say not so unjustas to classify persons by the color of their skin even the devil is willing to leave to its operation the great law that character assigns to every man his place but think not my dear douglass that it is you colored men alone who suffer from this insane and rampant prejudice the wound it inflicts on you it inflicts on us who spmpa thize with you and who have identified ourselves and made ourselves colored men with i you in your sufferings we suffer in your afflictions we are afflicted did i never tell you that one reason i so seldom leave my house is that because of my sympathy with my colored brethren i am made so unhappy abroad i i look around for them in vain they are not there to share with me in ray comforts and privileges it is true that lam not thus tried in the churches i atfflw when from home since i attend no negrohating churches for some fifteen years i have shunned such churches as i would a pesthouse but when visiting cannot always steer clear oam places and occasions where my is despised and hated and crucified often find myself in public houses and private houses in steamboats and cars and omnibuses ingatherings and circles where i know my poor colored brother if allowed at all is not allowed to be as the equal of the white man and how can i be happy in such circumstances how can i enjoy that in which my equal brother is permitted no participation even the attempt to enjoy it feel to be traitorous to him and if enjoyment begin the rising of such a feeling arrests and wither it in such circumstances lam wont to remember that by reason of the interference and remonstrance of his sympathy with others david had not the heart to slake his raging thirst with the water offered him despair not however my dear brother all will be made right and iri due time the religion of jesusthe religion of the bible that will prevail and when it does prevail it will make all right for it is not a slavery or casts religion but a religion of lcve and freedom and equality you and i shall not live to see its pievalence but it is our privilege to labor for it and to live and die in the assurance that jesus shall yet reigd in this sincrazed and sinruined world and that he shall yet shew who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and lord of lords with great regard your friend and brother gerrit smith american leape of colored la bo tena numbet of colored men who have long made the beat interests of their race in the united slates their study and effort being in new york attending the anniversary and wishing to make the best improvement of the occasion assembled together in the lecture room of zions chureh corner of leonard and church streets and organized and opened their meeting in the usual way rev s r ward of new york was appointed president and henry bibb of michigan secretary an interchange of views was then had on the present aspect of their affairs in the united states and of what is best to be done in the present crisis the first conclusion at rived at was that union and conckkt of action is indispensable to speedy success to our efforts for improvement and elevation the second conclusion was thatour pkj deal and pecuniary improvement has not kept pace with oar other improvements and at present demands our serious attention they therefore agteed to adopt for themselves the following proposing to practice upon and he governed by them in their future operations and in union and concert to recomownc the same to the government and practice of others rnrf it is manifest that one very great evil now suffered by the t tee colored people of the united states is the want of money money can he obtained by labor all colored men should engage in the most profitable labor provided it be honorable that labor is most profitable which is and can be most and beet assisted assistance of labor is from animals and machinerycapital  any man who has learned a useful trade of any kind and has tbe talent for conducting it on his own account ought so to conduct it because all the nett profits would then be his and he would then have a fair opportunity of assisting his brethren by employing them ae apprentices and journeymen but if he has not the means of setting up in trade on his own account then if in is a man of integrity he ought to be furnished with the means hence a fund should be established in every community for the purpose of loaning suras of money to colored men of integrity to assist them to go into business on their own acoouni or in such way as they may find most convenient and profitable we recommend skillful honorable profitable labor to the free colored men of the united states not merely because it is productive ot wealth and si iu accompanying advantages but because it is indispensable to that developement and perfection both of body and mind which we so much need and which many of us so much desire the free colored men of the uuiied slates are already impressed with the importance of educating their rising youth in the sciences this we recommend as highly favorable to their advancement and elevation but science without a trade or some way of turning it to useful account loses more than half its value we therefore recommend that they be just as careful to educate their youth in the arts of agriculture manufacture and commerce as in the sciences we recommend the attainment of learning and lliches because they are capable of procuring for us much personal comfort and inspiring us with respect for ourselves and for each othet and of gaining for us the respect of men generally bui we should have a still higher aim than the respect and fa vour of men we should practice those virtues and seek that purity and goodness of heart which will in the end procure fur us the favor of god the above propositions having been adopted with one dissenting voice the meeting adjourned until the afternoon at halfpast oclock having previously appointed a committee to report a plan of organixation afternoon session the committee appointed reported the

large room was completely crammed on the motion of j shoard esq tht chair was taken by edward thomas esq who said they weie met that evening to heai the statements of mr brown with respeci to slavery in america in the fifteen southern states of that country there were no lest than slaves but the fifteen northern states were free mr brown would not be able to give a perfect statement in one evening and it was accordingly proposed that he should devote two nights to that purpose if some of the south carolina gentlemen were present they would no doubt tell him mr thomas that he was introducing a thief well he admitted mi btown waa a thief for he had stolenhit own body laughter and applause mr brown on coming forward was received with the greatest enthusiasm he said he piesutned they had assembled in that room upon former occasions and for various purposes but he did not believe they had ever been convened for a higher purpose than the one which brought them together that evening applause the cause ol freedom was dear to every one and the tight of man to liberty the right of a human being to possess his own body and to have the value of his own laborwas a selfevident proposition man brings into the world with him a right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness he was there that evening as the advocate and representative of three millions of americans who had not the privilege of representing themselves persons with whom he was identified by the siripes which he carried on his own person by complexion and by suffering by everything which could bind man to his fellowman the institution of slavery had within itself the elements of destruction it was an institution disliked by all friends of freedom and religious liberty hear hear but slavery in america was lawful the constitution ol the united states threw around the slaveowner its protection and the slaveowner armed with the law and approved and upheld by the constitution reigned oyer those unfortunate beings who were in his power the chairman had justly said they had in america fifteen free states and fifteen slave states or at least fifteen states where slaves could not be considered or held to be goods and chattels but there was not a foot of soil in the states where he or any other fugitive slave could stand protected by law and where the slaveholder could not pursue him capture him and bting him back into interminable bondage that was the position of the american government at the present time and what had been the first and absorbing question before the american congress during the present session l the question of slavery that question had taken the precedence of all other subjects the slaveholders not satisfied with the privilege of pursuing a slave into any territorynot satisfied with imposing a fine of on any person for aiding or feeding an escaped slave had now a proposition before the american congress to add to the number of officers for the return of fugitive slaves to have or judges or postmasters before whom captured slaves could be brought and these judges were to be appointed by a slaveholding president who had upveegds of slaves working on his cane plantations but there was another proposition to add oo more to the penalty for aiding or feeding a slave while attempting to make hts escape from bondage shame w bile these questions were being agitated in america the slave holders had resolved to introduce slavery into mexico and for that purpose had dragged up henry clay to advocate the project not only had they dragged up henry clay from the verge of the grave but a christian man from a free state one of the most noble of the sous of massachusettshad made a speech in congress and declared that he would not only go for that measure but that he would vote for the proposition that would give to the slaveholder double advan tagea in recapturing hts slaves he referred to daniel webster and he the speaker was sure that that name would be held up to posterity as a name to be execraed for bending his supple knee to the power of the slaveholders cheer that was the position of slavery before the american congress in travelling through england he found the people had a very imperfect idea of what slavery was in the united state not only was slavery sanctioned in america by the countenance of the whole land but it was carried on between the several stales they had slave marts and slave markets in every town in the slaveholdtng states and the greatest mart in the union was at the city of washington the capital of the country shame tte americans who professed to be friends of freedomwho professed to have sympathies with other nations while struggling for freedomwho were welcoming hungarian and other brave menwere at the same time enslaving onesixth of their own countrymen the slave was a chattel as defined by the laws of the country a thinga piece of property he had no right to hts labor no right to his family no light to say anything concerning hts welfare or existence in fact he occupied the same position as the hound of the american slaveholder and was regarded as the horse or ox is regarded in this country shame it was not hts purpose to show them that the slaves wer not well fed or well cladthat had nothing to do with the question hear hear he did not come to wage war with the masters for not feeding or clothing their slaves but the right of the blavc to libeity was the question cheers he would not discuss the question there whether the american slave had a right to be free for the british people were satisfied on that point and had given prima facie evidence of it in the emancipation of their west india slaves and in their effortslo abolish the odious system it was not a ques ion whether the lave had enough to eat or wear suppose a man gvae him food and clothing what was that to him so long as he knew that roan had the power to put him upon the auction block and sell him to the highest bidderto tear the husband from the wife and the wife from the husband what compensation was there for that they would find in this country that if there were men who conceded the point and who brought forward the argument that a slave ought tobe satisfied with enough for his bodily wants such men we e the first to oppress the people of this country and say they ought tobe satisfied with the rights they have loud cheers he would now for a moment notice the condition of the slave in america why had the americans a law making it penal for as many as five slave to be fuund talking on the highway because the slaveholders feared insurrections v hy had they a law making it a penally of from so to loo for teaching a slave to read simply because they could not keep them in their present position if they wete educated cheers why had they law making it a penalty of death to the slave who should strike his master because all of these odious jaws tended to keep the slaves where they were the system of slavery was founded upon ignorance ami degradationit must he kept where it is in order to be kept at all lt was the remark of an american statesman that education was the lever which would turn slavery upside down probably some would ask whether those laws were enforced he would observe that probably some of them were not but the law regardiog education was enforced to its utmost extent ao the law regstdiog the atrikingoi the master was enforced because it was said slaves goulioot he kept dpwo without enforcing such laws if a slave stiuck his master hii master had to inform against him eo tha other slaves might learn not to follow tb example as an additional inducement fo masters to deliver their slaves up to the lawin the stale of mississippi the master war compensated for any slave that might be executed every freeman in tbit state war taxed to pay the master for that slave that of coutsc was a very good method of getting rid of old and useless slaveso give them up when the masters knew they would be remunerated for them the slaves in america could not worship god according to the dictates of their conscience the slave ol america could not hold a public meeting bul he had had a warm reception from the people of this country and the warmest reception he had found was from those hearts that beat under the fustian jacket hear hear and cheers but the question of human slavery was one that went beyond every other evil that they could think of it unmanned the man because it placed him in a position where he was not a man it placed him where he could not think for himself and act for himselfwhere he was not considered capable of acting or tkinking at all except at the will of another for twenty years he mr wells was a slave on the plantations of the ameiican nlaveholders during that twenty yeais he had no right to think for himself and when he did think for himself he always found he was running away with himself laughter the institution of slavery had corrupted every other institution the institution of religion and the principles of christianity had been set at naught in the united states and the religious denominations to a greater or lee extent were filled by individuals either slaveholders or connected with slaveholders by relationship or otherwise and all this helps to sustain the odious system in that country the american institutions are thrown around the institutions of slavery political social and commercial institution were thrown around the system and combined to keep it were it wasat the present time but there was one spot of soil inamerica that afforded shelter and asylum for the poor bondsman who made his escape from slavery he referred to the canadas cheers and if he felt reason to rejoice at anything it was at the fact that the english people had yet a hold u pon a portion of the american continent where the fugitive slave found an asylum and was protected by law loud cheers that fact and what the english people had done for the cause of freedom had endeared them to every slave in the united states of america hear hear mr wells brown then went into details explaining at some length the law in different states and giving some very interesting statements of several escapes fiom slavery he then referred to the particulars of his own escape recounting the perils he underwent and concluded by thanking those present for the kindness with which they had received him he hoped there would be a public expression of opinion in this country for the americans paid great defereuce to anything that came from england mr wells satdown amidst several rounds of applause at the conclusion of mr browns address mr liussom moved that a tea meeting should take place in that room on tuesday next the proceeds to be given to mr brown dr j cash neild seconded the motion he trusted that it would reach the ears of the slaveholders in the united states that they might see that in this country difference of color made no distinction as regarded our notions of respectability the motion was ad opted amid rapturous applause mr brown then sang two antislavery songs and a vote of thanks to the chairman terminated the proceedings the horrors of the slave trade in washington cityfiendish assault upon a female the washington correspondent of the true democrat gives the following descripion of a scene in the capitol of the republic how websters retainers must rejoice in anticipation of their future work as slave catchers should masons bill pass the letter is dated may da short distance from my residence lived a very honest and industrious colored woman with some half dozen children this women was employed as a cook by a family near the capitol by her industry and good deportment she had gained the esteem of all who knew her and though a slave she was permitted to apply a portion of her wages to the support of her family and was making efiorls to purchase her freedom as i wa passing down the avenue yesterday i saw near the railroad depot a crowd of people gathered around two ruffian fellows who hed this colored woman in their custody bound hand and foot she could not stand upon her feet her hands were tied behind her and she was moaning as though in great anguish and in broken sobs beseeching the bystanders to protect het blood was running frofusely from a frightful wound in her head and with ruthless hands she was rudely thrust into a hack and under the guardianship of her miscreant captors was hurried off to williams slave pen upon inquiry learned that while engaged in her usual vocations a constable laid hands upon her and ordered her to follow him to the slave pen had a thunderbolt crushed her to the earth she could not have been more shocked than at this summons she reluctantly obeyed her step however were not sufficiently rapid to suit the convenience of the fellow who attended her and laying hold of her with considerable violence he attempted to force her on faster but he was balked in his intentions for she refused to go at all unless he kept his hands off from herby god says the constable ill see if you wont go and with that he attempted to carry his threat into execution but he had no sooner commenced his desperate work titan he found himself sprawling upon his back and the woman standing over him in a menacing attitude and resolutely informing him that she would not b cdragged over to the pen by himshe would rie first she would go peaceably if he would keep his hands off her and not otherwise the fellow was allowed to get up when he again undertook the driving process but he could not move her and called lustily upon the numerous spectators that had gathered round for help but not a man moved although he threatened raved and swore as an officer to arrest them a brother constable however boon came to the scene of action and to his resue but she was too much for the two together and handled them both as though they were mere infants in her grasp having worried them both out declaring all the while however that she would go peaceably if they would keep their hands off one of the miscreants raised a heavy cane and with a furious and welldirected blow felled her senseless tn the earth and while in that state they bound her and in her torn nd bloody garments followed by the execrations and curses of the multitude hurried her off to the head quarters of these land pirates there to die or await her shipment to the southern market her little children the while wete at home they knew nought of the capture and treatment of their mother you can imagine tneir sorrow when left under such circumstances without a protector they are free but their mother is a slave in the hands of men who have no fear of god before their eyes whom no pity can awe no benevolence conciliate no tears no orphan cries no broken hearts no dishonored name no fears of death the judgment and long eternity of woo eon arrest correspondence of the tribune esnporior faust in i of hs tti sad hi palace portatpamci march having reached this city my first care was to request m raybaud to present me to the man whose name is at this moment in the hundred mouths of renown after several days the french consul announced to me that be had arranged the desired interview we betook ourselves to the palace this edifice which served as a habitation to the old governors of st domingo appears rather imposing when compared with the mean houses of the city although it has but one story raised several feet above the ground a barred courtyard where the emperor holds a review every sunday morning vaguely recalls that of the tuilleries we entered a hall of waiting which i examined with curiosity the floor ia of marble slabs the furniture is of black haircloth and straw on a richly wrought table stands a fine bronze cloak representing the arms of haiti a palm surrounded with a bundle of lances and surmounted with a phrygian cao two handsome portraits serve as pendants to each other one represents the abbe greg ime the celebrated conventionist the other the reigning emperor the first is the work of a european pencilthe second does honor to the talent of a mulattos rtist baron colbert i should perhaps have noticed other particulars if the step of his majesty had not been heard in the adjoining hall which contains portraits of the great men of hayti and serves for grand receptions we advanced to meet the emperor who wears a green uniform of an irreproachable cut epaulettes of gold adorned with twelve silver stars a plate on his breast a sword at his side and his chapeau in his band he commenced by giving us a cordial shake of the hand then mmed himself on a fauteuil and awaited with a certain timidity for m raybaud td commence we seated ourselves the consul in announcing my name said that i had come to visit the empire as a traveller and w mid not willingly have departed without the honor of having been received by his majesty sire it is the only aim ot my voyage said i half rising the emperor imitated my movement thanking me i have already had the pleasure of seeing monsieur at the review on sunday he added graciously it was now my turn to thank him the conversation continued in this tone about twenty minutes when we rose to take leave of the emperor he shook hands again three salutations on our part and three on his completed the ceremony faustin soulouque is entirely black but his features have by no means the savage and hideous expression whih has been ignorantly attributed to the purely african type his look might be called handsome and his smile is quite agreeable aged about years he does not seem to be more than of a medium height he has a very full chest large shoulders and broad hips on horseback he has a stately air and is one of the best horsemen i have ever seen on foot his corpulence makes him appear small although naturally not much of a talker he alway exhibits a perfect propriety and dignity in his words here it may be well to rectify the rumor which has attributed to him a complete ignorance of the french language in my presence he expressed himself very correctly and without the least mixture of creole dialect he has also been accused of knowing neither how to lead or write the truth is that he signs his name legibly writes even a letter if need he and reads every evening without the aid of a secretary the new history of hayti which is now being published by a talented native m modi on recently created baron the caricatures and squibs of the parisian press have annoyed him profoundly in this respect he possesses an incurable susceptibility the birth of souloque was very humble he was horn as a slave in the plantation of mt viallet this white who has been pointed i to me succeeded in stemming the revolutton  ary waves which have agitated the queen of tha aunties and actually lives at portau i prince at present soulouque meeting him j lately said although emperor to everybody else i cannot help still as regarding you as my master and i sire consider myself your subject replied m viallet a little dialogue which indicates how marvellous are the reverses of butnan destiny on the evacuation of the french the freed slave entered the army ofdossalines asa soldier and afterward under petion fought against christophe from step to step he came to be colonel at the time of the fall of boyer an event to which he contributed in no way his taciturnitya quality or defect which among the blacks is considered as a matk of prefound discretioncaused him tobe admitted to the confidence of the different subterranean trains which succeeded each other from to created general of brigade by richer he owed his election to the presidency to the chance which pronounced his name in the senate whon opinions were about equally divided between two candidates neither of whom could obtain the necessary majority he was favored by both parties by the blacks on account of hts ebony skin and by the creoles because they hoped to use him as their pliant tool the sequel showed how much they were mistaken they had chosen a master not a ser vant from the contributor eld mathews journal doring the convention sermons was preached by bro kenyon fitzgerald and the writer a cordial hospitality was shown by the inhabitants in the vicinity and much sympathy

meeting vvc came up the ohio river in the ben franklin a splendid boat but like other boats it pays more respect to a white gambler than to a colored minister to rebuke this ungodly practice waited when descending the river till the colored passengers came to the table none other of my color ate with them i was waited on admirably will you not take some fish sir here is some exellent fish shall we help you to a thin slice of ham sic were the inquries of the waiters all of whom were colored but i was about to describe our coming up the river there were on bosid but two colored passengers bro fitzgerald of columbus ands tosspot a congregationalist five white passenners including bro j c craven and his wife whose moral courage was worthy of all praise agreed togeilier to wait and eat with them the supper bell at length rang and the fiist company were ferved the secondf bell rang and the remainder sat down o course they did not fill the seats f began to fear they would never finish eatiog it seemed so long when their lordships had finished the table was spread for the colored passengers and as we had given the steward ahint for their associates we enjoyed the supper albeit several pair of eyes peered upon us from the end of the cabin now for the deseit after supper we divided the boat into distticis then each one taking a district visited and couieously furnished to each passenger a handbill previously printed one of which i enclose to the passengers on board this steamboat respected readercustom having established a law which requires colored persons whatever may he their intellectual and moral worth to watt till white persons have eaten before they appear a the table on board our steamboats ac we present to our fellowpassengers the following reasons against the continuance of this custom it is unjustcolored passengers pay the same fare as others it is contrary to the word of cod do unto others as y would do unto yoxi love thy neighbors as thyself inasmuch us ye did it unto one of the inst ol these ray brethren ye did ft nnto me it is antirepublicanall men are bora free and equal it pays no regard to moral character gamblers if white take precedence of ministers of tbe gospel if colored it is oppressive to the friends ofliberty they are expected to sanction the wicked prejudice on which slsvery the sutn of til villsnies rests should tbe reader desired to reply publicly to these objections he ill please forward his name to the person from whom he received this bandbill that it may be appended to a paperto be presented to the captain ol the steamboat requesting its use for that purpose several passengers v ou inquire how waa it received i reply differently by different persons tbe wife of the captain handed it back to brs craven whose district was the ladies cabin my husband is perfectly competent to make rules for the government of tbe boat another read it and opening the stove door threw it into the fire anoiher proposed to see the captain sud have those who distributed them sent ashore at the first woodyard another came to me for another copy to send to charlestown but in all that numerous throng of passengers not one was found ready and willing to come out and defend the ungodly practice and yet it was the hardest silence ever held they felt guilty and had no power to conceal the guilt usually free colored passengers are not allowed to sleep in the stateroorna but a bed is made for them on the cabin floor even colored ladies in some boats suffer ihts indignity uuless they choose to sit up all night which with the delicacy which honor of the sex they in some cases prefer to do bro fitzgerald however was not thus treated that night the first instance probably in the history of the boat he slept in the same stateroom with a white mah as i thought of the comfortable berth he had my pillow seemed softer i ought to add that in each stateroom are two berths and when a slaveholder comes on board he occupies one berth and the slave the other great is diana ot the ephesians presbyterian general assembly n this convention on the sixth day of its session had majority and minority reporta on the subject of slavery frem s committee appointed on that subject the majority report was presented by dr duffield of detroit here is an extract resolved that we deeply deplore thd working of the whole system of american slavery interwoven as it is with the policy of tire slaveholding states and with tbe social and domestic life of their citizens and regarding it as in former years we have ex plicity stated to be fraught with sefious injury to the civil political intellectual and moral interests of society and le riding to much sin we declare it to be in all cases where the laws of the state the obligations ol guardianship and the demands of humanity do not render it unavoidable an offense in the proper import of that term as used in our book of discipline cnap sec d resolved that while we regard all cases in which the holding of slaves is sinful a matter for the exercise of such discipline as falls within the proper jurisdiction of the inferior chyrch courts of sessions yet as our constitution declares the exercise of discipline in such a manner as to edify the ciiurch requires not only much of the spirit of piety but also much prudence and discretion and therefore it becomes the rulera of the church to take into view all the circumstances which may give a different character to conduct and tender it more or less offensive and which may of course require a very different mode of proceeding in similar cases at different times for the attainment of the same end book of dis chap sec these obligations we cannot disrespect or violate without a breach of the covenant binding us in visible unity under the acknowledged authority of the book of discipline j that constitution prescribes the modes and processes of discipline so distinctly that any attempt at a summary withdrawal from fellowship or declarative condemnation legislative exscinding or censure pronounced in respect of particular synods presbyteries churches nr their members without a due and careful investigation of charges preferred and proof and guilt adduced conformably to its provisions as j ust as contrary to our covenant as it is repugnant to the obligations of christian courtesy the dictates of common justice and the positive precepts of the word of god the powers of the general assembly and of all inferior judicatures are carefully defined in our book of discipline to the church i session exclusively pertains the spiritual government of the congregation the power to inquire into the knowledge and christian conduct of the members of the church and consequently to judge of the qualifications for membership and to admit to the fellowship of the church the word god is in the law and the confession of faith with the lirger and the shorter catechism which sets forth our acknowledgement and covenant agreement as to what that word teaches is the accepted conventional aid to direct in the exercise of that judgement  d resolved that while the general assembly are constitutionally incompetent by legislative acts to exscind any of their synods presbyteries churches or members or to pronounce their condemnation of persons and churches except in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction or even to know the disciplinary action of inferior courts and the condition of the churches except as they may be particularly and officially informed they can only testify exhort and entreat with all longsuffering and gentlenessspeaking the truth in love and in the spirit of christ the minority report was presented by mr wisner of new york minority report a minority of the committee to whom waa referred a number of memorials on the subject of slavery from various synods presbyteries and churches within oar bounds beg i leave to report that after a careful and thorough examination of the whole subject they have been brought to the conclusion that in consideration of the previous action of the assembly had at different times for a series of years and what they believe to be its present sentiments and the expectation of the churches in its connection the cause of truth and right cousness of peace and unity will be best subserved by the adoption of the following re solutions resolved that we exceedingly deplore the working of the whole system of slavery as it exists in our country and is interwoven with the political institutions of the slaveholding states as fraught with many nd great evils to the civil political and moral interests of those regions where it exists that the holding ot our fellow men in bondage and treating them as chattels unless licensed by the civil laws and other circumstances over which the individual baa no control is an offense against god and the church which should be put upon a level with and be treated in the same manner as other offenses of the same magnitude that the sessions and presbyteries are by tbe constitution of our church the court or primary jurisdictions for tbe trial of offenses that after this declaration of sentiment the whole subject of slavery as it exist in the church be referred to the sessions and presbyteries to take such action thereon at in their judgement the lawa of christianity re tjuire lapnhmkit of colored seameo saikn with an african complexion who eater any of the porta of south carolina are by irtue of a law of that state arrested and imprined and to render

he subsequently pleaded guilty at the sessions of the offence charged in the indictment and was sentenced to two years in the state prison mr graham made application for an order that he be surrendered to mr thomas on the expiration of the sentence but the court refused to entertain the motion until after the expiration of the sentence alarge number of colored persons of both sexes hovered round the city hall a large portion of the day n y express th right of suffrage in ohio our colored fellow citizens in ohio have during the last two years made very spirited and commendable efforts to secure the right of franchise they have held conventions sent forth addresses passed resolutions and delivered lectures with a vie pose the public mind to their object and not without success for we have observed a marked change in the tone of the press of that state with respect to colored citizens which maybe traced rt to their own cfforts at vat ion if they fail of accomplishing their grrfnd object at this present constitutional convention as is likely to be the case they must not be discouraged but rather glory in continuing the struggle remembering the old proverb that they who shoot at the moon though they fail to hit it nevertheless shoot higher than those who aim at the earth we copy the following proceedings of the constitutional convention from the antislavery bugle f d among the resolutions adopted is one instructing the committee on the elective franchise to inquire into the expediency of engrafting a clause in the constitution more effectually to prevent the immigration and settlement of negroes and mulattoes within this state of course it took ademocrat to propose such a resolution its adoption shows the ruling spirit of the convention on the th inst mr cook of medina presented two memorials signed by about filty inhabitants of stark and portageone praying that the new constitution may secure to all the citizens of the state equal rights and privileges irrespective ot complexion or race and the other praying that the new constitution may accord to all the members of the commonwealth equal rights political and civil without regard to sex or color mr cook moved that these memorials be received read and referred to the committee on the elective franchise the redoubtable mr sawyer whether he is related to him of sausage memory we know not said i shall ferever object sir to every petition of the kind so far as the colored population are concerned i dont care if they prefer to let women vote and hold officethat dont disturb me laughter mr archibold said i began to see sir that we are likely to be considerably annoyed by petitions of this class ahd would suggest that we just as quitely as possible allow all these effusions f f ily and fanticisra to go to the table without debate or remark with the least possible notice mr townsend said he would be perfectly willing that these and all other petitions should be received and referred in the usual manner without discussion if gentlemen would u oppose or characterize them as effusions of folly and fanticism will they agree to this mr mitchell had serious doubts whether any petition proposing to class the negro population of ohio with reference to their rights and interests with our wives and daughters could be made in respectful language he would be very glad if gentlemen would suggest to their constituents the property of separating in their petitions and carefully distinguishing between these two objects he was opposed to combining them it is a pity that the people of ohio should not square their principles to suit the taste of mr mitchell mr holmes of hamilton inquired whether the signers of those petitions were white or colored his vote must depend on that he was unwilling to receive petitions from the colored portion of our population or even seem to entertain any disposition to receive them lest the fact might go abroad and encourage them to petition from all quarters of the state mr cook i believe that i am acquainted with nearly every individual signers of these memorialsand i believe they are ail white think i am not mistaken in that i will say however that it would make no difference with me in presenting these paperswhether their signers had been white or black judging from the tone of the remarks which have accompanied the presentation of these petitions am led to conclude that except i alter my democratic notions upon this subject i shall be found in a very lean minority here for i hnow of no one in the community so degraded whose respectful prayer i would not be willing to hear and know of no deliberate body with delegated powers so awfully dignified to whom i would not present such a peti tion the memorials were received and referred to the committe on the elective franchise on the th mr gray of lake offered a resolution that the constitution require the passage of laws prohibiting any officer connected with tne administration of justice in the state from aiding in the arrest or detention ol any person claimed as a fugitive from slavery or involuntary service mr sawyer demanded the ayes and noes on this resolution he wanted to see whether the convention was willing to have a provision incorporated in the new constitution in palpable violation of the constitution of the united states mr swan moved to lay the resolution on the table which was carried a resolution offered by mr hunter of ashtabula proposing to insert a clause in the bill of rights declaring that life shall never be taken for any crime whatever and that imprisonment for life shall be the highest punishment inflicted in any case was referred to the judiciary committee we have condensed the above frun the ohio standard

perseverance which no bodily suffering has overcome not as an abolitionist then but as the friend of human rights as one determined to struggle to the last for a free press and free lips let me thank you for the stand thus far maintained in may after such an exhibition of the despotism of the new york mob we need not be surprised to know that the offices of her city government have been long abandoned tu men who could be hiredthe retainers of any mean enough to purchase a conscience a negro man and a halfnegro whose generous blood a miserable anglo saxon streak has not been able to pale have spoken to this new york mob and have conquered it in spite othe press the link between man and the monkey has been finally snapped the last six months have been rich ic antfslavery fruit and

sorrowed over a noble wreck it was hoped by many doubtless that he would find some noble excuse foi our fathers compromise with sin and death but had he you must have lost the ground that we must either enter such a compromise or protest against our unholy union but wm lloyd garrison and the great expounder read the constitution alike trust that every american will read his late speech and

let men and angels grieve over our national loss but rejoice over such antislavery gain i agree with you in thinking that the antislavery cause is a gospel of itself and contends against the same foes as the gospel in judea one bitter likeness we may all deplore among the primitive christians a mans foes were they of his own household so are they now ido not mean that antislavery feeling creates family discord but simply that tbe subject being of such importance that no man can dodgr it brings out into the light those differing degrees of conscientiousness which make it sorrowful work sometimes to abide with those we love whether of the family or the nation may god give us strength to endure every national and every individual test until the end be come may we watch and pray ceaselessly for thoss we love but first of all for that love of truth which is tbe love of god may this expression of sympath strengthen the right cause use it and ine always and allwbere in behalf of
