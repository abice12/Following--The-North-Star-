tbe senate proceeded to the unfinished business being the resolutions from the general assembly of the state of vermont which were presented on wednesday last by mr upham mr chase lt was not my purpose mr president nor is it my purpose now to go into any discussion upon this motion to print the resolutions from the state of vermont if i understand the general sentiments of senators there isa disposition to acquiesce in the motion to print with very few dissenting voices i rejoice sir for one that the precedent set in the case of vermont some ten years ago is now to be reversed and that the memorials and resolutions of the states of this confederacy are tobe received and taken in the ordinary course no matter what may be the subject of those memorials or resolutions i should be glad sir if i could state that thffre appeared to be a similar disposition in regard not merely to the memorials of sovereign states but to the petitions of the sovereign people but i understand sir that a practice prevails hereand i must be permitted to say that in my judgment it is a practice more honored in the breach than in the observancewhen a petition from individuals is presented to move the question of reception upon it aud to lay that question of reception upon the table i trust sir that that practice will also be discontinued for one i accord entirely with the senators from south carolina when they say that it is better far better for the people of this country that they should understand distinctly what are the sentiments of the respective states and not merely of the states but of the people who make the states which compose this confederacy let it be understood what the positions upon all sides are let us understand each other distinctly and then we shall have the best possible opportunity when the positions upon all sides are clearly and distinctly understood to compare those respective positions and if possible arrive at an amicable solution of the difficulties that exist but sir i may be permitted to say that in my judgment the path to an amicable solution of the difficulty does not lie through criminations and recriminations it does not lie through denunciations upon one side and upon the other side and i inay be permitted to suggest to my friend the senator from arkansas whether anything is to be gained ina comparison between the application of the terms crime and criminals on the one side and the application ol the epithets robber and assassin upon the other sir we gain nothing in this way let us define our positions with candor with fairness with clearness and with precision and then understanding each other we shall be able to determine what course becomes us as senators and what course it becomes the states ns sovereignties to pursue mr president i may be permitted to say and i think it due to the state which i in part represent here to say that oo menace of disunion no resolves tending towards disunion no intimations of the probability disunion in any form will move us from the path which in our judgment it is due to ourselves and the people whom we represent to pursue everything of that sort has lost us terror at least i trust it has trust that no man hereafter is to be moved from the course which in hi judgment and his conscience hs due le the state and the people whom be right is of no sextruth is ofjio color represents to pursue i trust thot no mao is to be moved from that deliberate coarse by any threat or by any resolve from whatever quarter i trust we shall pursue a path of rectitude with entire respect for all the people of all the states and for every state of the whole union but having determined upon what that path shall be i trust we shall not be deterred from pursuing u by any intimidation of any kind or of this character particularly mr president we have had it intimated in this debate that the states of the south have had some reason to complain of the course which has been pursued now sir what is there in our past histoy or in our present history which justifies that complaint let it be calmly considered deliberately considered and then let me again press the inquiry what is there in our past or present history to justify that complaint have any states of the south mr president lacked their full proportion of all the honors of this confederacy have they not had their full proportion at least of all the power of this confederacy do they not at this moment in this hall and in the other hall exercise all the power to say the least of it which to them legitimately belongs why sir who presides in the other hall r how have your committees been consummated here under what influence have they been constituted and with what purpose have the committees been constituted here have they not been so constituted mr president as to meet the claims and the extremest claims of the gentlemen who represent the southern states of inis union has it not been held here to be a disqualification as chairman of a committee that the distinguished senator even of a clave state should maintain wbat in his judgment was due to the people of the whole confederacy ih reference to this subject and has it not been held also to be a disqualification to other senators that they maintain sentiments which are common to the people of their entire states in reference to this question of slavery why mr president for my own part i may be permitted to say that in political sentiment i accord fully with that party which is known as the free democracy of the united states a party which is sometimes sectional but which i trust wiu not remain forever sectional and which had during the last canvass if i may be permitted to allude to it nnt merely friends in the ponslaveholdiog states in this union but friends in many of the slaveholding states alsonot organizations but friends and in some of the states organizations also i will add further sir as it is known to be my position that i stand ready and willing to cooperate with that party which is known as the democracy of this country whenever that party takes such ground on the subject of slavery as accords with the principles of the ordinance of well sir now let us compare the positions held with reference to this very question which is exciting debate and attention here now do i understand the senators of the south as saying that they are prepared to act with the democracy of this country if the democracy of this country take ground in favor of freedom do they not make it the test of their adherence to the party that the party shall respect what in their judgment are their legitimate claims most unquestionably that test is made then sir is it not legitimate that a senator holding just as strongly opinions in favor of freedom as they hold in favor of slavery that be should require that the party which is to command his cooperation and his suffrages should take the ground which in his judgment he can reconcile to his own conscience if it be so mr president in what position do we stand here that tests may be made up on one side without exclusion from the partys confidence and the partys respect but tests shall not be made on the other side but if made in favor of freedom they shall be ground for such i exclusion well mr president i refer to this matter simply as showing that there is nothing to complain of so far as this house so far as the other house sofar as present arrangements are concerned what can be complained of in the future what in expected why sir it is apprehended that the congress of the united states may adopt the prin jciples of the ordinance of and concurred in by the unanimous assent of all the states represented in the congress of the confederation in their application not to territory which was l slave territory as the territory northwest of the river ohio is claimed to be i but territory which is now free that is one of the grounds of apprehension i another ground of apprehension ia r tbat the congress of the united states may determine in their judgment that it is proper to apply the principles of free dona proper tu apply the principles ol law to the question of slavery in the district of columbia it is apprehended that the influence and power of this government may be placed upon the side of freedom woll air what if it should be was that not the precise i object which was marked out by the framers of the constitution was it i not the precise object which was mark i ed out by those who concurred in ea tabiiahing the ordinance of but we are told that if that crisis arises it i must be met by the south the seua tor from south carolina tells us bef trusts in the event that congress should adopt any measure of this east that the i south will meet the crisis as it ought well sir i must say that i concur m that hope and how mr president ought such n crisis to be met ought it to be met in n spirit of disunion or ought it to be met in tne spirit which governed the deliberations of those who framed the constitution ought it tobe met in the jpirit of those who framed the ordinance cf that spirit which was then universal in this countrythe spirit which animated the breast of every gentleman who had a seat in the cong res of the confederation at that time mr president trust for oneand it is all that i have to toy on this sub jectthat whenever this crisis arisip fit will be met in the spirit of the fathers of the republic ana if it be so met rely upon it mr president there will beno cause for apprehension but on the contrary the union will be cemented and the example of this union will be made wbat the fathers of the republic designed it should be made an example of freedom to the nations of the earth mr clemens next addressed the senate at some length the report of his remarks is deferred at his request mr hale i do not intend to occupy the time of the senate but briefly but as matters of a private character wi require my absence from the senate for a few days i will say a few words in reference to some of the remarks made by the senator from alabama mr clemens if he has done nothing else be has at least by bis remarks convinced me of one fact and that is that concession never satisfies fanaticism i wish every senator frrm every iree state would take up that remark as a text and tell the timid the doubtful and the wavering at the north that concession never satisfies fanaticism i thank the senator for that i hope the north will find it out they have felt it ever since the adoption of the constitution but they do not seem to have practically learned it although they are beginning to do it there was another remark made by the senator which struck me as somewhat peculiar aud i must say it gratified me there are many timid people at the north who have looked forward with excited nerves and trembling fears at the wreck of matter and the crash of worlds which they have believed would be the result of the dissolution ol this union i think they will be exceedingly quiet now when they find out that it has already taken place and they did not know it laughter for the honorable senator from alabama tells us it is already dissolved if it is not a matter too serious for a pleasant illustration let me give you one once in my life in the capacity ola justice of the peacefor held that office before i was a senator laughter i was called on to officiate in uniting a couple in the bonds of matrimony they came up and i made short work of it i asked the man if he would take the woman whom he held by the band to be hjs wedded wife he replied to be aure i will i came here to do that very thing i then put the question to the lady whether she would have the man for her hdsband and when she answered in the affirmative i told them they were man and wife then she looked up with apparent astonishment and inquired is that all yes said i that is all well said she it is not such a mighty affair as i expected it to be after all laughter if this union is already dissolved it has produced less commotion in the act than expected the honorable senator says that he speaks for the whole south i remember once hearing a senator say on this floor that there was not anybody here who had a right to speak for the whole south it is a pretty large section of country comprising fifteen states and he would not recognize the right of anyone man to speak for fifteen states do not claim the right to speak for the whole north or any considerable part of itonly for a very small portion of it but it lies a good ways north and fwant to say a word with regard to a remark which fell from the lips ol the honorable senator which i have often heard before but have never taken the trouble to answer here and i would not attempt to answer it now for any effect it might have at home but sitting in silence here and permitting this remark to pass ijnanswered and unnoticed it may be supposed that there is some justice in it i the honorable senator spoke of the mechanical population the operatives in the factories of the northern states as slaves and it is not a new remark i here i have heard it in private con vernations and i have been very kindly told by individuals who professed to have and had no doubt a real and earnest desire to give roa instruction on the subject that our factory population would not bear a comparison not only in the amount of physical and animal comfort they enjoyedbut in intelligence i and good breeding with their southern i slaves have had that information given me by gentlemen members of this body in private conversation and rei marks of that character are eo frequent i ly made that it certainly becomes mei living in one of the villages composed of thin population thus denounced and vil lified to say a tingle word not in vindication but in illustration of the character and position of that much misunderstood and misrepresented class of our population and sir my honorable colleague sitting on the other side of the chamber mr norris lived in a village constituted end now mdse i n one of j the largest and most flourishing villages rochester n y friday january  legrity in any i wish him to rise in his place and set the senate right the village in which i live has about a thousand female operatives employed hi manufacturing eßabltijfmaciifs in that village there are a n man other of thoee villages bi snks for savings and the amounts deposited there exceed and uiunkl will be justified in saying that more than oeehalf of the whole sum is depend kv these very slaves as they as called and who are they theyardyn a great meas sons living remote from the places where the factories are located and when poverty or disease or death or misfortune in any shape visits the homesteads of these families when palsy seizes upon the frame of the aged or calamity in any form comes as a visitation from providence these young women leaving their homes where they were born and nurtured come down to these villages and by industry economy and prudence generally succeed in making quiet and happy and comfortable the declining years of those parents they have left behind i will do them the credit hereto say that i do not believe search the country through from the aroostook to our southern boundary that you can find in any class of society i do not care who they are or bow worthy elevated and cultivated they may be an equal number of females of purer moral deportment higher intellectual cultivation or who better understand all the duties belonging to private and social life and the domestic relations than these same muchabused factory girls the character of the male population is equally worthy they are industrious prudent thriving intelligent educated and moral they are the pride and glory of new england i would like to have any man i do not care who heis chivalric bold and intellectual ashe may be go into one of these factory villages and teli that population they are slaves i am willing to compare this papulation with the population of the south leaving the slaves out of the comparison altogether and taking the masters and then see on which side ol the scale the intellect the intelligence and all the virtues which adorn the human character will be found sir il it would not be found on tbc side ol these factory operatives you would have to produce a higher standard liijmi has fallen under ray observation anywhere north or south i de not say this to court popularity for i think if i have not preyed anything else i have proved that i am nota great worshipper of that i take occasion to say that i do not know a population anywhere north or suuth against whom charges of this character might not be brought with equal justice as against the manufacturing population of new england there never w as a people more misunderstood than they who have been compared by the honorable senator to the slaves in those states where that institution is tolerated i have said enough of them sir with one other remark i leave the subject the honorable senator from alabama says we have clubs and societies in the north which issue pamphlets and send out lecturers to preach murder to the filaves and to instigate them to violate the wives and daughters of the slaveholders sir i have been somewhat conversant with the movements of the antislavery society of the northern part of the country if ever the first letter of that character has been printed in any northern state i must say that it has escaped my observation ido not stand here as the advocate of any of these organizations ido uot belong to them but i do not say this to avoid responsibility but speak of it as a matter of fact have never known a single society large qi small male or female composed of men women or children who have not utterly disclaimed everything of that kind and that have not put forth a solemn warning to everybody that had anything to do with them that they should not preach insurrection to the slaves on the other hand they have invariably been instructed to teach thtn to refrain from everything like violence aod that it ia their duty to bow with meekness and submission to a power which they cannot resist and to put forth all their energies and efforts in sending up from their degradation and misery tbeir supplications to him who has avowed himself to be the god of the oppressed i have never seen such a publication as thatnever i have never heard such a sentiment advanced in any public assembly or stich a prayer offered up from any pulpit but on the contrary a different course of conduct is universally inculcated so far as have any knowledge of the matter and if there be such associations as the senator has spokfen of i know nothing of them he has a much more intimate knowledge of what i going on in the northern states if he i advised that what he speaks qf j tru than i have having said thus much i will leave the subject i do not propose again to go into tbe question of the dissolution oftbe union but i do join in the wish and hope expressed by tho senator from ohio mr chase that gentlemen wifi come out and let us know what they want and having tom us that concession will not satisfy fanaticism treat that no more concession will be asked for let us understand what wa want and then if rjrtmm r rsnurr nr god is the father of us all and all we are brethren jr a iw cannot aim to unite let u agree to differ rift btrrleal bad no idea flaking any part in this debate except s far as to suggest the propriety of printing the resolutions intending to take another occasion to discuss the topics which bare been brought under discussion in this unexpected debate bnt sir the gentleman from vermont the other day indulged in a very wide range of debate so far as regards one of tm be thought proper to bring wihin the scope of bis remarks he hamssed all the doctrines connected with the organization f territorial government and uttered many sentiments well calculated to arrest atten tioneuch as seemed to provoke a reply tke gentleman frem ohio this morning in a somewhat prepared effort think he come forward and has avowed doctrines which in their tendency and operation cannot be disguised and sir while he has admonished us to cultivate harmony and while he and cithers have given us homilies on the value of this union he has avowed sentiments and not only on this occasion but on others has inculcated doctrines which will sow broadcast the seed of discordsuch as make odious and arrogant distinctions between different sections of this confederacy his docj trines would seem aim at the disfranchisement of the southern section of the union both through the action of the federal legislature and under the organization of parties it is not mere sentiment but a scheme that lie insists on to carry eut his plans of operation he presumes on an increasing majority in the north and a minority in the south as shall show by his expressed sentiments cannot therefore allow him to preach decent moderation when know he has with others ultimate designsdesigns which i will not allow him to disguise under the forms and professions of moderation he avows openly that he will submit to no compromise and will assimilate to no party that will pot recognize as a basis the freesoil principles in other words to form a party to be known as free democracya party that puts under the ban slaveholders as tainted partners in the association he speaks of the south as having held the offices of the confederacy and he avows doctrines that will hereafter by way of re tfiliation disfranchise them in the future unless they shall come to terms tobe prescribed on the basis which he has taken for party organization i have now a letter before me which i shall have occasion to refer to hy way of verifying all that have said a letter in which he openly avows his relianee on the minority of southern interests and according to my view on southern defection what he calls desertiou i would call treason his selfsustaining numerical strength suspect is t the bottom of his sublime political morality he aims at certainty on the disposition of submission by the south to the doctrines which he has avowed confidence has been inspired by the desire of the south to preserve the union and its past history somewhat sanctiooe the assumption sumnted up in a few words he calculates upon the unconditional submission of one aection in submitting to the organization of parties to be made exclusively by another section with kind and gentle allowances however for desertion from the southern ranks for the sake of the prizes of office but sir for fear might do the honorable gentlemen injustice will before i sit down read extracts from a letter which seems to have beep prepared by him with the cere of one avowing a sofeqin creed it is a creed that soars to fhe heavens in its doctrines bnt looks to the earth for its rewards philanthropy prescribes the latitude of its boundaries whilst selfishness contracts the serpe of its operation philanthropy whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere but whose practice is to be found in the sordid appropriation of office property allow me to say that i am naturalist enough to know that it is not the purest bird that flies the highest it is said of the condor that it alights in the atmosphere of the snowcapped andes and yet is it not true that it is a bird that lives upon the corruption of the earth these gentlemen who are so sublime in their morality when they descend from the elevation which their theory aspires to to the practical application of their doctrines are ready to deprive us of the soil that has been won by the common blood and common treasure of the countryare ready to appropiale to themselves the offices and their emoluments under the organization of parties and under the constitution of the united states thiiure which ought to be left open to all even federal eligibility to office has been assailed if it should be claimed by n southern man sir they go farther and tell you in so many words that acquiescence in their proposition will not satisfy them for that was the true import of the language of the senator from new hampshire he says that concessions that have taken place swell the spirit of fanaticism that it has an idea excellence which will not compromise with sny thing but the sublimity of an unlimited morality they ere to attain this point hy progressive aggression and to hold those who defend their rights ai responsible for the union those who have done the wrong have snll jutu h never assailed the union thev have cherished it and made au the compro si mines to preserve it and i my nowthe northern gentlemen hold the acts son of its rite in then own hands i they can oleee them on the cords orthis union by going on n their reckless aggression or stay their hand andi do justice they are the moving parties and in jupiter stator they may find a deity worthy of worship but it they go on they may presume too j much on the arts of mercury the j course which has been advertised is r rebuking commentary on southern ae quiescence in wrongful aggression those who have been guilty of the g wrong shall net hold liable for the conseqrences nor shall they assign mea position to the issues which they have made if they have brought the union in jeopardy they shall not throw the odium of disunionists on the defending and innocent party politicians have played with this subject as an element of political game and that game shall have the true parties to it i say it now and with perfect sincerity and candor that the people of the state which i represent and the i people of the southern states in gen oral have never taken measures thus f far with the view or wish that they should result in disunion igo further and say that their acquiescence in compromise is a refutation of the charges that have been made against them i what compromise that did not require a sacrifice of right and honor has not been aceeded to on the part of the south what compromise that she entered into has she violated these are questions that may be obviated by evasion or denunciation of a selfsus taining majority but honesty will only answer them before the tribunal of history the past cannot be changed and it will go to show that the south has made sacrifices to form the union and has submitted to unequal compromises to preserve it the north has presumed on tnat love of union to sanction their aggressive and arrogant pretensions no sir the history of the confederacy and especially the history of this question will show a degree of submission to compromise that astonishes me in the review of it i shall not go further than to speak of the history of this question wish my connexion with it the true element which has formed the basis of their course will the gentleman inform me what measure of compromise has ever been proposed to us if it were an honorable and just compromise that has been rejected b us when it was proposed to extend the missouri compromise to the pacific by whom was that proposition made it was made by one side and promptly and even scornfully rejected by the other it was refused even with the wantonness of rejection it was refused on the assumption that some of our own men would join in the repudiation by implication that compromise has been supposed to give to the south in all territories south of entire control whilst it in terms excluded slavery north of that line it recognised the right that it should exist if the people thought proper south of that line experience has shown that the temptation to disregard it depended on the power of doing so on a minority made so by its operation it has served the office of taking power from the south and placing it in the hands of those who have not magnanimity and justice to observe its obligations it has been but a dam of sand that has given way to the tide of insolent power when the questions growing out of a proposition to give governments to our mexican acquisitions assumed a critical aspect an honorable effort without regard to sections was made to settle them forever and to take them out of the arena of political gamesters that effort resulted in the clayton bill it was framed to save the honor of the south many thought her rights were not secure under it i will not state its terms it proposed an honorable compromise withoutimproper concession what baa been its fate the south generally acquiesced in it and i solemnly believe for the sake of the union does this look like a desire or design to dissolve this confederacy no sir it was anything else it was a sacrifice to the very name of the union it provoked a confidence that may be fatal i fear it has given rise to a delusion that there are no limits to which the north may not go another bill was brought in by the honorable senator from wisconsin well guarded in its provisions in relations to new mexico and california proposing merely to put it in the power of the courts by writs of habeas cor pu t to test the legality of the title by which slaves are held it wm assumed on that occasion that it conceded too much to the south and gave them the advantage in the issue was not that going far in the spirit of compromise could anything more strangely show the wantonness of nonslaveholdtng arrogance that was set aside anda clause with a snare under it was insisted on hy northern gentlemen as giving all that would settle the question in other words a clause to cover the wilmot proviso sir the compromises have all been one wayinto tke lions dennulla vestigia retrorsut but i shall go further and say we have violated none of the compromises into which we have entered whilst we have rejected none that have been offered to as on honorable terms is this not a proposition full of meaning it may be that tke cup of conciliation is exhausted i shall say nothing of that x will not utter menace nor will i indicate the end of this whole no  fearfiri question we have acceded to all that would preserve oug honoria every compromise that banoeen pw posed indeed we have evfoced a desire to let this question pam by oni a point of honoa and w ffentlemea come out and accuse thoee fso have maintained those compromises and l manifested a desire to bright of a de sign to sevtt the union oh yes we are the people they my who have shown a disposition to sever the different portions of this union itis tke wolf taking offence at the lamb because he contradicted him in saying he bad net mudded the water in drink ting below him the smith at tba time of the formation of thin confederacy made sacrifices and deprived herself of the scep tre j she petted with the sceptre when she consented to the formation of this union when she gave up to the north the power of regulating commerce by a mere majority but i shall go no further into the history ef thin matter at present i shall check myself so far as the tendency of this argument is concerned but i have much to say on it and i go back to the honorable senator from ohio the gentleman from ohio is a senator he represents in part one of the largest states in the confederacy and sir his opinions are to be respected lam mtisfied that he like many others acts nnder the pressure of an ex parte constituency they are exponents of those who have never looked except upon one aide of this question many who come here are committed exponents of irresponsible masses they are facile aad publican politicians who feel tbemselvea bound to the law of obedience they act ina channel that popular prejudice and irresponsible persons have made for them and yet they talk of slavery they get their places her by slavish submission they violate tba constitution before they come here hy vowson an unconstitutional altar at for any effect that might be produced by mere speaking would much rather address the people than their representatives the people have no temptation to do what is wrong they might he affected by a dispassionate appeal to their judgments at least they could be approached as a tribunal that could review its judgments they could have no interest to maintain an adversary position where trom feeling and duty they might wish to become friends politicians will play with topics as a tart ol a game which the people would shrink from with horror could they see the consequences i think it may be safely mid that those who yield most to transient popular prejudice and indulge in habitual expressions of love to the people would betray them soonest if there were an adequate temptation an accomodat ing spirit is generally associated witha facility in morality there are occasions on which i might expect statesmen and patriots to elevate themselves above those irresponsible influences but the day has passed am afraid when such men are to be found and in making this statement will not tear away one leaf from the history of the north i will not deprive the north of an iota of credit that is her due the past is secure and i speak of it only in an historical point of view but i will not sit here and hear doctrines expressed which in their consequences roust degrade a portion of the confederacy and deprive posterity of the rights which we have ourselves inherited i will ask the secretary to read a fitter of the senator from ohio because as have attributed to it an influence the letter itself will furnish the evidence upon which i have based it the secretary read as follows cincinnati mr dear sir i observe indications in various quarters of a disposition on the part of influential gentlemen to in terpoea difficulties in the way of cordial union between the free democracy and the old line democracy by insisting on conditions to which the latter cannot agree without the sacrifice of principles which they hold far dearer than party success the free democracy holding in com mou with the old line democracy the cardinal and eslfentiai doctrines of the democratic faith believe that the time has come for the application of thoee doctrines to the subject of slavery aswell as to the subjects of currency and trade tbey believe that slavery is the worst form of despotism the ownership of one man by another is the most absolute subjection known to human experience no democrat who has any real lining faith in the great cardinal doctrine of democracy that all men have equal rights by nature and that the only legitimate object of government is fe maintain and secure these rights oan doubt that alavebold ing is grossly inconsistent with democratic principles heretofore the slave power was content with retaining slave territory ea slave territory now it seeks to subject free territory to the blight of slavery this enormous pretension baa led to a more general examination of the constitutional relations of the national government to the slave system and the examination has fastened the con motion on the minds of thousands and hundreds of thousands that the government of the union ia hound to prohibit slavery tn the territories and to exert all ha legitimate and constitutor pwers to limit jocalizs and discourage it and especially to pro the sphere of its exclusive jurisdiction this is the conviction of free democracy they have announced it over and over again and are pledged to govern their political action by it this pledge they will undoubtedly redeem now t what is to hinder the reception of this faith by the oldline democracy what shall prevent their bold and frank avowal of it what should interfere with manly and straightforward action in consistency with it i can see but one thingthe alliance so called with the slaveholders them selvesthe fear of losing their political support and influence in a presidential lection now it is very certain that no consideration of mere political expediency ought to induce the democracy to refrain from carrying out its own principles and it seems to me equally certain that political expediency and duty at this time coincide for what will be the cost to the democracy of the alliance of the slaveholders in a presidential campaign to determine this question it must first be seen what the slaveholders demand as the price of their alliance this demand is easily stated it is nonintervention upon the subject of slavery that is northern men may think and act at home as they choose and southern men likewise but when northern men and southern men meet at washington either in executive or legislative capacities they must not take any action against slavery but leave the slaveholders at liberty to introduce slaveholding wherever they can this if i understand it is the ground of the washington union which has been approved by a number of democratic prints in the tree states and universally i believe as well it might bein the slave states now it is my deliberate opinion that it is utterly impracticable to unite the democracy on this platform in the free states the free democracy can never accede to it and maintaining as they do the cardinal doctrines of democracy and occupying as they will a bold and independent position on the lavery question and every other the people who love boldness and independence will rally around them in such numbers that it will be uuerly impossible for compromising democracy to carry a respectable number of the free states and they must as heretofore divide the free slates with compromising wbiggiem success therefore on the nonintervention platform is for the old ueraocra cy quite out of the question the free democracy believe in nonintervention auch as the constitution requires noninvention by congress with the legislation of the states on the subject of slavery but neither the history of the country nor the constitution of the country warrants nonintervention by congress with slavery in erri toriea and elsewhere without the limits ol any state but within the exclusive jurisdiction of the national government slavery in auch territory or places cannot under a stricl construction of the constitution exist at all slavery in such territory or places ought ai least to be prohibited by congress i have regretted to see certain expression attributed to john van buren calculated tc revive unpleasant feelingssuch as that the national democratic party is in progress of re generationin progress obeying that law ol progress which all ita doctrines recognize iron the old platform of nonintervention to the jet fersonian platform of slavery reslrictio anc discouragement it seems to me that th party io the free states ought at once to ad vauce to the jeffersonian ground and then unite in indissoluble phalaux wiih their brethren of the free democracy let the party ir tbe lave states advance to the same ground pi haps in advancing some may deser and go over to the conservatives possiblj in the slave states the party must go into i temporary minority let it be so the compensation will be found in the concentration unanimity the invincibility of the united democracy in the free states triumphant in tht free states and strong by the strength o principles even in the slave stales the democracy can elect its national candidates under auch circumstances in despite of all op position such are my views i feel a strong confidence that time will prove their correctness i am a democrat unreservedly and i fee earnestly bohcitous for the success of the democratic organization and the triumph ol its principles the doctrines of the democracy on the subjects of trade currency and special privileges command the entire assent of my judgement but i cannot while boldly asserting their principles in reference uj these subjects shrink from their just application to slavery i should feel guilty of shameful dereliction of duty if did you know what multitudes now sympathise with me aod bow truly it is this very fidelity tt democratic principles which makes it impossible for them to compromise with slavery what a melancholy spectacle it would b to see the democratic patty embracing defeal by auch a compromise and thus making it necessary for hundreds of thousands of the truest democrats in the land to choose between adhesion to party and adhesion tc principle the counsels of the washington union tend to this and in my judgement cannot be safely followed i shall be very glad to hear from you on this subject and meanwhile remain truly your friend s p chase j g bseslin esq mr butler now sir who ate in favor ef union and who of disunion according tc the sentiments there expressed the gentleman says it makes a sectional party in the programe of his party organization the basis of his party is to proscribe the south or to presume on desertion and treason its minority is the predicate of his whole sage superstructure of party organization this is the emanation of the newlight politicians who would throw into the shade of their contrast the statesmen who have preceded tbem those who go over to them are of the true faith whilst those who adhere to their ancient privileges and constitutional positions are called deserters sir the southern man who goes over on this question will be regarded as a traitorous criminal who has even up hit constituents for lucre the mthhasits peculiar institution and it the duty of her representatives to defend it to tire last extremityit is the defence of our firesides if i were to apply a meaning to the language used by the gentleman it would be very different from that which he has given oh yes these gentleroeu who are for taking care of our slaves who express so much sympathy for them who are for universal emancipation and who cannot listen to any proposition which falls short of what thev in their visionary conceptions suppose will eventuate in the freedom of the whole human race when applied to on the part of emancipated slaves deny them soil upon which to rest the soles of their feet they preach to the slave his right of rebellion against his roaster so long as he can holdout to him the means of running away they are ready and willing to countenance him but when they become free we find on the part of those gentlemen a hostility equal to the jove they professed when john randolph a distinguished citizen of virginiathat state which gave to the gentlemans stale its existence with that ordmanoe which has been said to have been dictated by the very spirit of freedom whilst in consequence it has been pregnant with mischief mr randolph gave freedom to his laves imagining that they week easily find piece of refuge in territory made free by virginia aed what was the fact they were driven out of ohio at the point of the bayonet but sir if they had gone into the state ss fugitive from their master in violation of the masters rights they would readily hare found a home mr chase will the gentleman allow me to correct him as to a matter of fact hie emancipated slaeee of mr randolph are at this day living in ohio ohio desires a homogeneous population and does not desirea population of varied character but she drives no person from her territory at the point of the bayonet or otherwise mr butler when the emancipated slaves of randolph first entered ohio they were not permitted to remain there has been some alteration made since i believe in the laws of ohio whether they are now iu that state i cannot say am merely s t ting an historical fact that they were not allowed to remain upon first entering the state the gentleman cannot change the dtnte of the case by his acsertion and he need not attempt to distort the facta because know the history to be as have stated yea air they have proposed snd voted for mr hunter will my friend allow me to set him right in regard to this matter  unueiatand that the executor of mr ran dolphs state paid nine thousand dollars for a farm for these emancipated blacks in ohio and when they went to take possession they weiti driven off by men armed with guns and pisijjs and never permitted to settle upon the land that had thus been purchased for them mr butler thank my friend for this statement it is a consuming refutation ol what the gentleman has asserted they reached ohio only under the garb of being servants they claimed their civil rights by appearing to be slaves to those who denounct slavery c i believe that the only way t be received favorably in ohio is for a man u represent himself as a runaway slave ir their wondrous philantbicpy they give then protection if they represent themselves at runaway slaves but the gentleman fronr vnginia has given you the true history of thii matter and do not stand corrected by any explanation that the gentleman from ohio hai given but i was about to allude to the views o gentlemen in regard to california and i ahal have occasion to speak of that hereafter have no doubt they suppose that slaveholder are to be prohibited from carrying their property there and herhaps that blacks will b excluded altogether will put the queatioi to those who propose this sublime doctrine i will put it to the gentleman from nev hampshire and i believe he ia at least candid i will do him the justice to say thisif th south send ten thousand slaves tomorrow ta free state with a view to make them free shall we not be permitted to do so i do no believe the gentleman can answer the question there ib not sir a nonslaveholdinj state in the union that would receive ou slaves if we chose to send them there i myself have had an agency in sendioj some free people of color to ohio and the were better oilunder a tolerated existence ii south carolina where their rights woul not have been invaded by vulgar ribaldry than in a situation in which they feel all th effects of exclusionwhere freedom is talke of and where privilege is deniedwere philanthropy in profession covers oppression it is the interference of these pseudophil anthropists which has prevented the master and mistresses of the slaves from setting ther free we cannot do it now air for we cac not send them into those states where th institution does not exist nor can we a cording to the doctrii e of these gentlemer send thm to california or new mexict why air if they were to go into any fie stale do you suppose they would be tolert ted what ia to become of these people i favor of whom there have been such sublim sermons preached whose condition is th subject of such sublime solicitude thos gentlemen have taken the blacks under the espeeial care baneful influences are exerte over them to make them dissatisfied with th condition in which they are placed whik there is no substantial mode pointed out t better their condition the slave unde such influences is made a rebel against hi master only that he may become an outcai and a pauper in the midst of hia professe friends but in fact real enemies incendiar publications are disseminated among then and with a view seduce them from thei fidelity why the very speeches whic gentlemen make on this floor i pay for i part uuder the post office arrangements ii sending them to my state that they may b disseminated and read by or to the blacks those speeches by which they are to be ren deted dissatisfied with their condition hare no right to quote from the speech of a honorable gentleman who declared to m once that you cannot better the condition c the slaves as a mass if the relation of tnasie and slave could be dissolved tomorrow yoi cannot give them the rights of freemen th j free states have refused it i speak of penn syivania particularly i do not know hot j far the remark will apply to the other state you give them but the name of freedom bu none of us fruits the condition of the slav could not be bettered but the gentlema has denied that the free states ate by club and associations making efforts to affect th condition of the slave and his master hot do so many printed pamphlets find their ws in the slave states how have these incendiary publications found their way into soutl carolina bundles of them bae been foun in our post offices one individual has bee indicted but i forbesi alluding to his case as i wouid not control the administration o justice but sir iu the case alluded to the i reason to suppose that a combination ha been formed to pioduce a revolution in soutl carolina on the slave question the pamphlets are now to be found with an aim tha cannot be mistaken they ate incendiar publications in every sens of the word aui written ftom the woesi of motives there iia gentleman mt babbit who has gone ti south carolina and there was found in hi possession large quantities of pamphlets ant other documents which were calculated ti produce a revolution in the south hi stated that he did not design their diasemina tion but there they are in the poet office liki a torch near a powder magazine at this day mr hale were they addressed to wbitei or blacks mr butler they were addressed suppose to some of your whiteswhitei who think like yourself that is the bes answer i can make mr hale then there are some person of my way of thinking at the south mr butler yes there are some whi travel from your pait of the country ant who having been fostered by our hospitality have basely taken advantage of us and com mittled treason against our institutions it ii certain that these papers are sent there witl a view to be used do not know whethe babbit is guilty or not shall make nt charge the gentleman has declared that be is no aware that any persons are associated foi the purpose of modiog these document indeed i am happy to bear that he does not but such documents are to be found and am sorry to believe that some of these documents have been actually written by some o those persona who have removed from thi south to ohio that they do write suet documents under the sanction of an aaaocia tion i have no hesitation in saying tin purpose and purport of the whole thing is these men travel about under the ostensibh calling of selling drugs that these miechiev oua documents shall be disseminated and am sure the gentleman must regard them ai mischievous if be believes what be says foi be save that he is opposed to interference am yet air there is interference continually i had no idea of taking up the time of the senate but when i saw the gentleman ffotr ohio rise bets ie his phum and preach bar mooy ttd under dm garb of moderation cloak bis real feelings i could not refrain from making an exposure ofhis true attitude to the issues involved in the discussion i shall not say here what the south will do the honor aud interests of these states will be safe now in their own keeping mr dav of mississippi mr president ido not know that i should have said anything upon this occasion but for the tact that tha senator from new hampshire mr hale has made severs points and announced them in connection with the isot that be is about to be absent from the senate his speech wss quite in keeping sir with many of the acts i have witnessed on the pair of that senator it was characteristic with him to make a speech upon this subject just before he wss to leave the senate that he rosy avail himself of it as i suppose in the region he is about to visit as food for agitation and as evidence of bis prowess upon the floor on this occasion he has taken as his theme the defence of the factory laborerthe intellectual cultivation and excellent morality of hia cooatituenta and in otdor to produce conviction i thought it exceeding well quite prudent i will not anyhow necessary that he should announce thai it was his colleague and not himself who dwelt among and was to be regarded as ih representative of so praiseworthy a population so high in the scale ot humanity so moral so intelligent and proper in ail things i thought it well sir that it was hia colleague whom the honorable senator located in tha midst of such superioi samples of humanity mr hale will the honorable senator permit me to interrupt him i mated that my colleague resided in one manufacturing village of the kind i have described and that i reside myself in another of the same kind mr davis thought the senate said li was his colleague who resided among theac remarkable people but as he has now cor reeled the statement i can only wonder tbi more that coming himself from the midst a population so moral so accomplished ant instructed therefore to be supposed so re gatdful ot the rights of others so regardfu ot the constitution as those he has the bonoi to represent he should make demonstration such as he is constantly exhibiting upon thit floor i thought it well as i understood hia first but now it assumes a more dubiouc form and without the high eulogy which h delivered upon that population and which suppose he is to take home with him lahouk have doubted their claims to such and m numerous virtues i trust he will take home with him also the speech he delivered the other day upon this floor in which he announced that all those petitions and memorial are a mere trick intended for electioneering purposes that this agitation ib a mere game intended to cajole the people that it is all i very harmless matter that it meana reallj nothing except to keep up an excitement an secure votes to candidates at election mei hope that the senator will repeat tha speech to these people when he happens t attend meetings whence these and simtla resolutions go forth when the people ii any quarter of this uuion are about to bi lashed into fury against the institutions of tb remaining states by the promptings of fanaticism and urged to assail that of which the know nothing i hope that he will rise am tell them how mean a spirit haw corrupt i purpose and how empty are the declaration which have provoked them to this madness let him tell them as he told the senato from vermont when he referred to the intro d action of these reselutions that it is a con enience to get up resolutions of the soi when a senator is to be elected think sir this would be far better than any constitutional argument or if such thing could h supposed there than any southern adddres which could be delivered i think it woulc recall the patriotism and the justice even othe senators own constituency to a sense o their folly and rashnessrecall them iron their wild war upon the rights of others am cause them to reflect how far they had beet made the unwilling instruments of men demagogues seeking to elevate theqnselve at their expense and the expense of the country by means of exciung their jealousy am passiou but the senator makes another declare tiou which surprises menot being very wel informed in relation to his private history that he is not a member of any of those associations which are operating in the norti against tha institutions of the souih and tha he knows nothing of them i am glad tt bear it and can now understand hisdeclara tion that he knows of no associations for thi purpose of printing incendiary publications to be circulated at the south we do know it aud it ie strange that he does not why air the new york antislaverv society aendi out more publications i believe than the senate of the united states they are sem now only into the southern states but sir that society has printed numerous publics tions for the express purpose of circulation u california and the purpose haa been avowed by means of agents aud publications gratuitously distributed to prevent slavery frou being jmitted into the consiitution of california v t ot only this but they are associated in close affiliation whith similar socituei in great britain and scotland they acknowledge the contributions of those societiei to be applied to these very objects for wbicti they are laboring according to their own reports it is very stiange that we who stand so far off should know so much more in relation to these matters than the senator from new hampshire yet sir i am glad that it is aothat such is the factbecause it exonerates tha senator from new hampshire from much of that capability which we had heretofore assigned to him mr president i always enter into discussion of the slavery question with feelings ol reluctance and only because i am forced into it by tboae who having nothing to do with it nevertheless indecently interfere in out domestic affaires here have done so sir it is a melancholy fact that morning uftei morning when we come here to enter into the business of the senate out feelings should be harrowed up by the introduction of this exciting and profitless subject and we be compelled to listen to insults heaped upon nor institutions sir there is no man who comes here to represent hie constituency for high and useful purposes and who feels upon himself the obligation of hia oath to maintain the constitution of the united states who could thus act from day to day for the purpose of disturbing the useful legislation of the countiy for no other purpose than to insert another branch into the flame which every reflecting sober man now sees threatens to consume the fabric of out government we of the south atand now aa we have always stood upon the defensive we raised not this question but when raised itis our duty to defend ourselves for one air my purposes are to keep down this species of excitement both here and at home i know the temper of those whom i represent and they require no promptings to resist aggression or insult i know their determination it is well and deeply taken and will be shown when the crisis comes they make no threats againtt any one and least of all against tbe union for which they have made such heavy and continued sacrifices they know their rights while they feel their wrongs and they will maintain the one resent the other if it may be will preserve our constitutional union but tba union without the coastiluiion they hold to be a curse with the constitution they will never abandon it we air are parlies to this union only under tbe constitution and there no power known in the world that could dictate to my liule state a union in which her righu were continually diareapec ted and trampled upon by an omestrained majority the present generator r will maintain the character their fathers wan they well know how to sueiainpm institutions which they inherited even by civil war if that be provoked they will mtieh up to this issue aad meet it free to free jhia is our poaitioo you havo not rtnpeo urntow atoeenid t i pat no frith ia politicians fret that they raised a invoked a spirit which the cannot alto and dare not confront and et i believe that i the descendants of the franklins the han cocks and the adamses if the aaw ear tn stitntions about tv be destroyed bp s mean i and captions exercise of the power of dema gogoes to press to a fatal extremity aggraa i aions upon oar rigbu by the north would rise op in their strength and would enforce the justice and obligations of the constitution r this is no indication of an confidence which i i put in their representatives with them ii am read to meet this issue face to free andr if the representatives of that people thinh proper to sow the seeds of dissension and toi inflame the passions and prejudices of one section whilst the drive the other fc ever r possible provocation to the point of civil wart then all have to say ia that the represents i tives of the south true to their constituency i are prepared to meet tbeissue here and now if this is to he the hotbedof civil war if from this as a center the evil ia to radiate throughout our country here let the first battle bes fought if gentlemen come here constantly to preaa upon us strip us of our rights to move the people of one section of the nation r to hostility against tha other i hope that i those who have brought the eountt to this j crisis will meet the first test t mr president it is no part of the business of a southern representative here to deliver panegyrics upon the attachment of his cont stituenta iohe union we have proved our i love of the union sod aur devotion to it too often and too long to require such declare tiona let those who feel that it may bef doubted make their declarations of fidelity toi the union we have nothing of the kind to do if the state of vermont chooses to send to the senate of the united states insulting r resolutions telating to her sister states let i the senators and representatives of thai i state do their duty in relation to them andi as i say nothing against a sovereign state i will only say to thorn senators that i regret that vermont has not now such constitutional scruples as actuated her in the war of i and that she does pot keep her rssolutiom within her own limits in this war of aggression as she attempted to keep her troopt i during that war i regret that i shall have to part with manj i frienda with whom i have uniformly acted ir he senate upon the motion now pending to print these leaolutions i would agree ti print them however offensive they might ber if the state had sent them to the senate i the state has a right to speak to the senate and be heard but i accept the argument ot the senator from georgia which has imi properly as it seems to me been callet t special pleading that they are the properly ol the senators to whom they are directed am i perceive no obligation requiring them ts have been placed before the senate the are instructions addressed to them wit r reference to their own duties and might jus  as well remain in their own pockets as to litt upon the table of the senate i hold then i to be unjust to be untrue offensive insulting treasonable to the constitution andr will not endotse them by my vote i havi thus briefly stated my reasons mr phklps i did not mean to be drive t again into this discussion and i believe should content myself with repeating what said the other day that if any man has mei this subject troublesome vexatious aa it ia i with a feeling of coolness and deliberation ii ia the senator from vermont but aomi f charges have been made from which i desiri i an opportunity to vindicate myself i ido not wish to go into the discussion now but after the remarks that have been madi by the senator from mississippi feel it ij duty which i owe to myself as well aa ti i those whom represent that i should presen my vindication and if the senate will in i dulge me until toiaorrow aa it is now late i will endeavor to do so in as brief a manne aa possible i the subject was passed by informally according lythe nobth star rochester january notice to snhkriben business and other communications connected with the north

knowledge ever been a meeting held by the abolitionists of this country which was looked forward to with non solicitude than the ooa in question the nature of the call the parties included in it and the differsee of opinion well known to exist among the persons likelyf to b n attendance naturally enough induced apprehensions in the minds of mgny that the whole weak bn a failure it is not our purpose in the present article to determine the question whether the convention is to be regarded as having snoeaeded or as having failed to accomplish the cod aimed at by those who called it together we do however propoee to give our readers a complete and candid narration of the points which ehieiy interacted as accompanied by such thoughts as may suggest themselves in connection with the subject indispensable engagements at borne rendered it impossible for us to reach syracuse before the afternoon of the second day and similar duties compelled ua to leave on sa urday morningtwo sessions before the convention dosed we arrived at market hall on wednesday afternoon while travelling thither we bought a penny paper containing the following list of officers samuel j may president frederick douglass and joseph c hathaway vice presidents j w randolph charles adams secretaries cbsrles c burleigh s h gay slocum howland abigail mott were appointed a business committee t g white aan son thorpe george w dean were a finance committee our readers will be interested to know at once who were in attendance as speakers we may mention besides those already named in tbe list of officers that messrs pruyn samuel r ward john thomas stephen s foster rev mr wing henry box brown calvin fairbanks mifflin gibbs c l remond c a wheaton lyndon king parker pilsbury lewis burtis benjamin fish james c jackson and gerrit smith the last named gentleman was speaking when we entered the hall we were struck at once with the complete command which he held over the crowded multitude before him his noble form his deep toned and musical voice hia graceful attitudes his face radiant with benevolence earnestness and sincerity proclaimed him at once among the noblest specimens of modern orators no one can hear him without feeling his power the subject under consideration was the character of the constitution of the united states the convention had already divided into parties and those parties had selected their champions mr smith represented the libeity party and antislavery character of the constitution and mr c c burleigh represented the american antislavery society both are able men and no good cause need suffer in the hands of either it wes not to opr taste that the discussion should have been confined to two individuals the arrangement however had been adopted previous to our arrival and we deferentially and cheerfully fell in with it aa we before stated mr smith was speaking when we entered the crowded hall he was establishing the utility of the preamble to the constitution aa a means of ascertaining the true meaning of the enacting clauses of that instrument he then proceeded to review what are commonly called the compromises of the constitution he denied that either of them authorised or guaranteed slavery and he affirmed thet each of them was capable of an innocent construction mrsmith holds views on this subject very nearly similar to those held by lysander spooner the clause relating to tbe apportionment of taxation he contended was an antislavery provision inasmuch instead of giving power to the southit reduced that power twofiffhs this part of his reasoning was based upon the hypothesis that tbe clause itself related in any way to slaves but mr smith denied that it did so refer and stated that the term free was not to be taken in this connection as the correlative of slave persons all this struck us strangely we confess knowing the history of this clause of the constitution as we do but we screwed up our courage resolved not to mind even if our friend should argue the nose off our face he gave a number of instances in which the word free is used when it is impossible that it should be considered as the correlative of slave persons claiming all the while that it was his privilege to range through the whole expanse of historyof precedentof lawin pursuit of an innocent meaning while hia opponent was compelled to confine himself wholly to the constitution while seeking to impose upon it a vicious construction it is scarcely necessary for us io this article to follow mrsmith through either his reasonings or his precedents the former have been shown tobe unsatisfactory and the latter to be of no avail against wellknown longestablished and universally admitted facts the claim that he alone bad a right to search for evidence outside of the constitution was as justly denied we think as it was complacently affirmed and mr burleigh demonstrated both by arg intent and precedent hia right to a range aa wide as that claimed by mr smith this debate occupied the entire day and evening on wednesday and formed decidedly the most interesting point in the whole proceedings we nevei sew a discussion conducted with more fairness dignity end feeling all that vre can award to mrsmith as he appeared to ue in this debate is honesty of opinion and consummate skill and ability io the presentation of hie views when on the right side of sn opinion he is the men whom w would select to chase ten thousand but in a cause so palpably erroneous as was that defended by him neither skill net ability availed charles c burleigh literally demolished every position taken in behalf of the character of the american constitution at tbe close of the debate between messrs smith and burleigh at ten oclock oo wednesday night the hall was still crowded and as the audience manifested no disposition to retire the debate was oooiumed between frederick douglass samuel r ward t cbae l remond and stephen footer this wai prolonged until after oofedfc the assemblage mill giving an signs of uaaasinasa fatigue mr smith then offered the follow sutwtilute for rhe twolotions prmnti by tbn business committee affirming the proslavery character of the united states coo u to tion and called for the popular voti epos the same this call ws subsequent foamed was wholly out of order inasmucl u a had been previously agreed upon tha no vote should be takes until the subject hat been folly discussed by tbe various speaker present who desired to discuss it and sc cording to the rules of the convection nt popular voting was contemplated aed now but enrolled members were expected to vote in tbe face of this undemanding mr smul offered bis substitute and demanded as w have said tbe popular vote upon it w give bis resolutions here entire i resolved that the federal coitstiluttoi should like other laws be subjected to fogs rules of interpretation and that when it it thus subjected it is seen not to be for slavery but again slaverynot of powers adequate to uphold any part of american slavery bu of powers adequate to overthrow every part o american slavery s that the man who votes for no slaveholder and ter no one who does and for none who does not regard the powers of th federal constitution as ample for the overthrow of slavery is provided always that hi acknowledges do proslavery church to be i church of christ sod no proslavery miniate to be a minister of christ worthy of tbe name and the honor of an abolitionist of course subjected to such a vote wit the prejudices of tbe audienoe against the din unionist and in fitvor of mr smith theat resolutions were adopted by a large majority the subject however was still to be act upon by tbe convention and it was taken uj as the first thing in older on thursday morning when the debate became genera mr calvin fairbanks insisted on the antislavery character of the constitution with i greater show of feeling than of argument he counseled us to be kindly affectioned om towards another and tecommended the for geat toleration he was followed by freder tek douglass who advocated the original rea olutions and opposed mr smiths substitute we condense this speech from the report e it published in tbe syracuse journal mr douglass referred to the adoption o mr smiths substitute last evening by a popular vote and while he would not impugi that vote he rejoiced that the question wa still open for the consideration ef tbe convention he considered that the differences o opinion upon the constitution formed one u the strongest barriers against the fusion of thi different antislavery men into one organiza tionan end devoutly to be wished for hi first objection to the substitute offered by mrsmith was that it practically aimed at a din solution of the union white it theoretically professed respect for that union it was ii his judgment seeking tn honest end in a dishonest way he was for dealing even will slaveholders in the most truthful and hones manner and was against taking any advantagi of the constitution in favor of freedom ii view of his well established conviction tha both they who framed that instrument am they who adopted h understood it as protecting slavery so long as that institution should continue in the land it was enough for bin to know that the union of could neve have been secured under such a coostiuctioi of the constitution as mr smith now proposed to put upcu it that construction amount to this that the constitution does not guarantee the right of the slaveholder of maiylam to reclaim his fugitive slave in new england that the genera government ia not authorize by the constitution to suppress slave insurrec irons that instead thereof the general government is bound by that instrument to tki sides with the slaves in a contest sgains their masters that that clause of the coneti tution relating to the apportionment of taxes is a premium to liberty and a condemnatioi of slavery that the clause referring to thi migration and importation ot such persons ai any of the states shall see fit to admit is at antislavery provision propositions each ant all so absurd and ridiculous as to fill ont with amazement that they should be entertained for a moment by a tingle individual o any intelligence every man must see tha no union could have been formed between tht free states and the slave states under such i construction of the constitution he bek that what the union was and what the parties agreed at the time it should be the partiei to it now should maintain it to be or eom out with the american antislavery society and repudiate the bargain altogether n union with slaveholders is the pares platform from which to preach delivering to the captive in reply to mr ward wb asked the question who will altei the lawi if you elect no one mr douglass referret to the admission of daniel oconnell to thi british parliament mr oconnell was i roman catholic and the british constitutroi required him to abjure the pope as a condition of becoming ajegislator did he abjurt the pope navas and probably he woulti not have done so though he should have died without seeing the inside of the british parliament who altered the lawa the british constitution was changed the moral sentiment of england improved under oconnells agitation the intolerance of bigotry relaxed and legislators sworn to support the constitution modified it in accordance with the progress and enlightenment of the nation mr douglass added further that there were more than sixty thousand colored persons free in maryland who are wholly indebted for their freedom to the moral sense of their former ownerno statute ever having been enacted obliging their masters to free them there were numerous instances that could be cited which show that the moral sense oftbe community often renders the statute hook null and void it was not however obligatory upon him to explain the precise manner in which the laws of this countiy are to be amended all he undertook to demonstrate was that the constitution required on the part ef those who became parties to it a violation of the law of gd the latter demon listed leaves no room for a question such m that pet to him by bis friend mi ward mr douglass next turned his attention to the charge of no government so often irged against diaunioniata by liberty party non he said it was all very well to talk of wiling an anuslavery construction upon tbe gad to predict tbn traction will mom day be put oa it bet ha ratal orbit is saw to bo done will tbo liberty party abide by tbecoosutoiioa as at preranl ooostroed will they tin all ibe intermediate time io the hope of finally fixiag a pea the coratitutiea tbeir ewe peculiar in teipr cut toot a prominent member of that party here exclaimed wt will mat then returned mr doegirae yea ara ai revolutionistaa inaaneetioniat and a not government ana there ia no escapiitg i this conclusion the supreme court of the united statue ia the authorised exponent of the meaning of the constitution its deemeoe i are tending upon the entire nation and be i who resists them places himself in rebellion against hie government so that the audience will eee that the loyal liberty party oeeepy aground as hostile to human government as thats p which the american antislavery society has erected its standard of no union with stavthousaa between tbo pratent i interpretation and the hoped fox future one i there is a great gulf fixedand to hit cued an impassable oee there is ten one jest i wey to deal with this question bn the ijn r k dissolved and the constitution repu diatedand in the spirit of our ancestors let os give to the world another declaration of independence and proclaim the esutbiishmem of a republic with s coasuiution to which no tyrant nor slave can possibly be a party i we would not have the reader aappoee r from the foregoing that we have gitso them a full statement of the arguments on either aide of the constitutional question there were many other points presented to which it will not be in our power to allude at this time there u one point however freon the oppo j site side which we arc disposed to mention as much for its novelty as for its absurdity it came from the eloquent lips of james c jackson who said so many good things during the greater part of his speech that we think he can afford to have us criticise him in i this particular he denied the right of one generation to make a constitution for another i stating that those who adopted the american constitution meant that it should be a proslavery instrument he had as good a right to adopt it as they bad and be should do so giving it sn antislavery meaningand that f kis meaning was of as much authority aa theirs we do not peihaps give the exact f words although even in this we think weare not seriously at fault mr jackson seemed well pleased with his philosophy of government his first idea is s good one snd is as old as it is good it may be seen in near p ly all the political works of jeremy bentham p but we should never dream of making it the premise of such a conclusion we put it to friend jackson if the argument would not stand better no generation baa a right to make a government which shall bind the consciences of another the framers of the american constitution have bound the conacien ces of tbeir successors and therefore we have a right to repudiate that constitution and to frame one for ourselves the subject next in importance to that in solving the eharaeter of the american con slitulion was embodied ia the following reso i lution offered to the convention by parker pilisbory resolved that among all the agencies and instrumentalities whose professed object ia the overthrow of slavery none has entitled itself to the full cooperation and support ofr the people but the american antislavery i society and its organized or individual auxiliaries none other can claim to be based ups on immutable piinciples none other has maintained inviolate even the principles upon which it set out and none other stands out i today before the world clear in ita doctrines as the sun fair in iu fidelity tothoaedoetrinea as the moon and terrible in iu righteous demands upon and rebukes of the tyrant as an army with banners and as such it and it only is worthy the regard the cordial aymp thy and support of every lover of humanity and manto this resolution many in the convention we among the number took exception such a resolution seemed tojjs illtimed and in no way calculated to lessen the nhieeltt io the way of a harmonious cooperation of all the antislavery forces in this stste it seemed to be too laudatory of ourselves and too blind to the good qualities of other associations simply because they follow not us since we commenced the present article we have received a copy of the proceedings of the two last sessions of the convention and an happy to find that a more temperate and an equally tiuthful resolution was substituted for the one in question it was offered by c c burleigh and is as follows resolved that the american antislavery society being baaed upon right piiociplee and having a plan of operation wisely adapted to the went of abolishing slavery and a platform on which all who wish to help in i that work whatever be their political oi religious creed can freely and efficiently aet for the accomplishment of the oommon object of them all it is worthy of their united support and cooperation and to give it such support and cooperation is to make the most economical and effective use which they cen make of tbeir anlislaveiy energy and re sources this resolution was adopted by a decided majoi ity sod the convention soon afterwards adjourned we may be asked our opinion as to what especial good this long lookedfor meeting has accomplished and we are sorry to say that we believe that no especial good has resulted from it those who felt kindly disposed towards the american antislavery society before the holding of this convention feel so still we doubt if one convert from the liberty party waa made the moat that bra bora accomplished has been a meeting of the two wings of the antislavery movement we have seen each other face to faee and prated with no other ties to tend os to each other than those of affinity whieh before existed messrs gmt south samuel r ward john thomas rev mr stowe and oumt liberty party men have gone heme quits satisfied with the cenreetneaa of their views end if possible more completely wedded to the liberty party while mr wheat on sedgwick and others of the free soil party mo feeling quite aa aelfeomplaeam in their position andwe scarcely need ray that messrs burleigh fosterptusbory remood hathaway and other members of the american antislavery society are as deeply as over convinced of the soundness of their views and of the wisdom of tbo policy adopted by that society there was of course on this occasion a vast amount of truth presented to the minds of the multitude who thronged the conventionw have seldom listened to a more powerful speech than that made by s foster on thursday night from oclock in the evening until long after he held a brilliant audience in the most profound attentionsi lencing all attempts at the first and there were many to hinder him in his grand ef foit our brother remond also spoke several times and as usual thrilled the audience by hia fervid eloquence our esteemed friend pillsbury had but little to say during the meeting we believe he spoke but once hr theo stirred up the elements of opposition u a high pitch he took up the idea of the gulf between the american antislavery society and the liberty party describing tbe former to be in heaven and the latter in hell this was too much for the liberty party including our esteemed friend gerrit smith who pronounced uch remarks to be insolent he confess that they struck us as harsh we considered the meaning however rather thtn the words in which it was couched the meaning was cotiect since it only de declared the one society to be right and tbe other to be wrong mr ward showed himself to be a fluent speaker an expert debatet and a goodnatured fellow full of fun and frolic barring his frequent references to bis wife hia humorous sallies must always delight an audience but it ia no part of our purpose to draw portraits of the differem speakers if we should attempt this we might fill the entire aide of our wide sheet there was every variety the broad axe ol foster the battering ram of pillsbury the ready logic and the melodious accents of gerrit smith the mental agility of burleigh the touching pathos of may and the tine declamation of remond were all brought into life and activity on this occasion we venture to say that syracuse has seldom witnessed such an array of moral and intellectual strength as that presented in this convention if in tbe foiegoing account we have misstated any one we shall of course be happy to be set rightr o editorial items the president of our model republic the everyday robber of the rights of three hundred people is at

of the design and we have appropriated it with pleasure it presents a rather dark appearance but we hope to relieve it of this imperfection by ii few moie touches from our engraver although as it is

the united states on the d instant in the declaration made by me and denied by my colleague that the general assembly of missouri has mistaken the sentiment of the people and misconceived theii own powers when they pledged the state to cooperate with the slaveholding states in the measures in progress the expected time for taking that issue was at the august elections of next summer but the time

contributions to the star they are always welcome the language of flowers how eloquent are the flowers as the psalmist said of the stars on high so may we ay of these aura of earth there is in them no speech nor language yet their voice is not unheard since the dew of the first morning rested upon them amid the groves of paradise they have been whispering their sweet counsels of love and beauty in the ears of manand yet they are not silent year by yeat as they come forth to adorn the ever changing links of the rolling seasons they bring with them fresh messages irora that spiritland whose glories seem at times wellnigh bursting through their bright etherial forms gentle poets and prophets ate they poets by virtue of their mission to interpret the beautiful to the eye of man and prophets inasmuch as they prefigure as they come forth one by one from their dark winter sleep in the bosom of earth to light and life and joy that great mystery of our nature that we teo shall not sleep but be changed surely if there is in the glorious apparelling of this outward world one thing more than another which speaks of the love of god it is the flowers it is a perfect hymn of love and praise that is written on the furrowed page of earth with these lovely hieroglyphics at first pale and trembling and delicate as the first unfolding of a tale of affection then deepening month by month in fervency and luxuriance and again sinking a way like the vanishing hues of the rainbow or the last melting touching strains of an ieolian mel ody the flowers have a high and holv mission to fulfil humble but appointed servitors are they in the vast cathedral of nature consecrated and ordained by none other than the great high priest himself in that hour wherein he looked upon them arrayed in a glory greater than that of solomon and gave them a gospel to preach to all generations of men a gospel of love and trusting faith and the assured belief to man that wlioso careth lor the flowers will much more care for him the lonely traveller in the far off wilds of africa is but a type of the myriads of human spirits that have drunk refreshment and consolation from these wayside fountains that have listened to the ministry of these lowly preachers and have gone on their way re joicing who has not felt in contemplating the vastness of creation in standing upon the very portals of the infinite and following the mighty hosis of heaven in their unimaginable multitudes and wanderingsin gazing into those abysses of ispace whete the torch ofi science serves but to make the darkness visi i ble a sensation of fearful and heartcrushing awe a sense of weakness and littleness and insignificance like that which actuated the poetking of israel to exclaim loid what isman that thou art mindful of him or the eon of man that thou visilest him it is in such moments as these that the breath of the low v flowers floats over the soul like a waft from the other world it is then that we listen most willingly to the sound of their holy evangeland as our sinking eyes turn from the crushing grandeurs of the starry heavens to the turf beneath our feet these heavensent messengers are there to assure us by the hoards of loveliness lavished upon their fairy forms and the delicate perfection of their organization that our poor notions of great and small bear no relation to infinitude that they exist not in the workings of the eternal order that they are among the many shadows that will flee away at the dawning of everlasting day and that if the testimony of our fathers might is written in burning cyphers on the firmament of heaven the message of hts boundless and all embracing love is as clearly told and as gladly accepted from the gleaming pages of the grassy earth and many a blessed lesson besides these great ones do the flowers teach to the willing and lowly mind that can stoop with childlike simplicity to learn of these gentle teachers to some submitted souls they have breathed forth great secrets of the spirit v orld they have become transparent with the radiance of their hidden and spiritual essence and have stood before them transfigured into the shining gloty of those great thoughts of god of which they are the symbols and the visible language and embodiments these have gazed upon them with thoughts too deep for tears because their delicate forms have been too thin a veil to hide from them the radiance of that indwelling informingspiiit of the j universe which is the life and soul of nature thus every separate flower has its own truth to tell besides foiming a harmonious part of the great whole and though the more serial notes of the music they breathe may be heard alone by deeply spiritualised natures yet they have tones of solemn sweetness loud enough i for til but the dullest ear to hear who can look on the snowdrop and the violet without thinking of spotless purity and modest virtue on the daisy without remembering the numberless mercies that gladden our path of life unacknowledged and almost unseen which would yet be sorely missed were they to depart on the majestic rose the venus of flowers without dreams of love and beauty or on the golden flower of the sun nor feel instructed by an emblem of fsith and constancy and of a noble upward looking to the soul and centre of all things who could hold that dull dry doctrine that calls itself utilitarian in the presence of aflower are not indeed the floral hosts avery cloud of witnesses against that blighting spirit that recognizes not the beautiful amongst the ministrations of the hueoay that sees not the perfect uoion of the twain a union solemnized by the hand of iova before the foundation of the world from what i world of joy and delight do such exclude themselves yea they lose their right o that fair and broad inheritance in the wide kingdom of nature which would enable them by virtue of loving and teachable hearts tom csm tbs florioih all their own their eyes are clouded vritla the duet of care the fretful stir unprofitable and the fever of the world and their ears deafened with the whirl of its ceaseless activities so that they see no beauty in the beautiful and bear not the still small voice that these lowly ministers lift up juor the high and glorious snatches of the heavenly harmonies that are permitted to float down to this nether sphere to gladden and refresh the weaned soul of man and to awaken in his heart that unconquerable yearning for his fatherland which gives him assurance of his high origi nal bloom on then ye lovely flowers keep for os beneath your rainbow wings that dew of oar youth which the worlds sultry bieath would so soon exhale weaiy not in your holy minitflries teach us to adorn like you the waste places of life

the latter was not perhaps intended for publication its writer will pardon us for inserting it in our paper on the assurance that it will be read with interest by american readersespecially by the friends of the slave to her majesty victoria queen or great britain and ireland may it please your most gracious majesty we the undersigned your dutiful and loyal subjects the women oflreland well aware of the warm interest your majesty takes in the cause of the oppressed of every colour and of every clime approach your throne with that relying confidence which your noble character inspiles and earnestly and respectfully beg to appeal to your majesty in behalf of those foully wronged and persecuted peo plethe victims of the african slave trade and implore your majesty to requite your ministers to adopt such measures as they shall deem requisite to enforce the fulfilment of the solemn treaties entered into at various times since with spain portugal and brazil for the total abolition of this nefarious traffic which was agreed to be abandoned forever in and in and fot the consummation of which the british people have bestowed the enormous sum of jg  many years have now elapsed bince these sacred promises were made and the prospect of their performance seems to be as distant as ever the shamelessness of such a violation of all honor and honesty in so holy a cause has already aroused the indignation of the whole empire and petitions to your majesty and to parliament are many an this soulstirring subject even female timidity is overborne and the women of the land crowd to testify their eager desire to have the bargain which their fathers and their husbands paid for scrupulously enforced we trust and hope that it only requires to draw your majestys attention thus lorcibly by the voice of the united kingdom to this insulting as well as faithless conduct of these ungrateful nations in order that they may be practically taught without further delay that the british people will not submit to this disgraceful fraud belfast dec th my dear sirl write a few lines by order of the committee of the belfast ladies antislavery association to let you knowhow much the members of it regret that they have not been able to collect a sufficient quantity of work in time to send out for your annual rochester fair this is chiefly owing to the distress amongst the poor of our own country and the number of bazaars which have taken place in consequence of it we have however collected some work and trust that if we are spared until the time of your next fair we shall be able to send you a box in the meantime lest you should imagine that our sympathy with the slave is extinct i enclose you a copy of a monster petition we have prepared to present to her majesty in behalf of the victims of the african slave trade the procuring of signatures which has occupied much time it has been signed by six thousand one hundred and eighteen irishwomen and many more would in all probability have done so had not the language been considered by them too strong for instance the society ot friends in general objected toit on this score and the members of the antislavery society in cork would neither sign it themselves nor procure signatures lor us as thinking the object of the petition could not be effected without war this we should regret as much as they provided the greater evil can be removed without resorting to so dreadful an alternaive our vice president mrs thomson jerment who drew up the petition has been most active and energetic and has done more towards procuring signatures than all the rest of our committee together will you be kind enough to let me know whether the subscription of our association for the north star has been paid for the year our treasurer has been in abad state of health and was obliged to remove to a warmer climate which has occasioned some confusion in the accounts i have just forwarded to mrs richardson of newcastle our subscriptions for also a subscription for mss m ireland a member of our committee her address is royal college i need scarcely say that we all derive much pleasure in perusing your excellent paper the letters in it addressed tq your former masterhave excited great and universal interest mrs richardson mentioned that the subscription to the north star was to be raised to s so i sent for the association and miss ireland my father tent his through our friends in cork do you think it would be possible to have some true stories of slaves or aneodotes of aiavery embodied in small tiacts for distribution in our schools such tracts for instance as the specimen i enclose these are sold at sixpence a hundred andi think facts placed in the hands of children would do more towards instilling a horror of slavery than anything else we can do but they would require to be judiciously written so as to excite deep sympathy for the slave and indignation against the slaveholder without shocking what would be termed here the refined feelings of these countries will you excuse the liberty i have taken in putting these queries my father and sister join mein wishiogyou the compliments

canadian connexion in all its aspects is that s far from england being a sufferer from tlx renunciation of their allegiance to the britts crown on the part of the canadians she would be an actual gainer it is a well ascertain ed fact that the expenses of the connexion have more than counterbalance its advantages the maintenance of that part o our colonial poasessions subjects us to a yearly

ona rocky height an old fortress one stormy evening in harvest its lord looked from his window into the darkuess and over the wellguarded court of the castle towards the opposite hills where the tops of the trees still visible rustled and waved in the dark blue heavens the rivulet in the valley sent forth a wild and strange sound and the creaking weathercock clattered and brawled as if chiding the storm the seene and the hour were congenial to the tnind of the lord of the castle he was no longer the mild and indulgent master his ordy daughter had fled from the fortress with a handsome youth far inferior to her inbirth but a sweeter singer and harp player than any inhabitant of the wild highlands and soon after their flight the lover was found dashed to pieces in the bottom of a rocky valley into which in the darkness of the night he had fallen thereupon the daughter by aa unknown pilgrim aent a letter toher father aaying that night having robbed her of her lover her eyes were opened to her fault that she had retired to a convent to do the most severe penance and that he would never ee her more from this event the lord of the castle had become almost as obdurate as the surrounding rocks and as unfeeling as the stony pavement ot his fortress as he now looked from the window he saw ia the yard a lantern move backwards and forwards aa if in the hand of tome one who with tottering steps stole across the aveaav angrily be called out who goes there for liis domestics had strict orders to admit no one within the walls and since the flight of the young lady these commands were rigidly obeyed it seemed as it lifeless stones alone dwelt within to the lord of the castle there came a sod voice an old woman it said begs some food noble knight but the bumble demand was impet josly refused spyvagrantwitch f were the appellations showered upon thwbeggar and because she did not immediately retire but reiterated her petition witha fervent though weak voice the knight in the wildness of his wrath called on his bloodhounds to hunt the beggar woman away wildly did the ferocious dogs rush forth hut scarcely had they approached the woman when she touched the strongest and fiercest with a slender wand the domestics who had come lit expected that the savage dog would tear her in pieces but howling he turned and the others laid themselves down whinning before the beggar again the lord of the castle urged them on but they only howled and moaned and lay stilla strange shuddering seized him which redoubled when the old woman raised her lantern on high and her long white hair appeared waving in the storm while with a sad and threatening voice she exclaimed thou in the heavens who seest and hearest trembling the knight retired from the window and ordered his people to give her what she demanded the domestics frightened at the apparition placed some food without in a basket and then secured the doorsall the while repeating prayers until they heard the strange old woman carry away the food as she stepped out of the castle gate the hounds moaned mysteriously after her from this time regularly every third evening the lantern was seen in the castle yard and no sooner did the strange twinkling begin to be visible through the darkness and the light steps to be heard to totter softly over the pavement than the lord of thecas tle hastened back from the window the domestic put out the basket of food and the hounds moaned sorrowful til the apparition vanished one dayit was now the beginning of winterthe knight followed tht chase in the wildest part of the mountains suddenly his hounds darted uj a steep height and expecting a gouc capture at the risk of imminent danger he forced his shuddering hors over the stoney slippery ground before a cavern in the middle of the ascent the hounds stood still but how felt the knight when the figure of woman stepped to the mouth of tin abyss and with a stick drove back tht dogs from the silvery locks of the woman as well as from the restlesi and low meanings of the hounds anti his own internal feelings he soon perceived that in tins drear spot the lantern bearer stood before him i hall frantic he turned his horses head buriea his spurs in its sides ant galloped down the steep accompaniet by the yelling hounds towards tht castle soon after this strange occurrence the lantern was no longer seen in tht court of the castlethey waited on dayseveral daysa whole week passed over but the apparition was n longer seen if its first appearance had alarmed the lord of the castle and his domestics its disappearance occasioned still mort t consternation they believed that the former prog i nosticated some dreadful event whicl the latter betokened to be near ot the knight this anticipation had a terrible effect he became pale and haggard and his countenance assumet such a disturbed appearance the inmates of the castle were of opinion tha the apparition gave warning of hit death it was not so one day as was his custom tilt knight rode to the chase and in hit present distraction of mind he approached unaware that part of tht country where the old woman with tht white hair had appeared to him ant which he horn that time had withgreai care avoidec again the dogs sprung up the heigh howling and looked fearful into the cavern the affrighted baron in vain called them back they stood as if fascinated on the dreadful spot but on this occasion no one appeared to chase them away i they then crept into the cavern anti from its dark bosom the knight still heard their moanings and cries at last he summoned resolution sprung from his horse and with determined courage clambered up the gteep height advancing into the cavern he beheld the hounds crouched round a wretched mossy couch on which the dead body of a woman lay stretched out on drawing near her he recognized the pure white hair of the formidable lantern bearer the little horn lantern stood near her on the ground and the features were those of his only child more slowly than the faithful hounds who from the beginning had known their young mistress did the unhappy knight become aware whom he saw before hitn but dissipate every deubt there lay a paper on the breast of the dead body on which with her own blood her hand had traced the following words in three nights the wanderers hair became white through grief for the death of her lovershe saw it in the brooks her hair he bad often called a net in which his life was entangled net and life were both by one stroke destroyed she then thought of those holy ones of the church who in humility have lived unknown and despised beneath the parental roof and as a penance she has besought alms from ner fathers castle and lived among he rocks from which her lover fell but her ponance draws near its end the crimson stream fails ah fath she would have written father but the stream was exhausted which with unspeakable sorrow the knight perceived bad issued from a deep wound in her left arm he was found by bis servants near the corpse in silent prtver his hounds moaning beside him he buried his daughter in the cavern from which he never afterwards came out the unhappy hermit forced every one from him his faithful dogs alone he could not drive away and mournfully they watched together by the side of their young mistress and beside their sorrowing lord and when he also died their sad bowlings first made it known to the surrounding country beginntxc of the year in various nations the chaldeansand egyptiansyear was dated from the autumnal equinox the

the dutch and the protestants in germany introduced the new style in the ancient clergy reckoned from the th mrch and the method was observed in britain until the introduction of the new style a d after which our year commenced on the ist of january from tlie union important invention the following communication was handed to us by the author rufus porter esq who is well known to us as the former ejit r of the scientific jimeri  can and as a man well versed in ai knowledge of the arts and invention he is a man of superior intelligence and of great honesty of character and we do not hesitate to say that any fact stated upon his own knowledge may be relied upon implicity we do not know whether all the great result which he anticipates from the invention which he describes can be realized but he has stated some remarkable facts the results of his own oxperi meuts which would seem to justify the anticipations in which he indulges ll the invention shall turn out to be what the inventors now promise themseive it will be it is certainly a most wonderful discovery and will create anew era in the arts and in civilization messrs editors i am authorized to announce the discovery and practical test of the most important scientific invention ever yet produced or brought i to light since the world has been inhabited by manan invention which j must eventually and almost immediately produce an immense revolution in the commercial intercourse and business in general throughout the world ard although it will break down and ruin many of the most important branches of business and avenues of wealth with hundreds of wealthy corporations and business establishments yet it will build up thousands of others and contribute hundreds of millions to the benefit of mankind especially to the american community the first and main feature and foundation of this invention and which at once opens a field for hundreds ol other inventions is the discovery by henry m paine esq of a ready and almost expenscless mode of decomposing water and reducing it to the gaseous state by the simple operation ofa very small machine without galvanic batteries or the consumption of metals or ecids and only the application ol less than one threehundredth iioo part of one horse power mr paint produces cubic feet of hydrogen gaq and feet of oxygen gas pel hour this quantity of these gases i the actual cost of which is less than one cent will furnish as much heat by combustion as feet of the ordinary coal gas and sufficient to supply light equal to three hundred common lamps for ten hours or to warm an ordinary dwellinghouse twelve hours including the requisite heat for the kitchen or to supply the requisite heat for one horse power of steam this invention has been tested by six months operation applied to the lighting of houses and recently the applicability of these gases to the warming f houses has also been tested with perfectly satisfactory results a steam engine furnace and parlor stove both adapted to the burning of these gases have been invented and measurefftaken for securing patents thereof mr paine has one of his machines new and elegant now in full operation aud publicly exhibited aud may be expected to exhibit the same in this city within twenty days the only actual expense of warming houses by this apparatus is that of winding up a weight like the winding up of a clock ones a day and the heat produced may we as easily graduated and regulated an the fleiae of a common gasburner no smoke whatever is produced but avery small quantity of steam sufficient to supply the requisite fnoisture to the atmosphere in its application to the production of steam powet it will reduce the expense thereof to the mere wear of machinery ana will immediately produce an immense demand for sieatn engines and induce the establishment of thousands of manufacturing mills reduce the expense of traveling and increase the demand for agricultural produce while it ruins the coal and gas business and such manufacturing establishments as depend on monopoly and high prices this invention moveover removes completely the only obstacles which have hitherto existed to aerial navigationthe difficulty of procuring hydrogen ga and carrying a supply of fuel and it may now be considered a matter of tolerable certainty that men will be seen swiftly and safely soaring in various directions before the first of may next these facts being of immense importance should not be longe r withheld and therefore would avail myself of your widelycirculating journal to present them to the publie yours respectfully r porter washington dec from the german of jean paul richteo the new years night of an unhappy man an old man stood at the window or new years uight gazing with at expression of fearful despondency upon the motionless unfading heavens anc thence on the still pure white earth on which there were none so friendless so unblessed with repose as himself meanwhile his grave opened near him it was no longer beautified by the verdure of youth but desolate will nows of age and from the whole rich season of his life he brought to it nothing but errors sins and maladies s shattered body and a blighted soul a bosom full of poison and an old age i withered by remorse the sunny dayt lof his youth tinted around him like spectres to drag him back to the cleai and early morning when his fathei first placed him at the crossways ol life of which the right be over the radiant road of virtue to a distant quiet land lull of light and waving with harvests the lelt over the decayed path ol vice conducted to a dark cavern full ol distilling poisons rightful serpents and dense sweltering vapors ah tlie seipents twined themselves ar nnd his breasts and the poison drops fell upon his tongue uniil he knew not where he was in unutterable anguish he madly cried fo heaven give me my youth again oh father place tne anew upon the diverging roads that may make another choice but his lather and his youth had passed away he saw phantom tires dance over the fens and become extinguished in the graveyard and he said they are my days of folly he beheld a star shoot trom heaven and bursting in its fail shroud itself in darkness on the earth lo it is i sighed a bleeding heart while the fangs ot remorse buried themselves deeper in his rankling wounds feverish phantasy displayed to him the birds of illomen singing over the roofs the windmill lifted up its huge arms as if to crush him while a wizurd left in the deadhouse gradually assumed his features in the heat of his struggle the new years music chimed down in the church towers like a distant sacred psalm he was tenderly affected he glanced around the horizon and over the widespread earth ashe thought of the friends of his youth who now happier and better than he were the models of society the lathers of prosperous children and loaded with blessingsand he exclaimed oh i like you might have passed this first night with slumber resting on mine eyes unmoist w ith tears had out been willing i might have been happy dear parents had i fulfilled your new years wishes and given heed to your new years admonitions amid these burning memories of his earlier hours the wizard wearing his lineaments arose until at last superstition which sees spirits and peers into futurity transformed it into a living youth who in the posture of the boy of the capitol was drawing a thorn from his foot but his former blooming aspect was sadly and mysteriously changed he could look no longer he covered his eyes from which a thousand hot tears were gushing out and streaming down upon the snow in agony that refused consolation he only sighed returnohyouth return and his youth did return as on the years birthnight he had so fearfully dreamed he was again a young man but his wanderings were np yision never he less he thanked god that he could turn from the darksome paths of vice and start upon the sunny way of virtue which stretched into the laud of the harvests turn with him thou that standest in the way of errors this terrible dream will at some future time by thy judge but when iu sorrowful accents thou say oh beautiful hours of youth return they may give no heed to thy summons they sat whenever anybody comes to you with a story concerning somebody or anything and prefaces it with the stereotype phrase ikey say you may rest assured that nine times out of ten that report remark or story is a lie when the author of a report must be suppressed there is something wrong in denmark no story true in all its parts need be prefaced with they say let those who know it report it boldly or keep it an entire secret we could bring some illustrations of this subject did we deem it at all necessary no doubt every man will readily apply it to him selfcolumbia dan whatever gcd has made m perfect said a western preacher to his hearers what do you think of me said a hunchback rising and exhibiting bis own deformity think of you replied the preacherwhy that you are as perfect a hunchback as i ever saw in my life
