shackfords lecture on the war with mexico i take as the subject of my lecture the war with mexico because it is at present the subject which should engage our attention it is the question of our country in which its prosperity is most concerned and i take it moreover because there is a disposition very generally manifest to leave this subject exclusively to professed politicians when these politicians themselves take their tone from the people and are but the echoes of public senti ment hence it would be to lose all moral influence for us to be quiet and silent leaving to them the exclusive consideration of this great question god bethanked that there is yet left some little appearance of freedom and that out public affairs have not yet fallen to the absolute disposal of a few with no opportunity for the rest to send forth remonstrance and rebuke if then it be true that officeholders are not our hut rather th servants of public opinion if they an loir the hands to execute our uork and tin mouth pe es to express our thoughts it belongs to each one t let ins thoughts and work be kn wn kach one is to take heed that he shall do something towards giving a high pure and christian tone to the opinion of that circle however small it may be in which he moves so that finally all the many streamlets shall converge to one centre and thus shall fertilize and bless the whole country it sometimes happens in the private history of an individual that when he begins to congratulate himself upon ins exalted stale the ground shakes beneath him and he falls an easy victim to some sin or passion which lie thought he had escaped the mist envelopes him and shuts out the sunlight and so it is w ith a people we today exemplify the fact in our own history wc who have boasted so much of the wisdom and philanthropy of our times who began to speak ol war as the relic of barbarous ages and fluttered ourselves that we were removed from the dangers of foreign war despotic armies and a resort to sword and cannon we who hoped that the reign of force and the day of the bloody warrior was well nigh over that the peaceful kingdom of industry science arts schools commerce justice and love had begun to dawn and would speedily culminate into the full brightness of noon who were nurtured in abhorrence of foreign war and thought we had opened a fairer career of progress than any of the old nations weakened und worn out by their very conquests we wh looked upon a national war as an impossibility have had our pleasing dream dispelled the shadows are about us and a dense cloud envelopes every object we art engaged in a war of conquest all the resources of our nation for today and many days to cotnc arc the north star l applied to inflict the horrors of war j upon a neighboring people we art recorded in the book of history as the murderers of thousands whose only crime was living upon their native soil we have sent thousands of or brethren to die bv the sword and pestilence to stain their hands in blood to be trained in the school of abject slavery to stifle conscience and the thought ol better things to forget their humanity and the sweet influences of a mothers prayer to learn the trade of vengeance and destruction we have caused to ascend the crp ians cry and the widow s wail we have sacked cities overturned thefpursuits of peace and used our wealth science means and men for war upon a foreign soil truly is this matter the question ol today and the question not of politicians merely but of every individual who has heart or thought or conscience it is a question which should torment each one of us until it is answered how we shall do our pait towards right and justice how whatever evils may beial we may ieel tuut out consciences are tree from blame not yet in our country are the governed one caste and the governors another while therefore we are all interested we are all responsible in the name of the people of which we aie a part is this war waged to the extent therefore of our acquiescence by silenceby indifference by a lctalone policy are we really guilty about twelve years ago when the j idea of the annexation of texas to the united states was derided by men ol all parties as would lie the idea of the annexation of botany baywhen the politicians were asleep and saw no signs of the approaching evil there j proceeded from one w ho was regarded by them as a mere dreamer and the jorist and was directed to stick to his trade of preaching from the pulpit a word which was a voice of prophecy so literally has it been fulfilled at that time dr banning wrote his letter to henry clay on the annexation ol texas to the united states a letter which like the w arning of all prophets fell upon deaf and incredulous ears in this letter he says by this act our country will enter on a career of encroachment war and crime and will merit and incur the punishment arid woe of wrongdoing the seizure oj texas will not stand alone it will darken our future history it will be linked by an iron necessity to long continued deeds of rapine and blood i texas is a country conquered by our citizens and the annexation of it to our uni m will be the beginning of conquests which unless arrested and beaten back by a just and kind providence will stop onhj at the idhmus of darien henceforth we must cease to cry peace peace oir eagle trill uhrt no rirge its appetite on its first victim and will snuff a more tempting quarry more alluring blood in every new region which opens southward to annex texas is to declare perpetual war with mexico texas is the first step to mexico the moment we plant our authority on texas the boundaries of these tiro countries trill become nominal will be little more than lines on the sand of the seashore can mexico look without alarm on the approaches of this evergrowing tide is she prepared to be a passive prey to shrink and surrender without a struggle is she not strong in her hatred if not in her fortresses and skill strong enough to make war a dear and bloodij game even were the dispositions of our gov eminent most pacific and opposed to encroachment the annexation of texas would almost certainly embroil us with mexico have we counted the cost of establishing and making perpetual these hostile relations with mexico will wars begun in rapacity carried on so far from the centre of tlie confcd oraffon and of consequence little cheeked or c ihited b mjress add strength to our institutions or cement our union orexeit a healthy moral influence on rulers or people what limits can he set to tiie atrocities of such conflicts whnt limits to the treasures which mut be lavished on such distant borders what limits to the patronage and power which such distant expeditious must accumulate in the hands of the executive l are the blood and hardearned wealth of the older states to be poured out like water to protect and revenge a new people whose character and condition wffll plunge them into perpetual wrongs those words have now become historical fact they contain the whole explanation of the war in which we are noiv engaged r l hey were based on n knowledge of the essential principles of human nature a keen perception of the realities of national character and proceeded from one w ro wrote free from the bias of party and political ambition whose finer instincts were alive to the influences at work in the moral world of causes but no one believed in the necessity of the warning one year passed after another and the advocates of this measure were pursuing their work oji eraiing stealthily and steadily mo party dared to advocate the measure of annexation as is well known our massachusetts legislature in s protested against it in the strongest terms and both whigs and democrats united in the protest the cabinet of van buren when texas first applied in were unanimous in rejecting the proposal mr forsyth the secretary of state thus replied so long as texas shall remain at war while the i united state are at peace with her adversary the proposition of the texan miuiter plenipotentiary necessarily in rorcs the question of tear tedh that ad right is of xo sextruth is of no colorood is the father of us all and all we are brethren versary and again in mr van buren wrote as te tstbu men we cannot avoid the conclusion that the immediate annexation of texas would draw after it a war with mexico can it be expedient to attempt it could we hope to stand justified in the eyes of mankind for entering into such a war more especially i its commencement is to be preceded by the ajy propriation to our own uses of the territory the sovereignty of which is in dispute between tiro nations one of which we are to join in the struggle and henry clay wrote atthesime time annexation and tear with mexico are identical and a large meeting at new york composed of mm of both parties at the same time unanimously adopted the following resolution reported by a prominent democrat resolved that the annexation of texas to this union as now contemplated would according to the acknowledged lairs of nations he a positive declaration of war against mexico a war of conquest and an unjust war in which this nation would be supported by no sense of right and be condemned by the unanimous voice of the civilized and christian world what else could be made of it mexico was at war with texas we had an existing treaty with mexico then in full force which stipulated that there should be a firm inviolable and universal peace and a true and sincere friendship between the united states ol america and the united mexican states in all the extent of their possessions now what can be said of the measure of incorporating as a pait of our territory and thus adopting all her quarrels a nation with which mexico wasat war and which she claimed the right at any moment of invading what if the canadas had become separated from great britain and we had thus incorporated the territory into our own according to the law of nations would not war have been inevitable with great britain would this deed think you have been dared what it south carolina had carried out her plan of nullification had thrown off all connection with the united states and war having followed england had entered even into an alliance with that state would not england have expected to go to war with our country also it is indeed too plain a point to be argued and so gen houston thought for lie says very coolly in congress when the senate w as deliberating may on the war message it is now too late to deliberate texas and mexico have been long at war and the united states became a party to thatj war in consenting to annexation j why gen jackson in ist even in regard to the minor point of acknowledging the independence of texas says the acknowledgment of a new state as independent is at all times an act of great delicacy and responsibility but more especially so when such aj state has forcibly separated itself from another which still claims dominion over it a premature recognition under these circumstances if not looked upon as justifiable cause of war is ahvays liable to be looked upon as proof of an unfriendly spirit to one of the contending parties but time passed on the slave power blind to all rights where its own prosperity was concerned used to trample upon the rights of man nursed in oppression and force this power wasat work and resolved upon annexation in spite of all danger the law of nations treaties and protests a new slavemarket must be opened texas must be secured to us forever from becoming an independent free state or ourdomestic institution will be very shortlived mr upshur said in in the virginia convention if it sh ud be our lot to acquire texas the price of slaves will rise and when it was feared that texas would abolish slavery the secretary of state tiie same mr upshur ii wrote to our minister in texas that the establishment in the very midst of our slaveholding states of an independent government forbidding the existence of slavery could not faij to produce the most unhappy effects there could not be any security for that species of property and in he wrote to our minister in england if texas should not be attached to the united states we cannot inaintoiu that institution teu years and so the slave interest labored with dogged perseverance caring little for reproach or opposition its work was aided by the cunning texans who played upon the fears hopes and ambition of the imbecile tylernow talking of abolition now of a union with englaud all of which has been since confessed by those most interested to have been the veriest humbug and pretence and when the treaty of annexation with texas was finally concluded mr calhoun then secretary of state had the sublime audacity to tvrite to mr pakenham tlie british minister that it was made necessary in order to preserve domestic institutions and deemed essential to their safely atul prosperity after tins treaty was rejected by the senate as is well known texas was admitted by a joint resolution which passed tbc house on the th december and the senate on the jjd december she was admitted with a constitution sufficiently re prbtican and just to satisfy the most bigoted slavedriver of south carolina it provided that aftnersons of color who were slaves for v should remain lin the like state of servitude and that congress should pass no laws to prohibit emigrants from the united states of america from bt inging their slaves into the republic with them that coo rochester n y friday february  gress should have no power to emancipate slaves and that no slaveholder should be allowed to emancipate his or her slaves and that no free person ol african descent should be permitted to reside permanently in the republic such was the precious we took from mexico but in saying this i wrong mexico herself for while texas was a province of mexico according toher laws the alave who trod upon the soil became a freeman these shining beauties of the jewel were brought outas preparatory measures to fit her for joining our free and glorious union what now on the consummation of i this measure could mexico do could it not have been suffered that after all her wrongs and the contempt which had been put upon her threats and cotn elaints after the appropriation y a professed friend and ally of the territory for which she was at war after thus humiliating her pride and setting at naught her entire national existence could it not have been suffered that she should manifest some sense of injury and make some exhibition of wounded honor what could the mexican minister do but demand his passports and return to his government what could mexico do but break off all diplomatic intercourse mexico according to the received laws of nations would have been justified at once in proceeding to war for she formally announced to our government that she would regard the measure of annexation as a declaration of war but mexico was weak distracted powerless to contend and therefore a little harmless blustering should have been permitted to assuage hcjti irritation she did not give way qven to this she preserved her dignity in the midst of her most burning desire of vengeance when the consul of the united states was directed by the president to ascertain from the mexican government whether it would receive an envoy intrusted with full powers to adjust all the questions in dispute between the two governments the minister of foreign relations penay pena replied that although the mexican nation was deeply injured by hie united states his government was disposed to receive the commissioner of the united states who might come with full powers from his government to settle tlie present dispute in a peaceful reasonable and honorable manner here was an opportunity for our government if it had been inclined to peace to have commenced the settlement of the existing difficulties but instead of sending a commissioner such as mexico agreed to receive our government sent a man of no national reputation a mere hack politician without dignity and without the requisite qualifications to act in such an emergency john slidell of louisiana as minister plenipotentiary to residt near the government of mexico this was a direct and palpable insult t mexico it supposed that he governments were on an entirely friendly footing it ignored all causes of complaint and injury and as might have been anticipated the popular feeling in mexico would not allow the minister tc be received the mexican minister replied to mr slidells request to be accredited as envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary that the supreme government of mexico cannot admit his excellency mr slidell to the exercise of the functions of the mission conferred on him by the united states government but that he will have the utmost pleasure in treating with mr slidell as soon as he shall have presented credentials authorizing him expressly and exclusively to settle the questions which have disturbed the harmony and good understanding between the two republics and which will bring on w ar between them unless such settlement be effected in a satisfactory manner why did not our government if it had been really desirous of peace recall its minister and send such a commissioner as mexico desired but so far from doing this it anticipated and seemed to welcome this rejection secretary buchanan writes to mr slidell in march that in the event of the refusal of the mexican government to receive him in the capacity of resident minister he is so to conduct himself as to throw the whole odium of the failure of the negotiations upon the mexican government in the meantime in anticipation of the final refusal of the mexican government to receive you the president lias ordered the army of texas to advance and take position on tlie left hank of the rio grande and has directed that a strong fleet shall be assembled in the gult ot mexico mistaking entire ly the temper of the mexican government which wanted only some little sop to its wounded pride and to gain time by delay for the passions and prejudices of the people to subside the blundering slidell writes home to the secretary of state that the mexican people must be convinced by hostile deroonstraiinns that our differences must be settled promptly and accordingly on the lkh of january gen taylor was ordered to advance to the rio grande on the th of april taylor had mounted a battery of eighteen pounders which u his own w ord w ere brought to bear upon the public square of matamoras and within good range for demolishing the town and two weeks after this an officer in our army wrote as fidlows camp opposite matamoras april our situation here is an extraordinary one right in the enemy country actually occupy ing their corn and cotton fields the people of the soil leaving their homes and we with a fmall handful of men marching with colors flying ux i drums beating right under the ven guns of one ol their principal cities displaying the starspangled banner at if in defiance under thiir very nose and they with an army twice as largf as ourssit quietly down and make not the least resistancenot the first effort to drive the invaders off there is nr parallel to it truly there is no parallel to it forthe army of the u state was then encamped on territory which no one can deny was doubtful territory for if texas had once made a claim tc it mexico claimed it too it does not matter whsfther the bouudarv claimed by texag extended to the rio grande or not avas it right for our government to advance an army for the purpose of occupation upon this disputed ground while the question of boundary was unsettled never would it have dared thus to send an army into the disputed territory of maine for this would assuredly have been a cause of war with england and moreover texas was annexed with no fixed boundaries for the joint resolution expressly provides that said state shall be formed subject to the adjustment of all questions of boundary that mny arise with other governments and for more than a hundred years had mexico possessed settlements on both banks of the river her customhouses had never been interfered with by the texans and in the upper portion of this valley there were villages of thousands ol inhabitants who had never seen a texan officer exacting any kind of submission or respect the army of tht united states was encamped on that soil which to incorporate into the union as a part of texas mr benton had declared would be an act of direct aggression upon mexico for all the consequences of which the united states would stand responsible what could have been expected but collision and bloodshed on the th of april a party of dragons attacked a superior force of the enemy and after losing sixteen men were compelled to surrender this may be considered as the actual commencement of the war on receiving news of this event the president sent a message to congress recommending the appropriation of men and money fur the war and by an almost unanimous votecongress passed such a bill with the assertion in its preamble that wav existed by the act of mexico this is the beginning of that series of events which at an incredible waste of lives and of money has placed the american army in the capital of mexico in reading impartially this page of history the impression is forced upon the mind that a singular spirit of blindness and perverse obtuseness seems to have possessed the minds of our rulers they seem to have acted like men who were under the influence of some fatality so that they could net see anyway of escape but must march on blindfold to the pit of slaughter and thus docs all history open to us the retributive justice of an overruling providence it is in vain when entered upon the career of evil to say thus far sin must pluck on sin unless there be a true repentance he who would keep the rewards of sin must sin yet farther and the fatal flitting light of corruption leads him onward to perdition mr calhoun the inasterspirit of annexation thinks he could have avoided the war satisfied with the spoils already earned for his favorite system he thinks that if the army had remained at corpus christi there would have been no conflict but providence knows no ifs onward must the mighty stream advance and no cunning hand can stay its progress with the cancer of slavery feeding upon our system this war was inevitable it must rush on until the awful voice of jehovah thunders thus far here shall thy proud wave bestayed the north with a fatal spirit of acquiescence ha submitted toone encroachment after another upon the spirit of freedom and uow floated upon the surface it is borue along to share the retribution there remains but one way of escape slavery that hvdra which but gains in strength from every act of feeble opposition and tame submission must be slain it is smitten of god with madness it rushes on with fatal blindness aud increasing filly and yet we are ail foolishly slumbering at every new victory of the accursed system some feeble cry is raised that this encroaching evil must be opposed henceforth and then ai is stffl the representatives from the north to save some little remnant of selfrespect lbe last moment when resistance is no avail utter a feeble dont we warn youthenwhen all is overand the evil is consummated join in the exulting shout and toast our ccuuiry howsoever bounded a war in its defence however iniquitous a measure however wrong has but to be entered upon and then they pronounce it right to aid in its completion the assembled w of the nation for a party purpose vote what they know to be a solemn lie governors falling into the current exhort the peaceful citizens to go forth and fight thi battle ot slavery appeal to their patriotism and lend their official influence to sanction the deeds of blood the ghosts of men who were killed politically because they dared ta contend for what they considered right haunt the miserable deep of our modern statesmen and so they dare nut move or cry or let their voice be heard in street or council and thus stooping to a false and corrupting popular standard crouching with fear they huzza for the glories f our country lend fheir aid to furnish of men and money give their children to pain through the tire of the false god of j war join in the exulting shout of victory praise the success of our glorious armies and lament that they aic too old to join in the noble work of slaying mexicans to be covtimed from tbt tribune fitblic lands several bills have already been proposed to the two houses of congress respectively purporting to contemplate the benefit of actual settlers on the publie lands by graduating or reducing the price of these which have j been longest in the market extending the term of preemption btc but as yet we believe no bill has been sul milled striking at the root of the real j evil the mischief is not that settlers snatch lands which rightfully belong toother settlers nor that the government j charges too high a price for them but that speculation forestalls the settler with regard to the choicest locations and presses hard upon the poor pioneer who is barely able to wrest a scanty livelihood from the h useless patch of wilderness he has undertaken to make a farm of reduce the price to sixpence an acre and leave the lands open to appropriation in unlimited quantities and the evil now felt will be j essentially aggravated and only the sooner become utterly intolerable what j is needed is a stringent limitation of the area of lands now public which any person can henceforth purchase and retain whether directly of the govern merit or at secondhand and to this wt j must ultimately come if the divine j purpose that each man should lahoi for his own subsistence and eat bread in the sweat of his own face is not tobe subverted here as entirely as it has already been throughout the old world no change can be effected which does not involve and effect the i limitation of public land sales to actual settlers and cultivators cnlyj though we shall welcome any change which does not facilitate and stimulate the ravages of speculation we nope and trust that the present session oij congress will not close without witnessing some earnest and powerful endeavor to secure the public land henceforth to the people who wish toj settle and cultivate them as mr smith of la has already proposed his bill of which notice was given some two or three weeks since has not

improvement and elevation of the oppressed tnd advancing the cauac of pure religion in this proud and scornful nation we do not wish to alarm mr collins but we must tell him that bs craft is in danget the question raised is one that must be discussed the spirit of equal human brotherhood and the oneness of the human family is abroad and will test the sbundness of even colored churches the questions which intelligent colored men feel bound to ask the advocates of separate religious organizations are nor to be evadod nor ridiculed nor winked out of sight by priestly cunning and appeals to prejudice whatever may have been the motive for establishing colored churches or whatever may have been the good resulting from their establishment the time has come when it vs quite proper to inquire into their character and to pronounce upon their good or evil effects no considerations of a personal nature shall prevent us from speaking our sentiments on this subject or any other connected with our progress in moral religious and social improvement we have no party to serve or sectarian ends to gain if the colored people cannot take the north star because it speaks of their inconsistencies aswell as the meanness of their oppressors why then it must go ou without their support forspeak we must and will that white ministers and churches linked as they are with the bloodstained church and evangelical man stealers of the south should seek to turn ofl our assaults and shelter themselves from our rebukes is natural and to be expected but that a colored man one of the oppressed and despised of our land should take tip his pen lo write for a proslavery paper in defence of those churches and ministers is painfully tmazing what can be the motive of such aman can he be sane and if so can he be lonesl below is an extract from the letter ot vlr collins in the springfield gazette copied rom the republican but mr douglass did net seem satisfied ith laboring to prove thesntire corruption f the american churches he strove to discourage the formation of colored churches stigmatizing them as negro pews on a higher scale and calling in question the motives of those who would encourage such churches now would the gentleman allow none of hfo own complexion to minister at the altar of god ay ould he annihilate the ministry that labors especially to elevate and improve his brethren suppose the eighteen colored churches in philadelphia were to be disbanded and merged into w hite congregations then their present ministers must cease their ministrations or lie settled over white congregations which is impossible there never w ere but two cases of the kind in this country and expediency seems to dictate the propriety of selecting a w hite minister w here the majority in the parish are white cannot an honest mind at orce the perfect propriety of a colored minister ministering to people of his own kind is it reason to argue that there should not be a common interest and sympathy between minister and people is good to by gained by w erking against nature ihink not that wc form a separate church because wc have not confidence in the goodwill of our while brethren their aid is cordia ly welcomed but we prefer an organization most natural and congenial with nur own tastes and feelings believing that thereby we shall secure a higher degree of selfculture in all our social and moral re lations the churches and ministers and proslavery press will probably keep silent on the subject while they can have a black minister to defend them he can do for them what they are unable to do for themselves his colored skin seems to them a protection from the shafts of antislavery rebuke they undoubtedly look upon him with about the same emotions of pleasure with which a slaveholder looks upon a contented slaveone who would not leave massa for the world yve shall not spare mr collins on account of his color we ask no favors on account of ours and wc shall grant none on account of his he says w c were not satisfied with lalorinp to prove the entire corruption of the american churches this was very criminal in bn regard but worse yet we strove to discourage the formation of colored churchesstig matizing them as negro pews on a higliet scale y t e plead guilty to the charge yt do ortoinlt regard than as ngro pnes on t higher and larger scale iuaof is a prtc f it is this a part of a house of wen ship assigned especially to colored people ot the ground that colored people are offcnsiti to white people and should be separate fron them yvliat is a colored church a ply of worship especially assigned to colored persons and entirely separate from w hite persons in what does it differ from the negn pew simply in location and ditnension there is no moral difference between them yyegire it as our deliberate conviction tha separate religious organizations and negn pews for the especial and exclusive use o colored persons originated in most unhol ard unnatuial prejudices that they are mere counterpart of colonization mnd that ihei existence is a serious injury to tlie best interests of the colored people at variance mitl the glorious cause of liberty and human equality and so far from being in accordance whl the will or purposes of our heavenly father they are diametrically opposed to the spirit an precepts of the gospel of christ then view s we shall maintain and defend at bom and abroad offend or pleaae whom it may among white oppressors or colored aemlcs mr collins says we railed in question thi motives of thoss meaning we suppose whit persons who would encourage rurh churches mt certainly wc do yy rail in questim tbs motifs of any white tmm whn wontt help plans ns safsils of awy portion of tbn christian chamh on niiisl of the color of omr skin aa in what mr collins mys abottt flawing any of oar own nplnhm to mm mtisr si the ahsr of god tha qaestim is impertinent we are in favor of mistoten who arc really qualified to tearb bet their color be what it may we look upon color as being no part of a suitable qualification of a christian minister white minister is as good as a black one for us mr fouins asks cannot an honest mind see at once the perfect propriety of a colored minister ministering to people of his n kind f we answer that when mr collins can show that colored people need moral and religious instruction differing from that of other people his question will be in point yve bcliete in the doctrine that god lias made of one blood all natioos of men for to dwell upon all the face of the earth and in the essential oneness of the human family and that all men are brothers we know nothing and care nothing for the artificial mnd conventional distinctions set up by wicked men until white ministers can be as deeply interested for the salvation of the souls of black men as they appear to be for those of white men we shall regard them as liars and hypocrites and if black men care any more for llie salvation of black men than white they hare mistaken their call to go into all the world and preach the gospel to evert creature mr collins says he prefers organizations most natural and congenial to his oicn tasted so does henry clay when he would hare us all sent out of the country so does every negro hater that objects to colored and white children going to the same school so does every steamboat company which denies the equal rights of colored persons on board their vessels so says the haughty hotel keeper who spares from his table a respectable colored traveller when he asks for accommodation so say the rail road companies that maintain distinction on account of color in the use of their cars so say the white lyceums and literary associations which exclude persons on account of their complexion so say the white proslavery and slavcholding churches which will not bow at the com i munion table with the despised black man and last not least so says the recreant reverend mr collins who though a black man himself is willing for the sake of gaining the good will of his oppressors to play the part of a clerical sycophant shame on him it has long been the desire of our enemies to deepen and widen the line of separation between the white and colored people of thus country and to establish the conviction that nature required this separation to accomplish this all sorts of schemes have been resorted torcoored temperance societies colored schools colored odd fellows and colored churches have been encouraged by the very men who hate us and wish to get rid of us some of these institutions we have deemed necessary in our present circumstances excluded as wc are from the like institutions among the whites but we have ever looked forward to the time when it would be our duty to abandon all complexional institutions and go for equal and universal brotherhood and demand admission to all institutions enjoyed by other men that time in our humble judgment has now conic at least in the northern states of this union we would to god that on the very next sabbath every colored church could be abandoned and their members make their way to the white churches from which they cams out and demand admission on equal terms with white persons such a demonstration would do more to open the eyes of the public to the character of our wrongs than any other which we can now think of yve also believe that with the light which sixteen years aeitation has thrown on this subject the example of europe anti the word of god in their hands the churches would not dare exclude us from the house of prayer or proscribe us when once admitted come brethren let us be men equal menchristians and equal christians let us show that we know our rights and mean to assert them their assertion will do us good and will do our white fellow countrymen no harm though we should test their christianity come let us try it yve shall discuss this subject further in our next itt in reply to the letter of mr walker which will be found in another column we have only to say that we wrote down the sum collected as it was announced at the time by mr green one of the financial committee we regret that our friend should feel disturbed on account of our mention of his destitute condition our readers bowj ever will see that the matter is made very little better by the letter of mi walker himself our friend takes exception to our saying that his discourse was wade up chiefly of i statements respecting his own sufferings in behalf of the cause now if our readers will refer to the letter from west winfield i they will see that tlicre is scarcely a shadow of difference between our statement and mri walkers own the statement on this point to which he objects reads thus mr walkers discourse was thvfiy majt vp of his own sufferings in behalf of the cause and exhorting others to follow his example j now in what do we differ why in this mr walker thinks he said little and we thought he said much about his sufferings in behalf the cause as to the stateim nt respecting the sad condition in which the family of our friend wees living at plymouth we are glad to have he picture in any measure relieved as it now seems to be by the letter of our friend walker if we have in any degree misrepresented our friend it was by no means intentional on our part we have no doubt that the impression made upon our mind by the speech of our friend st west winfield was the same as that made on the minds of nine tenths of the audience new state besides the new states tobe carved out of mexico the washington correspondent of the charleston courier states that the committee on territories will doubtless propose four new territorial governments in our present limitsnamely

are based on the most shallow apprehension of the character of the ruling power in this country the present unholy war is not the accident of a day but the result of long years of national transgression pride and ambition when once in the full possession of a nations heart and roused to action cannot easily be expelled by means this side of national ruin we are a ruined people we have given ourselves up to the blind spirit of mad ambition the war will be carried on the bones of many more american citizens must be added to the thousands now bleaching on the plains of mexico the slaughter of mexicans must be continued and the government of that country annihilated before this wicked war can cease some hopes of peace have been predicated on our national lore of money but glory has no time for monetaiy considerations especially while the idea of making mexico pay for her own invasion can be held out to blind the eyes of the american people while we can make the mexican government pay our soldiers for invading her territory and blowing out the brains of her citizens no rational prospect of a peace with that nation can be predicated on our fears of a national debt itis impossible to induce the people of this country to feel or to flunk of either the ex penso or wickedness of this war unless they are brought to their senses by a direct tax and this is out of the question the whigs are opposed to directtaxation and the democrats arc in favor of a vigorous prosecution of the war and the people arc intoxicated with military glory peace therefore for the present cannot take place slavery treachery and mad ambition are at the head of the government in the person of james k polk and the means of checking them are naught we can only bear our testimony clear oar own skirts and await the catastrophe of our national crimes what that will be is known only to the most high the sovereign ruler of the universe but whatever it may be our duty will have been done and a righteous god will save those who have done their duty and put their trust in him the rams morna recent number of this paper contains an article from the pen of its editor on the divisions in the antislavery ranks with some of which we agree but from most of which we dissent we deem the article unfortunate indiscreet ungrateful untruthful and mischievous no one can regret more than we do the unhappy divisions among abolition its they are constant grief to us but to class all the various parties aad divisions together under one general condemnation without any regard to the causes which separated them is a most unjust mode of treating the subject and in this opinion we think the editor of the rams horn will agree on further reflection we can see no good reason for such an article and are at a loe to divine the motive which led to its publication we copy the following extracts as fair specimens of the tone of the whole article but alas the time came when these friends of the slave who had united for such a high and noble object were divided into parties and instead of laboring to overthrow slavery and prejudice they are striving with all their might to prop up their parties and isms and now we behold liberty party liberty league old organisation new or ganixation and we know not how many mom titles and each of these parties must of course have their big men and these men j must be supported thousands of dollars j must be raised every year to support these i parties mark you this money is used to support these parties not to benefit the colored man the charge that monies are rained to support these parties and their big men and not to advance the cause of the colored manto our mind is a most ungrateful calumny we are pained to be compelled to apeak thus of one we esteem so highly as we have ever done the editor ofjtorams horn i why njfsome colored man re reiving a salary of a thousand dollars a year i from some of these parties whv are not colored wn employed

the matter where it now england and military defence the friends of peace in england have been roused to life and activity by the recent letter of the duke of wellington calling for increased military defences of that country ir j pmied meetings opposing ibis new effort to increase the burdens of the people have been held in various places and from all appearances the measure will meet with decided and successful opposition among the people of that country at a meeting in the tower hamlets presided orer by our friend and the worlds friend george thompson m p elihu burritt made the following statements which are well calculated to awaken manful opposition to the present mischievous measure for increasing the military power of england and all other countries whose people take time to think mr elihu burritt regretted to see that the measures which they were met to discuss j had been agitated in this country because if england began to increase her military cstab lishnients other nations would be likely to follow her example he had calculated that the workingman had paid ol taxes since the peace of as it was call jed and since the people of england j had expended more by than the total exports from this mighty world of industry all governments were too ready to act upon the old roman maxim of divide and govern and the great brotherhood of the people had been subjugated by setting them against each other in bloodstained fields of battle during the last vears england had been at war with france for o of those years and the expenses w hich they occasioned would purchase every acre in the kingdom at l an acre mr ilurritt then read a fraternal address w hich had been sent by the people of havre to the people of southampton and said that the estimates for the french

greatly to break up proslavery feeling remove prejudice against the cause aad liberalize the public mind very mueh yet remains to be done to arouse the hearts and actively interest the sympathies of the peoplo in earnest efforts to break every yoke in a population of sixteen thousand there are twelve hundred colored people of whom threequarters are from the southern house of bondage all these find sympathy and a home here and a more orderly industrious and welltodo class of people cannot be found in any community it was here that douglass in his flight from his oppressors stopped and found rest here he found friends a local habitation and a roc here he attended the first antislavery meeting where were gathered earnest women and men whose hearts beamed with sympathy for gods poor giving them lipe a fire of eloquence that aroused the sla verycrushed energies of his noble nature and the man was truly bom the announcement of douglass name foi an address is enough to secure a large turnout his address on sunday afternoon was delivered to a large audience he spoke of the corruptness of the national character as indicated by the annexation of texas for the extension the war with the mexican republic for the reestablisment of slaverythe love of military glorythe spirit of conquest that possesses the american heart a few years since and it was thought impossible to get us into a war but the voice of slavery is for war at the command of slavery the nation precipitates itself into a war with its neighbor a weak and misruled state and to sustain the war pours out its treasures and blood like water in the face of heaven shouting our country right or wrong we have done this armed with unrighteousness wc are warring with the almighty shall we succeed no no we may seem to succeed but victory will prove defeat at last and be made the instrumentality by which this proud nation shall be brought low our etatcmtcn may eloquently assert it is our destiny the press catch up

have entered upon our career the end is not vet the prophetic spirit of the age as it bids us listen to the voices of the old nations points ns to the result and need have we to tremble for our country when we reflect that god s justice cannot always sleep lie spoke of the colonization scheme of the great meeting lately held in washington city at which mr clay the great representative and exponent of colonization delivered an address douglass examined sonic of ihe arguments of mr clay in a powerful manner showed their w eakness and injustice and by referring to many acts and words in his lifeas well as by quoting parts of his address lifted off the covering of cant and pretended philanthropy with which mr clay knows so well how to dress up and give an air of sanctity to the whole system exposing it to tha viewa morally diseased and hideous creature godless and from beneath we could have exclaimed away with it from the face of the earth i could not help wishing then that mr clay and douglasscould be permittedon equal terms to discuss this question before the nation at w ashington hat a spectacle a negro and recently a slave debating with the demosthenes of the nation a subject one of the most important before the country believing thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just and he but naked though locked up in steel whose conscience with injustice is corruptedno matter for mr clays advantages in education age experience and positionl should not fear or the result years ago said lie mr garriscn exposed colonization to us since then iis whole conduct has but corroborated his judgment it is our deadly enemy we shall not obey its wishes but shall do that which mr clay wishes us not to do we shall stay acre in our country identified with the slave laboring to obtain our rights and his and we shall secure them through the last ten years are strewn the evidences of the past the tokens of our fotiue success the hand of providence is with and guides us crusls us to the earth and we rise again try to starve us and we grow strong and vigorous close up your hearts legislate against us ant try to make us hate the land of our birth and we love it tiie

telegraph oomnuiaicauos from point to point subduing the elements is ds your r bidding a flood of light sad knowledge is sweeping over the nation how is it psaibl to keep three millions of slaves in

hold religious bodies with their almost omnipotent instrumentalities for good os evil as responsible for the giant sins of the age and especially for american slavery what are the conferences synods presbyteries and religious conventions allover the land doing upon this question with few exceptions opposing its progress tilling discussion furnishing scriptural argui rnents either to justify their criminal neglect i in passing by on the other side the wounded and bleeding victims of slavery or in the support of slavery here he read extracts from a sermon written by bishop lledding tobe preached to slaves founded upon the golden rule all things whatsoever ye would that m m do unto you do ye even to unto them i verily thought that to enforce the doctrines of that rule would be to abolish j slavery that if being held as a slave wc should wish to be made free so holding another as a slave it would be our duty to restore him to liberty it seemed a simple truth respecting which none could err i could imagine no other interpretation and no other but a slaveholding divine or u proslavery theologian would dare give it any oilier interpretation but hear bishop lled ding explain if you slaves were in your masters places and your masters were in yours you would wish them to obey you at all times in your presence and when you were absent then ince in the providence of god you are slaves you should obey your masters not with eye serviceas men pleasers but as servants doing the will of god from the heart all things whatsoever c is not this wrenching scripture into the support of an unholy thing just heaven and arc j these thy ministers douglass in closing his remarks made an appeal to the friends of the cause bidding them go on as heretofore with the approbation of god and

inisaole upon the free thought and free expression of their fellowcitizens the land of the free is it what misnomer what a mockery what an insul to the name of liberty that is not freedom of discussion in which only one party i allowed to speak that is not freedom of in quirv which looks only at one side of ai argument that is notcannot be a frc country in which if an editor expresses himself on any subject in a way that happens no to coincide with popular sentiment he expose himself to the midnight assaults of lawlessness and ignorance this then is not a frei country it is a country iu which men an bought and sold and outraged and held it bondage and the american people not beinj themselves imbued with the true spirit o freedom arc even now attempting to fasten yoke of bondage on the neck of a neighboring republic their deeds are evil and wi not bear exposure therefore it is tha when an editor rebukes the jierpetrators o those evil deeds and exposes their bascnesi

thought the real pioneer of progress errors abound iniquity prevails a monstrous wickedness it being committed by our country men sigh amid the evils of ignorance and injustice and liccause an editor attempts to remove the one to expose the other he is assaulted mobbed injured w hy is it that the land rings not with the sound of the outrage upon the editor of the i charter oak in hartford why is it that when not more than two months since incanton ohio an editor sixty years of age was dragged from his bed and beaten unmercifully because he dared to speak plainly about certain officers who were recruiting for the mexican army in that part of the country little if any notice is taken of the fact how comes it that such atrocities ss these are passed over by the press in almost utter silence it can be accounted for only on the ground that they too are under the influence of the miserable conquest mania which is gnawing like a cancer at the heart of the american people that they too crave more bloodnmre glory and care not that the atrocity of the mexican war and the w icked ness of its instruments should be made mani fest such however is the invariable consequence of any transgression by a nation of the laws of eternal justice and morality it corrupts and vitiates the very heartfountains of the entire people every attempt that is made to exeuse or palliate the crime produces a plentiful harvest in the destruction of moral sentiment and right feeling and the result of the wholecrime palliation apology will be the retarding for years of the progress of humanity at the present time the corrupting influence of the mexican war upon popular sentiment is obvious enoughit is mischievous enough hut when the men who have been employed in this wicked crusade of rapine violence and slaughter shall return with degraded natures to their peaceful homes and families in the quiet towps and villages of our country how much more apparent and how fearful will be the inarch of demoralization and iniquity it is still true as ever in reference to such transgression sow the wind and ye shall reap the whirl wind but the cowardly and ruffianly attempt of the myrmidons of war in hartford to gag the editor of the charter oak will not be successful he says wc iend to do right to be true to our convictions of duty to speak out unfalteringly as we have heretofore spoken in conj damnation of the rapacity of our government of its infernal crusade against mexico and of all who intelligently participate in the crime we intend to strip off the mask of glory with which interested demagogues seek to hide tfic grim visage of war and show the ugly bloodsmeared visage beneath it our pen our tongue our press shall be free i brute violence may destroy them but while they have the power of utterance at all it shall be a free and fearless utterance it is well that there are some such spirits as the editor of the charter oak in our land else were there not reason to fear

themselves with little work and that sufficient labor cannot be had j and that all the whits inhabitants able to leave the island have gone sway the dif fore nee of export is proof enough of the means

from the tyrannical avaricious slavedriver to the free workingj man and if jamaica or any other island ornation or united states cannot thrive without slave labor then they ought not to thrive and the

winfield fair and meetings statements made respecting myself which need a little cor j rcction not that i charge the reporter with any intention of misrepresenting what i said or what i meant to say the report says mr walkers discourse was chiefly made up of statements respecting his own suffer ings if my memory is not very defective very little of my remarks consisted of statements of my sufferings and what i did say in allusion to them was if possible to induce others to the great work before them and place in the hands of their neighbors andi children the means of information respecting the condition of f he slaves and their claims on us and our kidnapping government there wxs one statement respecting his poverty which he madethat his family were now living in a miserable cabin in plymouth the only covering of which was apiece of cotton cloth i am confident i did not say in so many words that the only covering cf my miserable cabin was a piece of cotton doth but i that it was composed of a few rough boards battened with laths on the sides and overhead was covered with a piece of cotton cloth i here remark to prevent being misunderstood that the top of the cabin is nearly flat with common cotton sheeting lacked over it and paid with turpentine to make it shed water this being put up with my own hands in a hurry was the best i could do to shelter my family from the elements and the materials of this i am yet in debt for w ithout the means of paying it is a little too bad that a man who has suffered as mr walker has done in the cause of the slave and who labors as he now does should be allowed to live in such extreme destitution as he now does or to be compelled to expose his poverty before every meeting he addresses this idea that i make it a part of my discourse to make statements respecting my poverty which is very incorrect for itis seldom i make mention of it in public and should not have made the statement i did at winfield had i not been requested to do so while speaking the collection taken up on the occasion was loss instead of more than ten dollars it was more however than all the collections taken up for us since leaving home in

railroad is in successful operation over one thousand slaves from opa state alone j having escaped to canada west and whereas the climate is more congenial with tbeir health and prosperity than the

not able to take care of themselves they are able to take off themselves d that we congratulate all fugitive slaves who have set their feet on free soil or whom iy hereafter do so and rejoice with them in the enjoyment of a right guaranteed them bylaw namely the right of attf defence d resolved that we recommend to all such persons to defend themselves agcnal ail attempts made by slaveholders

hardly believe that he will allow himself to be made the instrument and beneficiary of such corruption even though his party require it wa shalli see the state the country and the american character are involved in the issue s from the liberty bell come and do it better the err is often raided against the antislaver folk thejr work is agood one the end srood perhaps the motivehut the method foolish and the spirit bad we also hate slavery in the abstract res more we hate it in the concrete hut we do not like the measure of the antislavery men and we dishke their spirit to all such we say that sound i very honestyou like the aim but not the means come and do it better there is room enough and to spare il i you hate slavery abstract and concrete let your hatred appear in your action if you like not our path travel in your own with what progress you may and j g d eked you say we if you like not our society rr our name why work in simh company as you will andi with such a name as you shell get only work then are two ways of criticising an actionone is to st down and tell how bad the action is how faulty hou inadequate the other isto set exnrn j pies of better actions one is criticism by censure the other criticism by creation now the antislavery men i have been so abundantly blessed with i the first kind of criticism that they are almost afraid it is lost upon them pray give them a little of the latter criticise them by example reform their bad hand by setting them a good copy the politicianthat is the partyman j says hut the antislaverv men actually abuse the state we like their work not their abuse to such we say again come and do it better oppose slavery prevent its extension get it ended and all that without abusing the state only oppose it manfully openly and with a continual frontas the democrats oppose protection as the whigs freetrade you say the antislavery men do not like the constitution call it proslavery and the like so they are enemies of their country they have small reason for liking the constitution as it is now itis no great wonder that a mail who bclives all men are created equal endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rightsshould dislike that part of the constitution which perpetuates slavery which binds men to defend slavery to bear arms in its behalf to pay money for supporting it to deliver up a fugitive who makes his declaration of independencesetting up on his own unalienable right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness remove this blot out of the constitution and no antislavery man as such will quarrel with itbut as things now go the defender of the constitution as it is as onr fathers left it t us isin daiiger of becoming a defender not of freedom but of slavery nat a friend to his country but a foe who fastens about her neck a millstone which must at last drown her in the depths of that sea which swallows up wicked states get a constitution which does not protect the robber of men and what antisaverv man will wag his tongue against it oppose slavery iri your own way without abusing the state the sectarianthe man of a theological party says likewise but the antislavery men abuse the churches speak ill of the orthodoxy of our times and have no great faith in the clergy themselves we like their work but not their abuse of the churches to them also we say come and do it better oppose slavery with the same zeal that you oppose heresy infidelity unbelief and without abusing the churches slighting the orthodoxy ol the day or without underrating the clergyonly oppose it take as much pains to teach mmsttanity with all that belongs thereto the whole counsel of godto the slave and the master in the united states as you take to send missionaries to india china and the sandwich islands perhaps the negro ou the gaboon river docs not need a missionary to help save his soul more than the negrodriver on the potomac or the cattahooclr the heathenism of eastern nations is very hadno doubt but the heathenism of america is a little nearer at hand uml more inexcusable but oppose slavery if you can and not oftend the churches is it true that the antislavery men speak ill of the churches except so far as those churches uphold slavery by speech or silencer it has net yet been shown in opposing churches church doctrines and churchservants the antislavery men only meant to oppose them so far as they upheld slavery surety they never thwarted the efforts of any church which aimed to promote goodness and piety amongst men put suppose they have erred a little in opposing the churches which never liked an opponent and you see the error why extend a little charity toward them criticise them bravely by setting a better example while sparing the churches contend you with all vour might against slavery the old opponents of savery will never disturb you the slave shall bless ou one day the churches shall call you a saint which is a trifle today the angel of the churches shall sav well done good and faithful ser vant good sber quiet inensay the antislavery men are light in the main slavery is not the only wrong of our times but the worst and the most inexcusable w e find little fault with what they say about the state or the churches thinking that pretty well deserved but they quarrel with one another the old school is bigoted the eibcrty party sectarian both hate oneanother in st cordially nnd wust their lives in mutual coulcnmn we like their w ork but not their quarrels to such likewise we say come and d it better do it without bigotry without sectarianism without quarrelling but be sure and do it quarrelling i no new thing sometimes tie re has been a little jarring among political nipnone has known of such things at conventions when only
