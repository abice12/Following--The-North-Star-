mr editor l find it useless to write to men who do not heed or cannot comprehend the ideas i may convoy and who judging from the matter of the editorial of the samples of your paper sent ire attempt more the rhetoric of words than the imparting of solid knowledge in all the mass of verbiage which you write for that press how little of ideas are conveyed and of these ideas how little accurate do you really understand yourselves as white folks see your reasoning have taken a glance over some few of your editorials and although i observe the exhibition of some talents the bulk o their purports falls far below the condensed or even diffuse argumentation of able white editors know not that you have any white assistant to correct and dress up your effusions but they are not such as men properly pretending to or conscious of equal parts and capacities with any other people on the globe would write take one example elaborate with f ihis reasoning to his own people january th last lie said that the colored people c annot find a state by themselves in new mexico or anywhere not beyond gunshot of the anglosaxon race this is the cream of that pieceof tedious loquacities now what has this model negro of abolition idealized that can be observable as to his race i put it to gerrit smith to lewis tappan and to w l garrison on your side and to any three gentlemen on the side of fairness of truth to decide whether or not you implied the inferiority of your race and the propriety of going off to liberiathat land beyond american gunshot you do me injustice in trying to ex  hibit me to ridicule you ridicule your own mental and moral powers by estimating yourselves unable to live near but separate from the anglo saxon as if one race could control the destiny of the other however guarded yours be by a state constitution and in effect you in that th january article undid the allegation you made a few weeks previously i that you had better moral and mental qualities than my second letter to you evinced to be mine your inferiority and dependence on the race of your old masters are confessed by your selves in few and short remarks you made relating to myself you do not respect that god to whom i referred as to certain decrees and attempt to cast odium on me as a seeker after notoriety ii i want negro notoriousness in writing to you ami had no ulterior view no ameliorating design no desire to rescue my republic troin dissolution ini its uniy it in short iny object equal to assassinating a iueeu was like the aspiration of erastratus why did i not get a shorter road to this fame by immolating myself in georgia and sanctifying my name at the north among your friends by sending you a letter most abusive on the south why do i face the thunder of the south by warning its interests to colonize your dangerous tribe off in their patrimonial country and incur the hatred and scurrility of the kmancipatists in engt land and america by telling you in plain unsophisticated english what you are of course like every man who tries to better the world too must have some ambition ail men but u merest drone or expletive have atoiratiou the only difference is that vh exists be ween mere seekers of i the north star fame for its sake like bonaparte orthose that look to conservative deeds for gratitude of mankind which confers a true and honest immortality if i can no matter what or whom i be manage to induce my countrymen to peremptorily plant the africans elsewhere out of this republic and by so doing preserve not only our political union but an affection between the various sections thereof ultimately henefitting both races my motive would be better seen and my notoriety transcending all your conceptions of it if i were in england so far from noticing the queen who i the helpless creature of the british constitution were i inclined to do britains a favor i would point to the necessity of ameud ing her magna charts to greater liberality i care not for persons principles and systems are what the wise aim to establishthe matter of individuals being arranged by nations whenever circumstance and prophecy warrant a division i do not care for a controversy when i have evidence that no fair argumentation can exist with those who descend only to ridicule and to sneer it is enough that the north saw my letters the thinking white people there who have the capacity to appreciate my remarks and the candor to conscientiously admit the impregnability of my position as well the propriety and humanity of my advice to you you flitted over them like the butterfly overl die flowery hills but the truth is not the less durable i saw that my observation that i had prayed to god to agony for the colonization of the negro race in africa drew from j d a jest at its being scarcely endurable i saw my remarks in the second epistle bringing from f i the churchattacking epithets of calvinistic kidnapper and evangelical womanflogger what now shall be inferred from such lame attempts at disparagement eschewing all argument as these my natural view was directed to that propensity of your race everywhere tousing mockery or mirth at anybody or thing and to the easy graduation by which negroes fall from a laughing habit to a vituperative temper and in review passing before me was ham mocking the patriarch noah in his state of nudity and then quickly that jufdlial and undevout haughty char icter which he exhibited when as all mtiquarians proved he was angry at hat ancestor and blasphemous against he deity ana making himself as ju iter ammon their god he instituted jagan worship and his grandson nimrod kingcraftthings that yet scourge he nations and which made noahs curse the more irrevocable on ham in keeping with this sacrilegious character you with a few such rabid and incoherent traitors to truth and to their country as gcrrit smith and open infidels and destructives as w l garrison compare the american character to fiends and devils because they do not join you in hating and abusing all that hold slaves in this part of the union and the only ipsedixii of your fraternity by which a christian must find his standard is neither in piety nor peace nor the bible but inbow ing down and idolizing the egyptian blackness of your internal complexion or in detiling gods sane theory with the abominations of your erring judgments i knew how white israelites strove to turn back to egypt not only on the way but long alter joshuas time and so fascinating was the egyptian face to them that god by one of the prophets admonished them thus now the egyptians are men and not gods how seducing must the negros charms be over many white persons to induce from on high such an explanation i see it at the north where not only men fall into the irrelevant snare and think ever after like nonsensical people bufour white women in many places look with some horror at the idea of not playing the desdemona and making othellos of your gang and contemplate the refusal to wed with a negro as a sin and i am fully conscious that among your reasons for wishing to stay iorever in the centre of white communities here is none more extrordinary and allab sorbing than the secret or open hope or wish to get white wives in fact your own daily habit of talkingwriting and acting prove your deep disdain for yourselves but i warn the insane north that this would never do the truits of indiscriminate amalgamation have been seen in the population of arabia ot mauritiauia of spain of italy of ireland and arc now visible in south america and mexico if it ever improved on the african constitution it does not on the european ye white men and women are perfect enough without your amalgam your mixture spoils that original perfectness the arabs are a people with hand mutually against each other why turn to that book you fearfully make light ot and see ishmael was a halfegyptian a mulatto the prophecy fulfilled in his family is certain to this hour but why was it given why was not isaac also thus historically foretold the moors that held spain for six centuries contaminated the gothic majesty and blood into that mongrel race of spaniards that yet not only acts turbulently at home bat still in brazil and othci places keeps up the slavetrade across the ocean the portuguese are of the same family look too at ireland her own historians would have it that a colony of trading phoenician cunaanites settled in their island and incorporated with the natives the fact uow is that in ireland there arc might is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren many darkskinned blackhaired and darkeyed men who are of canaanite origin and the further fact is that the irish here have the habit of falling into negroerrors called balls and are ol i course many of them a quarrelsome i peppery ferocious and reckless people i and as their ancestor was apparently doomed to inferiority or slavery so j they are measurably easily enslaved by the race of the anglosaxons so you see the consequence of amalgamation is not creditable to us in ireland phoenician men married gothic women and their progeny had a different i appearance from the mulattoes of the i south who are the breed of white men and black or colored women this is the cause that the irish do not resemble our mulattoes but the philosophy of i the fact is defined if you negroes have any high sense really of your abilities or qualities why do you shrink so sensitively from finding a local habitation of your own if my reason be the true one i must repulse the affiliation for we should qualify ourselves to the established laws of jehovah before whom i bid you to fajl down and humble yourselves and to seek the grace of christ to enable you to perceive the true path of duty one observation more a paper from boston the christian register was by some unknown hand sent me pen marked to indicate the ethnology it is of the oth january as i cannot employ my time in writing so many letters to the abolitionists wish as you may print this epistle as the third and last from me to call the attention of the editor of that press and of dr cox to certain errors into which i conceive him fallen i was a little surprised to see the doctor admitting what thought no man north of virginia ever admitted i thought fabers elaborate attempt to discover the origin of pagan idolatry was orthodox at the north and that author stated that the europeans were the progeny of cush and the ethiopians of japhet lr cox however reversed the belief andi find at least one man who thinks the truth there the abolitionists have ever acted as if there was no division of races by noahs three sons now one man corroborates not only my sentiment but the researches of that greatest of archeologists bryant nevertheless dr cox falls into an error as to the extent of the ciupe on j ham i e canaan and as to the meaning of the word ethiopian now hold that this curse was not confined to and fulfilled in canaan only the canaanites were not enslaved avery small portion of them were andj that from a strategem they acted j they were killed or expulsed the idea of servitude attaching not to that branch of hams race i inquire to whom did it attach i answer to ail our version of the bible said ham was himself the mocker and the curse on canaan was in mosesopinion to have that drift as they were the tribe with whom the jews dealt most still hams name might have been canaan j for he may have had more than one appendage as we observe by jupiter ammon the old arabic version of genesis says cursed be ham the father of canaan and the book of lasher lately found has the same allusion notwithstanding all this matter of slavery i think the curse was to separation or to inferiority if united aservant of servants implied a very low degradation a servant to our horses and dogslower than southern slavery in fact it meant nothing but separation or at least inferiority the meaning of ethiopian dr cox would find by consulting bryant is serpent worshipper from ethi to worship and ope a serpent this is the right greek definition it would i seem that when ham made his unfortunate progeny idolators they wori shipped the figure and living symbol of satan as the principle of dread and cried eva eva in reference to eve a rite in egypt this custom still continues in some places in africa adjoining liberia hence the blacks became thus denoted colored people i wisß you w r ell god only can turn your captivity from satan to that blessed light of true lib ertv not only here but in africa j j flournoy from the newbern n c republiruu free soil map the most disgraceful and insulting allusion yet

that such was the crowd upon the boat in which he came passenger to captina that the provisions were all consumed actually depriving the president of three meals thus did they not only show their high regard and love for the general by killing several persons but were well nigh killing him by starvation and dashing him to pieces the extent to which the american people carry this glorification of military crusaders is beyond a parallel except in the days of roman extravaganza w hich was but a foreboding of the end of her glory and speedy downfall of that haughty insolent empire and commonwealth the extent to which this homage is carried ceases to be respeciful since it is neither kind nor complimentary but like the homage of the serf to the noble or the vassal to his lord it is

within some three or fotnr months after these i found anything bat satisfactory hence i introduced certain resolutions in the ex committee forbidding the agents to beg anything more until they had settled up their accounts ac and published to the world what they were doing i urged the calling home of mr hanson who was then in the east and the language of one of the resolutions was the agents are doing what nobody knows bat themselves these resolutions were adopted by the ex committee and entered on their book the committee instructed roe to call mr henson home andi did so by writing to j

resignation and remained in connection wth the institution about one month after when the influence of mr henson broke up i the school myself and mr wilson were then misrepresented to the trustees by a traitor things not being settled and that resulting in my leaving the institution instantly thus my nearly two years connection with the institution turns out to be about fifteen months and two of them spent in labor to overthrow the cutse mr wilson says i am furnishing instruction to rising of scholars he should have told the public that these are the children of the neighborhood or at any rate tourfifths of them are and the rest the youth of the settlement and not strangers from afar as he would have us to he should have added also that the parents of these are and always have been charged tuition for the instruction their children received at dawn these scholars are no charge to the public for they board at home they hve not and do not receive any of the w hich has been given for their education and support i said in the article referred tu that was in the christian cot tributor that the dawn school managers hail received sii ce its commencement over loooo in cash clothing

clothing tic for five years past and much of the clothing was begged for gratuitous distribution among the poor but they did not get it as they know and will say nor did the missonaties laboring in different parts of the province get it dots mr wilson deny this let bira say so mr wilson says i have been eyes to the blind and feet to the lame l have fed the hungry and clothed the naked can simply say that those who have received eyes and feet know it of course but the fed a id clothed saying should have been the other way the poor fugitives or rather the use of their name and without the

pennsylvanian copies from the new york sunday times with apparent satisfaction an article upon the slave trade in constantinople which concludes with the following paragraph here we see the reverse of the picture the black brutal master selling the white beautiful slave and not a christian voice is raised against the l deep damnation of such an act the sympathetic english so anxious to abolish african slaverythe free soil american so mad for the freedom of the blackshave not a word to say a hand to lift or voice to implore for white christian female slavery among the mahometans who remonstrates with the turks against this barbarity who demands that the slavery of w hite females shall cease in the east no noe we show off our sympathy at home wheae it is not needed this is the world have you then o wise editors discovered that we have a right to interfere with the peculiar institutions of turkey and to remonstrate against the barbaiity and deep damnation of selling ichite christian females as slaves we had not looked for such dangerous confessions from you your rashness surprises us gentlemen are you not aware that the blows you strike against turkish slavery fall heavier on the same system in america when we follow your lead and have roused the world with an agitation against the social relations of master and slave in turkey what is to be the fate of our own slave system do you think it will endure the moral earthquake which opens the prison doors in constantinople your southern masters will not thank you for fulminating damnation against their practices nor for teaching us such incendiary iessoijs nor for abusing their respectable allies almost the only supporters they have in other nationsi the turkish slave traffickers they will fear though you do reverse the old proverb and teach us to begin our charity in turkey instead of at home that it will not end there that in casting your firebrands across the atlantic to destroy mohammedan slavery some sparks will fall into their own system and explode it is highly impudent in you to denounce even indirectly the barbarity of our liege lords the harem keepers of the south and they bare good reason to arraign you for plantation mutiny call you this backing your friends it will not avail you to say you have not designed your words to apply to new orleans and washington traders in white christian females for the practice is as barbarous and damnable on tbe mississippi and potomac as on the bosphorus and like the lawyer of old they may exclaim thus saying yon condemn us also we thank yon for the implied acknowledgement that it is our right and doty to condemn and denounce barbarities without regard to national limits however you may have intended to smite us your hand falls alone upon

clarivoyance as he professed to show and that i would take the boys place i knew he would refuse and plead some good reasons against it but i desired my friend to take no refusal the old man presently said i might do as liked but be did not think it would succeed more charms and incense were burned my hand was duly scoured with ink and the usual pool poured into the palm and i faithfully gazed into it in two minutes the sensation came though there was no hand upon my head the magician is a powerful and no doubt unconscious mesmeriser presently i began to see such odd things in the pool of inkit grew so large before my aching eyes and showed such strange moving shadows and clear symmetrical figures and intersecting lines that i felt uncertain how bng i could command my thoughts and words and considering the number of strangers present i thought it more prudent to shake off the influence while i could than to pursne the experiment the perfumes might have some effect though i was insensible to them and so might the dead silence and iny steadfast gazing into the ink but there was also a strong mesmeric influence present lam certain i hope it will not be long before some satisfactory course of mesmeric experiment like that so triumphantly pursued by dr esdaile in india is instituted in egpt or at jerusalem with arabs for sub jectsmiss martineau anecdote of lamb coleridge says de

machine whilst he stood shivering with cold two stout fellows laid hold of him one at each shoulder like heraldric supporters they waited for the word of command from their principal who began the following oration to them hear me men take notice of this i am to be dipped what more he would have said is unknown to the land or seabathing machinist for having reached the word dipped hei commenced such a rolling fire of li dididi that when at length he des cended a plomb upon the full word dipped the two men rather tired of the j long suspense became satisfied that they had reached what lawyers call the operativeclause of the sentence andi both exclaiming at once oh yes sir were quite aware of that down they plunged him into the sea on emerging lamb sobbed so much from the cold that he found no voice suitable to his indignation from necessity ne seemed tranquil and again addressing the men who stood respectfully listening he began thus men is it possible to obtain your attentionoh surely sir by all means then listen once more i tell you i am to be didi di and then with a burst of indignation dipped i tell you oh decidedly sirand down the stammerer went for the second time petrified

large bay a shark rose near his canoe and after reconnoitring a short time swam towards it and endeavored to upset it the size of the canoe however rendered this impossible so the ferocious monster actually began to break it to pieces by rushing forcibly against it the indian fired at the shark when he first saw it but without effect and not having time to reload he seized his paddle and mode for the shore the canoe however from the repeated attacks of the fish soon became leaky and it was evident that in a few minutes more the whole party would be at the mercy of the infuriated monster in this extremity the indian took up his youngest child an infant of a few months old and dropped it overboard and while the share was devouring it the rest of the party gained the shore ballantynes hud

anything but talk the week in and the week out upon slavery slavery for breakfast slavery for dinner and slavery for supper is a little too much even of a good thing and much less of that which in itself is goott for nothing and which in its constant repetition and agitation would become nauseous if ever so good the taste wearies upon one ever recurring topic congress ceases to be interesting when there is no novelty in its scenes and when its speeches maybe stereotyped day after dayn y express we have not had enough of it and we shall continue to have more and more until slavery is abolished from the capital and our country and from our world we cannot have too much of a good thing especially when that good thing is the right of man to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

fight with sullivan was almost infinitely more honorable than our recent natinnal fisticuff with ivrexico there was a semblance of justice and fairness about it the national melee was dastardly yet the chief victor of such a fight is held up to the multitudes by statesmen and divines as having in that very war achieved a glory which entitles him to the highest honor and most important trust in the nation this rowdyism attendant upon the hyer and sullivan affair is precisely the whirlwind which we are reaping for having sowed rough and readyism to talk of checking this evil by legislating penalties against prize fights is quite stupid our whig legislators cannot possibly from the nature of the case do any such thing they have estopped themselves by supporting a national pugilist for
