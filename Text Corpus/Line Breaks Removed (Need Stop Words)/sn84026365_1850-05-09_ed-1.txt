speech of mr haleon the territorial question delivered in the senate of the united states tuesday march the senate having under consideration the compromise resolutions submitted tome time since by mr clat mr hale mr president it seems to have been admitted by almost everyone who has addressed the senate on the subject which has some time past engaged the attention of this body that the stnate and the country at large are divided into two classesl will not say two great classesbut one large and one very small one that that the great body of the senate and of the country are patriotic that they earnestly and anxiously desire that the distracting questions which divide and harass the country may be settled upon some just and patriotic grounds while on the other hand there are a few designated as extremists or ultraists who do not desire to see any such end effected who desire in other words to promote agitation who are anxious for nothing but trouble and disturbance whose sole purpose is to increase the irritation that already exists in the community to keep the public mind sore the public pulse throbbing irregularly with feverish heat nothing it is said is so strange as the physical and moral organization of these few gentlemen agitation is the aliment upon which they feed and by which they live take away that and their life their occupation all which furnishes them with a motive for living is gone now i have not a word to say personally against this i am glad sir that these ultraists if they do nothing more at least accomplish this much good that they afford this wholesome safe tyvalve to these extra exhibitions of patriotism on the part of those who are in the habit of addressing the senate hardly any one seems to suppose that be has discharged the duty which he owes to the country or done what he ought to do to satiety his constituents unless he mingles with the suggestions which he makes wholesale denunciations againstthose ultraiststhose agitators and even the calm and judical mind of the senator from north carolina who has just concluded his remarks is so infected with the prevailing mania that even he educated ashe has been upon the bench where he learned to sanction a line of safe precedent could not sit down satisfied that he had discharged his duty until he bad relieved his conscience of a due proportion of vituperation against these miserable fanatics and agitators i think then it must be granted that theagitators do some good at least by affording a safe and wholesome channel through which this extra exhibition of patriotic indignation may find vent do hope that if it be not conceded that they do any other good at least credit wih be accorded to them for this much i have not a word to say in reference to the good taste or the truth and candor which prompts such a course i make no appeal to gentlemen who feel a consciousness in their own breasts that they are governed by high pure elevated motives to consider how far it is consistent with a proper selfrespect to be continually employed in depreciating and attacking the motives of others when obtained the floor air sometime smee after the address that was dcjvered by the distinguished senator from south carolina who is not now ia his seat i suggested that according to my reading of history tho account which he has undertaken to give of these agitations sounded to my mind more like the romance than the troth of history and that designed upon some occasion when it suited the convenience of the senate to set history aann liiaftwiihi nttnrimug jb nun and that is one of the objects i proposed to myself today i shall sir be compelled to call the attention ol the senate to ihe speech of jhe senator from south carolina somewhat in detail and in devoting some few moments to a preparation upon this subject i endeavored o make something of au analysis of it before ihad proceeded very far in my examination i found it assumed the form of a regular cate chismquestions and answers being given in the first place it commenced with a concession of the fact that the union was in great danger then it asks l how can the union be preserv ed answer to give a satisfactory answer to this mighty question it is indispensable to have an accurate and tbor oughknowledge of the nature and character of the cause by which the union is endangered what has endangered the union answerto this question there can be but one answer that the immediate cause is the almost universal discontent which pervades all the states composing the southern section of the union what is the cause of this dis content answer it will be found in the belief of the people of the southern states as prevalent as the discontent itself that they cannot remain as things now are consistently with honor and salety in the union what has caused this belief answer one of the causes is undoubtedly to be traced to the long continued agitation of the slave question on the part of the north and the many aggressions which they have made on the rights of the south during the time i will not enumerate them at present as it will be done hereafter in its proper place there is another lying back of it with which this is intimately connected that may b an tbe great mud primary cause this is to be found in tbe rect that the equilibrium between the two sections in the government as it stood when the constitution was ratified and the government put in action has been destroyed now sir the first act of this government in the series of these events which has broken up this equilibrium and caused this universal discontent thehonorable senator says is the ordinance of shall not undertake to go particularly into the history of that ordinance because it is familiar to the senate and the country and has been frequently referred to by gentlemen who have already addressed ths senate on this subject this mark you is the first in the series of northern aggressions by which the equilibrium which once existed has been destroyed mr butler the word aggression does not occur in his speech in that eonnection at all mr hale i do not know exaetly whether the senator used tbe word aggression or not perhaps he did not i mr butler in his seat i know he did not mr hale at any rate it is one of the acts which has destroyed the equilibrium that is it the equilibrium is spoken of by the senator several times and the ordinance of was one of the great events which he claims destroyed this equilibrium and sir it is curious that this first act of northern aggressionthe ordinance of was adopted in the convention of with but a single dissenting yote and that was a northern vote yes sir the only vote in the convention of against this ordinance which is said to have broken up the equilibrium of the states that originally existed and which was tobe perpetuated between northern and southern states was a vote from a northern statewas a northern state the state of new york for the delegates from every other state voted unanimously for itthe delegates iron south carolina among the number well sir what followed i propose to show now if the senate wili give me their attention that this fa famous ordinance of which hat now got to be the wilmot proviso and which is deemed to be so insulting tc the southern states of the confederacy if it is retained in our federal legislation that this ordinance oi older than the constitution wai reenacted by the first congress which assembled under that constitution and in the preamble to the act which re cognised the ordinance it is expressly recited that it is done in order that its provisions shall be made conformable to the constitution of tbe united states the act was approved the th august and is to be found in chapter btti of the isws of the united states the preamble i will read it is as follows oo tbeeecomi page of the speech of mr cubopi ia tbe following miaatc one af tin enuaea ia undoubtedly lo be traced to tbe longcon tinned agitation of rhea late cpnetiott on tbe part othe north and the mnuy aggrttmm which tbe have made on die rights of the rsonth during thi lime at another place on the same page hegsays a that time there waa a perfect equilibrium betweet the two which afforded ample mean to each u protect itself against ths afgrswmw of the other right is of no sextruth is of no color i whereas in ordetthat e ordinance of the ujjjted states in congres i assembled for the government of th i territory northwest of the river ohio i may continue to have full effect it iii requisite that cerfam provisions thoub y be made so as to adapt the same t the present constitution of the unite rf i nnjflm f nr first congress that assembteaunoe the federal constitution it reenacte and reestablished the provisions o that ordinance now sir we hav i been told today as well as on previous occasions that if this principle is insisted on it is an insult and sucl a grievous wrong that the southerr states if they remain in the confederacy will remain not from any principle of attachment to the union bul from fear of the bitter consequence which might follow secession now i undertake to say that i will prove tc the satisfaction of every reasonable man who can read the statutes of the country that the principle embodied in that ordinance of and reenacted by the first congress under the federal constitutionhas been continued to be reenacted in substance from the time of gen washington who signed the first act down to james k folk who signed the same provision in the oregon bill and that the talk which is raised by gentlemen about making an unequal and unjust discrimination about property has no foundation which may not with equal justice be alleged against every one of the acts of the federal government organizing territories which mark our history from the adoption of the constitution down to the present time i ask the attention of the senate to the subject it will be found that as early as on the d march by an act of congress general washington then being presidentwhilst the foreign slave trade was not prohibited an d could not be by the provisions of the federal constitution until while the trade in foreign slaves was the subject of legitimate commerce under the constitution while every citizen of the united states had a right under the laws of the constitution to go from any port of the united states to the coast of africa and take a cargo of slaves and bring them to any port in tbe united statescongress in made a discrimination against this species of property and prohibited the building or fitting out of any vessel for the purpose of carrying slaves to any foreign country they might bring hem here but congress thus far discriminated against that species of property as early as whilst it was a subject of legal commerce under the constitution ol the united states congress did not interfere provided the slaves were brought home but they did and utterly destroyed that species of property as an article of commerce when an attempt was made to carry it to any foreign country that was an act passed under george washington its provisions were as follows an act to prohibit the carrying on the slave trade from the united states to any foreign place or country sec prohibits building or fitting out vessels for the purpose of carrying slaves to any foreign country or procuring them in any foreign country to carr them to another vessels fitted out for that purpose forfeited sec imposes a penalty of on any person aiding or abetting in fitting out such a vessel sec any owner master or factor of any vessel clearing for africa or suspected of being intended for the slave trade are required to give bond in substance not to violate the provisions of this act sec imposes a penalty of oo for every person received on board any vessel in violation of this act g washington approved march that is an act passed in well sir other acts of a similar character only more express and explicit in their provisions may be found in the act of for the settlement of the limits of the state of georgia and the establishment of a government for the mississippi territory passed on the th april sec establishes a government for the mississippi territory in all respects similar to that now exercised in the territory northwest of the river ohio excepting and excluding the last article of the ordinance made for the government thereof by the late congress on the th of july which provides that there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude otherwise than in the punishment of crimes c sec makes it unlawful to bring slaves into mississippi territory from any place without the united states imposes a penalty of oo for every slave brought into the territory in violation of the provisions ot this act and gives every slave thus brought in bis or her freedom approved april look at the provisions of that act sl might legally be imported into the united states for ten years after that act was passed they might be imported and were as much and as legally a subject of property as anything else but congress took occasion to regulate that species of property ten years before the prohibition to the importation of slaves was to take effect and declared that alavet should not be carried into the mississippi ter rochester ni y thursday may  ritory from atyr place without the i united states and that any slave carried there became free and a penalty was imposed on those who took them i slaves were at tht timein legal ofcommere congress i had powjpiyer uadmeonstitiition were under the constitution as legitimately articles of commerce as sugar or molasses well congress did undertake that early in to say that slaves which were recognised as articles of commerce in the states should not be carried into the territories that fact establishes two points it shows that congress legislated for the territories and it shows that they legislated upon this particular subject within the territories well sir there are other acts of a similar character in an act erecting louisana into two territories and providing for the temporay government thereof approved the lst march section prohibits the bringing into said territory from any place without the united states any slave or slaves and imposed a fine of three hundred dollars for any slave so imported and act prohibited the bringing into wp territory any slave or slaves which shall have been imported to the united states since theist day of may or which shall hereafter he imported under the provisions of this act passed in congress undertook to say that slaves which have been imported into one of the slave states between and fair matters of commerce under the constitution should not be carried into the territory and imposed a penalty on any one so carrying them here then is an express and explicit recognition on the part of congress of the right and authority of congress thus to legislate upon this subject under the provisions of this law no one could move from a slave state into j the louisana territory in and and and carry with him slaves imported from africa into any state subsequently to or if they did they did in violation of this law which prohibited it i will not weary the senate by going owr tk history of then several acts they will very roirtfioftbeim be found i in a speech delivered in this body on the th june by mr dix then a member from the state of new york and they come down to the very last congressbecause the last congress adhering to the legislation heretofore practiced passed the oregon bili containing this very same prohibition and it was signed by mr james k polk he certainly must have understood it to be a constitutional prohibition the constitutional exercise of a right vested in congress or he never would have signed it the proposition was made in both houses to put the enactment of that clause in the oregon bill on the ground that it was north of thirtysix degrees thirty minutes both houses refused to do it it went to mr polk and he signed it and sent it back with a paper tho substance of which as i read it was that it was constitutional then but never would be again that sir has been the legislation of congress older than the constitution coming down through successive presidents washington adams jackson van buren and soon and in the organization of territorial governments in mississippi louisana florida and michigan all in express terms recog nising this right sometimes limiting slavery to a certain class of slaves in other instances excluding it altogeth er and now we are told that if we adhere to this longestablished well considered construction of the constitution if we continue to tread in the old path which our fathers marked out for us that the sensibility the sensitiveness of the south which has been sleeping for more than fifty years will be galvanized into such activity as to endanger the union itself well sir these arguments may beall potent but i want to put history right we are told that this agitation of the subject of slavery here is something new and the senator from south carolina gave it a date of fifteen years he said that it had commenced in and that as soon as it was introduced he saw themischief that was to ensue from it the honorable senator from south carolina did not go back far enough agitating papers of the sort complained of came here unger ao than that he ought to have gone back to and he would havo found one of the most agitating and fanatical papers that he could well find beginning with the declaration that all men are created equal the agitation of this question goes back as far as that and it shows what was the action and understanding of the men of that day i wish to read air a petition presented to the first congress that ever assembled under the federal constitution and signed by one of the great minds that framed it i allude sir to doctor franklin aot one of these modern agitators not one of those amphibious animats that have been described as flying about in the twilight between light and darkness on the th february benjamin frpnklin as president of the penney it ania society ur promoting the abolition of slaver y the relief of free negroes unlawfully held in bondago and the improvement of the african god is the father of us all and all men are brethren race presented a petition which i send to the clerks table te be read february a memorial of the pennsylvania society for promoting the abolition of slavery the relief of free negroes unlawfully held in bondage and the m provement of the african race as presented and read fcethdmw that from a regard for the happiness of mankind an association was formed several years since in this state by a number of her citzens of various religious denominations for promoting the abolition of slavery and for the relief of those unlawfully held in bondage a just and acute conception ot the true principles of liberty as it spread through the land produced accessions to their numbers many friends to their cause and a legislative coopv eration with their views which by the blessing ot divine providence been successtully directed to the relieving from bondage a large number of their fellowcreatures of the african race they have also the satisfaction to observe that in consequence of that spirit of pbilanthrophy and genuine liberty which is generally diffusing its beneficial influence similar v institutions are forming at home and abroad that mankind are all formed by the same almighty being alike objects of his care and equally designed for the enjoyment of happiness the christian religion teaches us to believe and the political creed of america fully coincides with the position vour memorialists particularly engaged in attending to the distresses arising from slavery believe it to be their indespensable duty to present this subject to your notice they have observed with real satisfaction that many important and salutary powers are vested in you for promoting the welfare and recuring the blessings of liberty to the people of the united states and as they conceive that these blessings ought rightfully to be administered without distinction of color to all descriptions of people sothe indulge themselves in the pleasing expectation that nothing which can be done for the relief of the unhappy objects of their care will be either omitted or delayed roin a pursuaion that equal liberty was originally the portion and is till the birthright of all men and influenced by the strong ties of humanity and the principles of their institutions your memorialists concieve themselves bound to use all justifiable endeavors to joosen the bonds of slavery and promote a general enjoyment of the blessings of freedom under these impressions they earnestly entreat your serious attention to the subject of slavery that yoir will be pleased to countenance to restoration of liberty to those unhappy men who alone in this land of freedom are degraded into perpetual bondage and who amidst the general joy of surrounding freemen are groaning in servile subjection and you will devise means for removing this inconsistency from the character of the american people that you will promote mercy and justice towards this distressed race and that you will step to the very verge of the power vested in you for discouraging every species of traffic in the persons of our fellowmen benj franklin president philadelphia february objection was made to the reception of the petition and a debate ensued when a motion to refer it to a committee prevailed by a vote of ayes to noes it was considered in committee reported on and the whole subject was under debate on the sth bth and tn of march the proceedings of which action in congress may be found in the journals page i only refer to this history to show that there were fanatics in earlier times than the year that there were men who were affected with this mania long ago and that amongst those upoh whose grave must fall the denunciations that are so freely and frequently heard here is the man who alone of mortal man had vision enough to answer the question proposed by the almighty to his servant long ago when he asked him it he can discover the way of the lightening of thunder well sir i have another document and a very curious one it is too referring to the action on this subject later in the history of congress it is to be found in the fourth volume of the house journals page second session of seventh congress under date of tarch and it is air a casein point the territory of indiana then being under the provisions of the ordinance of the people of indiana through a public meeting of which william henry harrison was pjpsi dent petitioned that this article of the ordinance of b prohibiting slavery in the territory might be suspended for a given number of yearsabout ten i believe it was the petition was referred to a committee of which the celebrated john randolph of virginia was chairman i desire to read an extract from his report because it shows what sentiments obtained iu virginia on this subject in house journal vol page d session th congressmarch d j mr randolph from the comm itme to which were referred a letter from william henry harrison president of the convention held at vincennes declaring the consent of the people of indiana to the suspension of the sixth article of comped between the united states and the people of that territory made the following report that the rapid population of the state of ohio sufficiently evinces in the opinion of yodr committee that the labor of slaves is sot accessary to promote the growth aod settlement of colonies in that regies that this labor dessowihy thwsigeatjpf any can only be employed to advantage m me cultivation of products more valuable than any known to that quarter of the united states that the committee deem it highly dangerous and inexpedient to impair a provision wisely calculated to promote the happiness and prosperity of the northwestern country and to give strength and security to that extensive frontier in the salutary operation of this sagacious and benevolent restraint it is believed that the inhabitants of indiana will at no very distant day find ample remuneration for a temporary privation of labor and of emigration from such a consideration as they have been enabled to bestow on the subject at this late period of the session and under the pressure of accumulating business they recommend the following resolutions which are respectfully submitted to the judgement of the house  resolved that it is inexpedient to suspend for a limited time the operation of the sixth article of compact between the original states and the people and states west of the ohio c cand sir is there a citizen of indiana today who will not rise up and do credit to the sagacity and philanthropy of john randolph when he told them that in the wisdom and sagacity of that exercise of power they would find ample remuneration for any temporary greivance they might be suffering under by the present application and sir here was a case stronger than any which has been or can be presented herea case of a territory of the united states settled by freemen with slavery interdicted who come forward and ask congress to relieve them from that interdictionto relieve them from hat prohibitionand congress refused o do it and they refused to do it up jnthe report from which i have just read that ruadejjy mr john randolph of v irginia now sir i think i may imfeiy leave that part of the subject the ordinance of having shown that it was not imposed by a part but that it was the act of the whole country t was impressed upon the legislation f the country at its earliest period it las continued there ever sioce and it remains there now what do gentle nen want on the principles that they qptend for that it is an insult do they ivant to repeal the bill establishing the oregon territory do they want it bliterated from the history of our leg slation they can speak for them lelves sir on that point the second matter which has dis urbed the equilibrium according to he arguments of the senator is the missouri compromise sir the missouri compromise disturbed the equilibrium of those northern representa ives that voted for it more than any hing else that ever happened and hat is the only equilibrium i ever beard of as being disturbed by that compromise not only did it disturb their equilibrium hut it threw them entirely off it and with but very rare exceptions these politicians have not yet recovered their equilibrium and what is more they never will well nr if according to the argument of the senator from south carolina the missouri compromise was such an odious measure and has had such an injurious effect upon the south is it not singular that we find nearly every southern man voting for it and every northern man voting against it whenever it is offered at the last session when a motion was made to insert the missouri compromise in a territorial bill nearly every gentleman representing a southern state on this floor voted for it and the northern men as abody were against it then sir it is the south who were aggressive and who were destroying the equilibrium and it is the north who have resisted it and further has not every other southern gentleman who has spoken here of that compromise characterized it as a great healing measure and as one that gave quiet peace and security to the country and will do it again if adopted and is it not a curious spectacle that they should thus ask us to return and settle down on one of the very measures that in the opinion of the senator from south carolina has been so potent and effectual in destroying the equilibrium fes sir the missouri compromise which is designated by the senator from south carolina as the givat equilibriumdestroyer has been lauded in our presence as a measure of peace and concord and as one that the south is willing to take and abide by now yes sir this measure which southern gentlemen now express their readiness to receive and abide by the senator from south carolina puts second in bis ltsl of the measures which have destroyed the equilibrium and produced discontent in the south well sir the third measure of which the senator speaks as destroying the equilibrium between the sections and producing this great discontent in the south in the oregon bill if this be so it must indeed have had a wonderfully rapid influence for it was ony passed u august has been john sick p whole no but about a year and a half ia operation and indeed ido not know whether any despatches hare bean received by this government informing us of the organise ion of the government instituted at that time if they have been laid before congress is it possible thencan the senator from south carolina be serious when he mentions the oregen bill ss one of the three measures of the government t nirtitinwii h mgapimldia content at the south that thwjf csn no longer remain in the union what possible influence can the oregon bill have had on the south within the brief time that has transpired since its passage i will not spend more time on this subject the charge is prepos terous i have another document to which i will here refer as it shows that there was discontent and talk of disunion in the south long before this oregon bill was thought of the senator from south carolina speaks of the abolition fanatics in which is the time ashe says they commenced their operations as being small and contemptible and as having no sort of influence and consideration now what was the declaration of the senator in the very time when he states this fraction was so small and contemptible in niles register of th vol th page is an extract of a letter from john c calhoun to the editor of the washington telegraph heaays since you passed through the south the excitement in relation to the northern fanatics has very greatly increased the indications are that the south will be unanimousin their resistance will be of the most determined character even to the extent of disunion if that should be necessary to arrrst the evil i trust however it may be arrested far short of such ex tremity from this it appears that as long ago as the southall the south he speaks forhad come to such a unanimous determination to resist the northern fanatices that if they could not put them down in any other way they were ready to dissolve the union small and contemptible as this faction then was to use the language of the senator from south carolina it was potent enough it seems to work up the whole southjo a determination to dissolve tha union if they were not putdown wish to call the attention of the senate to another view of this question of the equilibrium the senator from georgia mr berrien in his speech the other day puts this significant question to senators irom the northern states he says now sir revert to the period when this constitution was entered into when thirteen confederated states loosely connected together mutually grasping hands drew more closely the bond of union and now tell me do you believedoes any man believe that it consists with the spirit and intention of the farmers of that instrument with the feelings ofthat moment that you should circumscribe slavery within limits within which in process of time it could no longer exist that were to deny to us the privilege of exercising the rights with which we came into the constitution in the manner in which we had exercised and were exercising them when the constitution was formed it would be in effect to say to us we will allow you to hold slaves if you will keep them within your present limits but in the future acquisitions which we make of territories by our joint and equal effofts even of such asare fitted to your peculiar kind of labor hands off slavery shall never be extended with our consent the banner of this free republic shall never wave over another slave state whether it were originally free or slave if this proposition had been made to our fathers in that convention what think you would have been their answer i will not trust myself to express it do you believe that this constitution would have been formed under such circum stances now sir it seems to me that an all sufficient answer to this question is tobe found in the fact that the constitution was formed under precisely the circumstances on which he speculates under what circumstances was the constitution formed sir why every inch of territory which the states then owned was subject to this very prohibition every inch of territory by that provision of the continental congress ratified by the first congress under the federal constitution was subjected to the inhibition of slavery in another part of his speech the senator from south carolina savs that next aaer the ordinance of the missouri compromise and the oregon bill among the causes which have produced discontent at the south is the system of revenue and disbursements adopted by the government he says the next is the system of revenue sod disbursements which has been adopted by the government it is well hnown that the government has derived its levenae roiislj from duties on imports i shall not undertake to show that such duties must necessarily fall mainly on the exporting states and that the south as fte great exporting portion of the union has in reality paid vastly more than her due proportion of the revenue because i deem it unnecessary ss tbs subject has on so many occasions been fully disscuased nor shall i for the same reason undertake to show that s far greater portion of the rev anua has bo disbursed at the north than its due share and that tbs joint effect of these causes has been to transfer vast amounts form south to north which under an equal system of revenue and disbursements would have been lost to her if to this be that many of the duties were imposed not for retenne but for protectionthat is intended to put money not in the treasury but directly into the pocket of the manufacture some conception may be formed of the immenes am mount which in the long course of sixty yearshas been transferred from south to north there are no data bylwhich it can be estimated with any certainty but it is safe to sayt at it amonnts to hundreds of millions of dollar under the most moderate estimate it would be sufficient to add greatly lo the wealth ofihe north and thus greatly increase her population by attracting emigration from all quarters to that section thiscombined with the great and primary cause amply explains why the north has acquired a preponderance over every department of the government by ita disproportionate increase of population and states i think it well for the senator that he did not undertake to show thet for he knowa that the duties fall upon and are paid by the consumers be they where they may a state therefore which hnaa population ten times greater than that of another state and con aumes imports in that proportion pays ten times more revenue no matter where the imports go those who consume them pay the duties upon them go into the manufacturing towns and villages where they consume a large amount of sugar and other dutiable articles do they not pay the duty on their importation and is not the fact true always that it is the consumer wherever he may be who pays the duty sir the fact is undeniable the senator undertakes to show that by far the greater portion of our revenue has been disbursed at the north or more than ita due share now sir that struck me as the most bold assertion in the whole speech is all history sir to be set at naught in this matter the disbursements greater at the north than in the south why air in the state in which i live aside from the expenses of collecting the revenue not of the public money has been spent in fifty years no sir the expenditures of the government are not made here the officers of the government do not come from the north nor are the great contracts made there what is it that consumes onahalf aye threefourths of your revenue but the army and the navy and where is it expended why where your indian wars occur youi seminole and creek wars in the southern and not in the northern portion of these states why sir the idea that an undue proportion of the money collected by the general government has been disbursed in the northern states is to say the least one in as direct opposition to the truth of history as any statement which coulc possibly be made a friend has collected for me some statistics showing the expenditures of the government one item of which i will refer to which is well calculated to show the proportion between the free and the slav states by the returns of the posi office department for the year it appears that there was collected it the fifteenfree states by way of postage a sum exceeding the expenses othe department in these states for tha year by while there was t deficiency to the same araouut in the lave states thus there was a direc tax collected in small sums from the north to the amount of over  in one year for that single department of government and apprehent that if the other departments were examined it would be found that the pos office was in fact the one under whicl the north suffered least why in oui little state of new hampshire then is a direct tax for postage to the amoum of over the revenue collected there for postage in that yeai was and the expenditure leaving us with a direct tai of for that year and sir ii cannot be said that these letters were received from commercial correspondents because we have no great commercial emporium in the state noir this tax is collected from those manufacturing operatives of whom mention is sometimes made here it isa tax on the affections of the human heart on filial love and reverence on correspondence with parents children and friends and it is collected from the hardworking men and women of the north for the support of this government yet we do not complain of it but in the face of all this it is rather hard to be told that our prosperity is all owing to the undue amount of government expenditures made in the northern states why sir it would be a curiosity in the part f the country in which live to hear of the expenditure amongthem of a dollar of the money of the general government over and above just what is necessary to collect the revenue to be spent elsewhere so much for this subject again says the senator from south carolina if to this be added that many of the duties imposed not for revenue but for protectionthat is intended to put money not in the treasury but directly into the pocket of the manufacturer some conception may be formed of the immense amount which in the long course of sixty years bus been lruufrr from to north there are no data by which it can be estimated with any certainty but it is sale to say that it amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars under the most moderate estimate it would be sufficient to add greatly to the wealth of the north and thus greatly increase her population by attracting emigration from all quarters to that section now sir let us examine this point it is the tariff then that has done injury to the south and produced discontent there now have been at some little pains to examine the history of the various tariffs and our revenue policy and i find that the first tariff act was passed on the th of july and the preamble to it is in the following words whereas it is necessary for the support of government for the discharge of the debts of the united states and for the encouragement and protection of manufactures that duties belaid on goods wares and merchandise imported the yeas and nays were not taken on the bill m either house the next year the duties were largely increased and i think in some instances that they were doubled and the bill for that put pose passed the house of representatives yeas nays and as a curiosity will read the votes of the states an that measure yeas ways yeas nays nhampsh delaware  massach maryland connecticut virginia new york n carolina new jersey s carolina pennsylvania georgia  the tariff remained substantially as it was established by the act of with the exception of the acts passed during the war which were considered as war measuresuntil have not got the precise date when that act was approved but i think it was in april then the war was over and it became necessary to abandon the war acts passed during its prosecution and to bettle down on something like a permanent policy and a tariff act was passed it passed the house of representatives yeas nays and as the yeas and nays upon it are somewhat interesting i will read them by states yeas nays yeas nays nhampsh maryland  massachus virginia r island ncarolinao connecticut scarolina vermont georgia new york kentucky n jersey tennessee  pennsylv ohio delaware did not louisiana vote and among the yeas on the passage of that bill stands recorded the name of john c calhoun one of the representatives from south carolina that was in the tariff policy of the country continued without material alteration until when another bill on the subject passed the house yeas nays south carolina then changed front on the question but i wish to call the attention of the senate to the vote of new england on the subject because she has been considered the greatest sinner in regard to it her vote on the tariff was yeas nays as follows yeas nays yeas nays maine connecticut  nhampsh r island  massachus vermont  and such had been the uniform policy of that portion of the country but the history of the tariff acts that have been passed show that the northern states have generally objected to them and that too against the power and the eloquence of the senator trom south carolina in in the house and when this policy was fored on new england and forced on her too by southern votes against her own wishes then sir the genius the enterprise and the industry of her people began to accommodate themselves to the state of things and because she flourished under it it is made a charge against her and forms the next point in the indictment against the north tor disturbing the equilibrium between the sections another evil of which the senator complains is as follows to usa his own i language but wbile these measures were destroying the equilibrium between the two sections the action of the government was leading to a radical change in its character by concentrating all the power of the system in itself the occasion will not permit me to trace the measures by which this great i change has been consummated if it did it would not be difficult to show that the process commenced at an early period of the government that it proceeded almost without interruption step by step until it absorbed virtually its entire powers but without going through the whole process to establish the fact it may be done satisfactorily by a very short statement that the government claims and practically maintains the right to decide in the last resort as to the extent of its powers will scarcely be denied by any one conversant with the political history of the country that it also claims the right to resort to force to maintain whatever power she claims against all opposition is equally cer tain his charge is that this government has changed gradually from a federal republic to a consolidated democracy who has done it from the very adoption of the constitution down to the present time what counsels have prevailed northern or southern who have been the presidents of the united states northern men or southern men again w th reference to the action of the supreme court who have been on the bench of that court history wilt show that there there has been no ume when you would trust northern men there so as to constitute a majority though a man may have crept to the foot of power in the most abject manner the north qpuld never be trusted bo far as to have her citizens constitute a majority on the bench of hat court there has been a majority pi southern men on that bench and i say air that the south has always controlled the policy of this government think the honorable senator from kentucky was magnanimous enough the other day in his speech to acknowledge thia not only the legislative but the judicial power has always been in the hands of the south if the question was asked today of the most ordinary or the most astute observer of passing events who it is of all men that has hfb the moat to do to control and shape the policy of thia government and make it what it is the answer would be that it is the honorable senator from south carolina mr calhoun who makes this charge did he not tell us with the modesty which always belongs to him with the honesty and truth which characterize him that hs more than any other man effected the acquisition oi texas to this coun ryt he was then a private citizen if he could in perfect consistency with historical truth say that he more than any one else effected that great act by which that country was annexed and made a part and parcel of our own wbat must have been hia influence while be occupied a seat in the ether house in the pride ot his power or when for eight years he was at the head of the department of war and for six years filled the chair which yoturow occupy if he could thus control public policy in hit reiirment no sir great and commanding aa baa been the influence of other gentlemen in the councils of this nation if there be any one man who has stamped upon its character and features the imprest orbit thought and purposes that manit the honorable senator from south carolina who addressed the senate the other day on this subject but now he ooraea in and files a bill of indictment against the north for doing that which all along they have resisted and remonstrated against the next part of the speech to which i wish to direct attention is the assertion that nevertheless as small and contemptible as the party then was both of the great parties of the north dreaded them they felt that though small they were organised in reference to a subject which had a great and commanding influence over the northern mind each party on that account feared to oppose their petitions lest the opposite party should take advantage of the one who might do so by fsvormg tueir petitions the effect was that both united by insisting that the petitions should be received and that congress should take jurisdiction of the subject for which they prayed and speaking on the subject in another part of the speech on the bth page he says and congress is invoked to do all this expressly with the view to the fins abolition of slavery in the states thst has been avowed to be the ultimate object from the beginning of the agitation until the present time and yet the great body of both parties of the nsrth with the full knowledge of the fact although disavowing the abolitionists have cooperated with them in almost all their measures if understand this air it is a distinct avowal that the abolition movement has been received with public favor from the commencement by both parties in both houses of congress from the north and at home t undertake to say that a declaration more at war with the truth of history could not possibly be affirmed in language the abolitionists instead of being received with public favor at the north by either party have been denounced in every possible form in which language could denounce them the meetings which they have holden in public places have been broken in upon by lawless mobs they have been driven from the place where they had assembled for the exercise of a constitutional right and to such an extent had this spirit progressed that the buildings in which they had assembled and had been peaceably exercising the rights of citizens under the constitution have been in at lepst one instance burnt to the ground by a mob i dont refer to these matters for the purpose of reopening any wounda that may have been healedup by the soothing influence of time but i do contend that if the senate ineana to do justice and the country means to do justice it is necessary and right that the truth upon this subject should be made known sir there never has been a aect that has arisen since the christian era that has been met at every turn on every hand on everv i side and by all parlies with more bitter violent unrelenting persecution than these same abolitionists have been instead of growing up by the public favor of the north i they have grown np in spite of the most determined opposition they have lived upon persecution persecution and denunciation have been everything which they have had and sir to show that upon this matter ido not speak without book i will refer in the first place to the proceedings of congress on this subject i will show how far it is i true in refelf nee to the house of representatives that both partiea fiom the north have united in receiving their petitions and taking jurisdiction of the subject the year is the lime which is assigned as the com mencement of this agitation the time at which both parties at the north united ingiving them public favor the time at which both parties in congress should sake juriadic tion of the subject and that the petitions of the abolitionists should be received it will be found sir thst in the house of represent laltves on the bth day of february mr pinkney introduced the following resolu tion resolved that all the memorials which r have been offered or may hereafter be pie santed to this house praying for the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia and also the resolutions offered by an honorable i member from maine mr jarvis with the amendment thereto proposed by an honorable

ought not to interfere o any way wiih slavery in the district of columbia because it would be a violation of the public faith uni wise impolitic and dangerous to the union t assigning such reasons for these concln i sions as in the judgement of the committee may be best calculated to enlighten the pub lie mind to allay excitement to repress agita i tion to secure and maintain the just rights oi the

pruslartry prints in the land thousands were taken and paid for by the colored people of those cities while the number of readers of antislavery papers maybe counted by fifties a very mournful picture aye verily what hope is there of the elevation of a people who thus succumb to their oppressors and administer to their own enslavement none none they who would be free themselves must strike the blow this is the perfect work of tyranny it begins by refusing men their rights and ends by depriving them of the power of appreciating the value of what they have lost however tuoh we may be alarmed at the exertions of slaveholders for the continuance and extension of their authority and the lamentable subserviency to the slave power of some who heretofore have been loud in braggadocio and declamation respecting their love of lib ertywe regard this apathy on the part of the victims oi oppression as the most gloomy feature of the caw since aa the surgeon knowa the most certain symptom of mortification having taken place is the cessation of pain on the part of the patient the colored people of this land must arouse themselves from their lethargyprove themselves men be up snd doing in

perpetual serfdom barberdom and bootblack ng white men oannot afford to be ignorant ind poaferish the prevailing prejudice igainst color in this country makes it dou ily ruinous for oolored men to indulge either n apathy ignorance or vicej j the pious and prophetic editor of the new york herald professes to be mightily alarmed for the safety of the union and in order to preserve it in the paper of last week pours forth a torrent of patriotic cackle on the subject describing what he conceives to be the causes of the danger and the best means tobe used for their removal one of the articles in the herald purports to be an account of the different societies whose anniversaries were to be held in new york during the present week but is in reality a diabolical tirade against abolitionists generally and in particular against what it calls the amalgamation meeting if the faithful men who perform their duty to their country by denouncing this union and exposing the hollowness and hypocrisy of the american people in their professions of a high regard for liberty while holding three millions of their fellowmen in chains if these devoted few are allowed to return to their homes uninjured it will not be because this vile papei did not do all m its power to rouse the worst passions of the multitude against them we should like to know what is the use of a government if not to take charge of each ruffianly instigators to breaches of the peace yet colored men are largely implicated in the criminality of sustaining that and kindred paper aa well may they rear an anaconda in

about to be formed for that slate women shall be secured not only the rights of suffrage but all the political and legal rights guaranteed to men as far as we are personally concerned we do not set a very high value upon political lights for their exercise merely so longas the political arena continues such a muddy quagmire s we now find it we do not suppose thst a very large proportion of the gentler sex would exercise their political rights were they in full and free possession of them still in onr opinion it is a manifest injustice and absurdity that one half the people of these united states should be excluded from political privileges simply because they are women he who can arrive at the irrational conclusion that this it right ought to be prepared to adopt the turkish custom of excluding woman from the social circle and to huddle her away under thick veils within the four walls of a harem the arguments for both customs are very nearly alike and equally fallacious the proceedings of the convention are said to have been conducted with much dignity we du not doubt it of this at all events we are very sure that a certain honorable assemblage we wot of which occasionally indulges in a little pistol exercise and other gentlemanly accomplishments might take an example from this womans convention among the resolutions adopted was ooe to the effect that we

i confess that if the time and circumstances gave an opportunity should not be indisposed to address the people of massachusetts directly upon the duty which the present exigencies of affaiis bad devolved upon her this great and glorious csramos wealth upon ibe duty at least which it devolves upon us who represent her in the national legislature this will not be such an opportunity i have an occasion in my seat in the senate to which i shall immediately return to give my opinions upon some topics of an interesting character topics in regard to some of which there exist both misstatements and misapprehension the greatest misstatement the greatest misapprehension especially so far as i am concerned may simply mention one of then tomes the delivery of fugitives from service v ith regard to that question there exin the greatest prejudices the greatest misapprehensions do not wonder at the misapprehensions am well aware that isa topic which must excite prejudices can very well feel what the prejudices are which it must very naturally bung up in the minds of the good people of this commonwealth but mr cuitis and gentlemen there are in regard to that topic duties absolutely

resolve performance of duty though i be a disagreeable duty any man can perform an agreeable duty but it is not every man who can perform a disageesble duty any man can do what is altogether pleasant

below the resolves concerning slavery which have been passed by the legislature of this commonwealth several weeks agothe aeries passed the house of repreaentativest with only lour dissenting voicea

passed in their present hum by a vote of to on saturday they came to the house again the amendments of the senate were concurred in and the resolves passed to be engrossed by s unanimous vote we are

reaffirmed therefore resolved that the people of massachusetts earnestly insist upon the application by congress of the ordinance ol with all possible sanctions and solemnities of law to the territorialall possessions of lh union in all parts of the continent and for all coming time resolved that the people ol massachusetts cherish the union with unabated attachment that they will support

the treaty exempts the whole of central america including the states of hon durse guatemala sen salvador nicaraugua and the entire mosquito coast from the dominion and control of any foreign power this comprises the whole region extending through the isthmus which divides north from south americaa distance of from ten to twelve hundred miles it provides for the protection of the canal from san

guarantied forever by all thereat leading powers known to civilization ind far this independence she is indebted to he american republic it will be rembered by all who know any hing of the history of english policy in ceb its america that great concessions from that government were necessary to the formation of such a treaty as this her poeseasory rights over different portions ot that large and in many respects valuable territory as it furnishes choice woods is mahogany and other kinds as well as jther productions exteud back more then a sentury all of these rights with the exception of her little ancient colony of the lielise which is about miles distant from the proposed canal she has surrendered ii will be recollected that mr polk offered sve hundred millions of dollaisfor the privilege ofthe tehuantepec route and was defeated by english diplomacy from obtaining n even at that enormous price now we iiave all these privileges without the coast of single dollar and we secure them partly ioo by the cooperation of the veryj power with which we were negotiating and which aolds a possession upon the isthmus while we have not a tingle acre there this most remarkable treaty has no parallel i will ven ure to say in the annals of english diplomacy and yet the wisdom of this liberal policy hi the part of that government is apparent emily russell our readers will recollect tha case of the young woman who was sold at alexandria ind the piteous letter which the victim wrote o her mother mrs cartwright of this city lbe whole case if recited in detail would fill a volume and such a volvme we hope will be written whenever the public mind of this nation shall become propeily aroused to the crimes and woes of slavery it is announced on the authority of bruin and hill the slave dealer that emily russell has been released from the grasp of avarice and the touch of polution by the finger of the almighty who has taken her to that land where the servant is fiee from his master she died in georgia on her way to the far south a gentleman in this city who is intimately acquainted with mrs cartwright has called to mention a few facta in regard to the effect of the reception of his news by the mother of the victim when she was finally compelled to give up all hope of dedeeming her beloved daughter from the dreadful doom lo which she had been sold and when she learned that the eoffle had actually departed for the south the hapless molhor drooped like a stricken woman she no longer lifted up her head or took a part in the privileges of life her mind was with that daughter gone gone aold and goneon her weary way to her dreadful destiny at length one day our informant called on her have you heard anything from my daughter yes i have was ihe reply tetter from bruin and hill and what is the news the friend thought it best to give a direct answer emily is dead tha mother immediately lifted up her eyes and raised her hand toward heaven and exclaimed thank the lord this is what have prayed for most earnestly that if she could not be liberated she might die before she reached the market she said she eonsid ered it an answer to her prayers and that she had long felt a confidence that god would not lay upon her a buidenshe could not bear he had been so good to her at all times that she had still trusted in him and he did not deceive her hope here she recounted some of the leading events of her life to show what god had done for her in eveiy exigency she is distinguished for the habit of referring all event to the band of god who doeih ail

leave the subject without noticing it in a manner at once serious and impressive tb present is a moment when we stand almost as it wore on the brink of a dissolution of tbs uniona separation of these statesand perhaps a long and bloody civil war what has brought about this awful state of things what has excited the south almost to a pitch of madness we answer in the main the action of these very societies they gather in nsw terk tie first and second weeks in may to compart notes hold meetings and raise money they are all of one side ol thinking in regard to slavery there is no opposition when they meet they have their own way and no cheek they come from all sections very much excited about the institution of slavery in the south and the wrongs of their colored brethren sod sisters they mix with then eat dnnk pray preach bing and by the time the week is over they are ready to go home to their various aeetiona raving nark staring mad on the topic and diaaeminate their outrageous and false sentiments all throngh the length and breadth of the free states the south here of these raving and fancy the whole north are engaged in them instead of these few miserable fanatics this slavery question will not only shake the politics elements of our union to its fall but tf so the protestant church of christ in this country will be engulphed in its rains the chureh of st paul and st

methodist church in the south will not have anything to do with their brethren in the north and the detestation of the preabyte ian is becoming as universal in the south as hatred to an abolitionist for the name is but the same thing the presbyterian as a church is the fountain head of abotitionism and the day is not far distant when a presbyterian minister in the south or even a layman if he continues in communication with the north will have to run for his life or elseruu for martyrdom or crucifixion the merchants men of business and men of property in this city should frown down the meetings of these mad people if they would save themselves what right have ii the religious lunatics of the free states to gather in this commercial city for purposes which carried into effect would ruin and iestroy its prosperity will the men of sense illow meetings to be held in this city which re calculated to make our country the arena af blood and murder and render our city an abject of

and then say whether these things shall go forth to the south and the world as the the great city of new york every citizen has a right legally ud more than morally to have his say at the imalgamatiou

mad as insanity could make them the antislavery delegates of every hue and of eveiy clime will pour upon us by monday and on tuesday they wih assemble to give people a true notion of what free discussion can accomplish they will be full of all kinds of assaults upon all kinds of decency and upon liberty itself they will assault the people the nation the constitution the representatives and

the bible then everything divine and human throughout the world quarrelling among themselves at a fearful rats and possibly kicking up a disgraceful riot in order to become martyrs to their false pa

become interested and get upon the stage and the tables by talking down and voting down the actors it would be a case of real free discussion popular opinion rising superior to local prejudice and

placing the slave with ins face to a pout in which is framed a crossbar an iron collar or ring is put round his neck and fastened to the post the arms are exteoded each way and fastened to the crossbar by ting around the wrist they are then stripped bare and thus are whipped from twentyfin to fifty lashes and upwards and sometimes as long as a man can continue to use the whip without being exhausted and they often die there under the lash if a slave is brought down from kentucky or virginia and sold to a planter at the southand it is understood that he has any pride or occasionally assumes a degree of independence unbecoming a slave or shows any reluctance against being driven beyond what is consistent and humane he is as the drivers say getting damned smart and must have a small touch of the mississippi breakdown and without any further ceremony he is put on the post and whipped untill the driver thinks he will not be quite so smart and in many cases it is necessary to

is turned up over their head and they are made to lie down with their face to the ground their arms extended and tied to a stake a board is then taken which is prepared in shape like a shovel the wide part full of small holes and with this they are beaten on the bare fleih from twentyfive to two hundred blows after these blows are repeated a few times the skin tears away and the blood and flesh are driven through these holes with grelt force and flies several feet from them and yet this is very modest and mederate correction females are required to do as much work on a plantation a men and there are generally about thirty women to seventy menthe treatment of slave women is so severe and their labor so hard that very few children are raised on the sugar or cotton plantations and if they are alive at birth they grow up feeble and puny and from neglect and the want of proper cleanliness and care very few become men and women vikuinia on thic nashville convention out of nearly one hundred

for it is herebefore you in unmistakable character how completly unfeeling inhuman and brutalized a man can become and yet be a gentleman and respectable the number of slaves sold here at auction is very great there is a large number of traders pens where slaves are received on consignmant and sold on commission the traders also buy for speculation the laigest of these establishments is in esplenard street they are a long row of buildings and on the front step on the sidewalk the slaves are made to stand for exhibition from oclock in the morning till oclock in the afternoon there are often in these slavespens arranged in a line on the sidewalk from five to eight hundred and these are fine looking robust stout young men and girls from the age of sixteer to twentyfive there are also

for those it considers deserving but not such a one as consorts with their own estimate of their exalted merits the great error in this case is in the original maxim it is false and detestable the world owes you a living ho v owes have you earned it by good service if you have whether on the anvil or in the pulpit or asa teacher you have required a just livelihood but if you have earned or worse still done little or no good the world owes you nothing you maybe worth millions and able to enjoy every imaginable luxury without care or effort but if you have done nothing to increase the sum of human comforts instead of the world owing you anything as fools have babbled you are morally a bankrupt and a beggar mankind are just awkening to consciousness of the duty resting on every man to be active and useful in his day and in bis sphere all are not called to dig or hew or plough or plane but every man has a sphere oi usefulness allotted to him by providence and is unfaithful to his trust if he deserts it for idle pomp and heedless luxury oue may be fitted by nature and inclination for an artisan another for a sailor but ho man ever born is fitted for an idler and a drone those who become such are the victims ol perserve circumstances and a deplorably false education but has not the rich man the right to enjoy his wealth most certainly we would be the last to deprive him of it he has a natural and legal right to possess and enjoy it in any manner not injurious to others but he has no moral right to he useless because he has superior means of being useful let him surround himself with all the true comforts and luxuries of life let the masterpieces of art smile upon him in his galleries and the mighty minds of all ages speak to him from his library let plenty deck his board and the faces of those he loves gather joyously around let him possess in abundance the means ot satisfying every pure and just desire of his nature and become wiser nobler larger in soul than his less fortunate neighbor but let him never forget and if he is properly trained he never can that it is a solemn duty to be useful to his fellow creatures especially to the depressed aud sufferingto labor for their benefit and suffer if need be for their ele vation the servile idolatry with which ignorance and vulgarity have looked to power and wealth the hosannahs which the trampled millions have sung before the ears of conquerers and other scourges of the earthare fading flitting forever in the twilight which succeeds this gross darkness there comes a season of moral anarchy when men having lost faith in the juggles which once blinded and bound them resolved to believe nothingto decry and prostrate all that rises above its lowest level what i saw one morning in india a long but sleepless night in the march of had fevered my bloodas one morning ere yet a single individual was stirring about our quaiters strolled towards the mountain gorge and had stumbled almost to the top of the stetep acclivity before the faint flush of dawn had roused the sentinel whose call awoke the solitary pair of musicians of our party a drummer and fifer to sound the reveille in ten minutes more i stood panting on the summit of the rock gazing thirstily on the scene beneath me where asiatic beauty winded slowly before me like a glorious river whose changeable waters the eye tired not of drinking i had no fear of thief or thug for a late excursion in the district behind me had assured me safety but nevertheless i started riolentlj when from tha branches of a stately peepul tree that grew close by a dark figure that seemed of human proportions leaped with a jibbering cry upon the ground i had no great reason to be alarmed for i saw not a man but a monkey one of those longlegged brown monkeys with whitestreaked faces that abound amongst these bights and which probaby little less startled than myself receded as i advanced jabbering its dissatisfaction at my intrusion at the foot of the peepul tree throwing up its rich white petals that shed around a sweet but sickening odor grew a magnificent plant of the datura and as i stooped to pluck it a rustle in the underwood beyond followed by an acute sharp scream wmch i as scribed to my friend the monkey arrested my hand i had judged correctly but i had underrated the number of my early companions with aspring that brought to my feet making me in my turn retreat the monkey lay moaning and as i thought violently convulsed among the grass nor did i at the moment perceive wha indeed i discovered with a degree of horror that round his body was twisted a gorgeous spotted snake the cobra dicapello i wish i could describe the maddened contortioua of the monkey as writhing beneath the straining coils of the reptile it rolled on the grass in vain efforts to rid itself of its deadly r ssailant the piteous gaze of its eyes as they wistfully looked up into my face was eloquent with a summons for help which i was by no means inclined to resist whether the snake bad bitten it or not i could not guess for it seemed to me as if it were merely playiug ith the animalthat fatal game which the cat plays with the mouse but i shouted and threw astone and then seizing a withered branch that lay on the ground i advanced to the charge the monkey which at another time would have fled at my approach now remained perfectly motionleis as if it awaited certain succor but the serpent aroused to the cognisance of an assailant put its horrid crest into that hoodlike form which renders it so appallingly hideous gave vent to a loud hiss that seemed brimful of poison again and again struck at it nor was it without a cold thrill through my veins that i beheld it disengage itself from the monkey but far from attempting to make its escape as i had conjec hred it would do it turned itself half erect towards me and with a fluttering hobblelike the hop of a bird whose wings have been brokenit leaped with forked tongue protruded right into my very path there was no time for thought my stick was neither strong nor long i could see the venomous eyes burn like fire and the colors of its swelling neck glow more deeply as it prepared to spring again and i was fairly on the point of making my retreat by plunging at all hazards down the rock behind me when a shrill chirrup cry somewhat like that of a guinea pig was heard and suddenly an elegant little creature which at the moment i was well nigh ready to spiritualize into a good genius sprung upon the serpent with a hound of lightsome ferocity which reminded me of the swoop of a kite upon a wa terrat it was a mungoos and now indeed a combat took place which fixed me to the spot in mute admiration but not for long once or twice it seemed to me that the mungoos was bitten but it might not have been so for the velocity of their movements as clinging together the snake and its foe rolled over and over amongst the long grass prevented minute observation it is asserted that when bitteff by a snake the ichneumon retires for a moment to eat of some unknown plant capable of rendering null the viperine venom but on this occasion nothing of the sort occurred the mungoos left not the conflict for a breathing space and at the end ofabeutten minutes the cobradicapello lay dead torn and mangled piecemeal by the little animal which frisked and danced about with a purring sound in a perfect frenzy of enjoyment as i held out my hand actually believing in the enthusiasm of the moment that it would approach to receive my caresses the mungoos giving a bright quiek look at me stamped its tiny hindfeet briskly on the relics of the serpent as if in scorn of its victim and disappeared amongst the brush wood i had forgotten the poor rfronkey i found it stretched out stiff and stark among the datura flowers the mungoos had come too late tiie worlds industrial exhibition the national intelligencer of tuesday has anhnteresting correspondence

sabbath in norway l found that it is the custom over all norway to devote the sunday evening to social pleasures taking literally the text the evening and the morning was the first day they consider the sabbath as commencing at six oclock on saturday and terminating at the same hour on sunday a doctrine in which i believe they are countenanced by the pilgrim fathers of america accordingly in norway there is no public entertainment such as theatricals or dancing permitted by law on saturday evening and the more strict class of people will not see their friends even privately at that time believing however the day of rest and of devotion to be at a close on the sunday at six oclock they feel themselves then at liberty to enter upon any amusement or enjoyment for which they may have an inclination even in the houses of the clergy there will be found both cardplaying and dancing on this evening and this without the slightest scandal to their flocks chambers edinburgh journal an
