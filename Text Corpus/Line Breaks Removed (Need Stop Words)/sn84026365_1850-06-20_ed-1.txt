unity and brotherhood of the human race rev thomas smyth i d the carolina patriarch who gained more fame than glory by his encounter with frederick douglass in ireland has just published an elaborate argument entitled the unity of the human race proved to be the drctrine of scripture reason and science the reader may charitably suppose that the slaveholding dr has profited by mr douglasss tuition and his experience in ireland and emancipated his slaves and that having repented of the sin of degrading men into brutes he boldly preaches the gospel of equal brotherhood to his slaveholding partners in sin calling them to love their neighbor and break every yoke and prove their love to god by their ve to their brethren not so we presume as we have no evidence of his repentance or reform that dr smyth remains a slaveholder it go he still practically gives the lie to the teachings of moses the prophets and jesus christ and out of his own mouth he is condemned he is moved to his work not by love for man but reverence for the bible not to protect him from outrage and desecration but to preserve that from doubt not to check violence and oppression and war but to stem the increase of infidel science it brings him no grief to see immortal souls brutalized the holiest union of life torn asunder the fairest creature of an infinitely wise and good creator deformed into a monster or sunk to stolid idiocy no he can join in the horrible sacrilege and defend it as acceptable service to god but his righteous soul is vexed that the expounders of the wonders of nature cast doubt either upon the text or the ancient interpretation thereof and he overflows with zeal to vindicate the integrity of the scriptures to what end that they shall be made to redeem man from slavery and war and the world from sin or that they shall continue ito furnish a bulwark to legalized and popular crime let his life give an l swer but whatever his motive his argument falls with its full weight upon his own head at the bar of conscience and the world he stands convicted by his own pleading of infidelity to the scriptures and to god in his daily practical denial of the human brotherhood well might the learned naturalists whom he arraigns for irreverence to the scriptures reply thou hypocrite doth not the same revelation which declares god hath made ail nations of one blood also command love thy neighbor as thyself dost thou appeal to moses then like moon this fiftieth year of the century proclaim a jubilee ofliberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof believest thou in the prophets like them go thou into the oalaces of the oppressor and cry aloud commanding to break every yoke art thou a disciple of christ follow him in preaching deliverance to the captive in saving the lost and healing the sick receive the poorest slave as jesus himself for inasmuch as ye do it to one of the least of these ye do it untohim dost thou revere the apostles heed their counsels and render justice and equality to thy servants dost thou defend the bible and the oneness of the human race obey the bible and treat manas thy brother pluck the beam of injustice from thy own eye ere thou seekest for the mote of error in ours to answer such a reply we suspect would give dr smyth a severer task than that he has attempted opinion abroadof the benton and foot fracas in the senate the london standard an able and judicious journal says when we compare so frightful an exhibition as this to any of the altercations in the british senate we feel that we have a right to be proud of the exercise of public opinion on the conduct of our parliamentary represen atives terms at an adjourned meeting of the vestry of st homas p e church held monday evening june d the following preamble and resolutions reported by a committee previously appointed were accented and unanimously adopted the said committee was also authorized to publish sie same in such papers as they might see proper to select whereas the minister church w ardens and v estrymen of st thomas p e church did send in a petition to the episcopal convention of tho diocese of pennsylvania sitting in philadelphia may praying said convention to repeal the bth revised regulation which prohibit the aforesaid church from being reps resented by delegation having been under the superintendence of the bishop of the diocese upwards of fiftyfive years and having conformed to the doctrines discipline and worship othe episcopal church during the period above mentioned and whereas the said petition was referred to i committee of five gentlemen to report to the convention to be held in st andrews church in and whereas a majority of the committee not only reported adversely to the prayer of the petitioners but betrayed a spirit very unbecoming professing christians announcing in their report that our color physical and social condition and education rendered us entirely unfit to sit in deliberative bodies and whereas we are not surprised at the final result yet we confess that we are perfectly astounded to find that it was thought necessary in so solemn an assembly in order to reach the result to condescend to appeal to those unrighteous prejudices unknown in the constitution of the church the book of common prayer and utterly at variance with all the principles precepts and doctrines as laid down by the great head of the church therefore resolved that if we were heretofore dextrous of beiog admitted into union with the convention weare not now nor can we hereafter bewith due respect to ourselves and to posterity social condition and education continue to be the test of admission or rejection resolved that in the opinion of this vestry the expressions that were used by some of the members of the convention should be kept from the heathen lest the gospel should fail to have its salutary effect upon their minds they instinctively rejecting the message at the hands of those who justify complexional distinctions in the church of christ resolved that expediency is no plea against the violation of the great principles of charity mercy justice and truth resolved that the consoling consideration offered by reminding us that the rejection could not debar us from communing with the spirit did not in our humble opinion come with very good grace after having been told in terms not to be misunderstood that we were entirely unfit to hold visible fellowship with a delegated counsel of that body who defines the church to be a visible body or faithful men c whose high mission on earth is fulfilled only so far as she is a coworker with the spirit resolved that the thanks of this vestry be and are hereby tendered to that portion of the convention who endorsed by their votes the minority report which developesthe true catholic spirit beautifully harmonizing with all that is pure holy and elevating in the christian system james needham clayton miller j c bowers

episcopal convenuon of the diocese of pennsylvania on the majority report of a committee to whom was referred a certain petition from the aforesaid churchrespectfully asking a repeal ot the eighth revised regula tion resolved as the sense of this ves trythat the members of st thomas church have common understanding and know how to appreciate virtue honesty and industry as well as other people let their complexion be what it may right is of no sex truth is of no color destroyed garrisonism have among the great benefits resulting from the organization of the free soil party we rank the influence it has had in bringing to a due standard of moderation the views of so many northern abolitionists that this has been achieved is plain enough compare the spirit manifested at the tabernacle on tuesday morning with what it has been in times past we regard that meeting as the final struggle of the ultra or garrison party in it they were worsted alike by public opinion and then own foiiy the whole country is agitatiug upon the question as it never has been before the long strife in congress has reached its crisis and all eyes are turned upon this great display of ultra abolition strength it shared for a moment with congress the attention of the people even the mercbers of that body might be supposed to feel its influence in that decision what came of it all their great anniversary was a failure not even important enough to be abused as if blinded for their own destruction they did not even play their own best cards wendell phillips the gentleman the scholar the fearless orator the only redeeming man of the party who shines among his company like a pearl on a dunghill sat in inglorious silence and the time was occupied in stupid discussion on negro physiology and the empty jabber of some half taught negroes cowering all the while beneath a bullys fist so spoke the brooklyn freeman on the th inst so reason madmen no doubt the webseters and clays and footes and slaveholders north and south think the garrison meeting at the tabernacle was a failure they intended to make it a failure if they washed their hands in the blood of the peaceable men and women that assembled there yes madmen may regard that meeting as the final struggle of the ultra garrison party now we are not technically of the garrison party nevertheless we will say that that anniversary instead of being a failure was the beginning in our opinian of a glorious triumph the infidel and blasphemous parties of this country can produce no moral failure by the interposition of of a drunken mob the physical arms of lawless i warns under tlvo gfrtdrvce rrp tv christless church and a ruined state may not and cannot crush the moral power of he country on the contrary as the history of the world has proved as the history of this cause has proved it does but give vigor to the power it intended to dsstroy garrison preached a more effectual iesson at the tabernaclehe has written out a more truthful ana godly sermon upon the literature of the country than the orthodox of the schools ever thought of he did indeed prove himself the real christian the true dis i ciple and showed his persecutors to bethe infidels and blasphemers of the truth and the god of truth that sermon will live and gather fruit and triumph over the pharisaical impious and infidel instructions of the schoools until a better day dawns upon hu manity the parties have made a desperate onset upon god and humanity since congress assembled their energies have all been gathared and propelled with concentrated force against the friends of truth and righteousnessbut they may as well hope to dethrone the almighty as to break the power of his faithful followers they have got to ltarn that truth crushed to earth will rise again but that day is passed in this country truth cannot even be crushed here in europe it may be pressed down by power but here it rises by the pressure upon it we love garrison and douglass and phillips the better for their perse cutionsliberty party paper imprisonment of a british subject in the police intelligepce which will be found reported in our paper of our will be found the case of isaac bowers a colored man a native of antigua and of course a british subject who has recently suffered an imprisonment of two months in the goal of charleston south carolina for no criminal offence or misdemeanor committed by him but solely on the ground of his color he does not appear tc have landed at the port of that city but was taken boldly and by force out of the british bark mary jinn from under the protection of the british flag and contrary to our treaties with the united states and the amity of nations was deprived of his personal liberty and subjected to the restraints and discipline of a prison isaac bowers is admitted to be a most respectable man but if we may judge from the answer of lord palmerston to the question o mr cockburn in relation to his case he is not likely to obtain any redress for the indignity and injury he has suffered at the hands of the american au tohrities now we do not intend that this case shall pass over so lightly itis too important to be shuffled out of sight to suit the convenience of any parties and the question must receive a definite answer whether the colored population belonging to this country and its various dependencies are to be treated as felons and slaves in any ports dlhhe united states and whether the british government is unable or unwilling to protect them when going rochester n y thursday june  they mr rusk replied at considerable length in defence of the title of texas to the rio grande the debate was continued no new point of interest being disclosed by messrs hale davis of mass and douglas mr davis of miss supported mr clemens amendment in a speech of some lengthand with much vehemence insisting that the title of texas to the rio grande is indisputable and expressing his unqualified dissent from any proposition which shall eventually give to free soil any portion of territory belonging so clearly to the south mr foote said he would not himself vote for the committees proposition for the settlement of the boundary of texas if he was not satisfied that it would not result in making free soil e thither on their lawful business it may not be known to some of our readers that had the captain of the mary jinn chosen to have left isaac bowers in prison or have refused to pay the expenses incurred by his detention there he would have been sold to pay the goal fees and would now be a slave probably on some southern plantation the committee of the antislavery r society have long had the laws and polt lice regulations of the slave states afd fecting colored people under their e consideration and heve frequently r sought the aid of f h y rnrpent forj the protection ot them vnen injured j by their application some years since lt two british subjects from the bahamas were seized and cast into prison in one of the slave states on the ground of their color by a mere accident it was discovered that being unable to pay the goal fees they were sold as slaves in that case the government made a demand on the united states and one of them was ultimately discovered andr restored to his freedom the other could not be found and most probably died under the merciless treatment he received it is not improbsble that at this very time there are many british l colored subjects in slavery in the uni i ted states and that more will have to i endure the same hard fate unless thel government be urged to do its duty i a case similar to the one now under consideration was fully brought under the attention of lord aberdeen when t foreign minister and from the correspondence whidh ensued it was understood that in future the personal free c dom of all british subjects without dis junction of color would be respected in c american ports the case of ftaac bowers however shows that we twere mistaken and we now call upon severy portion of the british press and a the british public to demand from the government that measures be immediately taken toprevent such outrages on our fellowsubjects for the future n we call also on the entire body of col lored persons in the emancipated colonies and in england to make a spe u cial effort to obtain their rights in this a particular we advise them without dsiay to call public meetings to collect facts and to memorialize the government on this important point nor to desist until the foreign ministers shall do them justice and extend an equal cl protection to them with that enjoyed by their white fellowsubjects jhitisla t very itiponer it thirtyfirst congressfirst session we copy the following report of the proceedings of congress from the new york tribune washington june the senate met at ii oclock hardly a quorum present mr mason presented a memorial from mr ritchie asking to be released from the contract for public printing it was referred to the committee on printing mr king asked to be excused from the further service on the committee of investigation into the benton and foote rencontre he stated that it is supposed by a party interested in the investigation that he is biased in relation to the matter and he felt that he could not serve on the committee consistently with selfrespect the difference is understood to be between mr king and mr benton the motion to excuse was adopted after the transaction of the morning business the senate in committee of the whole resumed the consideration of the omnibus bill mr clemens moved to amend the section fixing the boundaries of texas so as to conform those boundaries as settled by the law of limits passed by the texan congress in also providing for the setting apart for the use of the indians all of the territory north of latitude deg the indians tobe collected and removed thereto at the expense of the united states mr clay addressed the senate avoiding the question of title of texas but discussing the importance of the amendment in its bearing and influence upon the general question in consideration of the many differences of opinion in regard to the title of texas this wa preeminently a subject of compromise the compromise proposed by the committee he believed tobe one which ought to command the approval of both sections southern gentlemen in particular in view of the doubts thrown upon the title of texas ought to give it a hearty assent he called upon southern senators not to insist upon their assertion of the undoubted title of texas and predicted that ifthe question should ever be submitted to the decision of the supreme court they would decide against the claim of texas g od is the father of us all and all men are brethren and intimated an amendment removing all doubt from this point after further debate by messrs cass berrien butler and mason mr ebster said he did not desire to see great political questions referred to the judiciary of the country he thought it much better to settle such questions by compromise yet he saw no difficulty in bringing this question of the title of texas to the supreme court ot the united states the question was one between the united states and the state of texas and he proceeded to show by argument that the case might be easily and rc marly brought before that tribunal mr mason desired to enter his dissent to the proposition that any case could arise in which the united states could be one party in a suit and a state in another mr hale moved that when the senate adjourn it should be to monday next it was very evident that the senate could not get through with the amendments to the bill tomorrow mr clay suggested that the motion was not in order while the bill was under consideration and the friends of the bill generally insisted upon sitting tomorrow for the purpose of getting the final vote if possible the vote was then taken upon the amendment of mr clemens and it was rejectedyeas nays mr hale moved a postponement of the bill until monday mr clay opposed mr benton intimated his intention on monday to move the indefinite postponement of the further consideration of the bilk the senate then refused to postpone the bill till monday but made it the special order for tomorrow and after an executive session adjourned house of representatives after unimportant preliminary business an ineffectual attempt was made to take up private bills the house went into committee of the whole on the state of the union and resumed the consideration of the california question messrs hubbard richardson and williams gave notice of amendments they will offer mr caldwell of kentucky proceeded to show that the antislavery movement was for the purpose of acquiring political power he was willing to admit california in connection with territorial governments for utah and new mexico but not without he planted himself on the democratic platform of nonintervention to slavery mr root declared the people of the north all one way on the slavery question and there would never be dough facery here if they were honestly represented it was glory more than enough that the wilmot proviso had made california glorious as a new state mr johnson of arkansas advocated the missouri compromise and pressed the necessity of all southern men combining to oppose the organization of the north against southern rights forty members present and two persons only in the galleries mr duncan was in favor of the admission of california and territorial governments for ndw mexico and utah excluding slavery and a proper settlement of the boundary between new mexico and texas he was also in fa or of the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia mr duer gave notice of an amendment almost in the words of the compromise of the senate he was aware of the strong objections to it but there was necessity for action of some sort and this was less objectionable than some other propositions he reserved the right to offer or not to offer it being governed by circumstances the committee rose and the house took a recess till oclock at a quarter past the consideration of the california question was resumed mr jackson of ga advocated the missouri compromise line arguing that all the southern states can be profitably cultivated south of deg min he warmly defended the south mr durkee viewed the great controversy as a glorious war between truth and error between liberty and despotismand zealously argued against slavery fondly anticipating the ultimate triumph of general freedom mr phelps obtained the floor when a motion was made that the committee rise no quorum voted at halfpast ten there were thirty one members present the rules being imperative that the committee on finding itself without a quorum the roll shall be called and absentees reported to the house the members warned to set the rule aside but did not succeed as several wanted to make speeches the roll was called the committee rose and the names of absentees re ported at ten minutes to eleven the house adjourned washington june senate mr bentons resolutions instructing the committee on finance to inquire into the expediency of refunding to california the moneys collected from her citizens as duties on imports was passed after the consideration of the morning business the senate took up the omnibus bill the questien pending was upon an amendment moved by mr foote fixing the northern boundary to be proposed to texas at the thirtyfourth de whole no gree of north latitude also providing that nothing in the bill shall be construed as impairing the right of texas to all the territory claimed by her provided she shall fail to accept the terms proposed for the settlement of her boundaries a long and ununinteresting debate ensued upon this amendment in the course of which various propositions were suggested and disposed of finally however mr footes amendment was withdrawn and mr douglass moved to amend the section under consideration so as to fix the northern boundary of texas as follows run a line drawn due east from the rio grande from the south end of the junction of the dead to thered river also fixing the dividing ridge of the mountains separating the waters of the rio grande and the gila as the western boundary of texas mr davis loco of miss here addressed the senate in opposition to the entire proposition for settling the boundary of texas by any of the modes proposed where did the united states get the power to purchase the territory and where did texas derive the authority to sell he contended that the thing was wrong and the result of the pending propositions if agreed to would only be to rob the south of alarge portion of territory unquestionably belonging to and suited for slave territory these remarks drew out a repetition of former discussions upon the necessity and propriety of compromising the questions in agitation in the cousre of which mr foote triumphantly announced the defeat death burial and extermination of free soilism and predicted the speedy settlement of all the controverted questions of the day and the overthrow an destruction of demagogues by thousands mr hale free soiler of n h responded in a tone of pungent irony expressing his sincere thanks to mr foote for having come out fairly and squarely and declared that he would not go tor this measure if he supposed it would add a foot of free soil mr dawson whig of georgia went into a castigation of mr hale intimating that he had mounted the freesoil hobby for interested purposes and reading from a letter published several years ago by rev mr paper called ihe star for the purpose or snowing that mr hale at that time took decided ground against abolitionism the letter states that mr hale at the close of an address by mr storer arose and denounced abolitionism in no measured t rms as well as declared the black s to be beasts inhuman form unfit to live free he also read an extract from the dover n h gazette which he intimated was then under the control of mr hale in which also the abolitionists are handled with much severity and an abolition lecturer named thompson is threatened with a law found inside of pine and outside of geese or in other terms a coat of tar and feathers mr dawson thought the position taken by mr hale at that time honorable creditable and worthy the good heart which he knew he possessed he only alluded to this history now for the purpose of suggesting to the senator that having once held such views and changed his own sentiments he should have more consideration and charity for those who then thought with him and whose views had not changed mr hale admitted the general accuracy of the statement made by rev mr storer and that within fifteen years his sentiments had changed and proceeded to defend himself with considerable force against the aspersions upen his course washington june mr webster presented a memorial of citizens of boston praying that professor johnson may be authorized to make further exploration under the direction ot the government of the coal regions of the country which he supported with a few remarks the bill to promote the progress of the useful arts was taken up and madea special order for halfpast oclock tomorrow mr clay who had been indisposed here entered the senate his health having much improved after the consideration of morning business the senate took up the omnibus bill mr hale having the floor withdrew in favor of mr benton who he said desired to address the senate to day mr clay expressed the hope that mr benton would postpone making the motion which he had intimated until the vote should have been taken on the amendments proposed to the bill mr benton intimated that there was no disposition to take any vote that further discussion upon amendments was only to add to the waste of time all ready accomplished in the consideration of the bill and expressed his readiness to withdraw whenever the senate should be ready to take a vote he then moved the further consideration of the bill bepostponed until the th of march in the year of our lord and proceeded to address the senate in support of the motion butin so low a tone for some time as tobe inaudible in the gallery after some sarcastic and amusiug observe tions in relation to the appointment of the committee of thirteen and their operations he said california was made the scapegoat of all the sins of slavery innocent of it herself their sins were all heaped upon her head he gave an account of the proceedings among the jews in sacrificing a goat for the expration of the sins of israel for the purpose of showing the analogy between the ceremony and the action of the committee of thirteen one of the reasons given for the conjunction of the several measures was the speed with which she was to come in the argument had been fully answered by the lapse of timeanother argument was the danger of such opposition to the admission of calif inia as a separate measure altogether that resolution had been abandoned by those who advocated it california was made a mere handmaid of the territories to be used for this purpose three months ago he and mr clay stood together in favor of the independent admission of california the senator from kentucky left him as he had a right to do and he had refused to follow as he had a right to retuse but mr clay had no right to call upon those who chose otherwise to follow the path which he had taken he did not admit that the territories were the supreme objects of considera ion he admitted that they were ob ects demanding the attention of congress he felt that the neglect which they had experienced was a shame and reproach to congress but they were not the superior objects and entitled to the first consideration california occupied that position having prepared herself for immediate action and presented herself for admission into the family of states the pica was that by this bill california and the territories were to be carried through together but suppose they should be defeated together suppose california to whom there was little or no objection should be dragged downwith measures to which there was much demurring where would be her remedy and what the reasonable excuse for submitting her to such a fate why should the friends of california be compelled either to vote against her admission or to take with her and vote for measures which they honestly believe to be injurious and which they cannot therefore vote for and fiulfil ihe obligations they had assumed he proceeded to consider the several bills reported by the compromise committee exposing their various objections and incongruities he dwelt at much iength upon that portion of the california hill proposing to define the boundaries of texas and new mexico describing the geograghy of the country and contending that the boundaries suggested are unnatural and inexpedient having disposed of this branch of the subject he proceeded at great length with a general examination of the scheme presented as a compro miseconvulsing the chamber with laughter at his droll analogies and illustrations and attacking the matter ina strain of biting sarcasm and irresistible irony tuiich he applied equally and with no measured hand to the originators of the scheme its advocates and supporters in conclusion he observed that it was time to end this comedy of errorscalifornia was suffering for admission and the territories for protection with a view to that end he had made the motion to mr hale addressed the senate in reply to the personal attack made upon him by mr dawson on saturday last for the purpose ot vindicating himself from the charge of having from corrupt motives mounted a hobby to ride into power he gave a history of his political course showing that at the time he separated from the democratic party with whom he stood as well as any man that party was largely in the majority in new hampshire as for ambition for the future we had only to say that it was well known among his triends that jit was very far from his intention even to serve out the brief term for which he had been elected to the senate after a brief reply by mr dawson and a rejoinder from mr hale mr cass took the floor and the senate adjourned panorama of slavery we hail every effort to spread information on the subject of slavery with satistaction whether it come in the shape of public meetings lectures or pictorial representations and therefore we earnestly invite those unacquainted with its details or anxious to have their feelings of detestation deepened against the horrid institution to an inspection of the moving panorama of american slavery now exhibiting at the royal victoria hall leicester square the hours of exhibition are three in the afternoon and halfpast seven oclock in the evening the panorama opens with a scene on the african coast and then follow a series of paintings embracing the great outlines of slavery in the united states and the escape of slaves into canada the rev mr irwin the proprietor comes highly recommended to us as a christian and an abolitionist who during twelve years residence in the slave states became thoroughly acquainted with the system of slavery and the sufferings and degradation of the slave he accompanies the panorama with illustrative remarks having himself personally witnessed the events each department of the panorama is intended to represent with the exception only of the african scene we are satisfied thet the great object which mr irwin has in view is not profit but the diffusion of information on the subject of american slavery and that he deserves the patronage and support of every british abolitionist many will be intown during the anniversary meetings end not one of them we trust will fail to visit this panorama and to recommend others to follow the example an hour spent in this way we are persuaded will not be regretted a s reporter manumitted slaves mr timothy rodgers of bedford county va who died recently by his will emancipated bis slaves about thirty on condition that the american colonization society shall send them to africa the society made a public call for aid and stated that if siboo is contributed the slaves should be sent to their des tmation where on their arrival they will he liberally provided for under the provisions of the will this sum has been subscribed in nejv york city and the slaves will go to liberia rejoicing from the rochester democrat daniel webster and horace maun the hon horace mann has replied ai great length to the newburyport letter of mr webster which we published some da since mr w took occasion to refer rathei contemptuously to mr mann for which tie latter returns some pretty hard hits it space permitted we would give the whole of mr manns letter but as it is we can publish only the following i have seen a publication by mr horace mann a member of congress from massachusetts in which i find this sentence speaking of the bill before the house he says this bill derides the trial by jury secured by the constitution a man maj not lose his horse without a right to this trial but he may lose his freedom mr webster speaks for the south and slavery not tor the north and for freedom when he abandons this right this personal vituperation does not annoy me but i lament to see a public man of massachusetts so crude and confused in his legal apprehensions and so little acquainted with the constitution of his country as these opinions evince mr mann to be his citation of a supposed case as in point if it have any analogy to the matter would prove that if mr manns horse stray into his neighbors field he cannot lead him back without a previous trial by jury to ascertain the right truly if what mr mann ays of the provisions of the constitution in this publication be a test of his accuracy in the understanding of that instrument he would to well not to seek to protect his peculiar notions under its sanction but to appeal at once as others do to that higher au thoiity which sits emhtoned above the constitution and above the law on this mr m thus comments mr webster laments to see a public man of massachusetts so crude and confused in his legal apprehensions and so little acquainted with the constitution of hs country as these opinions evince mr mann to be yet he points out no error of opinion he specifies nothing as unusual he presents no information indictment bill of particulars or even the common counts judgment and condemnation alone appear he seems to have taken it for granted that he had only to say i was guilty and then proceed to punish i protest against and impugn tnis method of proceeding by any man however high against any man however humble when mr webster penned his lamentations over my crudeness confusion and ignorance he doubtless meant to deal me a mortal blow the blow was certainly heavy but the question still remains whether it hit polyphemus struck hard blows but his blindness left the objects of bis passion un harmed but wherein do these erroneous opinions consist which mr webster does not deign to specify but assumes to condemn fortunately in writing the sentences which he quotes for animadversion followed the precise meaning of judge stoty as laid down n his commentaries and in regard to the only point which is open to a question i look the exact words of that great jurist he speaks of the right of a trial by jury in civil cases as an existing right before the seventh article of the amendment to the constitution which preserves this right in suits of common law had been adopted comm instead of transcribing judge stoiys words in civil cases which present no distinct image to common minds i supposed the every day case of a litigation respecting a horse which is a civil case and this difference of fotm is the only difference between my language and that of the learned judge i can wish mr w no more fitting retribution after reposing from this ill tempeied attack upon roe than to awake and find that it was judge story whom he had maligned ttiir thp onininn expressed by me on this point does not need tne autfiuniy ol any itaiinr to support it and the illustration which i give is not only intelligible to every sensible man but is also apposite i said a man may not lose his horse his property in ahorse without a right to this trial mr websters comment is that this case if it have any analogy to the matter means that if a mans horse stray into his neighbors field he cannot lead him back without a previous trial by jury to ascertain the right was ever the plain meaning of a sentence more exactly changed about end for end mr webster may pitch summcrsetts with his own doctrines but he has no right to pitch them with mine i said a man may not lose his horse or his property in a horse without aright to the trial by jury he says i said a man cannot find or retake alost horse without a previous trial dulec est desipere loco or it is pleasant to see a grave senator play upon words but there must be wit to redeem it from puerijity but the childishness of this criticism is not its worst feature what is the great truth which mr webster and his apologists attempt here to ridicule it is that while every man amongst us in regard to any piece of property worth more than so of which violence or fraud may attempt to despoil him has a right to a trial by jury yeta mans freedom and that of his posterity forever may be wrested from him as our law now stands without such a trial d ies not this hold a mans freedom to be of less value than so if two adverse claimanls contest title to an alleged slave whose market value is more than this sum each is entitled to a jury to try the fact of ownership but if the alleged slave declares that he owns himself he is debarred from his right and this truth or a common illustration of it mr webster and his apologists think a suitable topic for sneers or pleasantry a foreign proverb says that for a man to kill his mother is not in good taste i trust the moral and religious people of massachusetts have too much good taste to telish a joke on such a theme mr mann then goes on to examine at length and with remarkable ability and learning the merits of the legal and constitutional question of granting a trial by jury to persons claimed as a fugitive slaves arguing that they have every way a good right there to we quote the following paragraphs mr webster advises me in a certain contingency to appeal to ihe higher authority which sits enthroned above the constitution and above the law i take no exception to this counsel because of its officiousness but would thank him for it my ideas of duty require me to seek anxiously for the true interpretation of the constitution and then to abide by it unswayed by hope or fear it the constitution requires me to do anything which my sense of duty forbids i shall save my conscience by resigning my office lam free however to say that if in the discharge of my political duties i should transfer my allegiance to any other power i should adopt mr websters advice and go to the power which sits enthroned above rather than to descend to that opposite realm whence the bill which he so coidially promised to support must have emerged mr webster holds massachusetts up to the ridicule of the woild because she grows fervid on pennsylvania wrongs and he has deemed it his duty to enquire how many seizures of fugiiive slaves have occurred in new england wiihin our time is this the christian standard by which to estimate the evil of encroachments upon the xaost sacred rights of men if i repose in contentment and indifference because my own section or state or county is as yet but a partial sufferer whv should i not continue contented and indifferent as long as i am safe in providing for the liberties of the citizen under a common government i think massachusetts worthy of all honor and not of ridicule because she does grow fervid upon pennsylvania wrongs and on the wrong of an entire race whether in pennsylvania or california certainly within the boundaries of our own country i see no reasorr why my sympathies asa man or the obligation of my oath as an of in regard to the nearer or remoter slates should be inversely as the squares f lie distances even with regard to foreign ountrtes did mr webster thnrk so in those tetter days when his eloquent appeal for op ressed and bleeding greece roused the na uon like the voice of a clarion did mr webster deem i necessary to make inquisi ians through all the new england states how many hungarian patriots there had been shot at the of the drum or how many noble women had been striped anj whipped in their market places before he bribed the heart of the nation at the wrongs if kossuth and his compatriots and invoked he execrations of the world upon the austri rn and russian despots see no difference between these cases which is not in favor o our own interests of our own domestic right except the difference of their bearings upon partisan politics conscience and the constitution with remarks on the recent speech of the hon daniel webster on the subject of slavery by m stuart lately professor in the theological seminary at andover published by croker st brewster boston this is a large octavo pamphlet of pages for which we are indebted to s m pettingill newspaper and advertising agent this work is ostensibly a zealous attempt to sustain the profligate course of the great new england apostate in laying himself and attempting to lay his constituents and his country upon the altar of human slavery in truth it is however an assay to overthrow the bible and god himself by making them the upholders and justifiers of that greatest of all violations of human rights the introductory portion of the present pamphlet is mostly personal and apologetic and is a singular medley of c asm pedantry garrullity greek philology argument and stale anecdote the ancient and venerable exprofessor evidently labors under a vague and rather indefinable impression of the difficulties that stand in the way of his effort the certainty that the natural and moral instincts of the people of new england and especially of massachusetts are against him seems to hang weightily upon his mind though he puts his sholder resolutely to tin wheel yet does lie betray at every moment the consciousness that the load is heavier than that he may be able to carry it we would like to present many and luminous extracts from this book did our limits permit a more remarkable instance of the weakness of learning when arrayed against commonsense and the common sympathies of the human heart we have never met here is a specimen of the way the learned hebrew lexicographer confounds the doctrines of modern abolitionists who contend that all slavery is sinful and criminal after a very brief consideration of the old testament teaching he says in the name of all hat is called reasoning now in morals or religion how is the ownership of slaves which heaven has given expressed leave to purchase to be deemed a crime of ihe deepest dyea malum in se an offence to be classed wnh murder and treason let those answer this question who decide a priori what the bible ought to speak and then turn it over in order to see how they can make it speak what they wish but there is no bending or twisting of mosess words there they are so plain that he who runneth mav read if abolitionists are right in their position then moses is greatly in the wrong more than this then has the god of the hebrews sanctioned with his express leave the commission of a crime as great as that which he has forbidden in the sixth or seventh commandment there is no retreat from this the position of the abolitionists plainly taxes high heaven with misdemeanor with encouragement to commit one among the foulest of crimes such exposition as this of the old testament from an evangelical doctor of divinity that men who know the utter diabolism ot slavery are ready nay compelled to reject the canonical auowu v n f a book which they are taught upholds the most atrocious wrong man can commit against his fellow man nor does the exprofessor of theology think much better of the new testament that also is proslaverychrist and the apostles were proslavery in fact opposition to the peculiar institution isin his judgment little less than blasphemy and nothing short of infidelity from the national era origin of the nashville convention the following is a letter from mr calhoun to col c s tarpley of mississippi fort hill july dear sir lam greatly obliged to you for a copy of the proceedings of your mississippi meeting i have read it with a great deal of pleasure you ask me loi my opinionas to the course which would be adopted by the mississippi slate convention in october next i have delayed answering your letter until this time that i might more fully notice the developments at the north befme i gave it they arc more and more adverse to us every day there has not been a single occurrence since the rising of congress which does not indicate on the pan of the north a fixed determination to push the abolition question to the last extreme in my opinion there is but one thing that holds out the promise of saving both ourselves and the union and that is a southern convention and that if much longer delayed cannot it ought to have been held this fall and ought not to be delayed beyond another year all our movements ooght to look to that result for that purpose every southern state ought to be organized with a central committee and one in each county ours is already it is indispensable to produce concert and prompt action in the mean time firm and resolute resolutions ought to be adopted by yours and such meetings as may take place before the assembly of the legislatures in the fall they when they meet ought to take up the subject in the most solemn and impressive manner the great object of a southern convention should be to put forth in a solemn manner the causes of our guevances in an address to the other states and to admonish them in a solemn manner as to the consequences which must follow if they should not be redressed and to take measures preparatory toit in cas they should not be the call should be addtessed to all those who are desirous save the unionand our institutions and who in the alternative should it be foic ed on us of submission or dissolving the partnership would prefer the latter no state could better take the lead in this great conservative movement than yours itis destined to be the greatest of sufferers if ihe abolitionists should succeed and i am not certain but by the time our convention meets or at furthest your legislature that the time will have come to make the call with great respect i am c j c calhoun paines light sir chales d aiehibald an english gentleman who has

too frequently nor too urgently direct the attention of our colored fellow countrymen to agricultural pursuits as a means of livelihood and final elevation to equality with the rest of the community situated as we are as a peopleshut out from nearly all profitable and respectable employments in towns and in cities our prospeci would be dark indeed were we thrown entirely upon menial employments for subsistence it is therefore a source of much encouragement to those who believe in the advancement of colored people in this country that agriculturethat employment which takes us into immediate cooperation with the arrangements of providence and which ai the same time removes us the farthest from the influence of the malign prejudice by which we are persecuted and oppressedi still open to us and bids us welcome to its manifold blessings it is evident to all who refleet upon the condition of colored people in large cities that many causes are in operation to render ii more and more difficult for them to gain subsistence the flood of emigration setting in upon our shores from the old world and especially from ireland is rapidly filling our cities with hungry competitors in those avocation upon which the colored people rely mainly for support loading and unloading ships piling timber in lumber yards stowing goods in stores carting hodcarrying grooming horses acting as servants gardening all these and many other occupations are tap idlv falling into the hands of the irish scotch and dutch emigrants to this country meanwhile the avenues to all respectable trades are firmly closed against us it requires but little philosophy to foresee that if emigration continues and the avenues to trades remain thus blocked up the condition of the colored people in cities must change rapidly from bad tp worse and finally become absolutely wretched and unendurable with such a prospect before us it becomes us as men fathers husbands and brothers to provide against the evil which may be plainly scanned in the distance it is cowardly and disgraceful on our part to see and acknowledge the impending ruin and indolently to rota out arms ann perisii wunoui a srruggler we must not cannot suffer such ignominy while men aie imbued with prejudices and inspired with hatred against us it is consoling that the earth and the elements like the great god that brough them into being are yet impartial and will pour their rich treasures into the garners of colored industry as they do into those of the white husbandman every days experience does but confirm us in the conviction that the most feasible path from poverty ignorance and degradation is that of agriculture we must become the tillers of the soil we must turn from the faces of men to the face of the earth fromj the partial and capricious arrangements of j society to the steady and impartial operation of the lawv of providence here we shall extract the means of living and improvement the community may deprive us of trades and may refuse to patronize us as shopkeepers ut the farmer of what color soever he be will always be able in this greedy world to command cash for wheat prejudice is strong but necessity is stronger let us at once become tillers of the soil and our elevation is certain but we may be told of the obstacles which obstruct even this path there are many who would gladly leave the large cities such as new york and philadelphia and go into thecounties around but they have large families that require every dollar which they can earn from week to week to satisfy their immediate aid pressing wants and they are therefore left without the means of emigrating and with them the struggle is to live we jo most fully appreciate the disadvantages under which our brethien labor we admit the difficulties tobe gieat but tliey are not insurmountable and the old maxim that where theres a will theres a way applies as truthfully to us as to any other people when we have seen the trains of povertystricken white men women and children in their dilapidated wagons moving forward towards the fertile west with animals that appeared but the apologies for horses we have been made to leel that emigration is wiihin the reach of any and every industrious colored family whose circumstances might justify them in making the effort many of our colored citizens have already through the benevolence of genii smith had the first impediment in their path removedland has been given to them these are without excuse and if they do not go upon these lands and improve themwe were about to say that they deserve to suffer we are however happy to learn that many have already taken up their goods and effects with their wives and little ones leaving behind them the menial employments of the city to become the honorable tillers of the soil and that more propose to go but what we desire to see is a general movement among our people in favoi of agricultura pursuits for not until we shall show ourselves not only capable but willing to take the world from the stump and extract a living fiom the earth need we ever look for independence o respect we may black boots carry the hod unload the ship dress hair and wait at the table until doomsday and we shall not havi moved one inch towards that equality anr respectability to which every human being ought to aspire come oppressed fellowcountrymen witl axe hoe and spade let us to the woods and by active industry and manly endurance provide for our own wants and achieve our own freedomf d i fry geo w goines whose name is above knows that so far as his shameless but characteiistic and impudent statement from being true that i turned aside from the subject intended for the lecture on the evening alluded to to speak on the influence of slavery over the general government and on this very prejudice as the grand reason why black men are treated us they are by the government and the people george w goines knows and had he a will to state the truth would say that threefourths of my lecture was on this very subject of negro hate the only reason i can conceive of whywhe does not tell the truth about the tnafter is that it is not las choice to do so as to my consenting to the handbill objected to the arrangement ot the house he knows and so do the trustees of the church and dr bias and rev mr templeton and scoies of olhers that i constantly remonstrated against it that i had no responsibility in the getting up of the bill goines also knows that the objectionable portion of ihe handbill was cut off by the chairman of the meeting from scores of them before they were put into circulation goines also knows that pewholders in the church resigned their seats voluntarily to accommodate the whites on the same principle of comity that one gives his rockingchair in his parlor to his stranger guest this was the distinct ground of miss alice james and many others where antislavery will with his now fret giassjcharles l re mond robert purvis george i downing t idomne genus who censured me ought thave known as they might lme known ihese facts and had ihey taken half the pains to see and know that what they said was true before they uttered it that they took to cast censure upon me injny absence they could and would have known the facts goines had the mendacity to mislead some of these gentlemen that mr douglass should however make such misslstements a appeared in his extra after left the city does not all surprise me but does remind me of like slips of his pen or more than one occasion before s r ward f j remarks the complaints against mr wardanay be stated in a very few words as to thepublic in philadelphia in a placard which stated that the lower saloon of the building should be appropriated to white citizens exclusively d he attended that meeting and delivered an address and never mentioned this insulting placard now we ask in all candor has mr ward denied the truth of either of these charges who ever said that threefourths of the lecture of mr ward was not on this very sub jectnegro hate who ever said that mr ward didnot object to the arrangement to ihe individuals named who ever said that the chairman of the meeting did not cut off the objectionable portion of a number of the placards nobody and nobody is therefore answered by mr wards indignant reply we can inform the editor of the impartial citizen that neither his blustering denunca tion of mr goines nor his polite rocking chair reasoning nor his reflections upon our motives can wipe out the disgraceful concision made by him in consenting to address the meeting in question without openly denouncing that infamous pacard that the north star extra did pot appear till after mr ward left philadelphia was the fault of the printer not purs mr ward knowslhat ive denounced that handbill in a public meeting two hours after our arrival in that city and three days before he leftf d north star fair in new york it will be seen by the report of the committee of the north star fair recently held in the city of new york that the members of the committee have resolved to continue their efforts this is gratifying and shows that the feeling which prompted the holding of the first fair was not an effervescent impulse induced by a desire to make a display but an earnest determination to support the cause of truth and justice the names of the ladies associated with this effort are quite sufficient to commend their cause among those who know them the are found in ihe front ranks of all those in new york who are nobly contending against prejudice and for the elevation and improvement of our downtrodden people this effort to sustain the press devoted to this work is proof that they well understand the causes that depress and enslave the coloied people of this country we commend the example of these our oppressed sisters to all our oppressed people and cal upon them to stand by and sustain those instrumentalities which serve to lemove manifold social aud political ills to which weare continually subjected here at the nrth and to break the chains of the slave at the south who would be free themselves must strike the bloio f d k we have copied in another plaqe the letter of mr downing to mr wardnot because we wish to take part in the matter which first originated the discussion but because the discussion has been made to turnon our representation of mr wards conduct in philadelphia in respect to that representation w r e may here say that we standby every word of it and that mr wards statement does not in the slighest degree invalidate our testimony as to what is said of messrs purvis remond and goines these gentlemen are fully of age and can speak for themselves we hope they may feci moved to do sof dm r delanywe have just received along letter from our friend delany addressed to samuel r ward and evidently intended as much for ourselves as for him

whole soul seems to be swallowed ip in the sincere desiie to be good as well asio do guodf othe first article on out first page animadverting upon dr smyth of charleston is copied fiom the pennsylvania freeman a more contemptible apostate does not breathe than this same smyth we encountered him in belfast ireland four years ago when he came to attend the evangelical alliance he then took the occasion to pronounce our representations of slavery to be false whereupon we challenged him to a public discussion instead of accepting our challenge he meanly made an attack upon our characterdenounced us an infidel and as of bad moral character we demanded satisfaction and he promptly responded giving the lie to what he had before uttered f d the new england a s convention it was fully our intention to have been present at this grand annual assemblage of the anti slavery masses recently held in the city of boston and we deeply regretted that circumstances made it inconvenient for us to fulfil that intention it is the most interesting of all antislavery meetings which we have attended there is generally a stronger array of talent and genius to speak as well as a larger gathering of earnest men assembled to hear at these meetings than at any other ansislavery meetings with which weare acquainted the present meeting seems to have been one of unusual interest and to have awakened much discussion and agitation in boston the boston papers have been remarkably unjust and untruthful in their representations of the speeches made and as as remarkably rude and slanderous towards the speakers themselves for low vulgarity dark insinuations and abuse of the abolitionists the boston press has shown itself but little inferior to that of new york we give below the remarks of a distinguished massachusetts senator respecting the character of this convention which we take to be a candid and impartial representation of that which he hasgenerously undertaken to set forth mr buckingham is notan abolitionistat any rate not a disunionist but is we believe a whig and was for many yeats the distinguished editor of the boston courier and devotedly attached to daniel webster it is however due to state that though a whig he yet retains a conscience and though devotedly attached to mr webster he has refused to follow the latter in his present infamous slave hunt but we are keeping the reader from ths article here it is read it entire f d from the boston courier one of the anniversaries by hon joseph t buckingham the anniversary week has passed away editors and reporters have ceased to utter their judgements and the public have probably forgotten that such things were will you allow me my old friends and associates to use a colum of the courier wherein i may place on record some thoughts that have occurred to me on reading ihe reports of the antislavery convention which have appeared in some of the papers i will endeavor to avoid the forbidden ground of politics and to keep my pen within the pale of civility though i am aware that the subject is one which barely to name may kindle afire in the breasts of some very good and fair minded people in my humble judgement messrs editors the new england antislavery convention was not during its sessions treated with that courtesy which it had a right to aspect and the reports of its proceedings and the speeches of its members have not b en fairly represented by the press some of those reports seem to me to be misrepresentations and caricatures i speak particularly of the speeches made during the sessions in the daytime the evening sittings i know nothing of for i did not attend anyone of them i was present nearly all the time during the three days and heard most of the discussions and i must confess hat heard nothing that required or justified the severity of remark or the contemptuous ribaldry with which the speakers have been rebuked it is not denied that they used gre at plainness of speechthat they spoke of the constitution and the jaws of politics and religion of the state and the church of politicians and cletgymen in tones of great indignation and in words of no equivocal import but ido not recollect any remark in relation to either of these subjects which i did not believe to be true or which i should hesitate to endorse as my own deliberate opinion the speakers were undoubtedly sincete in their opinions why then should they not be permitted to express them undisturbed by clamorous attempts to restrain the freedom of speech i know it is said by some that the abolitionists are covetous of martyrdom and if i mistake not it has been said that the leaders were disappointed and mortified at the close of their last meeting that they were obliged to adjourn with whole skins now i do not believe that francis jackson theodore parker wendell phillipsor any of those with whom theseour neighbors and fellow citizens are associated on this occasionno not even w l garrison himself who is the peculiar object ol calumny and hatred had any desire to create a riot or to subject themselves to personal violence it is sad tooand seemingly in extenuation of the rude and discourteous treatment they receivedthat thay invite the public to attend their conventions and must expect to create uproar and confusion it is true they invite all who are disposed to entei upon a discussion of their avowed principles and purposes toepme and hear and to speak it they see fit but this is not an invitation to hiss or to drown the voice of a speaker b stamping with the feet and thumping witii canes and bludgeons on the floor of the hall it is evident fiom tho alacrity with which individuals opposed to the sentiments of the convention were introduced upon the stage that there was no indisposition to hear their principles their arguments or their statements of acts controverted and i canno think that the imputation of a vyish to cieatf a mob and to excite sympathy by subjecting iheiqselves to personal injury is any thing better than gratuitous and wanton misrepre sentation the first speaker whom i heard was henry c wright and it was the first time had ever heard or seen him this man i understand is a graduate from the andovei theological seminary and from the mannei of his speakingnot certainly from tin matter one might have conjectured as much there is in his manner a good degree of genuine orthodox gesticulation whicl sets off his speeches with an air that reminded me of the rev lyman beecher his theme was hypocrisy his text was the words of the declaration of independence all men are created equal endowed vi l l certain inalienable rights this being selfevident proposition all laws and all practices that tended in any degree to produce ar artificial inequality were wrong and all met who believed or pretended to believe thai proposition was true and who should swea to support the constitution with its proslavery provisions were hypocrites and a nooks which maintained doctrines or permii ted or justified practices contrary to this self vident proposition he contended were no god but of the devil and coq n t be true h the bible the making of slaves ol any portion of the human race it was thus fat a aelfevident falsehood either the bible or the declaration of independence according to those who justified proslavery from the bible must be false and no one bad ever pretended that the declaration ol independence did not assert a sacred and sellevident truth mr wright applied his doctrine to henry clay daniel webster moses stuart leonaid woods william m rogers and to all who in less prominem spheres undertake to appologise tor holding men and women in slavery or lor returning fugitive slaves to their masters and declared them to be hypocrites by their own confession if they admitted that all men were created equal this argument he iterated and reiterated and enforced by many pertinent illustrations which i have not time to place on paper and lo which i could hardly do justice it i should make the attempt the strongest expression i heard from mr wright was that if the bible laught doctrines contrary to the self evident proposition that all men were created equal then the bible was a selfevident falsehood and he would grind it under his heel as he would the head of a rattlesnake ido not recollect that lie uttered this declaration nor do i believe that he did utter it in any one instance and think he must have spoken it at least fifty times unaccompanied by this hypothetical qualificationlf the bible teaches anything contrary lo this selfevident proposition c and in this form i am unable to see any objection to the sentiment it involves or to the language in which it is expressed at a subsequent stage of the discussion mr wright was asked by one of the audience il be believed that tire bible taught this doctrine thus opposed to the declaration of independence and he replied very emphati rally no in the oourse of his argument mr wright described what kind of a god tlrojvmusi be that was worshiped by daniel webster moses stuart e it could not bethe god of the bible for that was a god of love and humanitya god who had created all men equala god who had denounced the severest punishment against all the sins involved in tire system of american slavery their god and their bible permited all these atrocious sins and when he wright should take off his hat to such a god his head should come off with it i cannot discover anything in this that justifies the charge of blasphemy a young gentleman who hailed from new york here ascended the platfotm to enter his protest against the condemnation of messrs clay and webster whom he pronounced the greatest and the best of men supporteis of ihe constitution and the union and worthv of the admiration and love and reverence of the world he said he could not keep silent when he heard such men spoken of so falsely and he wished to show to the convention that their sentence of condemnation was not unanimous for he at least would not consent to itand here he laid his hand most pathetically on his chest as if he supposedand heprobaby ritsuppose that there was a soil of pairiotic pulsation inside of it the oratorical display made by this young gentleman added to his juvenile and narcissus like presence gained great applause and he descended from the platform with immense cheering the platform was next occupied by mr cc burleigh a gentleman whose personal appearance has been a theme for such gratuitous ridicule and censure i confess that his outside show is not exactly to my taste nor such as i should b ambitious to imitate but i supposj he cuts his heard and curls liis hair after the fashion w hich suits his own taste and brushes his boots as often as he plpases ard i do not see that his taste in this matter is any more a legitimate subjici for abuse and ridicule than trie taste of some young men whom one sees every day in the street and who if they had no other claim to humanity than the countenances which they decorate with hair whether red or biack is of no importancein such a grotesque nd unhuman fashion that the monkey and the orangoutaug u ight bo pardoned if they should salute them as their natural j brethren tlr burleigh dwelt chiefly on the sin of slavehunting a portion of his remarks were sarcastically severe on mr webster for the doctrines laid down in liis recent speech in the senate and especially for his declared imention to support masons bill to its fullest extent he aimed to show that the piovision of the constitution concerning the reclamation of fugitive slaves was in direct hostility to god and humanity and that their was a nohler and a higher jaw than the constitution which it was eveiy mans duty to obey whenever that law and the constitution came in conflict by this law of god and humanity he contended everyman is hound to afford food and shelter to fugitive slaves and doubted whether there were many persons who woud lefuse to succor the fugitive if he was in need of food and protection he spoke of a case within his own personal knowledge a negro women with a child in her arms fled fiom a cruel master in maryland and in a cold and stormy night knocked at the door of a gentleman in delaware and begged lor shelter he opened his doorthough he knew he was violating the law of the statereceived the forlorn wretch with her perishing babe fed and warmed her aid permitted her lo depart in peace the next morning now said mr are their any here who would not do as the gentleman in delaware did would noi out young friend alluding to the gentleman from new yok have done as much would not you sir addressing himself directly to the youiu man in that case have relieved that wretched fugitive afe a pause the gentleman said not if it would disturb ihe unionor words of that import but said mr b do you think the delevvare man was guilty of sin against the laws ofgodjwhen he thus violated the law of the state would vou refuse to give food to a fandshing fugitive although the law made the act a crime the reply was it would depend upon circumstances mr b continued press the interiogatoiy to which hesitating and evasive replies were given he asked for a direct answer to the question whether the young gentleman would in the same circumstances do as the man did who relieved the suffering slave and after the question had been repeated he was met with a decided negative this colloquy afforded some amusement to the audience and even those who were opposed to the auti savery doctrines seemed to make themselves a little merry at the awkward position of the gentleman from new york of all the antislavery orators wendell phillips seems to be thopoint st which the bitterest denunciations are duected slander like death loves a shining mark if those who empty upon him the vials of their vvraih and gall ha i the head to understand or the heart to feel what he utter w iih a grace and courtesy w hich very tew speakers can command very differentindeed would be the ime ot their reports i never heard an uncivil or ungentlemanly sentence fall from his lips he is as incapable of speaking a fals hood or of misrepresenting the position and arguments ot his opponents as some of them are of sitting a proper value on truth and sincerity in language or gentlenesss and urbanity of manners his sentences are welland harmoniously constructed and ate utter edl without efforthesitation or study he tnntets castigation on hiuocracy and wickedness with an unsparing hand with an instrument that stings but without bursting mauling and butcherin its object his vocabulary is entirely deficient in epithet of vulgar ny anu meanness his elocution is easy and graceful and his whole deportment has a character of dignity manliness which man persons who made more impirtunate claims m public approbation would do well to en deavorto imitate to rival is beyond their power shall make no attempt to repon any thing that mr phillips said in two ot n brief and incidental speeches which t e privilege of hearing for could givt eader no idea of the beauty of his langu ge or the power of his eloquence if i wer mbittouß of changing my position in society would more willingly be wendell phillips than either of the great stars that now shine with such overpowering effulgence in the constellations of politics and theolvgy i should be well pleased to give some of the remarks made by parker pillsbury theodore parker stephen s foster and others if i could do so without committing a trss pass on my permitted limits let me say however that the remarks made by mr foster in relation to an amendment which he proposed to one of the resolutions were very pertinent and adapted to secure a gererai approval of ihe resolution w as surprised to learn that the amendment was rejected by the convtniion you well know messrs editors that i am not an abolitionist in the accepted meaning of that term that i have never joined their ranks nor ever participated in their projects but when isaw the caricatures and nmsrep resntations that were published concerning the speakers in the recent convention and when i saw the dishonorable attempts of certain persons unknown to me to interrupt the proceedingsand when i heard the insulting hisses and clamors of a party and saw the calmness and patience and fortitude approaching to indifference with which these nutired advocates for fieedoin receives the reproaches and the contempuous jeers of their opponents i confess i was strongly tempted to go on to their platform to sustain their principles and to partake of their fate whatever it may be you also well know mat if belong to any political party and i am not aware that any party claims allegiance from me it is to one which meets with one favor from antislavery orators but on the contrary is the subject of then frequent and severe rebukes if i have any political sympathies they are all shared w th this contemned sneered at and despised party yet notwithstanding all the objurgatory and as i think unmerited reproof bestowed on this party by abolitionists for what they suppose to be its timidity and shortcommings target them all in of their fearless and irrepressible advocacy of the entire freedom of the human race the clay ami foote compromise the savannah republican one of the most strenuous advocates of slavery extension thus speak of this famous compromise a simple calculation the compromise of the committee of thirteen proposes to admit california one free state and four slave states from the texan tern iory which will be slave states is it for the north or the south to complain of this arrangement we get four states they get one ihe compromise further proposes to suppress the slave traffic by speculators tn the district of columbiaa think oibut litte consequence lo us and vhich has been done by nearly if not the southern sates within their own limitsand provide more effectually for the recapturs of fugitive slaves or for the compensation of theie owners here we have an insignificant concession and receive in return the garranty of the government fur the suppression of escapes and kidnapping by which our people in the border status lose hundreds of slaves annually

their masters scarcely dream quite commensurate with such hazardous undertakings f da meeting of the slaveholders of queen annes county was held at centreville a few days since for the purpose of organizing a society to protect slave property on account of the numerous depredations that have been made by the abolitionists recently in that vicinity officers were elected and a constitution

by the slaveholder will not wonder when they learn that this exclusion was carried by a vote of ght to fifiyone it is such legislation as tms carried on year after year with no piospect of improvement which eiifies the assertion of john quincy adans that the preseiva tion propagation and perpetuation of slavery has been made the vital and animating spirit of the national government what can be less magnanimous and more mean on the part of a great and growing nation than for its lawmakers to go out of ihe way in legislating for the country to inflict a wound upon tho most despised and helpless of

on the subject ol slavery and especially in respect to the doctrine of the higher power than the constitution recently announed by hon vv h seward the path finder is of course on the liberal side and vindicates the truth with much skill in the course of this discussion the day book puts forth the following vile nonsense the idea that we are created free and equal is the sheerest humbug in the world it has not the first feature of truth in its foundation and is only used by fools and demagogues who think it great because it isin the declaration of independence weare born neither free nor equal and never can be either one or the other we ourselves are not free for we have to give our time to the courts as jurors and our money to the tax gatheis for laws and protection yet were all men like us we would want no laws and consequently would have no tax gatherers we submit to these because we must and not because we want them talk about equality look yousee that porter harnessed like an

of gratitude for patronge received not unmingled with hope for a similar favor in future the north stat fair association present a report of their first efforts in endeavoring to assist in sustaining the north star in this as in every good cause they met with obstacles as they anticipated yet knowing their cause to be worthy their efforts they were encouraged to petsevere they did so buoyant with hope for the success of their undertaking but alas when all seemed fair and prosperous and when about entering upon the most important part of their duty they were doomed to undergo a severe trial sickness and death entered their midst anti like a thief in the night snatched from them one of the most useful of their members thereby casting over them a gloom which must ever be remembered with heartfelt sorrow yes notwithstanding the difficulties they had to contend with the shortness of time for preparation and the melancholy events which took place during the fair all of which had a tendency to dampen the ardor of those interested the result maybe deemed truly successful with this hasty glance at the proceedings of the past the association give the following report donations in cash proceeds of fair expenses of fair aid to editor of north star  ggßhance on hand the asst tciaiion feel encouraged by the result o thefr feeble efforts and believe if so much cant be clone in

valuable donations to mr p h reason m g t downing professor reason and others for many offices of kindness to the gentlemen of the amateur band viz messrs w r jackson and s wadlron who caused great

last evening from batavia to this city i feli in company with a young bostonian who spent the last winter in new orleans in conversation on the subject of slavery be told me of an apparatus for whipping slaves which he was informed is used in that city which exceeds any and all oiher inventions of the diabolical system of which i ever heaid it consists of a kind of paddle full of holes which is worked in some way by steam when a master wants his slave punished he gives him half a dollar and sends him to this steam whipping machine where they apply the blows for one cent apiece if this story had been told by an abolitionist it would have been received by the community as an exaggerated statement of a reckless fanatic as it is coming from one who said that he thought the abolitionists were not sufficiently charitable towards the slaveholders who have been educated in the beliei that slavery is right and that many of the slaves appeared to be entirely happy and he believed were better off than they would be if free ti e statement is a valuable addition to the mass of testimony already before the public of the inherent cruelties which are and necessarily must be part and parcel of this peculiar hellish institution the dirty deed of meanness mr editor ln your paper of the bth you were pleased to say as follows witha golden brite in his hand a new york city black man hired some and caused others to vote the whig ticket and he was aided by some of the most influential of the same class in the empire city and what is still worse they found the most part of our people sinable and coaxable enough to do the dirty deed o meanness the above cannot be regarded other thana charge against some one city black man in particular as you call him and against the most part of the city black men in general as you are pleased to term them and a grievous charge too a charge not founded in fact but one calculated to effect me as a city black mananl which i notice because the base slanderthe false libel has been insinuated at and other places that the undersigned received a golden bribe from the whigs at the last election and that i hired colored men to vote the whig ticket this designed fabrication is perfectly and entirely false as for the city black men in general as it suits your taste to call themas for the being bribed hired or coaxed into any actionras to their proceeding against their inclinations determination or what they considered the best interests of the whole they are as free from any such charge as are the black men of syracuse geneva or any city of the state yes either of being coaxed bribed or intimidated by friend or foe no sir the black men of new york as you emphatically call them would support a collegecentral collegewould support it would aid and support what they conceived worthy of their aid and support though a friend might declare that he would hold them in execration for so doing to the last days of his life do not understand ine as affirming that there are no exceptions to this fact for we ha ve colored men too whose sentiments are paid for as to any expediency evinced by the colored voters of new york at the last election i think it justifiable if voting at all under all the circumstances were justifiable but it is not my purpose nor shall i discuss this point in fact i should not have alluded to it at all but for the vilifying insinuation connected therewith the black men of new york as you studiously call them believed and do believe that the best interest of the whole of the oppressed cobored men of the landthe enslaved together with the partially free was torwarded by the course they then pursued friend downing hates the term black dont he the above was the extent of my intended article but sine it was written i have been informed of a dirty deed of meanness on your part you will excuse my frankness far outstripping in subserviency and contemptibility anything that any black man iof new york has ever been found guilty of ji allude to your selfdegradation in consenting j to address an audience in achcrch owned by colored pers onsa church worshipped in by our people i will not say a colored church fo r i repudiate the title and the principleit is the property of our enemies it is appropriate to the churches where the lower saloon is appropriated exclusively to our white fellow ciizenswhere the ntgro pew is to be found in the gallery under the crreumstances that you did speak for you to speak where a special bonda positive understanding was had beforehand proscribing yousr peoplein your being a party with a white committee to an arrangement whereby colored men or black men as you would call themmen with whom you are identified by the unrighteous american system of caste men peeled stripped abused and despisedmen with whom you must rise or fallmen positively refused the occupancy of seats belonging to themselvss seats which they had been in the habit of occupying almost daily for years that while fellow citizens might mark ye exclusively enjoy them yes according to previous arrangement and understanding had and published through the streets of philadelphia this deed speaks for itself it is even worse than the charge impuied to a new york city black manof hiring black mento vote the whig ticket with this disgrace added to it of his taking his coaxed and hired crew to the garret to deposit their ballots whilst other voters weie inducted to the convenient parlor it is even more truckling grovelling and everyway disgraceful than was the recommendation given charles l reason some time ago when preparing for the ministry by a vestry of his people advising him to accept of a proposition submitted to him by bishop b t ondeidonk and which had been previously submitted to the late j g d grass and to alex crummell and by them indignantly rejected viz to sei on a side bench in the school ot the pro pliets and listen to ihe recitations of its pupils but not to regard himself as being ol the classes and thus he benefited thus he prepared to labor in lire vinyard of the lord verily lie would learn a lesson in humanity in selfabasement it is even more sycophantic than was the letter subsequently written and privately sent to the rev lat tier in the gospel by the same corporationto this eminent negrohater after he had been convicted of gross immoralities wherein they say to him who had despised them be assured that our confidence in you remains unshakenthat our love respect and veneration is unaltered and that we will gladly rejoice when we shall again listen to your godly admonition and advice i cite these in my opinion the par excellent dirty derds of meanness recorded against colored men of the city of new york to contrast with this ot ours and to bhow how much more despicable is the latter yours geo t downing new york may three points are raised by the latter part of friend downings communication did s r ward sanction the arrangement alluded o and advertised in the hand biii mr goines who is capable of telling ihe truth when he pleases knows we did not and the other gentlemen including mr downing might have kßwjj it had they chosen to know it did s r ward n his lecture rebuke lle prejudice which mr douglass label says and mr downing as falsely repeals he sanctioned the audience axe witness and ihese gentlemen might have known and stated had they chosen totliatwe occupied the major pait of the evening in lecturing with such humble power as we possess against neoro hate waving the constitutional argument for that purpose as suggested by circumstances did s r ward do right in addressing a meeting under such a call that i a matter about which honest men might differ our practice has inyatiably been to speak in rebuking prejudice and in giving utterance to oat sentiments in any meeting under ant call whatever thats the wav we come t address the meetings in the tabernacle the th of may last so ve addressed tin buffalo convention of b against the express wish of mr cochrane the great frei soiler of new york so we have addressee many meetings whose sentiments were awide as are the poles apart from our own all we ask is a fair chance to utter our sentiments and whether the meeting be composed of friends or foes whether the call please or displease ns we have attended and spoken and we shall attend and speak at as man meetings as we can god helping us thai douglass downing goines c c should express lhese opinions on the matter is undoubtedly their right but that they should state what is not true or withhold so much of tiuth as to make as was evidently their design a false impression is simply to bear false witness against a neighbor bui what of that to them h collins we have received letters from philadelphia about this matter in which our friends kindly inform us of the actions of several gentlemen in respect to it we do not differ from them at all in respect to the very apparent motive of mr douglass we do not at all blame them for doubting that it was his sole purpose to bear his humble testimony against wrongbut of course mr downing was noton the ground as mr douglass was to see and know how far fromhow opposite to truth and fairness his sentiment is thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor lmpartial citizen the u s mail steamer isabel capt rollins arrived from havana this morning with her accustomed punctuality she left havana at p m on the bth key west at a m on the oth and reached her wharf at this morning making hours from port to port including the stoppages at key west and savannah she brings passengers by the isabel we have our files of papers and correspondence to the bth inst extracts of which will be found annexed the papers ate mainly occupied with details connected with the late invasion of the islanda large number of crosses and other honorary distinctions have been conferred on those who were prominent in repelling the invaders at cardenas while liberal coniribu tions have been made for the support of the families of the killed and wounded on that oc casion much excitement still prevails throughout the island and the feelings of the old spaniards and the government officials run very strong against the americans and the american government the officers crew and passengers of the american vessel still remain in close confinement efforts heve been made by torture to extort confessions from the captains of the georgiana and susan loud but in vain they declared repeatedly that they regularly cleared from new orleans for t hagres as was confirmed by their papers that they had no knowledge of the character or objects of their passengers until the creole came along side when a number of them went onboard of that vessel and they were preceding on their course to chagres when they were captured by the spanish steamer the american consul was peremptorily refused all access to or communication with the prisoners to give a coht however to the proceedings of the court thepresence of the british consul was invited a strong disposition was manifested to dispose of the two american captains by a summary execution but against this course the british consul remonsiraed and warned them that this course would involve them in serious difficulties with the american government in cons quence of these remonstrances the decision ot the court upon their case was postponed the captains were then suspended in the air by cords attached to their thumbs but despite the torture they persisted in their statements among the prisoners was a young lawyer from one of ihe western states whose symptoms of trepidation gave expectation that by working on hs fears confessions might be obtained that would tend to criminate his companions a halter was accordingly placed around his neck and cannonballs attached to his feet and with the threat of immediate death hanging over him under promise of pardon for himself and for some of his companions whom he named he made certain disclosures upon which the authorities based their further proceedings the chief engineer of the matanzas and savanilla railroad died suddenly at havana and it was supposed by poison but there is no doubt that his deaffi was occasioned by over excitement and perplexity consequent upon the invasion of cardenas we have been infoimed by highly intelligent gentlemen that the excitement and terror at matanzas havana arid throughout the island upon the spread of the intelligence of the landing at cardenas was extreme and in many instances the authorities seemed perfectly paralyzed it is their opinion that if a thousand brave men well appointed and well officered had pushed on promptly from cardenas they could have placed themselveiu the center of the city of havana without serious resistance the tribune says of professor stuarts pamphlet in this uncomfortable position professor stuart has felt himself bound to take the field in the present pamphlet which is less a de fence of mr websters course than his own no one conversant with the production of the author will be surprised to find in it a singular medley of egotism pedantry garrulity exegesis greek philology argument and puerile anecdotes with the entire absence ol any sense of congruity coherence or good taste the professor however is not lo be regarded as the fiiend of slavery not hehe brings up ten good reasons why it should be deemed an evil the first of which is tell it not in gath after all the exegesis on ilie other side that it is contrary to the first and fundamental piineiples of the bible which declares that all are of one blood the few pages which professor stuart devotes to this subject toward the close of this parnph let after such an elaborate apology for slavery as composes the body of the work remind us of the description given of a certain timeserver in another age that he bui t a church to the almighty on one side of the road anda chapel to the devil on the other it will be seen that mr benton has withdrawn his motion to lay it upon the table and mr turney has moved to strike out this section relating to the boundary between texas and new mexico while this was pending mr webster spoke and we infer from the brief sketch of hs remarks that he will support the bill in theschape it stands oi may stand when it comes to a vote he was followed by mr seward who truly remarked that this whole slieme had been most unfortunate in its operations and tendency h examined the claim of texas to the territory of new mexico and believing it to be totally unfounded was unwilling to vote money t texas lor iand site did not own he willing to vote to pay the debt of texas oi other gtound but not to buy territory t which she nas no title the friends of the bill are said to be alarmed at mr turneys motion should it be carried as it is quite likely to be the bil cannot pass the two votes from texas a vvell as some others would certainly be los if the proposition to pay her a large bribe b striken out the vote upon this motion is therefore important and may prove decism of the fate of the bill as we get scarcely any of the proceedings by telegraph io an intelligable shape we may have to wait some time yet before knowing the result rochester democrat letter from havana englandthe greek question nor can it be doubted that that the russian cabinet it prepared in conformity with its solemn declarations since made public to mark its sense of these transactions when the note of the th of april was written it might still be hoped at st peteis burgh that the mediation of france would prevail we have yet to learn the effect produced on that court by the renewal of coercive measures hut it cannot fail to be ai least as acute as it was in paris mean while the indications already given bv lord palmerston of siinilar deigns against naples and tuscany have put all the powers on their guard against the reoccurrence of such a surprise as the blockade of the piraeus the french fleet has been for some months in the bay of naples prepared toward off an attack in that quarter and with instructions to support the king of the two sicilies the grand duke of tuscany being sirni lary threatened applied for the advice and support of northern powers and though we believe that an arrangement has since been made to refer the leghorn claims to arbitration the cabinets of russia and austria have seized this opportunity to announce that as lord palmerston holds the private claims of british residents in foreign countries to be a subject of the interference of the british fleet and not to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the municipal laws of those countries they demur in principle to any such pretensions and that they shall take measures to restrict the admission of british subjects to reside in their dominions if any such measure be acted upon it can scarcely fail to produce very inconvenient and unpleasant consequences and it would unjustly inflict on the mercantile classes of jtijhisgiei the recoil of a foreign policy in which they have no part but after what has passed we feel more regret than astonishment to learn that such things are possible and we fear that it must be added that the departure of the russian minister from london must be anticipated at no distant period these occurrences happening in rapid succession and accompanied with undisguised aversion on the part of foreign states are not matters of indifference they are on the contrary warnings and precursers of astate of isolation utterly at variance with the inclinations the tradition and the interests of great britain from the first hour of lord palmerstons return to office these results have been steadily foreseen and predicted they were then discernible to an attentive observer of the future they are now visible in the broad davlight of the preset but we confess we are not prepared for the lamentable climax of so daring a career and it may seem hard that after so many greater achivements which have been unavenged the claims of don pacifico should prove the last drop which makes the cup of bitterness overflow is it for such a cause as that we are to becalled upon to confront our former allies and to expose the vast interests on this ethpire to the adverse chances of universal hostility london times from jamaica the tribune has bpen furnished with the following letter from jamaica written by gw alexander a wellknown member of the society of friends who is now and has been for several months past travelling wiih a companion in the west indies as an agent of the british and foreign antislavery society the object of their mission is to observe the results of emancipation in the several islands standard kingston jamaica thur mo my dear friend i write very hastily to inform you that my wife and self with our companions j and m candler intend to leave this place for new york by the steamer on the ibih of next monthor thereabout we have now been five weeks in jamaica during which we have travelled over a large part of the island and are truly glad to find the condition of planters merchants and laboreis better than we expected that of the latter especially isin general one of much comfort this fine island is not at presenthastening to ruin notwithstanding the severe trial in which it has been exposed by the cruel injurious and inconsistent sugar act of it has been delightful to us to see the largenumber of the emancipated peasantry and their children who are brought under a moral and religious influence by the emod men who ate scalteted over jamaica there can i think be little or no doubt that population is increasing nov that the dead weight of slavery is removed and there are many indications of an increase of cultivation which will unless i am much mistaken be very shortly manifeste d by larger exports unless checked by bad legislation or the operation of the decreasing scale of duties at which foreign sugar is to be introduced for consumption in britain it remains however to be seen whether the friends of the slave in england will yet allow the sugar act of to be carried into full effect i much doubt it at least this wili not be done i believe without a very serious struggle in parliament i yesterday went with our party to see a slaver brought into kingston within a day or two with the slaves on boird she was first seen by a british cruiser near the isle of pines on the coast of cuba for which country the slaves were destined and secured after a chase of hours this slaver was a favoiable speci mjn of the mode in which the horrid traffic in human beings is carried on as she had only slaves on board when she left the coast of africa and was of the burden of tuns it had however been intended as we were informed to ship a much larger number of the original cargo had died before the capture and sinceleaving about men woman and children of these from their appearance there can he little doubt hut that some will yet be added to the list of death connected with the diabolical enterprise we saw the slave captain whose countenance indicated as utter an absence of feeling as can well be conceived in a human he ng when shall this abominable traffic cease when your country shall do its duty in the abolition of slavery and that day is not i trust distant slavery and the slave trade will soon be doomed in brazil and cuba j candler and i

constitution of slaveholding states as set forth in the foregoing resolutions and should they further refuse to adjust the controversy growing out of the slavery question on terms satisfactory to the slaveholding states they should through their respective legislatures concert and adopt measures for the organization of a general convention to be constituted of delegates from such states and to be invested with full power and authority to prescribe the mode and manner of redress provided that said contemplated convention should be convened only m the event that if said slaveholding states should concur in calling for the same judge tucker of va submitted the following which was read and re ferred inasmuch as no pledgeon the parti of congress that that body will not assume power it granted by the constitution can add to the existing constitutional obligation and inasmuch as alight plodge not to exercise powers granted by the constitution will bind nobody it follows that no satisfactory security can be given by congress to the injured and insulted south against the continuance repetition and aggra tion of wrongs and insults by northern fanatics and factious aspirants and

denied the right of voting under the said constitution and whereas we have obtained alarge list of petitioners to the above convention praying that the constitution may be so altered as to extend to all of its citizens without regard to color the elective franchise ist resolved that we the disfranchised citizens here assembled who believe that taxation and representation should always go together
