the english welcome to the austrian butcher we are anything but blind worshippers of england or indiscriminate admirers of the english character but every now and then a circumstance occurs which testifies most eloquently to the largeness and generosity of the english heart which vividly arouses our national pride and makes us exclaim there is no country like england there is no people like the english we can recollect nomort remarkable occurrence of this welcome nature than the reception which marshal haynau met with last wednesday from the workmen at barclays brewery that interesting personage at present on his travels condescended to tnvor england with his presence once in london he seemed to have set about his duties as sightseer in good earnest and like most curious strangers illustrious or otherwise paid an early visit to messrs barclays brewery to make acquaintance with the wonders of that enormous establishment he was requested to enter his name in the visiters book end possibly as he complied with the request he speculated on the awe and admiration with which so formidable and notorious a name would inspire the clerks and workmen around and a most sudden and marvellous effect it certainly did produce th ugh not exactly the effect expected or desired like almost all englishmen the workmeu of messrs barclay had heard of the struggle the woes and the wrongs of hungary of the murder of bathyany the massacre at arad the whipping of women the hanging of clergymen and all the fearful variety of sufferings which the hungarians had undergone like the immense majority of englishmen they had thought much of these things and taken them deeply to hearthad felt an intense interest in the sublime strug le and no common grief at its mourn ul result they had glowed with love and pity for the noble sufferers and had burned with intense hate against the savage oppressors and suddenlyahe great criminal the chief oppressor was before them they beheld in the midst of them the womandogger themurderer of bathy nay the shedder of the noble blood poured forth at arad the austrian butcher and the oppressor of hungary the clerks left their desks the draymen quitted their drays the workmen gathered around how could they testify their indignation how express their abhorrence they hissed they hooted they execrated they cast mud over that illustrious form they brandished brooms over that reverenced bead they battered those illustrious sides with besoms their rude hande profanely pulled those formidable whiskers and dragged the marshal along the ground by the flowing moustache in which he glories they tore the clothes from off his honored back they drove him forth from the brewery and pursued him along bank side o piteous spectacle the illustrious fieldmarshal tbs commander of mighty hosts the prop of the austrian empire the wearer of countleaa stars and orders fled along the dirtiest streets of london before e furious crowd of draymen and coal heavers truly the flogged hungarian ladies were most appropriately avenged at last he took refuge in a publichouse into which the crowd followed him and no one can aay what would have been bis ultimate fate had not the police come to the rescue dispersed the crowd with some difficulty and snt the unfortunate haynau up the river in a police galley we are no admirers of furious mobs we ere no apologists for the attacks of multitudes upon individuals especially upon strangers whether illustrious or otherwise but there is something nobly singular in this onslaught which nines it above ell common cases of assault and battery and exalts it into a positive act of virtue a generous vindication of national honor a bnve assertion of humanity this is no vulgar outrage there was no gotup mob n hungarian prompter no organised attack it was exclusively english entirely spontaneous and wholly gener ousa fierce expression of virtuou indignationa brave trampling on tru umpkani guilta grand chastisement pf victorious oppressiona rude and the north stair fiedekick mdlass miter ail froprleter vol no outrageous net if you willbut an act infinitely more respectable and teo fold more virtuous than any airoable acquiescence in the presence of evil any mean cringing to prosperous wickedness we hope that there are few assemblies of englishmen aye of refined and educated englishmen that would not find some means of expressing their loathing and abhorrence should the austrian butcher appear among them it was justice too rude wild justice if you willbut mill strict justice the gallant woman ftogger was most appropriately chastised there was so much degradation in the doom bo much contemptuous bitterness in the punishment the bespattering mud the busy besoms the rent garments and the profound moustache will not be very proud or agreeable recollections for the woman wbipper the london drayman have most exactly avenged the hungarian ladies the illustrious foreigner was hunted aa the meanest criminal the wouldbe star was trampled upon like the most noxious reptile remarks the foiegoing is from the birmingham mercury and is a pretty full endorsement of the oonduct of the draymen and others who took part in the assault upon the austrian butcher for our part we shudder at the thought of giving the slightest encouragement to mob violence in any circumstances whatever it is a dangerous and barbarous mode of dealing with a supposed wrong doer besides we never divest s scene like the one described of lust meanest of hnrnan wickedness cowardice three or four hundred men assaulting one man no matter how much he may deserve the chastisement is never grateful to our eyes we have two often suffered such rude violence ourselves to have sympathy with its manifestations in any form whatsoever there is no question as to the hateful character of haynau his deeds of blood and shame are known to the whole world and humanity should find some appropriate mode of expressing its sense of abhorrence of such moral monsters but away with all mobs for this purpose there are other and better modes of punishment let uch an enemy of the human rsoe such a coldblooded hyena as is this haynau be shunned and detested let him read in every human face upon which he gazes the deep aversion with which he is tegarded but let no violent hand be laid upon him less the murderer should for one moment fancy himself a martyr we observe that the americans are delighted with the london reception of this whippet of hungarian women we bid them beware lest they plait a scourge frt the backs of some of their own distinguished countrymen haynau is not the only wo msnflogger in the world nor is austria the only country where such monsters reside there are american as well as austrian monsters of this continent they hunt men with bloodhounds tear their flesh with the claws of living eats burn their flesh with but irons cut off the ears of living women and i otherwise torment maltreat and abuse them these are american slaveholdersdemocrat icand christian slaveholders now there is not one word said above in justification of the assault and ignominy heaped upon this austrian

is a philosophy in amusement as well as in education indeed we have no hesitation in averring that amusement is a most important part of education of course there are many kinds oj amusement varying according to the degree of moral and intellectual cnl k in i hem there are the low amusements of the groes and uneducated whom society has allowed to grow up in in its midst with minds untrimed and uulaught with tastes unrefined by intercourse with art or letters who are narrowed in all their sources of pleasure and enjoyment to these the butal exhibition of a dogfight is a saturnalia of enjoyment an enjoyment which is level with the meanest capacity and no otherhow different the amusement of the intelligent and refinedsuch an intercourse with the beauties of nature a ramble through a beautiful country full of historic associations a concert of exquisite music a picture exhibition a soiree an agreeable book oran evenings delightful conversation with intelligent persons then there are out ofdoors amusements the manly games of which the healthful game of cricket is one of the most cheerful and exciting the occupations of a very large portion of our town population are sedentary and unwholesome and require for healths sake a frequent relaxation in game of this latter sort which brings a mans muscles into action and healthfully excites all it he organic functions of the system what is better calculated to blow away the vapors from the brain and to give a thorough freshairing to the blood than the breeze blowing across the heath while the cricket is actively engaged in batting balling fielding and the other exercise of the game every muscle is put into action he mist run and play his limbs actively the use ol which while sitting at his city desk he had well nigh forgotten he must be all alivehe makes the green carpet of turf fly from under him while the welcome breeze plays around his head he is cheerful and full of good humor care and anxiety are banished and lumbago headache or gout is driven further from him in every run that he takes he goes to bedwell tired and then enjoys the profound and refreshing slumber which he has earned on the cricket ground rising in the morning clear beaded and renovated in health and strength it is a mistake to suppose that the man who plays at cricket or who otherwise amuses himself in active exercise during the intervals of business is wasting his time amusement is not waste of time but rather economy of life relax frequently if you would en joy good health during a long period of existence if you relax not and take no amusementthat is if your calling should not itself be constant exercisethen you will mentally suffer in the pangs of indigestion in weak and unhealthy lungs in cold and rhumatisins and in all the penalties which attend confinement and sedentary occupation man has a strong natural appetite for relaxation and amusement and like all other natural appetites it has been implanted in us for a wise purpose itis not to be repressed but will breakout in one form or other if we provide not the opportunity for enjoying whole me amusements men will certainly find out vicious ones for themselves there are we believe some people in the world who under mistaken notions would if they had the pow r hang the heavens about with crape pick the bright stars from tee sky veil the sun with clouds because of his shining too merrily on the gay earth pluck the silver moon from her place in the firmament no more to brighten the young wooers who laughed and loved under her beams throw a

chferlessness bnt there is no reason or morality in this and still less religion a benevolent creator has endowed man with an eminent capacity for enjoyment set him in a fair and lovely world surrouoded him with things good and beautiful and given him the dispositon to love to sympathize to produce to cooperate to enjoy and thus to become an honorable and happy being bringing gods work to perfection and suiting the divine creation in the midst of which he lives who knows not that the heart of man is greatly influenced by the moral atmosphere which he breathes and that he is disposed to an affinity with the good very much io proportion as his spirits are kept in that genial tone which their relaxation promotes make a man happy and his actions will be happy too but doom him to dismal

passage in the stage that runs between rochester and oswego and has thus been delayed three or four days beyond the time she had allotted fur her visit this meanness and cruelty of the stage company ate additionally aggravated by the fact that mis williams name had been regularly entered on the companys book and her fare duly paid but in each instance the driver when he called and found that hts intended passenger was a colored woman took it upon himself to refuse her a seat and while in the act of driving his hoises away from the door he threw her money conlemptously on the giound we hope

and that many other arrests and recaptures will speadily lake place we ae equally certain we are as a people almost hopelessly unprotected we are all at the mercy of a band of bloodhound commissioners

american press mr kane has thrown light upon a transaction of which very little was before known although that transaction involved the commission of outrages the most cruel and monstrous against humanity and strikingly illustrates the feebleness of the american government in protecting human rights and the hollowness of that boast of civil and religious liberty which is so constantly and pertinaciously insisted upon as peculiar to the united states the author of this address is entitled to great praise for the fidelity and boldness with which he has brought the case of the mormons before the american people and unless the american press is entirely fettered by the prejudice of the people against that persecuted and hated community he will surely have that praise awarded him unfortunately however for him his fine powers are devoted to a sect evetywhere spoken against and it is possible that this splendid effort of his will share to some extent the fate of the people whose sorrows and sufferings he li so vividly and powerfully por trayed the mormons or latter day saints as they are called were the industrious builders and happy inhabitants of nauvoo a beautiful city on the upper miteistippi they ate akl to have numbered twenty thousand eoule and to have been remarkable for their activity skill sobriety frugality and for the ardor of their religious seal their prosperity which was great fxcited the envy and malice of their neighbors who not possessing the virtue to copy the good example set them meanly resolved upon the destruction of that example itself and to the shame of the american government be it told a war was permitted to be waged against this religious community which resulted in their final expulsion from their city and their exile into a faroff country beyond the rocky mountains the pamphlet before us presents a graphic picture of nauvoo as it appeared immediately after its desertion by its once happy and thriving people no one devoid of prejudice can read this portraiture of desolation without emotions of sympathy for the exiled mormons and the deepest detestation of the guilty perpetrators of this moat wanton and unprovoked cruelty mr kane thus describee the appalling scene of the depopulated city the spinning wheel was idle the carpenter had gone from his workbench and shavings his unfinished sash and casing fresh bark was in the tanners vat and the freefa chopped lightwood stood piled against the bakers oven the blacksmiths shop was cold but his coal heap and ladling pool and crooked water horn wero all there if

with my stick the tall heavyheaded ahtico aim sumiowers hunted over the beds for cucumbers and loveapples no one called out to me from any open window or dog sprang forward to bark an alarm i could have supposed the people hidden in their houses but the doora were unfastened i found dead ashes white on the hearths as walking down the aisle of a country church to avoid rousing irreverent echoes from the naked floors un the outskirts of the town was the city graveyard but there was no record of plague there nor did it in auy wise differ from any other american protestant cemeteries some of the mounds were not long sodded some of the stones were newly set their dates recent and their black inscriptions glossy in the masons hardly dried lettering ink beyond the graveyard out in the fields i saw in one spot hard by where the fruitsd boughs of a young orchard had been rudely torn downthe still smouldering embers of a barbecue that had been constructed of rails of the fencing around it it was the latest sign of life there fields upon fields of heavyheaded yellow gram lay rotting ungathered upon the ground no one was at hand to take in their rich harvest baring the authors long sentences and bad grammar he will we trust pardon us the above may be considered an excellent specimen of his poetic tuin of mind and hia fine powers of observation wo can easily fancy his feelings as he threaded his lonesome way through the doomed city they who would understand and appreciate the chaiacter of the mysterious people under considetation and would learn a lesson of perseverance and patience under discouragements the most disheaileuing trials and hardships the most appalling sufferings the most intense and grievous cannot do better than read this brief sketch by mr kane of the expulsion and the final exile of the mormon people from their peaceful habitation on the banks of the upper mississippi to their present location beyond the rocky mountains upon the shores of salt laker n the blackphobia in rochester though the inhabitant of this city have been mercifully preserved almost wholly from the frightful ravages of cholera to which jthers have been exposed in our land they cannot claim exemption from our peculiarly national epidemic viz madness at color while it cannot be faithfully said that this malady exists here to such an extent as in many other placesstill here it is and it is fraught with he same m schief here as elsewhere the manifestations of this disease are different in different persons but they are all striking and unmistakable one is never at a loss to determine what the disease is when the proper tests are applied at least such has been the experience of our whole practice we propose in the present brief investigation to give our readers the true method by which they may asceitain to an absolute certainty as to the presence of vhe blackphobia either in communities or in individuals it is necessary to establish some general rule by which quick and certain conclusions may be arrived at in any and every given case butin order to do this it is essential that we point out the ineufficiency of some of the methods by which the absence of the disease is often attempted to be established first then the fact that a white man or woman is willing to be waited upon at the dining table by a person of sable hue does not necessarily prove that the white man or white woman is fee from the loathsome disease denominated above as blackphobia by some inexplicable relation subsisting between the two the horrid virus seems soothed rather than excited by the presence of black persons in the act of serving white persons with food so fat from objecting to being served by colored servants our white fellowcitizens admit them to be among the most and attentive waiters in the world in proof of this we need only to point to the fact that this class of persons may be found in the vocations of servants and waiters on board of the moat popular steamers and in the moat fashionable hotels of the united states this therefore is no test of the presence of the vile plague secoodlythe fact that a white man or woman may be willing to be driven in a carriage by a colored driver and to have that driver bold an umbrella over hia or her head in a rainstorm is no evidence whatever that such a person is free from the blackphobia fur these gentle aer vices when tendered indue menial obsequiousness act as opiate and lull the black madness into aeren repose so that the disease is scarcely to be perceived by the most experienced practitioner thirdly nor must we be deceived into the belief that a man is free from this grievous distemper simply because he will quietly tin the chair of a colored barber and give to ihat baibet the entire freedom of bis face lor the fact is and this ends our legations that our mageanimous white fellowcitizens are always perfectly wiumg to have either heir pride their indolence or their ioter ests subserved hy men bo matter how buck they be hue might be proved by a boat of evidence end illustrated by uj amount of lieii the tree test of freedom from blaek pbobia is to be found in to entire willingness to associate on terms of equality with all men irrespective of their complexion he who varies from this view be it but io the estimation of single bair has the seeds of the diaeaae within him and will only require a negrohating atmosphere about him to make him a ease at oncer o incivility to colored persons in the street this is a spades of low brooding of which we have bad very little to complain since our residence in rochester t our white fellow citixena for the most put whatever may be their private feelings on the subject of equality or negro inferiority are generally sufficiently mindful of the characteristics of gentlemen and ladies to treat us with perfect civility when they meet us in the street but thete are other by no mean the beet looking put of our white community who have adopted the custom of making their mouths about as ugly as their hearts the moment they see us these parties are usually of the gentler sex possessing a delectable tallow candle complexion and we may also add they are generally ot lean and tallnw omd dimensions now to be laughed at or to have months made at us by ladies who can display a good set of teeth when they venture to grin or have some other mode of indicating their emotion may be patiently borne with but to be laughed at sneered at and sneezed it by creatures so devoid of all personal charms as ere some of the lanky erasures who indulge in this sport with us is almost intolerable ard it would be quite so were it not for the relief that any expression affords to their cadaverous facesr o hutchinson family this delightful band

miss breaker she passed through rochester en rout to niagara falls and although travelling rapidly she did not leave the homesof our friend frederick douglass unvisited the acquaintance i long since formed with the writings of swedens gifted authoress and the gratification and amusement derived therefrom had imbsed me with a strong desire to look upon herbut as she was ever associated in my mind with norwegian and swedish visions i little thought that my first introduction to frederika bremer would take place in this faroff western world and under the roof of frederick douglass once a slave under this glorious republic this is however but another illustration of the adage that truth is often stranger than fiction my interest in sweden its scenery and its domestic life was created by reading the neighbors and increased by all the works that followed from the same pen the graphic sketch there given by fransiska othe sweet home in the beautiful valley o roaenik with its green woods its crystal lake and its grey mountains seemed calculated to allure the lover of nature thither while as a matter of course ones imagination would picture the tall and commanding figure of ma chert nere advancing at the end of the long journey to receive the weary traveller with the due rites of swedish hospitality and to press on him the bounties of swedish housewifery was once conversing with an impulsive friend of mine about norway and sweden together we were lamenting that those northern regions are so lutle travelled in by our adventurous cuuntrymeif that the world of wonders therein contained has shed its lofty beauty but on the few and that while the footfall of the english traveller is beard amid the highest passes of the alps and the appenines its sound rarely bieak the stillnestf of the stupendous dovre range our enthusiasm kindled as we discoursed and we half resolved to beat up recruits for a scandinavian excursion when suddeny my friend was seized with a shivering fit and our airy castle fellas be exclaimed bnt its so cold there i am inclihed to think that many a roamer has been stayed from experimenting upon sweden by similar icy anticipations he has perhaps become so enveloped in the diery mantle of a swedish winter that he has failed to discover tbe exquisitely lovely spring reluming thither in youth and joyousness shedding beauty and warmth song and fragrance upon all around and then who can picture all the loveliness of a swedish summer my northern visions have it is true been broken by many grand realities i have felt the roll of the

expected her engaging frankness and cordiality of manner won me at once while her superior powers of conversation enchained me and caused hours to pass in her company but aa minutes i discovered at once that she is a woman of rare intellect and possesses that something still than beauty dearer she conversed long aad earnestly with our friend frederick dougaas upon the alavery subject and although she speaks good english yet ever and anon as she paused to find tbe right word felt that our party was incomplete without you dear mrs howitt to be tbe interpreter sod to explainjthe various idioms that presented themselves lam convinced that mies bremer is sincerely desirous of being impartial in her investigations and i doubt not but that if sb write a book upon thia country it trill be remarkable for candor generosity it ia not however to be coaonied that abe ia liaue to many falae bteeoe aa well aa other travellers in the united states the beat foot foremost a proverb not entirely monopolised by transatlantic nations i aomeiirres think that americana are eveo more anxious than others to impress visitors from abroad favorably with their institutions and ms the traveller in question is one of extraordinary distinction itis easy to see that her food opinion whi be eagerly sought after and that more than ordinary efforts will be made to throw out of her view tbe enormous cruelties of slavery and thn bitter prejudices cherished by the american people against the victims of their oppression i was happy to find that miss bremer was accompanied to the falla by the young and interesting american poet james russell lowell of whose genius you are already aware he is one of the few in america who has nobly sacrificed a large share ol popular favor by his uncompromising hostility to slavery anf he ia therefore well suited lathe office of travelling companion to mist brpmer for he may be able to explain away many of the sophisttea with which americans often attempt to cover tbeir flagrant inconsistencies mr lowsll reminded roe in appearance a good deal of our friend mr george dawson but the poet looks all sunshine and is quite devoid of that expressior of deep melancholy that in the opinion o some imparts so great an interest to the fee tares of our talented english friend tht visit of miss bremer and her companion afforded us much pleasure ani will long h

savageness from a lar and tears from the least sensitive of human eyes the soul is oppressed in her angelic presence sensualism leaves the heart at once if it had intiuded there before and while the

unfairly in drawing up the recognizance winch called forth a s barj resentment an explanation followed and the in vi at gallon was about to proceed when mr hall generously interposed with an expression of his readiness to have the detired changes however unusualanal it was un usualbut then chaplin had stolen that peculiar species ot ptopeny whose owners always insist on corresponding erra guards and guarantees the desired phrase was then added the bond was ao cepted and the prisoner who had remained a silent and wonderfully composed spectator was delivered into the custody of capt goddard and nflicei handy the latter of whom held the requisition of gov thomas so soon aa judge cranehs return and the necessary conveyances could be gotten ready the calracade proceeded to this place the counsel and friends of mr chaplin preceded ed the custodians of the law with the prisoner by at least two hours they evidently tot k theit tiijie the teason of which will probably appear hereafter when arrived at this place found the resident counsel of mrcbaplin mr brewer and mr child dr jackson and others in a state r sad discouragement and soon leirned that the magistrate who had agreeed to lake bail on the charge of assault anti battery with intent to kill had been overawed by the popular feeling which had risen high during the unfortunate delay in washington and ttad not only retreated from his agreement as to inception and amount f  but even refused to designate any high ei sum or to confer on the subect at all but beside the bailor with whom the arrangement had been made and to whom acheck foi the money had been given recanted upon the warning of his father that his business as a merchant would be ruined thus stood the case when arrived here a good deal of delay taking place after the arrival of the prisoner i inquired the cause but could learn nothing except surmises the delay was explained finally it being now dark by the arrival of hon richard j bowie present representative in congress from this district who voluntarily left his post and the business of the nation to look after the interests of slavery according to hit own statement be was an ex proatcsjting attorney and entered into this case without authority he was joined by wut h tuck esq ol prince georges county who it is understood is to be his sueoessot in business mr tuck also stated in open court that he had voluntered at the request ot several respectable eitkens the hearing now was proceeded with before three justices of the peace messr adamson spests and braddock who hold

interruption by long am loud applause from the proslavery crowd and here i will take occasion to say that ir thia aod another instance mr bowie die himself great credit by rebuking the roobo cratic spirit thus manifested as well as hii whole bearing in the case but to proceed the counsel lor mr chaplin who sat calm and resigned as become him though rudely gaxed upon as a criminal severally cited points of law and replied lo the opposition to show that the case here should be separated entirely from the charge of abduction in washington that the officers who arrested mr chaplin had no official authority by theii own statements to do so even in the district of columbia much less in this state aiid that the assault if proved would not b of that aggravated character which attaches to resistance of officers of the law in the discharge of their duty as contended on the other aide and that the offence charged here was only a misdemeanor and not a felony at common lawwas bailable therefore by the justices of the peace mr chaplms counsel seted with firmness and decision hut ihe had neglected to fortify themselves sufficiently with authoritiesprobably because not foreseeing the difficulties that would be thrown in the way indeed there seemed ube a lack of books all roundthe principal authority appealed to being bjackatone or the iin potted common law of england as quoted in latrobea practice a work intended specially for the guidance of justices of the peace becoming considerably puzzled by the position of the prisoners counsel mr bowie asked s postponement until this morning st oclock finally notwithstanding the embarrassing circumstances sunoundiug mr chaplin and his counsel as well as his outside fttends the court so ordered mr chaplin was then conveyed to the jail in spite of an application to the comraty and therein and a miserable apology for a priso iit is passed what must have been an anxious night indeed however it was perhaps the safest for him after all no thanks to the feeling which forced him to accept it the testimony of the witnesses and the arguments of couusel had prolonged the session until about oclock last night a crowd followed to the prison door but were excluded by the creaking door i say creaking because there was but one prisoner in it who is in for five hundred dollars fine and three years for the crime as is charged of seeking help for fugitive slaves he isa german and waa drunk at the time a conversation thus constructed was held with some informant the excitement of the court scene had exhausted the steam of the outsiders in same degree and when retired at i left the villagers save here and there a siraggler sleeping quietly this fnorning before the appointed hour for the assembling of the court oclock the counsel for mr chaplion conferred together and came to the conclusion that the chances were altogether against success they could not get the amount of bjtl predetermined and the chances were that if the outside pressuie would allow of success the amount would not only be fixed too high for those friendly marylanders on hand but thai their sufficiency also would be questioned and thus only additional excitement be pro ducedhence they withdrew their application for hail for the present mr chapfin of course now stood full committed on the assault and battery charge his counsel and friends saw him safe ia prison made arrangements with the sheriff mr thompson and the jailor who seemed kindly disposed for his bodily comfort and his intellectual wains and took their departure for

to be his duty lo comply with the call made upon him to attend in the present case mr tuck stated that he was not a volunteer but had been engaged by citizens of montgomery to appear for the prosecution he declared at some length upon the enormity of ihe offence attempted by the accused n the midst of his speech he was vehemently applauded mr bowie rebuked this applause mr tack expressed his regret for it the magistrates commanded silence and ordered the arrest of any person offending in thiswise the applause was however subsequent tepeated we mention this as showing the excited feelings of the people there was some argument between the counsel relative to the power of magistrates to accept bail lor the prisoners appearance it being contended by ihe prosecution that a court of record alone was competent the case was finally adjourned till yesterday morning when upon the reassembling of the court the counsel for the prisoner announced their determina ion to waive further resistance for the present and the accused was accordingly committed to prison to await his tnl upon the charge of a murderous as sault it may perhaps be well to explain that the charge is based upon the defence or assault made by himself or the two slaves of mesra toombs nd stephens whom he was aiding to escape from slavery some weeks since when the officers of police and others who had followed him from this city beyond the mery land line were about to arrest him and ids party national era itp french journalist says of the sable prints door mudame martinez that she isa complete lypo of the

her native originality w slavery tbe strangest speeches that have been made in congress on tbe southern side ol the terntorisi question have been made bp those who claim that tbe rights of slavery or slaveholding are inherent is the constitution and a part of the fundamental law and strange to say that this principle baa been conceded in several instance by northern statesmen this is a correct opimoh or it ia incorrect and a question that may yet have to be decided by the supreme court of thf united states so far it decisions hare not reached this point although on incidental questions that have been decided tbe opinions of tbe court appear to be of an opposite tendency if it l trne that under the operation ol the united states constitution in the territories of the united states and elsewhere the right ol the slaveholder in on of the states to bis slave on removal ui the territories is equal to the clause in the constitution which says no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law then it follows that slavery is a part of the fundamental law and that state laws and sate constitutions are equal in authority to the constitution and the laws of the united stages  hose that defend this doclriuce argue by implication that because in a few instances and for particular reasons the fundamental law was suspended m its operations by that very act the fundamental law of liberty is destroyed and the right of a man to his liberty is no longer an inalinabte right but must rest on some legal decision or court of record again let the advocates of this doctrine consider for if it is true that slavery under the constitution has equal rights with freedom under the fotce of slate laws as well as by inherent right in said constitution it follows that the people of all the states are responsible fonts existence in any particular state our right to legislate on the subject becomes inherent in congress under the constitution and congress may at any time abolish slavery throughout the states whenever the opponents of slavety have the power the advocates for the fundamental law of freedom in all places where the united states authority is exclusive have never claimed to exercise it in the states then by constitutional provisions this fundamental law was juspended as respects those held to service er labor in such states according to the laws thereof but slavery received no new powers jy this constitution nor had conceded to it ny extraterritorial force except as by law rovided for the return of fugitives from labor tut not any such law as that of p either r buch a substitute as the bill of mr mason proposes that is not the pricj agreed they both lack the constitutional prot risiondue process of law as the fundamental law of

divided from the flowergem med bank by a belt of glittering sand while oq our right the bold headland stretched far into the sleeping waters whereon rock and tree and grassy m und were brightly mirrored nothing of life stirred in the silent wilderness save the brilliant butterflies hovering around more gaily tinted blossoms and the bright hummingbirds with their emerald and ruby plumage glancing like jewels in the sunshine fluttering over the flowery shrubs and darting away across the honeycomb quartz that gleamed between us and tbe pint with a low hum as though they were murmuring tales of the gold which slept below but all the unsunned treat ures which the gnlduoom might indicate were in worth far belt w the priceless offering once laid upon those stones and many many years

of our companions ands we sat there beneath the lofty sycamore with the noonday sun pouring down light and beauty on the fertile earth and deep blue waves the tale to which we listened gained perchance a deeper interest from the scene of its re lation the coming winter had breathed his first frostspell over the forest turning to crimson and gold and silver its garb of varied green when one evening a girl sat on the grassy bank watching the latest sunbeams fade from the glowing sky and darkening lake the sunset hues had left tbe clouds and the stars were glancing forth to mirror themselves in the blue watershut still the girl kept her post gazing along the shore and afar in the distance she was alone yet the line of tall tr e bordering the forest concealed an indian encampment and above their heads several columns of grey smoke were soaring up into the evening sky while the murmur of voices rose on the air and at times peals of laughter echoed through the woods but wabegwona cared not to join in the merrimeot she was watching for the return of her nearest relative who had ever been to her as a brother and dreaming such dim visions as she could dream of the scenes and the people among whom her mother had been born for though her hair was dark as midnight and her features those of the race with whom she dwelt there was enough in the maidens fairer complexion and deep blue eyes to have won her the name of wabegwona white lilly which was bestowed upon herby her tribe her father long dead had been agreat chief but her mother had been fo jnd as a child by the ottowas among the ruins of an american outpost which another nation had destroyed andcarried away and adopted by them had become the wife of one of their bravest warriors yet amid all the contrasts of her wild forest life the fair haiied daughter of the palefaces had retained some faint recollection oi the past to breathe into the wondering ear ol her child before she also was called away and webegwona was left an orphanalone save for laguiab the son of her fathers brother who had taken hpr to hit home and bade his mother lo k upon her as a daughter and the young men to whom her smile was cold as sunlit snowand the od women who were for ever whispering like the forest leaves said that laguiab would make her his wife but ne maidens heart was still in her mothers grave and the boldest hunter and bravest warrior of the ottawas feared to draw it theoee too rashlylest it might shrink away from his touch and now a dark speck glided among the starbeami on the lakeand a canoe came bounding forward eagerly like a wild deer to its favorite haunt it was for that which wabegwona watched and a smile lit up her features as she beheld it and her thought which had been wandering far beyond the dark threat and the gleaming waves flew back to the present the rifle of laguiab haa not been idle said wabegwona who stood on the shore to welcome her cousin he has lingered longhis canoe is heavy be rifld ot laguiab has been his enemy replied the hunter mournfully let my sister bid tbe young men come hither for the load in his canoe lies heavy at the heart of laguiab one glance had told the girl that a stranger lay to all appearance lifeleas in the canoe and she hastened to summon the hunters from tbe fires around which they were tailing of the past days exploits then she went on to tell her aunt of the guest they might expect how wabegwona heart beat as the otto ways bore the wounded stranger into the lodge and she saw that he was not merely young and handsome for that was little then to her but of the race her mother had always loved and when the medicinemen had done their best and eo they said charmed he bullet out of the wound and apoken the wise words which would make their herbpotions drive away the evil apirit of fever and call back health to the sufferer then laguiab came to her and told her how a branch had caught the trigger of his rifle and without his touch it had struck down the shite hunter the moment he first beheld him but wabegwona will be a sister to the pale face continued tbe young ottaway she will know that it is the heart of laguiab which lies wounded in hia lodge and she will watch over the stranger as tbe eagle watches over her young one until his wings ere strong and hia eyes can look boldly on the aun as the summer wind was laguiab voice and tha maidens will waa the rush which loved to bend before it for uo brother could be dearer than he bad ever been to her but the strong grasp of sickness was on tbe strangers mime and it arms long ere all tbeir earn coaid loom it and often as she sat beside bis coach while spirits of the past and of the absent seemed hovering around and in communion with him did wabegwona fear that be would pass away to the happy gardens of the palefaces and leave a shadow on the soul of laguiab for though the ottoway bad slain many foes on the warpath until his fame was on the earth as the lights whose name he bore were in the sky and shona in the sight of many nations and women trembled at its rushing sound and warriors mused on wbat it might portend still the youog chief sorrowed for the aimless blow which had struck down a tree whose fall might crush many flowers but gave no place for glory to spring up but the summons had not gone forth and the englishman was left to find the life to which bo awoke a wilder dream than all his fererrisiono weeks and months had glided by the snows which had not fallen when seyton was brought to the ottawas encampment had melted aw with the hours forever vanishedand leaves were bursting forth on tne trees and flowers were starting up among the bright fresh grass with all the rapidity and vigor of the vegetation in that region but spring aid not find the ouawas where the autumn left themon the point beside the gold loom death had breathed on one of their fairest plants and when it withered and died they as si frequent among the indians deserted the eene of the misfortune and their lodges were now raised and their fires lighted on the shores of a quiet bay several miles lower down the lake again it was evening and wabeg wona sat on the starlit strand but this time she was not alone for seyton was by her side telling her of the mighty river beside which dwelt her mothers people and his own and of the stately dwellings along its shores and down where the salt waves broke in restless murmurs that were for ever whispering of the distant island far towards the rising sun moaning and dashed around their forefathersgraves and he told her too of one who would gladly bear away the fairest flower of the forest to bloom within one of those proud dwellings and of a love which would guard it against the tempest and shelter it from the burning sunray and cheer it if the breath of sorrow which wanders everywhere should bow it to the earth the maiden smiled as she listened but the englishman wondered if it were in pleasure or in scorn for the faint light revealed her face dimly has wabegwona no words he asked say must the paleface regret that her voice called him back when his spirit was on the wing there was a minutes silence and then the low sweet voice of wabegwo na came like music on the ear why should an ottawa girl speak was her reply the paleface are the stars the hefrt of wabegwona is the lake whereon they rest let them lookdown and they will see no other light reflected in ita joyful exclamation was on seyton lips but it was stayed as a shadow fell on the sand and a form stood before himlaguiab the starbeams showed him deadly pale and his arma were folded and his lips compressed while his glance was as though the true aurora borealis had flashed upon them laguiab is a fool said he bitterly his rifle was wise but he wa angry with its wisdom are there no blossoms beside the distant waters where the palefaces build their lodges so high up into the sky that the stranger must come with a tongue keener and brighter than the knives ofhis people to steal away the only flower an indian loved to look upon the heait of laguiab was spread before my sifter continued the warrior reproachfully to wabegwona had the while lily looked into it she would have seen but herself but a white mist has come her eyes and she can nota stange wind has whispered inin her ear and the voice to which she once listened is forgotten the ottawa paused but surprised b the accusation of treacheryof which he no thought of being guilty seyton hesitated to reply and v abegwona bowed her head in silence for love for laguiab was strong within her heart but it was only as a brother that he had always mingled in her thoughts and sue never dreamed of hearing such words from his iips after a moment he resumed more fiercely but why should that mist stay to blind the eyes of wabegwona la guiabs arm is stronger than his voice and his arger is a mighty tempest which breaks down the forest as it passes it shall sweep the mist from his path and the eyes of the white lily can look once more on his face as he spoke tne last words laguiab drew the tomahawk from his belt sey ton had risen to his feet but not to fly though a strange thrill shot through bis heart u he stood fir moment de fenceless before the enraged indian like a fawn awaiting the panthers spring the bright weapon gleamed in the starbeams as the ottaway raised his arm but the next instant it was whirled far over the lak to bury its keen edge in the slumbering waters no stud the indian in a low deep voice the arm of laguiab is strong but not strong enough to strike his friend the paleface has slept in his lodge and hunted by his side and an ottawa chief cannot take the life he has watched over thare is a cloud on laguiab but the stars are bright and the clouds cast uo shadow on the lake let it bo sothe paths of my brother shall be open to he great villages of the people but let not his glance be ever dark towards the white lily which his hand him torn from the home where it was loved and sheltered in the forest to plant it afar where the axe of the stranger has left no oranc hes to cover the earth and uetore either had time to answer laguiab had plunged auud the dark cedars which reared their lofty heads near the shore nor did he returnto the encampment until the silence of midnight rested on its barkcovered lodges and smouldering fires tne nextmorntag seyton asked in vain for his host for before the last star faded irous the iky the young chief with some halfdozen hunters had gone into the wood in quest of game had they remained they would have found more need of their rifles but no thought of danger was in the minds of the ottawa it was the oft repeated tale in those regionsthe wildcat stealing on her prey while it slept but this time in the daylight all was hushed and still ss though the voice of paio or discord had never echoed through the wilder oess when suddenly a youth rushed into the centre of the lodges crying the winnebagoes the wione bagoes a wild ahriek of womans terror was the reply to be instantly followed by a shriller cry of agony which told that the work of destruction bad begun and to be in its turn lost iu the terriblewarwhoop of the winnebagoes as they rushed upon the un prepart d and unsuspecting ottawa we will not the scene of bloodshed and desolation it is enough that death and fie reigned everywhere and that wabegwnna who had taktn shelter beneath the brancnes of a fallen tree saw seyton stunned and bleeding carried away alive to meet a darker fate than had befallen her tribesmen when laguiab and his hunters returned at sunset they found their encampment a heap of ruink and those they nad left in life claimed nothing at their hands except a grave and revenge so said the sorrowing and indignant warriors when they heard the tale which wabegwona alone remained to tell but other thoughts were io the young chiefs mind as he looked upon the maidens face and saw in it the agony which rent her heart and his gaze lingered on her pale features while his tribesmen spoke of seeking another band of their nation some daysjourney distantto join with them in wreaking on their foes the vengeance they were too weak to take alone another chief will lead the young men said he quietly laguiabs path is over the water but he must go alone let no wabegwona weep as though the sun were gone forever day will come back to pour sunshine on the darkened lake and the drooping lily will raise her head again the night had passed away and the morrows sun was shining gaily and brilliantly on the scene we first described and seyton stood in the centre of that spot of gleaming quartz to take his last farewell of life and view calmly as he enud the terrible preparations for its close how the thought of wa begwona and of that distant home whence the wod spirit of adventure had lured hi u came round him in that moment when death in its most dreadful aspect stood before him and cruel hands and savage looks and taunting words surrounded him in that lonely and beautiful spot where he must close his eyes in agony far away from all he loved with not one kind glance or friendly voice to support him in the fearful hour of trial just as the signal for its commencement was to be given a youth who had accompanied the war party to serve as an unsuspicious looking scout approached the chiefs and intimated that a stranger claimed the privilege of entering and leaving the camp uum tested safe conduct was accorded and in a few minutes a young indian advanced inf the circle of expectant warriors with the haughty step and lofty air of one accustomed to be honored and obeyed despite the usual selfcontrol of such assemblages the name of laguiab ran in wondering tones around the circle the winnebagoes looked for la guiab said an old chief with a hidden sneer had he flown up into the sky or dived irke an otter into the lake when the warwhoop was sounding through the woods laguiab has folowed the winnebagoes said he coldly to ask if they ever heard his name it is the name of a brave warrior replied the winnebago there is no greater in his nation the dirk eye of the ottawa flashed proudlyfor a moment then he said as cold as before would the winnebagoes like to boast to their women that they had slain that warrior or a paleface whose name they never heard the path of laguiab is open replied the old chief the winnebagoes will not keep what is not theirs let the paleface be free as the wind which wanders over the lake said laguiab and an ottawa chief will be the prisoner of his foes the old chief waved his hand and in an instant a ready knite severed the thongswhich bound seyton to the stake laguiab laguiab this must not be exclaimed the englishman advancing quickly to his side what have i done that you should die forme a mournful smile flitted over the ottawas face he pressed seyton hand and whispered in his ear there is sorrow in the heart of wabegwona and the eyes of laguiab could not look upon her tears it is wellla guiab is content the voices of his fathers are in his ears calling him away and an indian must follow to the land of spirits why should he stay the light of laguiab will shine no more upon the night of the ottawa but the white lily will be happy ift the shelter that she loves then turning away he spoke a few words to his captors and before the englishman well knew the purpose of the indians who once more seized him he was speeding over the deep waters far away from the fatal spot where the life of laguiab was being paid the fearful price of his liberty and there on the goldbloom was offered up the noble heart of the ottawa chief the sacrifice of a selfdevo tion against which not all the w alth slumbering in the untouched mine comd ever weigh the next tempest swept sway the traces of the sacrifice and when we heard the tale and looked upon the spot all was calm and bright as though the passions of man had never cast a shadow upon the earth though even the name of laguiab was still loved and wept over in one dwel sf far away on the banks of the st wrence and many many more years must glide into the past ere the memory of that deed shall die away orit cease to be recounted to those who like ourselves may chases to res in ihst that wild and lovsly sce ihsir wanderings in the west
