i of voted on motion of wendell phillips that we now hear the annual report of the board of managers or such portions thereof as the corresponding secretary shall select mr quincy then read selections irom the report notice was given that the report had been printed and would be ready for delivery to members and others tomorrow wendell phillips from the business ommittee reported the following res olutions l resolved that while we look upon the free soil movement as the unavoidable result of our principles and agitation and hail it so far as its formation gives proof of the wider spread o a degree of antislavery feeling in the community we feel called upon to warn the old friends of our cause the veter aus of so long and fierce a struggle not to expect too much from the first groping of a community which as yet sees men hut as trees walking and that we are not to sink the experience of nigh twenty years to suit the views or wait the infant movements of those who have just awakened to our enterprise that the maintaining of our advanced position is the only security we have that they will persevere in their measure the only sheet anchor when this experiment necessary for their education has failed as in its present lorm it musir the corps of reserve by which alone their broken ranks and disheartened courage are to he succored and the labors of so man y years saved when this transition perihd is passed resolved that as the success of the slave power in usurping the control if our government has beenowing the north starr to its being made the paramount objed of a large class in this community and especially in the slave states no effectual resistance can be made to such a conspiracy but by a party prepared tc make resistance to the slave power the exclusive and pahunount object of iti existence and herxe we view with alarm and deep regret the course of the free soil party in putting in nomination in some cases men who were not prepared to pledge themselves to the support of even their platform of principles deeming such a course treason to the hopes and deserving to forfeit the trust of the antislavery public l resolved that we cannot look upon the free soil party as an antislavery party in any proper sense of the term as no effectual resistance can be made to the slave power except by a party prepared and pledged to trample under foot the compromises of the constitution and we look upon any success attending the efforts of the freesoil movement as due only to the fear entertained by the south that their candidates will in reality be false to their oaths of office and ready to make every use covertly of that antislavery sentiment in the community which far outruns its platform and has lorig ago snapped asunder the bonds of the union  resolved that the church which is in religious fellowship with slaveholders or the members of which are in political alliance with slaveholders or which cherishes and exemplifies the spirit of complexional casteor which does not make the immediate abolition of slavery its special concernis not worthy to be recognized as the church of christ has no claim upon human sympathy or respect and ought to be abandoned by every one as radically defective in christian principle and character and whoever continues in willing connection and with such a church is to be regarded as an actual supporter of slavery voted motion of oliver johnson to adjourn to half past p m wednesdayafternoon session society met according to adjournment the president in the chair the resolutions reported in the morning were again read and on motion of s may jr the first three resolutions relating to the free soil party were taken up for consideration stephen s foster of worcester i objected to the resolutions that they admitted too much in behalf of the free soil party and would tend to recompile the members of that party to their present positfon james n buffum of lynn moved that all persons present whether friendly to its principles or not whether antislavery or proslavery be invited to take part in the discussions of this meet jing adopted unanimously stephen s foster moved to recommit the resolutions on the freesoil party which was seconded e quincy opposed the recommit ment leave being granted the following resolution was offered and adopted resolved that every friend of the antislavery cause present at our meetings be invited to enrol his or her name as a member of this body and also to give one dollar or such other sum as is thought proper towards defraying the expenses of this annual meeting  s foster withdrew his motion to recommit and moved to amend the first resolution by substituting as fol lows resolved that we hail with joy the breaking up of the two great political parties of the country as conclusive evidence of the progress of antislavery sentiments even though their sundered fragments have been reunited on ground scarcely less proslavery than that of the parties from which they have been torn jxwis hayden spoke in opposition othe substitution the discussion was continued by wendell phillips and abby k foster at oclock adjourned to  oclock

constitutions or party organizations or ecclesiastical combinations whatever we summon all the true friends of freedom and humanity to come to our aid and sustain during the year on which we have entered that great moral movement which has laid the axe at the root of slaverys tree by their most generous contributions and pledges the committee on finance then and subsequently received pledges

subject before the society it was spoken to by samuel may jr and parker pfllsbury its adoption was moved by stephens foster seward mitchell moved to amend that resolution by substituting the fol lowing resolved that as the american church has been fully proved to be the bulwark of slavery we believe the time has come when it should be destroyed root and branch as of no use to the people and a curse to every canse of moral reform after remarks by mr mitchell and john c cluer the amendment on motion of edwin thompson was laid on the table the question was then taken on the original resolution that numbered and adopted without a dissenting vote stephen s foster introduced the following resolution and advocated it at length resolved that in the opinion of this society it is

in the morning by s s foster came up and was supported by w jenkins of andover and opposed by w l garrison on motion of e quincy k the resolution was laid on the table charles stearns oflered the following resolution and supported it in some very earnest remarks respecting the sufferings of many of the laboring people of the north whereas the rights of the laborer at the north are identified with those of the southern slaveand cannot be obtained as long as chattel slavery rears its hydra head in our land and whereas the same arguments which apply to the situation of the crushed slave are also m forca in reference to the condition of the northern in a less degree therefore resolved that it is equally incumbent upon the workingmen of the north to espouse the cause of the emancipation of the slave and upon abolitionists to advocate the claims of the free laborer john c cluer attributed t h greater part of the sufferings of the northern laboring people and especially of the poor irish to a too free cse of iiitexi cating drinks he said he had paid much attention to these subjects viz the rights of the laborer and temperance and he spoke with a full assurance of the truth of what he said mr stearnss resolution was adopted and the society adjourned to  oclock fridayevening session the society met according to adjournment francis jackson president in the chair mr garrison chairman of the business committee reported the following resolutions resolved that the one great object to be attempted and achieved to secure the emancipation of our enslaved countrymen to assert and protect the rights of the people of the northand to impose the awful criminality involved in the slavfe system exclusively upon the incorrigible tyrants of the southis the immediate dissolution of the american uniona union based on the prostrate bodies of three millions of the people and cemented with their blood a union which gives absolute power and perfect security to the wholesale traffickers in human flesh by its combined military and naval power and the overthrow of which would inevitably burst asunder the chain of every bondmana union in which freedom of speech and of the press the right of petition and safe and equal locomotion are cloven down and the citizens of one portion of the country are seized for no alleged crime in another portioo burned to prison kept in chains plundered of their property and in numerous instances sold oq the auction hlpck at public vendue as slaves in lots to suit purchasers resolved that iu openly and unequivocally advocating slavery as a just beneficent and democratic institution john c calhoun of south carolina is to be commended for his frankness and directness that for his earnestness consistency intrepidity nod selfsacrt tice in defending end kmg to extend and perpetuate what he thus profeeees to regard ns superlatively excellent hem equally to be commended and that he in honorable contrast and in incomparably to be preferred those northern timeservers and doughfaces who rofiir abhorrence ed ready to compromise the sacred prioci ptee ef liberty the north and ck keoie georgetown d c who wu soon tobe sold to the south if not redeemed a man was said to be now in boston raising money to purchase her freedom mrc also asked leave to take up a collection in the meeting to aid this object which was agreed to and the sum of was contributed william w brown advocated the resolutions and declared that he could do no less than make war upon a constitution and union which made a chattel of him and utterly refused to acknowledge his right to freedom or to protect him in it he referred to the two fugitives from slavery who had attended some of our previous meetings and again introducedthem to the audience who received them with enthusiastic greetings mr brown again gave a sketch of their method of projecting and executing their bold attempt wendell phillips referred eloquently to the case of these interesting fugitives he said that we should look in vain through the most trying times of our revolutionary history for an incident of courage and noble daring to equal that of the escape of william and ellen craft and future historians and poets would tell this story as one of the most thrilling in the nations annals and millions would read it with admiration of the hero and heroine of the story and would wish that they could have lived to take part in the glorious struggle of freedom and justice and humanity against slavery fraud and tyranny mr phillips closed with reading the petition to the massachusetts legislature now in session for a secession from the union and called upon all who are not mere hearers but doers to come up and sign and circulate this petition mr garrison from the business committee then reported the following resolutions resolved that if in the earlier days of our antislavery struggle the utmost zeal and alacrity were widely and effectually shown by abolitionists in circulating petitions for the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia and for the repeal of all laws in thi commonwealth in derogation of the rights of our colored population it is incomparably more important now that they should manifest at least a much zeal and alacrity in circulating for popular signatures the petitions to the legislature for immediate secession of massachusetts from a union in which she is helh as a vassal and which serves only to pollute and degrade her voted that the question be now taken on the three resolutions reported this evening the question was then taken on the resolutions separately and they were unanimously adopted voted to adjourn sine die francis jackson president samuel mav jr ic bramhall assistant secs eliza j kenny from the antislavery standard ethnology we have just een the hopes of the friends of liberalism and progress in central europe thwarted in a grea measure by foolish disputes about races and nationalities while the honest men were falling out the rogues have succeeded in getting what was not their own again the german punch has a print representing two men in different national costumes engaged in a furious combat the point at issue being whether the name of a certain town should be pronounced gratz or graetz when this matter of nationality is reduced to a downright absurdity by setting the inhabitants of two neighboring villages together by the ears it affords us only matter for a smile but it becomes serious when acted on a larger stage and by more prominent players though abstractedly as ludicrous as before almost all races in proportion as they have become powerful and distinguished have endeavored to justify their preeminence as it were by attributing to themselves a divine or at least a noble origin nations like individuals when they have risen in the social scale go immediately to the heralds office lor a coat of arms and a pedigree had the pilgrims landed at plymouth a thousand years earliertheir exodus from the land of bondage and their arrival in the promised land would have been foreran and accompanied by an abundance of signs and wonders as it is we are obliged to cootent ourselves with vague assertions of our anglosaxon descent the truth being that the settlers of new eogland end of those very few can lay any probable claim to such an origin we have no especial interest in these assertions of national nobility in as far as they have been the cause or the apology of national oppressions men are very willing to excuse any unnatural feature in their social system by tracing it ep to some inscrutable divine arrangement whatever revolts from the natural religion of the human beset they shore up with the props of their artificial and traditional religion an inferior tribe among the hindoos sprang from the feet of brahma which of course explains to general satisfaction why hey have always been and should always condone to be at the febt of the social scale in the same

the promise of hospitality to the ear and broke it to the sense when the descent of the negro races from the scriptural ham had been pretty clearly disproved and the application of the curse emailed upon his progeny transferred to another race proslavery was necessarily reduced to another line of defence a divine origin was attributed to slavery by tracing its natural cause to an innate inferiority both mental and physical of the negro family of main it is here that the researches of ethnologists become particularly interesting to abolitionists and furnish them with arguments more generally appreciable by the man of mankind than those appealing exclusively to the principles of abstract justice and right it is worth remarking from hnr various and unexpected sources e quiver of the reformer is constantly recruited with fresh arrows and how the investigations of science prosecuted indirections which seem the farthest removed from every day interests have yet a practical bearing more or less decided upon the hdmanitary questions of the time ethnology or the science of races is of very recent origin and dependent as it necessarily most be on glottol gy the science of languages which is also in its infancy it must generally make its appeals to inferences and probabilities rather than to actual dei monstration its conclusions may in i fact be assumed as incapable of experimental proof since periods of time quite beyond our ordinary conceptions of duration as derived from human history might be required to produce any foretold result and yet a sufficient number of examples may be found of various kinds in localities widely separated and wholly independent of each other where certain i causes have produced certain effects toi establish a firm basis for reasonable induction i the most comprehensive work on the science of races is that of dr prichard the natural history of man it is necessarily somewhat deficient in arrangement because ethnol less an exact system than an agglomeration of detached facts all however tending to one result so that it is not difficult for the reader to generalize for himself dr prichard is aman of great learning and apparently of an honest and wellbalanced mind not likely to be led astray by theory nor to form his conclusions in advince of his facts he gives very full extracts from the accounts of particular tribes of men given by travellers of different nations at different periods of time so that the reader may form conclusions for himself without being obliged to rely too implicitly upon the conscientiousness of the author the instances hitherto collected by ethnological students seem to put beyond question the fact that difference of physical structure and of the color of the skin may all oe referred to climatic causes and do not in the least countenance the theory of essential diversity of race the examples by which this proposition is supported are very numerous are found among all races and in all quarters of the globe and are to our mind perfectly con vincing the jew transplanted to poland becomes redbearded and blueeyed in england his complexion grows gradually fair in the east indies on the other hand colonies of jewish stock are found who are entirely black and that without the least proof or probability of foreign intermixture in china they are described as having approximated very nearly in complexion to the native type this is a strong argument because the uniform reluctance of the jews wherever scattered to contract marriages with other races puts the purity of their blood almost beyond dispute and refers us to some other natural causes for a solution of the problem these natural causes are to be found in difference of climate habits and food of the influence of climate a remarkable example is afforded by the berbers inhabiting ai mountainous region of africa their language habits traditions all prove them to be of one unmixed descentand yet they differ in complexion and some other characteristics in proportion as the particular tribes occupy a position further from the plain ranging from yellow hair fair complexion and blue eyes to black akiitp and woolly hair we have seen the influence of clj mate upon complexion and the color and texture of the hair changes equally remarkable in the shape of the skull in the length and general characteristics of the limbs and in the det deloproent and tissue of the muscular system are broeght about by the habits and diet of a race dependent upon the climate or some other circumstance of local condition the difference between the turk settled for four centuries in europe and the original race till existing in asm is so great that nothing hut the clearest proof deducible from language and authentic history would suffice to satisfy us of their identity as remarkable are the changes which have taken place in the races at present occ spying the western portion of europe not to spook of the entire contrast they offer to th original asiatic type it will be enough to allude merely to their dimatnhmtkr m general features from tbcur ancestors as described by the eaifiest trustworthy ob servers the r isipiilstl g i john wch pssn whole no  uftd not greater than may be fo listing in individuals of the same r subjected for a long period of time to the action of climatic or othe physical causes we may say farther that the conclusion to which many inquirers hate been led is that the white skin i an no the black is a divergence from the original type effected either by climate or by the propagation of an accidental variety such as we still find to rouc among races naturally we wish that dr prichards work might be reprinted in this country since the high price of the english edition places it beyond the reach of the great majority of readers we have some doubts however whether such a book would pass the uice censorship of the press which presides over our american republishers slavery demands the expurgation of science mm well as reli ion and like molieres doctor in pite of himself woold change the heart from the left side to the right if its ends could be served thereby an excellent summary of the book may be found in the last number of the edinburgh review where the reader will be able to see at a glance the progress of ethnological studies and the present boundaries of its discoveries except for purposes of reference it will be more interesting and useful than the original book which we have found to produce some confusion in the mind after a single reading from the multiplicity of its facts and references j r l voice of ohio i j no one subject at present more generally or justly agitates the public mind than does that of the extension of slavery it is one of fearful import as the division is one of geographical lines and adverse interests of soil and climate so far as the state of ohio is concerned there appears to be but little difference of opinion on this subject although our people differ upon questions of state or national policy j yet upon this one subject all or nearly all are agreed thnt slavery ought not to be extended this unity of feeling has been heretofore manifested by legislative action upon one occasion when one of the great politioal parties into which the state is divided was in the ascendency and the question was agitated of adding more slave territory to this union that project was unanimously condemned by the general assembly and at a subsequent period the other political party being in power the same measure was condemned by an overwhelming majority of the same body but this was of no avail this remonstrance was unheeded texas was annexed with slavery irrevocably fixed upon it since that period in consequence of the war with mexico a war waged against the feelings and wishes of a majority of the people of this state new territories of immense extent have been added to the united states these territories are now free uncontaminated by the blight of slavery and the great question which now agitates the nation is whether they shall be protected in that freedom by an act containing the principles of the ordinance of or whether by authority of the congress of the united states the curse of slavery shall be extended over them w hile i would faithfuly accord to the slavehoiding states all tie rights secured to them by the compact which binds us together i must also regard the rights of the free states with equal care and believing as i do that the fathers of the constitution never contemplated the extension of slavery under the authority of that instrument beyond the limits of the original states i can never consent nor will the state of ohio ever consent that this moral and political evil shall be further extended the interests of free labor the general good of the whole nation and the yet higher claims of humanity and justice demand that any act organ ising these territories should contain the principles of that ordinance which has contributed so much to the prosperity and happiness of that portion of our country once composing the northwestern territory i would therefore recommend to your consideration the passage of such resolutions as will express to the general government the voice of the stale of ohio upon the aubjeet and give strength to our senators and representatives in congress in their endeavors to restrain slavery within its present limitsger fords menage am american niumm ft should teach the people their true interests and duty their duty to themselves to their children to a world for freedom and searching for ait example of a pure and permanent republic by it let the people be taught that the advantages

by mr creen and showed members present the absentees were all excused but messrs mott and holcomb who after some delay made their appearance and were greeted with loud applause mr koedter said ln explanation of my vote i will make a few remarks this bill contains two separate propositions first it provides that the taxes raised from property of colored persons for school purposes shall he applied for the education of colored child en this is a principle of common justice and would consider it a disgrace to depart from it by taxing colored people for the education of our own children the second eart of the bill provides for the repeal of the lack laws so called on a careful examination of these black laws find them to be a miserable patchwork of incongruous provisions entirely inadequate to the purposes of their enactment am in favor of a prompt and full examination according to the eternal laws of nature and of reason whether two races so distinct and different from each other as tpe caucasian and the negro race can coexist together in one state upon terms of perfect equality if they cannot so live together w ithout endangering the public tranquility and happiness of the state if they must be separated then sir i am in favoi of enacting without delay instead of those insufficient black laws one general law of sufficient force and precision for the purpose of

representatives of the state of new york the petition of ihe undersigned sheweth that in the opinion of your petitioners the punishment of death is opposed to christiani ty that it does not answer the

achieved the following extract will certainly interest all who may read w c nit cannot be denied that this first victory of the norlhover the south was the consequence of the growing antislavery sentiment at the north and to the demonstrations which the presidential obliquities of the two parties had called forth for the first time in our history has the north arrayed itself in so unbroken a line against the south on a point involving the interests of slavery for the first time since we were a nation was slavery disappointed of a purpose she f had at heart and which she was determined s to carry through she has sometimes waited s for a season while the pear was ripening but it has always been of her own mere notion and with her own free consent whatever she has wished for she has had and at tjie moment she was ready for it she has met with her first reverse the charm of unbroken success is at an end her vassals have made a stand against her aggressions i they are learning that the advantage is on their side if they know how to use it like the oppressed everywhere they are the many and woe to the few when the imaginary bonds which have held them in obedience are discovered to be merely air the maxim of her rule divide and conquer failed her for once the threatening aspect of affairs on the northern frontier has deprived her of her usual tools as soon as they saw reason to apprehend that their interests and hers had ceased to be identical and so they have by union given her her first repulse and it is surely time that freedom should i take her turn in the direction of affairs the histoiy of the country is one connected sue cession of slaveholding triumphs first kentucky split off from virginia then lou j isiana purchased and admitted then the war iof then the tariff then the missouri compromise then nullification and the tariff compromise then the florida warthen the annexation of texas and last of all the war with mexico and the conquest of new mexico and the californias and as instruments and consequences of these victories the appointment of almost every president and important executive judicial diplomatic or military officer they have had the victory and the spoils of victory for sixty years and the sluggish north is but beginning to open its stupid eyes to the fact it is certainly encouraging to know that its eyes were not sealed in a judicial blindness but that there was a reach of audacity which could pour twilight at least upon them that though it had been laboring mute as a camel under the heaviest load that slavery could bind upon its back for years a weight could be at last found of w hich it would be impatient we have always thought and said that the only hope of the north jay in the very insolence of the encroachments of slavery this history proves it having submitted patiently to the extension of the domain and consequently the dqration of slavery over millions of square miles and years unknown and waged two bloody wars in its quarrel the north at last recalcitrates against the putting of the new territory to the uses for which tt was acquired no resistance was made to the acquisition of mexican territory by conquest though its acquisition for any purpose was as gross an outrage as could well be perpetrated if the uttered parchment of the constitution had any virtue in it but after it had been wou at a great cost of blood and treasure then suddenly we awake to the consequences of our own act and refuse to permit it to be occupied for the purposes for w hich it had been won it is hopeful to see that these latent sparks of vital heat exist for they may yet be kindled into a consuming fixe but it is the perpetual watchings and tbs uuwearied importunity of the abolkiooisu for the last eighteen years that are to be for keeping them alive their unwelcome message has forced its way into the unwilkog ears of the people and compelled them to see where are and w hither they are going and after all the

for the par pose of advancing the sacred cause of human freedom as well as with a view to extend the circulation of the north star i have now resolved to devote several months to travelling and lecturing in such places as shall seem to offer tire most hopeful prospects of promoting these objects during my absence the editorial management of the north star will be committed to the faithful hands of william c nell those who have read the paper from its commencement and have seen tho articles from his pen need no assurance from me that it will be conducted with candor and ability a

having spent several years under the wings of the eagleeyed liberator and being deeply devoted to the cause of improvement and elevation of the oppressed his words will have a weight and a warmth which will secure for them a ready welcome to the hearts of all our readers and patrons mr nell takes charge of the paper more with a view to aid it in this its time of need than from any pecuniary considerations which may result from his labors and on this account will be entitled to my w arm gratitude and that of all who wish for the continuance and prosperity of the north star in addition to mr nell the publisher mr john dick whose pen has already contributed to the interest of the paper has kindly offered to use his best endeavors in making the north star all that its readers and friends can desire both with respect to its typographical appearance and moral character much therefore of the regret and embarrassment which i should feel in finding myself compelled to take the lecturing

thursday and friday the st and d in the city of reading berks county the people in lancaster are few in number and generally well to do and are intelligent yet there is an indifference about them in regard to meetings and lectures which may only be accounted for from the almost entire absence of such meetings among them as among our people generally the church is the alpha and omega of all things it is their only source of informationtheir only acknowledged public bodytheir state legislature as it weretheir common council their supreme courttheir dictator and only acknowledged adviser hence that which does not emanate from the church may not expect to interest the people to any considerable extent i would not be understood to say that they did not attend the meetings nor that opposition was given by those who had control of the church this is not the ease as both of the clergymen who reside in thp place not only gave their consent to the use of the church but gave their continual presence at the meetings and also subscribed for the paper but the lateness of the hour at which the young people generally cams to the men ings and the indifference manifested when therethe restlessness manifested by them w hen in the housethe continued running jn and out by tlie young womenat leaat manifested an absence of good breeding if nota want of interest in the meetings it was evident that they had no interest in inytliing but religious meetings an error arising from the misers bis blunders of our former spiritual teachers instilled into them by their proslavery and slavebolding oppressors thereby the easier to degrade us and keep us in w retched servility and subjection this error in our religion even taught and preached now by manywhose advantages of education

not the least pleasing features of this interesting gathering were the young and active people women and men all manifesting a deep interest for the success of the undertaking witha full promise of

wihich it is intended the recent fair was hastily gotten up by suggestion without organization or any particular plan of operation hence the difference of opinion on the part of the different ladies concerned as to the appropriation of the proceeds the fair however was well managed and well conducted and the ladies concerned one and all have our hearty thanks the sum donated to the star of one

subject of farming and the interests of the colored people generally he spoke of our condition in large towns and cities often surrounded by unjust laws and prejudiced public sentiment everywliere great obstacles upjmse our improvement afid elevation law public sentiment and popular religion uiuie to crush the colored man we see it and foci it in our souls we are determined to have a change ourselves only ran bring about that change ourselves must strike the blow we must inform and strengthen ourselves with knowledge go into the occupations of hfe around us with intelligence and confidence he spoke of the prospect opened to us by ihe benevolence of that greathearted man gerrit smith in the gift lands and those offered at such low prices urging upon us to usuil ourselves of

johnson cvn j b sandrbboh secy the spirit of antiftlaoery in western hew york since i entered the borders of the empire state up to this period judging from what i have seen the cause of freedom has been moving forward with signal success the willingness to hear and the interest manifested oh the part of the common people has been far greater than i expected i commenced at buffalo where found both the white and colored population awake to the cause of humanity the latter numerously attended all of ray meetings and gave willing aid the cause the noblehearted george weir jr d harris and many others are doing much for the moral and religious elevation of our people  held meetings at lockport geneva waterloo seneca falls syracuse and utica at all the above places i found more or less of our people the greater ipart of whom i found somewhat interested in the antislavery cause and those who are not with us are most generally exerting an influence against us they support proslavery presses and newspapers to the exclusion of those which are advocating the cause of suffering humanity others resoit to the gamblinghouse and rumshops and thereby bring down reproach and disgrace upon our oppressed race the number of colored people living in lockport is about geneva and syracuse has about the same utica little about in each place geneva is the most aristocratic proslavery hole i have visited i had the pleasure of visiting h h garnets splendid school and address a crowded antislavery meeting in his church when i arrived at syracuse i found the longtried and faithful friend of the slave the rev samuel j may who received me though a stranger as a friend and brother and by his aid and cooperation in a series of meetings we made the church ring with the appeals of our enslaved countrymen yours for the oppressed through the land henry little falls jan in another letter the same writer says i find that the florence village is all a humbug and will doubtless do great injury to the antislavery cause if it is not exposed i hope that you will not allow your name tobe associated with it you are probably aware that your name is published in the last number of their paper as being one of its officers or agents as are also many other good mens names whom i know have nothing to do with it i have every reason to believe it to be a cunning trick of an unprincipled clique whose chief object is to build up themselves on the benevolence of our antislavery friends at the expense of the reputation of our best and most influential colored men when i arrived at utica i found the names of five or six colored men reported as being the largest landholders in the state who were going out to florence to build mills open factories c which i have found to beall false these men do not own a foot of land neither have they any intention of going to florence and i am surprised to see the names of our best men connected with so base a business be on your guard eaton feb frederic k docglassyou have without a doubt ere this received the gratifying intelligence of the action on the th ult of the ohio legislature on the black laws which resulted in their unconditional repeal by a vote of fiftytwo to ten the measure was unanimously supported by whigs and democrats only six of the former and four of the latter voting in the negative it w ill pass the senate though not without considerable resistance by a strong minority in this body there are several members holding their seats by pledges made before the election to go against those laws some however begin to show signs of recreancy the other day one of those so pledged remarked in substance that he did not believe his obligations to his constituents required him to support all but that part only which relates to colored testimony in courts of law against white persons as an act of justice he was willing to concede this but he was not yet prepared to swallow a whole nigger wool and alla report amendatory to the common school law making provisional arrangements for the education of colored children was made andi think will become a law these achievements of victory over the hitherto strong popular prejudices we have had to encounter on every hand are such as should make us truly thankful to those who have ao successfully advocated our rights and rendered ua such signal aid in this our to be hoped great triumph five years ago there could not have been found a dozen in either branch willing to have their names recorded in favor of repeal such was its unpopularity at that time now there is a clear majority of fortytwo m favor of it true certain influences and am sorry to acknowledge the fact tended in some degree to produce this result aside from that of mere considerations to extend

nursing mother of states of heroes and statesmen and one of the principal founders of american freedom compare her with new york and how has times whirligig dealt with her new york has an area of fifty thousand square miles virginia has one of sixtyfive thousand the latter has almost all natural advantages over the empire state richer soil more genial climate finer mineral resources and far better means of intercommunication and how do the two states stand to one another in virginia contained a population of and new york only and hdw did the figures stand in new york had inhabitants and virginia had a very small fraction over half as many the wornout lands of virginia is a common phrase among the farmers of that state but whoever hears of the worn out lands of new york what explanation can be given of these astonishing facts l if the productions or elements tiiat exhibit the prosperity of the two be compared the resalts would be still more astounding than those wc have shown will any one pretend that nature made virginia the thrace and new york the attica of the united states or is it the work of man in kentucky contained inhabitants and ohio had but in the census showed that ohio hatf a population of and kentucky only the question returns upon us why are these things so is kentucky inferior to ohio in climate soil mineral wealth manufacturing or commercial facilities truth answers tiiat instead of being inferior in any of these items kentucky is superior to ohio in each and every one of these sources of prosperity what then has produced these results are not these political problems full of grave and important subjects for the solution of the people of kentucky l do we not owe it to the people of the commonwealth to ourselves and to posterity to ponder over these things louisville courier emancipation in kentucky the following joint resolutions preceded by a preamble have been introduced into the legislature of kentucky be it enacted c that in the opinion of this legislature the present agitation of the subject of emancipation is premature andl must result in evil uud only evil resolved that the only hope of relief to kentucky from the vast and acknowledged evils of slavery is in a long gradual course of preparatory legislation in combination and in unison with private and voluntary effort and in the ultimate colonization of the blacks beyond the limits of the united states resolved that in view of the great curse of a free colored population to any community in which they are incorporated the early creation of a moderate sinking fund with the purpose of assisting in getting lid of and colonizing the blacks now free or such as hereafter become free in kentucky would bea wise prudent and laudable expenditure of money by the people of this commonwealth resolved that this great cause iu the magnitude of its interest and in the difficulty j of its accomplishment is worthy of the exertion of the national energies resolved that our senators be instructed and oar representatives be requested to urge upon congress the propriety ot the creation of a national sinking fund out of the proceeds of the public lands to aid the efforts and promote the ends of colonization and of contributing to the ends in any other proper way and if there be no efficient constitutional warrant for these purposes to propose sustain

this blackhole was ventilated by a single aperture the door of this prison having been secured the little steamer proceeded gallantly on her waythrough rather than over the seas her captain fearing lest his vessel should founder or his passengers be drowned ordered a tarpaulin to be nailed over the forehatchway the sole airhole by which the suffering wretches below were enabled to breathe their stifled cries aad groans reached the ears of the crew as the wind lulled but the noise the work and the danger on deck prevented any attention being paid to them until the steamer had rounded the northern point of ireland and found a harbor of refuge in the smooth waters of loch foyle then the captain bad leisure to examine into the state of the emigrants below their cries and groans had been

troubles thicken with each passing day we see that a proposition has been introduced into the virginia legislature by a mr faulkner for some plan of action to prevent the escape of their human property he says the slave population in some sections of the state is rapidly thinning out especially since the recent legislation of pennsylvania proclaiming protection to all who cross her borders he estimates the early loss to the state through the connivance of the laws of the neighboring states at  his scheme is quite as foolish and vain as the edict of the old danish king to the ocean the tide of freedom is swelling in human hearts and it will not stay for virginia fetters or commands he may calculate on a still increasing emigration northward every year till this state ceases to decree half her children to be brutes and chattels it he would prevent the state being depopulated of her laborers let him move to treat them as men freedom is the only embargo they can lay on

repeating and the truths it conveys arc worth remem bering there are people who having begun life by setting their boat against the wind and tide are always complaining of their bad luck and always just ready to give it up and for that very reason always helpless and good for nothing yet if they would persevere hard as it may be to work up stream all life long they would have their reward at

anything hardship is the native soil of manhood and selfdefence he that cannot abide the storm without flinching or quailing strips himself in the sunshine and lies down by the wayside to be overlooked and for gotten he who braces himself up to the struggle when the wind blows gives up when they are done and falls asleep in the stillness that follows did you ever know any body to stick to any kind of business no matter how unpromising ten years at most who did not prosper no matter how hadit might be at the beginning if he stuck ito it earnestly and faithfully and noth iug else no

the boston mercantile library association december on england giving the results of his observations during his recent visit he apjears to have derived strongly favorable impressions of the english character he spoke of the steady balance of the qualities of their nature as their great characteristic and the secret of their success everything in england betokens life the land and climate are favorable to the production and preservation of good men mr e facetiously remarked that it was against his theory to travehe did not like it and in most cases he believed it disadvantageous to the literary man running up hills and over valleys he believed the office of a wheel not of a mati but he had profitted by his trip to england he referred to the elements of that power which the english now hold and have held for centuries after looking at her manufactories scattered over all the land her commerce her agriculture her arts and witnessing the stupendous results which have been wrought

exiles could not fait to exche the pity and even the sympathy o the spectators the populace in general manifested much feeling and if occasionally the religious meditations of the arabs were disturbed by a somewhat indiscreet j eagerness to see the ceremony we must blame that idle curiosity to which iwe flench are only too prone the cortege having reached the cemetery the arabs dug the grave during this operation the father of the deceased who betrayed an utter absence of moorish stoicism did nothing but weep and pray by turns the arabs inter their dead in much care and precaution the corpse is laid down on its right side with the face turned toward the east fragments of wood placed above the bier form a sort of dome covered with leaves and grass and consolidated by stones the earth which is cast over the whole does not touch the coffin which the arabs take great care to protect from the dampnes of the soil the gravediggers having washed their hands and feet the ceremony terminated on his return to the chateau the father of the decased thanked can taios boissonier and fournier for their kindnes and immediately retired to his apartments it appears that the deaths oithese two children

fifteen years of age her poverty was so extreme that to procure a subsis tance she prevailed upon her partly by persuasion and partly by compul t sion to suffer herself to be secretly conducted one evening to his lodgings by a varlet of his returning late t from a banquet in town the good knight found her in his apartment she was i lovely as an angel but her eyes were i swollen with weeping seeing her in r this plight he immediately asked her i what ailed her and if she knew why l she was come there the poor girl threw herself upon her knees andi said alas yes my lord my mother i j has insisted upon it nor would i have i done so without compulsion but my mother and i are so poor that we are dying of hunger and would to god i were dead so i might not be of the ii number of unhappy girls and in dishonor all my life and so saying she wept so violently that there was no pacifying her when the good knight j perceived her noble courage he said to her almost with tears truly my friend i will not be so wicked as to seek to alter your virtuous resolution and changing vice into virtue he took her by the hand and making his varl pt take a torch he conducted her to a female relative of his who lived near under whose charge he left her the next morning be sent for her mother and asked if she were not a miserable wretch to render her daughter vicious the poor woman ashamed and afraid could only answer that they were in i the extremity of poverty well said the good knight never do so vile a thing as to sell your daughter who j is a gentle woman you should be c severely punished tell me now has no one ever asked her in marriage j yes indeed she said a neighbor of mine an honorable man but he re a quires pc hundred florins and i have not thenaif of them and if he bad them would he marry her said the good knight yes assuredly an r swe red she he then took his purse dand handed her three hundred crowns t aying here my friend are two hun d dred crowns which are more than equivalent to six hundred florins of this country to marry your daughter withal and a hundred crowns for her wedding gear he then presented the mother ll with another hundred crowns for herself and desired his varlet not to lose sight of them till he had seen the daugb ter married which she was three days and kept a very creditable house taking her mother to live with her vi believe you have
