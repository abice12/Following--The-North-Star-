a brief account of israel french late of the vicinity of richmond wayne county indiana by his sister emma steer now in her th year of age it lias ion been in my mind to write home account ot my endared lirother s life and labors the education and encouragement of his jnany valuable friends who are still endeavoring to advance the cause of peace and rightj e msness in the earth believjng i know j more of him than any personliving j having been his friend and confidant through our youthwe held correspondence when separated and during those seasons of absence affinities ol mind were revealed which endeared us still more to each other and led us to prize the privilege of improvement in each others society and during the years of my widowhood i was also one of his family for the last years of his life j he was born in frederick county maryland the st of th mo lt is disposition was naturally quiet not inclined to interfere with the comfort of others hut very quick to resent imposition our mother died when he was only five years of age in the course of his childhood and youth being exposed to many trials he so tully overcame or regulated his temper that he was seldom seen ruffled by anythingyet always exhibited a keen sense ot justice and firm independence of mind lie was very early impressed with antislavery feeling in the following manner being on an errand one morning he crossed the farm of a slaveholder on his way home and meeting some little hoys went to play with them till they heard a horn blow when the boys ran quickly to the quarter for their breakfast it being on his way he went with them and saw them receive their gourd of cold mush containing only about two spoonbills for tticli and they kindly offered lmn some hut he took his leave and walked home ruminating on their condition and querying why it was that these lively sensible kind little creatures might not be as free as he was a deep sense of the injustice of slavery fixed on his mind and increased with time and observation and he was afterwards the means of convincing their masters son so that he formed a resolution never to own a slave and leaving maryland without any assistance from his father settled in ohio at years of age my brother was apprenticed to a tailor in virginia where he was exposed to many snares our father was a man of strict justice and integrity and truly christian spirit hut having placed his son according to the requisitions of the discipline in a settlement of friends and with a member of the society he trusted all would he well when about to leave us my sister set the alphabet in writing for him to learn that we might correspond which we did from that instruction alone on his part he could only read the new testament when he left us but continued to improve by his own exertion and attention during the very few leisure moments he eould get having no more opportunity of instruction till near years of ago he was released from his hard servitude by an arbitration having suffered much abuse he loft the place with a determination not to return and made application to a justice of the peace which caused the case to be examined and resulted iu his liberty after which he devoted some time to the study of arithmetic bookkeeping surveying navigation c and he might truly he raid to he selfeducated for to the end the north star of time with him his comprehensive mind was ever embracing all that was useful in science and literature at the period to which i have referred being very deficient in what he conceived to be a competent knowledge of his trade he settled to work in baltimore as the most likely place to accomplish his object his health was sometimes affected by close confinement to business and at those seasons his relatives and friends in the country were refreshed by his sojourn among them his disposition to udd to the enjoyment of others and not amuse himself at the expense of the feelings of any ever rendered him a welcome guest in all situations he strictly avoided the use of spirituous liquors though often urged to participate as the practice was very common with many in those times frequently remonstrating upon the deleterious influence thereof in the city he walked mostly alone for he found there were those who would lead him into snares many of which he hut was favored joyfully and thankfully to escape he acquired a marked solidity of deportment tempered with habitual cheerfulness and he attended meetings of all religious societies in which he was steady and attentive to their doctrines and ceremonies and at length settled his mind on sending for a certificate of his right in the society of friends whose early doctrine he approved he could not join with some religious authors in decrying human reason believing it had preserved him from many dangers that it was the recipient ot the llivine spirit and cooperating together evil was avoided and good embraced and thus good fruits produced in life aud conduct he always cherished a reverence for religion but thought it was not so mystical as many suppose hut plain and clear and comprehensive to a sound rational understanding he thought the rationality bestowed on us by the creator by which wc arc distinguished from the brute creation very different from the serpentine insinuations of pride that greatest darkener of reason and most subtle and potent enemy of mankind it was and continued to he his belief that many who promulgated doctrines shrouded in mystery were probably unacquainted with real religion and were hut blind leaders of the blind he maintained an equal stand between priestcraft and that slate of society which a rejection of religion hasa tendency to create he read the scriptures much in ekrly life for he wished to understand them for himself not depending upon the expositions of otlir he prized nftmy truths they contain as most excellent for instruction edification and comfort and continued to do so through all the course of his life though he chose the society of friends for his regard to the principles they early professed he was not blind to their failings in his day and often met wth those who could not brook plaindealing hut there were others with whom a lasting friendship was cemented thereby and with the society of such as those his mind was cheered through all the checkered scenes of his life about the th year of his age hei married deborah phillips of york pennsylvania who proved indeed a worthy companion of his pilgrimage they settled in maryland in his native county where he was surrounded by slaveholders who gave him many opportunities of remonstrating with them upon the iniquity of dealing in human beings and after he left mary land was often heard to say he did not know but j he ought to have remained there toi labor for the extinction of slavery for he was not satisfied w r ith being out of i sight of it believing there was a great j work to do and he was desirous of performing his part in breaking every yoke and letting the oppressed go free his remove to ohio was in and the first antislavery effort he there engaged in was the formation of the uniou humane society one of the objects of which was to assist fugitives j heeingfrom oppressionin which service he was actively engaged his house was the first that could be seen on entering mount pleasant jefferson county ohio and this becoming known to them they were enabled to gain its shelter without inquiry where they were comfortably equipped and facilitated oni their perilous journey it required much vigilance on his part as the manhunters frequently visited his premises hut his perils and sacrifices were cheerfully borne for the relief of the oppressed and he was often heard to express his regret that they were i obliged to seek so cold a clime as the canadas to ensure their safety he was always opposed to any scheme of colonization believing they ought to have their liberty to remain where they were uatives m a state ol freedom hut when any asserted their right by taking flight he would do ail in his power to prevent their being retyken aud subjected again to the evils of sla very tlie society of friends in ohio was very pleasant to him for some years many of its most active members were among his personal friends with whom he could enjoy much freedom in conversation the meeting of frienda and relatives from distant and different parts of the country at a newlyestablished yearly meeting made it sown like a family of love and all this rendered it very interesting but at lengh a time came when this family was shaken from centre to circumference by the accusations against that faithful friend and antislavery laborer elias hick it is well known to many that right is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren h first offence to hi principal accusers was his testimony against slavery and his labor with some who had grown rich in the society by trade in cotton goods e which he deemed sinful and deserving the name of prize goods against which the society professed to bear a loud and decisive testimony those who w ished to keep in the quiet and enjoy themselves in their own comfortable selfish way acl cuscd elias hicks with holding and promulgating doctrines contrary to the ancient belief of the society of friends this controversy was carefully examined by my brother and being satisfied j that be was in accordance with the early friends as much as when he w as universally admired and applauded by all he used his endeavors to show that there was no need of a division he strove to be impartial in his investiga lions sought opportunities of being where elias hicks was both at meetings and in the private circle without being known to him that he might be able to judge of his spirit and doctrines and being satisfied that he was actuated by a truly christian spirit he did not longer hesitate but invited him to partake of the hospitalities of our home during his sojourn amongst us this caused a separation between him and many of his former social friends who had now become full of party spirit and they disowned him and many others being thus separated he entered into labors ainongt the accused party having clearly seen in the workings of this division the pernicious influence of making a part of the meeting seleet by recommending ministers and appointing elders he proposed that everything making way for real or supposed authority be dispensed with that we who were associated might ever bear in remembrance the saying of jesus one is your master even christ and all ye are brethren many saw the propriety of this proposal but were overruled and settled down in the old forms which gave room for the aspiring again to assume the mastery which was tlie cause of much labor and trouble to him and many other purespirited friends in different parts of the society and through the course of his many trials and while a member of indiana v m his convictions on this subject still deepenedstrengthened and were expressed to his friend john mott michigan only a few months previous to his death in the following language n the mischievous contrivance of ordination early friends bore a faithful testimony against but thattestimony was let fall when they began to approve ministers and appoint elder this mode of ordination differs only fit form from that of other sects the results arc tlfc same the office in all is to establish a privileged class out of which will eventually grow a mercenary priesthood and a sycophantic people money is not the only item of priests wages flattery is the most delicious food to a w eak and aspiring mind and what i ask can gratify an inordinate selfesteem more than to be raised to the pmhacle of the temple by those whose ears are in turn pleased by hearing from the gallery or sacred desk the beautiful sound of eloquent oratory what a temptation is here presented for weak vain mortals to steal the livery of heaven and make it pander to their ow r n low ambition but let us iny dear friend spend our little remaining energies in striving to demolish those images set up by our modern nebuchadnezzars and rear in its place a standard with this inscription salvation is of god our creator who seeth not as man seeth he has prorniscd to be the teacher of his people himself requiring that ail should use the talents committed to their care to promote his glory and bring about a state of peace on earth and good will among men by doing good to each other commanding us to let our light so shine before men that they seeing our good works may glorify him our father in heaven therefore let our watchword be no secrecy no proscription light and loe will redeem the world his removal to the state of indiana was in the year and in the declaration of sentiments of tlie american antislavery society appeared and it cheered our spirits to see the stand they had taken and the labor they proposed to engage in it revived our hopes he assisted in organizing societies and made way for lecturers also encouraged young persons who in the freshness of feeling on first awakening to the importance of the subject seemed prepared to speak profitably thereon his house was ever open to all the friends of the cause as many can testify who have partaken of his hospitality arid our meetinghouse was never refused though at richmond where the monthly meeting was held to which we belonged they did not allow theirs to be thus occupied still continuing to attend monthly meetings where a disposition to disown their members being very prevalent he was often led to expostulate with the rulers desiring the discipline administered in the spirit of love that it might have a tendency to gather rather than scatter but a rumor being raised among them that he wished to destroy order and the name of order having become an idul among them they were jealous of his proposition to dispense with the select meetings and they kept up the err of order and slighted all labors of love to prevent disownment till at length he became impressed with the belief all excommunication was wrong being an emanation from the spirit of antichrist and used for persecuting purposes he would plead that we ought to labor always and not cast any off rochester n y friday may that we should be willing to bear some burdens often citing the parable of the lost sheep which the shepherd would bear on his shoulders rejoicing while these were hu thoughts and feelings towards all even the poor criminal in prison preparations were making to disown him committees were appointed to visit and revisit our preparative meeting and they produced a minute from a called meeting for sufferings requiring us to forbid the use of our meetinghouse to antislavery laborers warning us against mixing with the world they were all the while actively engaged in political manoeuvres and every scheme which seemed to promise them the aggrandizement of wealth or power they also required that none of our members should lecture in what they termed the present popular manner these demands he deemed unwarrantable and grievous infringments of his rights and the cry of mixing with the world had not been able to deter him from attending to his apprehensionss of duty they proceeded to lay down our preparative meeting and attach it to their own without which they could not take up a complaint against him then having all in their own hands they made up a complaint and having gone through the form issued a testimony of disownment against him he appealed to the quarterly meeting not to contend for privileges which were no longer desirable but to exhibit their bigotry and intolerance and was looking towards carrying it to the yearly meeting believing it to be his duty to arouse the minds of the people to the inroads and aggressions of sectarianism butat this period he was attacked by the prevailing fever of the country which terminated his existence they went through the form in the quarterly meeting and confirmed the judgment of the monthly meeting after he was laid in his grave his mind had been ardently and actively engaged in the dissemination of peace principles and in all his trials he manifested a truly christian spirit j and through all the last summer of his life seemed more and more pleasant and resigned and remarkably so in his last illness which was about nine days his head was affected with fever at night but in the morn he could rise and be cheerful with his family everyday until the last expressing great enjoyment in the beauties of nature taking notice of the notes of the birdsand with remarkable innocent cheerfulness desiring his family to dwell upon all the pleasant pictures he departed this life on the th of bth month inh th year of his age and his wife about thrfe weeks after leaving a much bereaved sister and daughter and many other friends to feel the loss of their precious society sth month d  extract from the speech of mr giddikgs of ohio on the ur luthn of mr ialfrey to mature win liter the members of c tigress had bun threatened by a law lei mob mr giddinos saidbefore entering upon the subject more immediately under consideration i must be permitted to say that have no intention to reply to those personal attacks that for three days have been made upon me they are unbecoming the dignity of a legislative body they are equally unsuited to the occasion yve are discussing the rights of humanitya subject dignified and solemn the eyes of the nation and of the civilized world are upon us and sir i cannot demean myself so much as to reply to those personal invectives which have been so liberally heaped upon me the subject of slavery which has now been before us for some days was not introduced by myself nor by any northern man the resolution of my friend from massachusetts mr palfrey does not allude to it yet it has been forced upon us by slaveholders aud northern men cannot avoid it regard it as inappropriate but have no alternative but to meet it or admit my inability to oppose the arguments ad vanced the gentleman mr haskell of tennessee charges roe with uttering sentiments on this floor and out of this house which have tended to excite the slaves to rebellion and to produce this state of thing by which suppose he means their attempt to escape from slavery for doing this be thinks i ought to hang as high as hainan and that the house ought to expel me for thus daring to give utterance to the honest sentiments of heart when such utterance way excite the slaves to regain their liberty mr speaker i wiß inform that gentleman with all sincerity that it is too late in the day to attempt to sea the lips of northern representatives in regard to the slave trade or any other subject which comes before this body i give notice to that gentleman and to all others that i shall speak just what i think on any and every subject which comes before us it is my intention to call things by their right names and to speak so far as i am able in such direct plain and simple language as to be understood it is true that the freedom of speech has been put down in this hall it was for years trampled under foot by the slave power i aat here daring several sessions of congress in degrading and humiliating silence and often listened to the supercilions tirades of southern members against myself and against the advocghm of überiv while i was not permitted to reply the suv selections a power then reigned triumphant in this body sir it n well known that for asserting in this house some of the plainest principles of constitutional law i was censured and driven from my seat here but thank god afteryears of toil and effort we have regained the freedom of debate and bw i say to the slaveholders present we shall never again surrender it when members here shall cease to cnjoy theprivilege of speaking their minds and representing the views and wishes ol their constituents my people will sendsome other man to congress or they will cease to be represented in this body why sir dots the gentleman from tennessee expect that i am to ask him or any other member what shall say when shall speak and how shall say it do southern gentlemen suppose they can bring into this body the practices which they pursue on their plantations sir they forget the theatre on which they are acting they forget that they are among freemen they surely think themselves among slaves accustomed to crouch and tremble ut their frowns this hall is not the place for the display of supercilious dictation such traits ol character are but poorly suited to the dignity of legislation they will not be tolerated by gentlemen who know their rights and have the spirit to maintain them whatsirare wc to sit here and listen to such language would advise the gentleman from tennessee to read the constitution of the united states to study the spirit and genius of the government of which heis a member to learn the privileges and duties and endeavor to catch the spirit and inspiration of an american statesman his thoughts will then be free as the winds of heaven and he will look with ineffable contempt upon upon all efforts to restrain the freedom of debate when the proposition of the gentleman to restrain the freedom of debate shall he published in my district the schoolboys will laugh at its absurdity but the gentleman thinks that my language in this hall has excited a love of liberty among the slaves as to that i have made no inquiry if it has imparted to them information or iaspired them with a desire to regain the rights which god has given them i shalf rejoice at it i would not desist from speaking truth in this hall if all theslaves in the universe were listening to me no sir if i had the power i would from this forum give to every slave south of mason and dixons line a perfect knowledge of his rights would explain to their understanding the oppression that weighs down their intellects and shuts out truth from their comprehension i would explain to them the outrage which has robbed them of their humanity reduced them to the level of chattels and subjects them to sale like brutes in the market could rny voice be heard by them from this hall i would teach them that they came from the hand of the same creator as ourselves and were endowed by him by with the same inalienable rights as those who now lord it over them i would inform them that they are brethren and candidates for the same immortality with us mr gayle of alabama desired to inquire of the gentleman from ohio mr giddings if these sentiments were not now uttered in the hearing of slaves mr giddings the gentleman from alabama pc haps could answer that question more accurately than myself ii know not whether such persons be present hope there may be some to hear me and if the utterance of such truths as these can teach them how to release themselves from bondage god knows their redemption draws nigh no sir i would say to gentlemen go tell your slaves how choleric you are and bid your bondmen tremble but come not here and threaten to expel andto hang the represeatatives of freemen for giving utterance to the sentiments which they entertain genj tlemcn may play the tyrant on their plantations bold theif fellowmen insubjection may cause their lacerated flesh to quiver with the lash but they shall not impose silence upon northern men nor dictate the language we shall use on this floor mr gayle inquired if the gentleman alluded to him when he spoke of the flesh being made to quiver by the lash he never used the lash on his slaves they would not accompany him here because they were afraid the abolitionists would skin them mr giddings the gentlemans statement shows to what depths of de j gradation slavery can reduce the immortal mind the gentleman from alabama has been so far successful as to teach his slave to hug their chains hid to shudder at the thought of being free he has driven from their minds the instinctive love of liberty these fact shw the most horrid characteristics of that i station it blots ot the intellect and reduces man created in the image of his god to tlie level of brutes that gentleman dare not teach bis slaves to read the word off god it would subject him to punishment in the penitentiary of bis state were be to do it nor need we go to alabama to find such laws if sir you pass over the river potomac j lying before our windows and on ft j southern bank attempt to kindle in the dormant intellect of n slave the hope j of a future life by teaching him to rend the holy scriptures you will be liable to an incarceration in the penitentiary of that old dominion of which we hear so often and so much in this house yes sir it is regarded a a crime to teach aslave to read the word of god in this christian landthis land of sabbaths and ministers and bibles and slaves mr vexvsle begged to say to the gentleman from ohio that he was no methodist though he highly respected that sect he was a presbyterian but he would refer the gentleman to the kpistle of paul to philemon from which that gentleman would learn that paul did net tell servants to run away from their masters but to return back to them hen the gentleman from ohio can bring evidence to show that he is better wiser and holier than paul he would listen to his counsels and not till then think the gentleman is too much excited for a presbyterian by what authority does he pronouuce onesimus a slave was he not a hired servant such as we of the north employ and pay for their labor did paul direct i that he should return to slavery no he commanded that he should be received as a brother but the gentleman from north carolina has attempted to press st paul into a justification of slavery what is slavery and what are its effects why sir a gentleman mr clay once a member in the other end of the capitol anda slaveholder of accurate information some years since stated that the average life of slaves after entering upon the sugar plantations was only five years and upon the cotton plantations only seven years that is to say they are driven so hard at labor as to destroy the lives of the whole of them every five and seven years upon an average now sir is it not ns much murder to destroy the life of our lellow man by a torture of five or seven years as it would be to strike him down at a blow yea is not this prolonged torture a refinement in cruelty i have no time to refer to the licentiousness or indeed to the almost total obliteration of moral sentiment to he found not only among slaves but among ail slaveholding communities why sir it is said ami i believe with perfect truth to be no unusual j thing for slaveholders to sell their own children as slaves brothers are said to traffic in the bodies of their fathers sons and daughters such crimes have no names yet the gentleman from north carolina represents st paul as approving and even enjoining slavery with all its concomitant iniquities well might the great john wesley denounce slavery as the sum of all villames for it is so in fact itis not merely murder for it takes life by a slow and regular process of torture it is not merely theft for it steals not only the property and the treasures of men but it takes from them their intellectual enjoyments it is not merely robbery for it robs man of himself the essential elements of all these crimes in their most aggravated form are comprehended in the term slavery and scripture is quoted to justify such appalling wickedness why sir if i entertained such sentiments i would abjure my religion and turn pagan these arguments are put forth by presbyterians the general assembly of that church some thirty years since declared slavery to he inherently sinful and of course it must be offensive to god and to allgood men slaye holding justice the following is an extract from the editorial correspondence of the ohio true demo crat washington april as an evidence of the manner in which justice is administered here i would state that the three prisoners who were bound over to appear at court and answe r to the charge of aiding in the escape of the negroes are each required to give hail in the sum of this is a country where the constitution requires that excessive bail shall not be demanded one of the men as i i have already stated in a previous letter was proved to be innocent on the i examination still he was bound over and bail required to the amount ot liotk he did think some of applying for a habeas corptu for the purpose i ot having the amount reduced by judge cranch he could give bail in the surn of soooo but we were given to understand that if released he would not leave the city alive the jail is constantly watched by men who have nothing to do with it but who are determined that no one of the prisoners shall ever be acquitted the jailor has i strict orders not to permit any one to have any conversation with them exeept in his presencenot even their counsel the prisoners are confined in cold cells with brick doors and nothing to sleep on except a single blanket as yet they have not disclosed the names of any persona who where engaged in the enterprise with them and they assured me that they never would do aa part of the negroes are still in jail some of them have not yet been elaim ed by their masters and others are kept there until a good rale cri be made of them the question arises iby what authority arc they there the f jail is the property of the people of the united states erected by their money for the purpose of receiving and keeping safe those charged or convicted of crimes committed in the i hat net by what authority then is it used for the i keeping of the negroes hie marshal j this district is appointed by the president he w paid out of the public treasury js be thus appointed and paid to be employed iu the capture and safekeeping of runaway negroes do the people of the united states pay him for this purpose and who pays for the keeping of these negroes m jad t r food tic the marshal of fbts wilham c we fvaitssta joitx dick whole no district has applied to congress to pay him the sum d for keeping runaway uvea prior to these and probably be will soon present another bill for keeping these and what i worse he has not only applied but the judiciary committee has sanctioned the application and mr taylor of ohio one of that committee has reported in favor of allow ing the claim these runaways were not committed to jail by any order of court there is no law requiring the jailor to receive them the marshal volunteered the use of the jail for this purpose and now comes to congress aud ask the people of the united states to pay him for it and mr w intbrops committee on the judiciary report a bill to pav him for it one hundred and eightythree colored persons were thus committed no one of them was charged with any violation of law some were confined as runaways some for safekeeping some as petitioners for freedom all put in prison by the order of some private person and kept until du eharged by the order of some private person except in a very few instances where having been kept tor several months and sometimes for more than a year they were discharged by order ot court i notice that one poor lellow put in jail by order of moses graham remained there days or three years and five months and then was dischargedby order of f s key and for keeping this negro the marshal charges the united states sl and the judiciary committee have reported in favor of taking this money out of the pockets of the people and paying it to him here was a man put in jail by order of a private individual and kept there three years and five months lying upon the cold brick floor in what other land would it be tolerated had he committed any crime not any he had attempted to escape from slavery to a land of liberty and for this attempt for three long y ears and a half lie was shut out from the light of day and remember this was done in the district of columbia where the people of the united states represented in congress have exclusive jurisdiction and now they are asked to pay more than four hundred dollars for this barbarity and a committee a majority of whom are northern men report in favor of the payment and this is hut one solitary case out of one hundred and eighty in which the marshal asks pay kidnapping we find the following letter relating the particulars of an atrocious ct of kidnapping in this state in the pennsylvania freeman the editor of that paper states that one of the kidnappers was recognized as a slavehunter trorn maryland and addsthat tfie jyiends from philadelphia followed them to baltimore where they learned that the girl had been carried to yirginia means are in train to recover her if possible downinotown lyth mo mv ieir fkicndthismorning our family was aroused by the screams of a young colored girl who bad been living with

excited by the attending circumstances of this daring and atrocious deed as scarcely to be able to give a coherent account f it but know that it is my duty to make it known and therefore write this immediately as soon as the house was opened in the morning these men who were lurking without having a carriage in waiting in the street entered on their horrid errand they encountered no one in their entrance except a colored boy who was making the fire and who being frightened at their approach ran and bid himself taking a lighted candle from the kitchen and carrying it upstairs they went directly to the chamber where the poor girl lay in a sound sleep lhey filled ier from her bed aud carried her down stairs in the entry of the second floor they met one of my sisters who bearing an unusual noise had sprang from her bed her screams and those of the poor girl who was now awakened to the dreadful truth amused my father who hurried undressed from his chamber on the ground floor my

deficiency as far as possible next week sreech or mbs lccretia mott there is not a m re interesting object for the contemplation of the philosopher and the christianthe lover of man and the lover ot god than the law of progress the advancement from knowledge to knowledge from obedience to obedienoe the contemplation of it is beautiful the investigation of it is exceedingly interesting as manifested in the history of the world we find in the earlier records the command to advance to get thee from thy kindred from thy fathers house and to coine into the land which shall show thee and again ye have encompassed this mountain long enough speak to my people that they go forward in the declaration of the prophets of old it was men of clean hands who were to grow stronger and stronger it was the righteous who held on his wav and in latter times we find the recommendation of the apostles to their brethren was to go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation for repentance from dead works and indeed was not the teaching of jesus particularly directed to lead the people onward ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt do thus or so then assailed those orders and institutions which they regarded as sacred speaking directly in opposition to their alleged heaven ordained law in contradiction to this law of retaliation he taught them to love their enemies and to do good to all embracing all mankind in the love which he so beautifully inculcated and so happily exemplified in coining down to latter times this law of progress is most emphatically marked in our day in the great reformatory movements which have agitated the truthloving and sin cerehearted engaged in the work of blessing man this may not be a fitting occasion to dwell much upon this topic but there are those present who can look back to the early days of the great peace reformation the liist efforts were to arrest the progress of offensive war while they claimed to themselves in extreme cases the right of a resort to selfdefence hut a reformer now the jesus of the present age on the mount zion of peace says ye have heard that it w as i said by them of old thou shalt war only in selfdefence but i say unto you take not up the sword at all the language is not now in only prophetic vision as of old it does not as the current theology has attempted explain the prophecies of peace on earth to refer to some future far distant millenium but its language now is sheath the sword render good for evil little children are taught to return a kiss for a blow do we not see the progress that these principles have made was there ever a period in history when nations were so prolific of events as at the present moment giving promise of being consummated by the ultimate realization of the higher principles of peace on earth and good w ill to man calling into action the high moral sentiments of the jieople and tending to arrest the sword of the destroyer truly this law of progress is worthy of our admiration look at it in the temperance reformation those interested in that cause can remember how it was said by them of old time thou shalt drink wine moderately and alistain from the unnecessary use of intoxicating liquors what is the language now of the saviour on mount zion of temperance say unto you drink not wine at all practice total abstinence from all intoxicating liquors and how has it been let me touch upon it ever so lightly with the subject of priestcraft it w as said by them of old time down with your hierarchies the protestant reformers said away with your popery away with firiests of that particular church and let us lave in lieu thereof the protestant and dissenting priesthood what now is the language of the reformer from among those who begin to have god for their high priesthim self the teacher of his people thou shah judge for thine own self what is right and god alone is and shall be thy teacher look at your pulpits they are widening they are not the little high narrow isolated boxes they were wont to be in olden time there is room for several and occasionally a woman is found to occupy a place there applause is not this then an evidence of progress even in the greatest and highest of christian principles how is it in the antislavery cause it is now more than ten years since it was my privilegeand a great one esteemed itto attend an anniversary of this kind m this city remember thetone of the speeches how that only the first principles of antislavery were brought into view and indeed looking back to a period shortly before this when a little handful gathered in the city of philadelphia and sat m convention and what fur o declare not merely selfevident truthsto reiterate the simplest truisms that were ever uttered head the declaration of the antislavery convention of and see w hat it was found necessary then to declare in convention the ptoplc were asleep on the subject with some few exceptions there had leen solitary individuals such as lundy and elias hicks aud the heuezetts the clarksons aud the wilberforces but tire labors in england for twenty years were simply to arrest the progress of the slave trade and it was the work of a w oman to declare that immediate not gradual abolition was no less the duty o r the master than the right of the slave in this convention in philadelphia the great principles of human freedom were ultered that every man had a right to his own body and that no man had a right to enslave or iinhrute his brother or to hold him for a moment as his property to put a fi ilowbe mg on the auctionblock arid sell him to the highest bidder nuking the mt cruel separations in families at that uio these tilings wer scarcely known the people had scarcely considered tliem it was now made known to very in the northern slates that there were then more than two millions held in lifts abject bondage who were claimed as property that men bad this irresponsible control tbs legal nght to their persons i hits ymeulioo resolved what it should do j firstefficiently to organize itself and then to j seek to farm other antislavery societies throughout the country they were to go forth and endeavor u enlist ihe pulpit aud the press in behalf of the suffering and the dumb the work it had to do w as a herculean tk it tw to tnret the priests

tioaiats in meeting the mi ulster in inis yj i the labors of these sow pwneero have bore sufficient to awake the nation to the eoamwetw tioo of this subject and there is re l h fce the hearts of those who bare not been blaafod by their sectarian prejudices by thev have received or by the boa j world which blinds the eyes of them that believe not these have heard the truth andi having received it gladly have come forward and in their inmost heart there is a response u tli truth as it was once uttered by a speaker of the house of assembly in barbados i that every man knows in his heart that slave hold mg is wrong it was needed that some should first come forth thus armed j give their views to the people and may noti the pioneer in this cause of immediate aboli j ion taming towards mr garrison who tiod the wine press alone in the beginning of this work say in the language of the prophet with my staff i passed over jordan and now i have become two bands look around you over the country and see whether he spoke in vain when he declared that he would be heard great applause observe the progress in the labors of this reform that both the pulpit and the press are enlisted to some extent in behalf of the suffering and the dumb also as has been already remarked in the legislative halta of the land the national assembly is engaged w ith it scarcely a legislature in the several states but discovers at every move on the great question of american slavery something cheering to the abolitiouist sven though the slaves are increasing in numbers even though their territory is being enlarged at every circle yet when we look abroad and see what is now being done in other lands when we see human freedom engaging the attention of the nations of the earth we may take courage and while we perceive bow it is assailed in our own land still we know how impossible it wjll be to separate it from the question of the freedom of the slave in that it is inseparably connected with it in france and is beginning fo be so in other countries have we not evidence of progress even in our own country on this subject a large kublic meeting was called the other day to ail the events of france mark the difference in this from former meetings why it was scarcely ten years since pennsylvania hall was burned by a mob because the liberty of the colored man was advocated by white and colored people intermingled what are now the facts with regard to this large meeting in the great public square in the same city not only were the movements in regard to freedom in the french colonies hailed by the white people present but the colored people also came forward and were helped onward they had their stand also and was it confined to themselves alone no it was an amalgamation meeting great applause yvas it by privilege as women sometimes have the privelege to hold a kind of play meeting laughter no the white people of that large gathering left their own speakeis to go among the colofed crowd and hear their speaker look also at the condition of the colored people in respect to the ridicule which was heajied upon them who are they now who ridicule us because colored people arc mingled in this meeting it is those whose ridicule is the scorn of the intelligent and wise of the nation applause now we find the colored people coming forth in intelligence in moral worth with increasing selfrespect and are respected by their white brethren we see them stand side by side with those who have thus cruelly treated oppressed and trodden them down these then are the evidences of progress let the abolitionist who should be as the jesus of the preseul age on the mount zion ot freedom continue to say ye have heard that it was said tiv them of old thou shall treat thy slaves kindly thou shait prepan them tor freedom at a future day but say unto you bold no slaves at all proclaim liberty now throughout the laud to all the inhabitants thereof let this be the loud sounding jubilee that shall be uttered let us no longer be blinded by the dim theology that only in the tar seeing vision discovers a millemum when violence shall no more be heard in the landwasting nor destruction in her borders but let us behold it now uigh at the door lending faith and confidence to our hopes assuring us that even we ourselves shall be instrumental in proclaiming liberty to the captive but let there be increasing activity on the the part of abolitionists they must not cease their labors arid ibid their bands thinking their work done because they have effected so much they must not be satisfied with coming to these anniversary meetings they must continue to work at home it is the righteous that holds on bis way it is those who are faithful to the light that obtain more light he that is faithful in a little shall be made ruler over more but if the light that is iu you be darkness how great is that darkness have we not some apostates in the cause who give evidence of the truth of this are there not some of whom it maybe said it were better they had never known the way of righteousness than that they should have turned from the commandments delivered unto them let us go on then and make advancement by our faithfulness when the pulpit cannot be enlisted nor the church aroused it is the duty of abolitionist to have no longer any fellowship with those unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them by separating from them and touching not the unclean thing here is the advanced step the abolitionists have made in the beginnmg of their w ork many of them w ere enlisted as some of them still are with the political movements of the land the party politics of the nation they lioped by thus uniting with these powers to effect their work but they have discovered that the situation of the country the legal euaclmenls the statutes that the slaveholders have made have been altogether tending to rivet the chains of the oppressed they have therefore found it theu duty to declare ui the progress they have been called upon to uuke that they must obey the command get thee from thy fathers house and come into a land that i shall show thee they have fotfhd it their duty to come out agaiust the constitution and government ot the country as it is at present const nod know hole however how treat this part of the subject lam glad however ui the pro gtess evident in this glad also of the evidence of advancement among abuhtionisu as to the commercial and manufacturing relations of the country it being made known that these are carried on by the gain of oppression while the north equally with the south building its houses by unrighteousness and its churches by wrong using its neighbor service without wages and giving four not for fog work it

will be the last stronghold of slavery in the civilised wotld ap plause new antislavery newspapers the reformer is published weekly by the newark n j antislavery society at one dollar a year and is presented to the public for the purpose of proposing and expounding the same principles which were to control the publication of the looking glam virginia in the mku an emancipation paper called the cbisis has just made its appearance at mandsville virginia edited by aaron berkshire who defines his position as follows one object and we may say the main object we have in presenting the public with this weekiy visitor is emancipation a theme which is now absorbing both the north and south we do not feel at all ashamed to embark in this general crusade against the system of american slavery as it is a notorious fact that many of the nolest citizens of the sunnysouth have declared in favor of emancipation as the only means of saving the nation from a premature and disgraceful death many very many slaveholders m virginia are in favor of a well grounded sykem of emancipation and will labor efficiently for its attain ment the louisville examiner tenders the following hearty greeting welcome brother most welcome there are none desiring the removal of slavery who will not hail the crisis with pleasure from all who long or labor for emancipation it will receive a hearty god speed the editor believes the time has come for action in western virginia doubtless it is so that vast and fertile region needs only the stimulus of free institutions and froe labor to make it one of the most desirable portions of our land what section is more healthful where is there more waterpower in what portion of any state can we find a larger amount and variety of mineral resources nature has scattered with liberal hand and most profusely too every means of wealth of power of sustaining a dense and thriving population and nothing but slavery has prevented these means from being used long ago the north star rochester may editorial correspondence since the recent anniversaries in new york i have been occupied in the lecturing field the interesting events transpiring at home and abroad makes this a most happy moment for from the platform the great principles of justice and human brotherhood against slavery at no time in the history of our rightcoo raovemont has there been a better opportunity to instruct and arouse the people to this subject than at this time a general desire to hear is everywhere manifested this general tide ought not to be lost abolitionists ought to improve it and use it efficiently for the destruction of slavery with all its hateful crimes john p hale is right in saying that the south is already agitated and that it is the north that needs to be stiired giddings palfrey and hale are stirring the south most effectually the recent speech of the former gentlen an in congress on the resolution inquiring into the facts relative to our disgraceful mob in the district of columbia must have stung burnt and blistered even the callous and obdurate slaveholders in that house it is truly a noble sign of the times when mr giddings can in the very teeth of southern men pronounce every man who enslaves his fellowman a manstealer and hurl defiance at any slave hohler or combination of slaveholders who may presume to fetter or limit his right of speech we look upon this speech as the noblest ever uttered on the floor of congress speeches there have been even during this session far above this in point of arrangement and rhetoric but none equalling this in boldness and power every word seems tocome warm from the heart as free and unrestrained as water from a gushing fountain it reads like the speech of a living man and it possesses a lifegiving power it was in vain for the slaveholders to warn him that his speech might make the slave unhappy in his chains that he was speaking within hearing of the slaves and that it might lead them to rebel against their masters he answered like a mana brave manand said though all the slaves in the universe should bear and be made dissatisfied with their chains he should yet speak out the sentiments of his heart on this subject warn the slaveholders that this roan giddings most be silenced er the district of columbia will become free there is no power on earth that caa support slavery where this man is allowed to speak as he has now done and has promised to persevere in doing and yet i hardly know how to advise them to stop him it will not do to censure him he will make it the occasion of setting the whole country in a blase of freedom with the power of his defence it wifi not do to expel him he wifi then go home but only to return with new strength and with s fresh baptism of antislavery fire nor wifi it do to kill him be would slay move by bis death than by his life i confess to my southern friends that i know not how to xdtiae them in their present unhappy predicament they are evidently in a bad fix and upon them devolves the responsibility of getting out iff it meanwhile i congratulate the slave poor toilworn and plundered bondmen ur op your heartsthe heel of the tyrant cannot much longer rest op your bearing bosom your deliverance diawetk nigh i meant to have said more about the anniversaries in tho feet number but was pres vented by my numerous public engagements i wish at thi time to call epccilmeaonlo  on resolution adopted by the american antislavery societj it ia this itaolved thai slavrholden m sfchcai have no rights they hare no rightful exist mar on autli tber were never created b god they emstittte no port of thw bulnai roar ihqr are of monstrous and mabolica io nod therefore no law an ooosutu tiim no compact no religion that endorse their humanity is to be obeyed or tolerated at the firm this startling resolution strud me unfavorably the great truth it contained and was designed to express i thought to h obscured by the ambiguity of its language maturer reflection on the subject has not oub removed this obstacle in the way of my adopting it but has led me to the eondosion that i is ooe of the dearest important and time words to which antislavery ever gareuttet aiice it dearly defines the position of tin slaveholder as a being that his forfeited al rights by annihilating all the rights of other theyhave no rightful existence on earth startling as this proposition may seem it i but the reiteration of god whoso atealel a man and selleth him or if be be found u his band be shall be surely put to death they were never created by god thi is simply saying that they are unknown ii the creation of god he made made man but never a manstealer the next affirmation is that they are of monstrous and diabol ica origin that is to say that they are ii the language of jesus of their father th devil the conclusion from these premise is irresistible no law constitution compact or religion that endorses their humanity ought to be obeyed or tolerated these propositions i regard as most important to be urged just now upon the peoph of the whole country while the ironheartec and brassbrowed calhoun with his train o merciless manstealers are with the utmos audacity standing up in the american senate and talking of the rights of slaveholders and there is in the north an everlasting prating about the rights of our southern brethren it is meet that the american antislavery society should confront them all with the bold and startling denial contained in this resol urion it is the right word for the times ll puts into language and force a truth which has lain dormant in the souls of many god made man with two hands two feet and ahead and no more and he who claims and possesses any more than these is devilmade and is a monster unknown to any law of god or nature and constitute no part of the human family they have forfeited all light to be numbered with that great family heis an outrage upon all law human and divine the laws if we must call them such that sustain him are monstrous and infernal and the religion that sustains him equally so itis important to keep this point before the whole country and especially before southern statesmen calhoun and foote bagby and davis should know that they are rapidly coming to be regarded and treated as man stealerschildren of the devil i have no doubt that the resolution will meet with opposition even in some quarters of the antislavery ranks but we only ask a calm consideration for it and i hrfve no fears for the result however much we may fail to seethe truth it contains the slaveholder will see and feel it on the first examination let it be discussed in every antislavery meeting and adopted and good will surely come of it among the numerous excellent resolutions adopted by the annual meeting was one one setting forth the right of slaves to escape and affirming the duty of abolitionists to help them and sanctioning the noble sayres and drayton in the act of aiding the seventyseven slaves who attempted to escape from slavery in the district of columbia these men have been stigmatised before the world as thievesrobberspirates manstealers th american antislavery society comes nobly up assumes voluntarily all the odium attaching to the act that has caused them to be stigmatized by those foul names deeming such reproach to be the highest honor that can be conferred upon them all these names have their right owners who shall one day have all the honor or disgrace that attaches to them the man who robs upon the high seas who gives his victim a chance to fight for bis life and property is a spotless saint compared with the mean and cowardly villain who wiq take the babe newly stamped with divinity in a state of helpless innocence and doom it to the chains of slavery such is every slaveholder in the united states during the past week i have visited new london connecticut and have given four lectures there the first meeting was but thinly attended and yet i was assured that no lecturer on slavery ever called out a larger and more respectable audience in that j laee it is by no means a grateful task to abolitionize connecticut as a state it will probably be the last to be reformed it piety has eaten oat its humanity the people seem to think themselves about as good as they can be and that it would be sinful for them to try to be any bettor than they now are slavery in their estimation is a sin which it is unrighteous to preach against this of course is a general statement of the case there are noble exceptions to this rule there are good men and women in this state and in new london but as as a mass this representation accords with their character it is absolutely bfoodehilling to witness the indifference with which the people listen to the thrilling wrongs of the slave and hear their own crimes and inconsistencies exposed you look in tain for emotion no tear of pity at the tale of woe no look of surprise mortification or shame at the enormities revealed no manly indignation is evinced al the recital of dastardly deeds but all is calm and still as though they were hearing a lecture on geology the two last meetings in new london were an exception to this description the audiences manifested a deeper interest in the subject than i had hitherto seen in any part of connecticut i think new london about the beat part in the state it borders on rhode island and may bo indebted to that feet for its superiority rhode island has given the right of suffrage to her colored citizens connecticut has denied that right and has shows herself in many other respects ttiforint in hex lost pious besides new london hare lectured m coventry east greenwich apponaug sod providence the meeting in this state have been vary satisfactory a

sides the harvest in the west v truly ready but the laborers are few wherever oar principles are fully made known they meet with many who readily subscribe tc them practical antislavery being that wftief the people desire and at once see the fore of an agent of the society is here tort much needed and i not being one have nc power to act for it my principal business being for the north star but there u scarcely a place where i stop and hold one meeting but there are loud calls to hold successivi meetings so eager are the people for th spread of antislavery truths tliere is ont favorable sign of the timesthe colored people are beginning to receive the moral suasion doctrine with much more favor thar formerly they have learned that opr war is noi against their rights but against america slavery and in favor of universal liberty am that while we readily concede the right tc vote even without disputing or quarrelling with our brethren either colored or white upon that point as such that we will indiscriminatingly strike down all and everything that may come in the way of emancipation and the elevation of our race be it politics false religion oterch or state government they are at once satisfied and willing to holdup our hands bidding us godspeed in oui laudable though arduous undertaking i find the females everywhere most readily subscribe to our doctrine and i can only account for this from the fact that they themselves are generally oppressed and deprived of their rights by the despotic acts of legislation and false judicature tuesday thl held a meeting last evening in rev mr boyingtonschurchon sixth street the house was filled with ihe most intelligent of both sexes and classesl mean white and colored on this evening i wa quite unwell and did not feel able to do justice to my subject though being before anew audience i made no apology they sal with the greatest attention for one hour the people showing evidence of a desire for my continuance when i ceased but having been promised the church for two evenings i made my discourso as short as possible on that occasion but found that i had been mistaken in my calculation about the church tbo trustees the rulers of the people disliking the positions taken in my lecture would not give their consent for the holding of another meeting there this is a fair representation of the antislavery senjiment in this community among our white fellowcitizens so long as we are conservative and timeserving we may get their churches bot a declaration of truth through the channel of liberal sentiments is certain to meet with religious execration this is the same church in which rcmond lectured when here some yeats ago hut at that time it was und jt the pastoral charge of rev mr blanchard who himself being of liberal sentiments and uncompromising in his coarse wielded an influence in the church even among the trustees that may not now be expected then the salvation of the church depended upon mr blanchard now it is fully established and independent of its clergyman though i know not how he felt towards the course pursue in the lecture wednesday evening the th i lectured in the true wesleyan church the house was full and we had as has been the eare with all the meetings i have held here an agreeable meeting so far as the people who some evidently eager and anxious to hear are concerned i hold another meeting on friday evening in sixth st methodist church the people here manifest great desire to bear testimony to antislavery truths snd tliere is nothing which prevents them from bearing but the closing of thechurebes against them it is true that there are many large and commodious public balls in the eity but to obtain one of these would be attended with an expense of from ten to twentyfive dollars a night an expense which we would not be justifiable in incurring this the churches know hence the power they wield in the irrosctiptive position they assume there is quite s urge population of colored residents in ciaeumati i suppose about among them there are many families of wealth and among the young people in particular there is much intelligence there are several young men here who have talents of the very highest order oratory and poetry being familiar themes in their literary course and many young women who would be an ornament to any society the intelligence of the more youthful of the children is particularly attractive many of them giving the premise of an intellect which if properly cultivated may beam forth in future with brilliancy the young men and women guneeally who are the most intelligent aad the best qualified are mainly indebted for their qualifications to their own exertions this is highly praiseworthy and eommends itself to every lover of the human family stid the young people as such especially the young men have not in general come up to that standard of doty which the three millions of american slaves and six hundred tb msand nominally free colored people of the mtftalaveboldiag states so loudly call for and imperatively demand tua young people i have said do not keep v with the spirit of the age though thaw ranch to commend among them the aged gimeraoy am the capitalists hot not haring had in their youth th advantages of tom cannot make such investment and eatet into such enterprises with their money as are necessary fbi the advancement of society i bis of coarse it um legitimate bufinme r and expected of their sons and daughters i now if their children manifest no such ircli  j nation but on the contrary appear indiff rent to the import and insensible of the advantages to bo derived from such a course of domestic enterprioe it is apparent that there is much cause for censure or reproof some years ago there were many youngs men and women who possessed a fine capital some of whom being the children of bonth p enters who moved by the impulses of nan tore brought them to this city bought property for them schooled them ami gave e ample means for a respectable lrehhood if b those young men and women who havutg  the qualifications and means had invested x their capital and embarked in different fnisi ness mich as confectionaries variety shop shoe stores dry goods and fancy millinery t establishments all of which are among the staple business of this place and which many of the young men and women could hate admirably succecdeti in which am sorry to say they did not do but rather wore disposed to live at ease upon what they hail forgetting the maxim that always taking out of the mealtub and putting nothiog in will soon come to the bottommuch might have been done by the young people of this city morn than what has been antislavery is but a beggarly element io this region and save a few exceptions in which our friends of the herald are included an eastern autirlavery man might well suppose himself to be in kentucky of course in this i except the colored residents who while they are all antislavery have not as yet given the subject aside from its political aspects any er much thought am pleased to see ue readiness with which the greater part admit the truthfulness of our position and subscribe to many of our views i and whilc many believe in the ballotbox as onoof the uwst effectual means of attaining the great end soughtthe overthrow of the infernal system of american slavery yet they do not hesitate to acknowledge that moral suasion is accomplishing practically what it j will take ages for politics to dothat is social equality it is a fact well worthy of remark that one of the most intelligent colored gen j tlemen observed to me that the antislavery j people of cincinnati and the colored people have no intercourse nor acquaintance only being hnought together on great or extraordinary occasions such as great meetings conventions lectures c when the colored people take no part among the whites they doing the whole business the colored looking on mi silence this truth is verified by the firrt that it is with the utmost difficulty that you can find a colored lady or gentlemen in this city who feel themselves at liberty to introduce you to an abolitionist they stand oif from them with as much deferential awe as charles to his lord and master the great einliojimint i administer this rebuke to the respectable colored residents of this eitv i because i am acquainted with tlum and love them and their worth much to see them thus duped or imposed upou by the mock antislavery of cincinnati ou will be pleased tojearn that i ha v o met with mary k miles late of boston the amiable and untiring fpend of the slave andi humanity who caine to this city some six months since to assist irr the high nohool ofr hiram gilmore and thus more effiet ually

of progress and reform as the reverend doctor cox and the new york evangelist all these have imagined or would have the world believe that they imagined that truth was with them alone and that all the rest of mankind were sunk in the deepest rror travelling to destruction headlong humility unparalleled poor simpleminded men how grievously they have been mistaken their creed such as it baa beensuch as it is was not is not one hairsbreadth nearer the truth inconsequence of their belief in it bishops laud and bonner and colleagues of the past and the present day have not been able with all their efforts open and insidious to stay the spread of heresy it has been an oft repeated but up to this time badly understood doctrine that it is utteily impossible to prevent the ultimate overthrow of error and the ultimate triumph of truth so that all the supporters of error may still say in the spirit and soma of them with the motive of the licforcmeniioned demetrius the temple of the great goddess diana is in danger great is diana of the ephesians the craft probably being uppermost in their minds while making the assertion the editor of the new york evangelist of last week in the fulness of his candor and generosity takes advantage of the publication of the massachusetts antislavery societys report to have a fling at what he is pleased to cal garrisonianism lie says after quoting some garbled statements of receipts and expenditure these items show how rapidly that party is waning and also show where the responsibility is of keeping up ihe whole system of disorganizing agitations of which it is the centre it rests ujon those who support the great annual fair at fancuil hall take thataway and it must die for want of food the new york evangelist notwithstanding this ebullition of hate against disorganizing agitations knows as every one else knows that the antislavery cause was never more hopeful or exhibited more vigorous signs of vitality than at the present time he may if he please lay the flattering unction to his toul that some such cause as that of which he speaks will stay the efforts of disorganizing agitators and thus save hypocritical professions of zeal for the cause of religion and humanity from merited ex insure and reproof in that however lie is most eggrcgiously mistaken their task is an arduous one requiring no ordinary degree of courage and resolution hut they will persevere to the end undaunted by difficulty undismayed by danger oklopiy or opjmisition the new york evangelist says further do not pretend to divine all the motives by which the wealthy and conservative citizens of boston are induced to extend so liberal a patronage to these fair perhaps many do it through inadvertencethey feel a little interest in the antislavery cause they wish to do a little for it and to do that little without having their names published and so they go to the fair as if that was helping the slave many doubtless uphold the fair tor political reasons because the party expend their chief bitterness against those who wish to cairy their antislavery principles thoroughly into politics and i believe that others feel an interest in the fair as a means of weakening the influence of religious institutions among us do not pretend to divine the motivs you had much better not it w ill be a mere waste of time for you to make the attempt pray can you ever divine the motives which lead any one to the performance of a praiseworthy act why then do you go on to di exactly what you say you will not do you make here three attempts to divine the motives which lead the citizens of boston t extend so liberal a patronage to these fairs but your divination is of the meanest am most unsatisfactory order your object apparently being to get as far from the truth at possible each attempt is of coutse more absurd and ludicrous more indecently falsi and irrational than the preceding througl inadvertence not wishing to have their namci published one supposition is as good ai another where all supposition is invalidates by fact that oue should go to a fair througl inadvertence is sufficiently strange ant unaccountable hut how or on what principli of why and because he should go there if order that his name should not be published is a problem at the solution of whicli even fuclid would stand aghast this is t new discovery in the science of opticsthai which is most visible is least seen al honor to the discoverer when oue wisha to avoid observation he must go where then are many of his friends and acquaintances probably this editor when he is desirous o moments of quiet and seclusion hides himsel in the centre of broadway they dont wan to have thetr names published and so the go to the fair names are generally un dirstood to be only the representatives o things people dont set a very high valu on the shadow when they can get the substance when they have the mao himself they duiit concern themselves much about hi nairn the common sense mode of judgin about these citizens of boston would be either that they went there without any ul tenor motive or because they approve of tb object and so they go to the fair bo there are many who go to the fair for pojiti cal reasons what these political reason are and buw they operate it is difficult t divine better a bad reason than noneor according to the irish rendering of the proverb better bad luck than no luck at all ttc editor must certainly have had this idot in lus head when he found uus motive fu going to the fair because says he the party expend their chief bitlcrnesi against tli who wish to carry their anti misery principles thoroughly into practice san weller could set through a brick wall ant a deal door and the wiadinga of the staircase

naeh better bare come to this at none aa in it all the fist of his argument and ao the malice of his spleen are cooerotratod it is the fhir a meaoa of weakening the influence of religious institutions among us in the language of the ephesian demetrius religious institutions meant the great goddess diana and her silver shrines in tbs language of persecuting popes cardinals and bishops it has king been understood to mean bigotry superstition intolerance priestcraft and the wealth and power and influence which their position as popes and cardinals and bishops conferred upon them in the language of the new york evangelist mar not religious institutions be understood to mean something analogous to these there is standing in society at stake there is orthodoxy at stake and the hypocritical professions of superior sanctity and seal for religion are in danger of being made manifest for garrison and his colleagues under the influence of considerations of truth justice and decency will not suffer your hollow mock cryyour pretended sympathy with suffering humanity to stalk on uiiblushiugly and without exposure verily this entire effusion is a pitiful conglomeration both melancholy and ridiculous it reminds one altogether too forcibly of falstafts estimate of hi ragged regiment food for powderfood for powder they will stop a shot as well as the best j d the bright side it is cheering to the traveller as he trudges along the road to be reminded by consecutive landmarks that he is gradually making pto gress in the right direction although the end of his journey may still be far distant it is cheering to the sailor as he navigates the vast and trackless ocean to fiud that his longitude daily increases and that he may reasonably expect in due season to reach the desired haven it is clieering to the man who has an object in view and is laboring to accomplish that object to learn from incontrovertible signs that his labors are not in vain and even a very small gleam of light and encouragement will sene to illumine his path and send him on his way rejoicing the friends of humanity and of the slave must rejoice in every indication however faint that seems to loint m the direction of freedom and justice tne following is one of these indications taken from the new york evening post itis an extract from a letter of a southern correspondent would that the signs of progress of which the writer makes mention were more decided and unequivocal but we must be thankful for such favors as we can get from that quarter within the last three yearswithin the last year indeeda most remarkable change has spread over or rather under the south on the subject of slavery i know several men high in office in slave states who openly condemn the system of slaverysome such are members of legislatures others hold high aphintinents of a judicial character the tremendous moral force of progress elsewhere has among other tilings led to this the washington era and the louisville examiner have numerous readers in these states why tlie inrc fact that southerners suliscribe for such prints call for them at the post office and have them lying open on their tables isa long stride over the prejudices of a few seasons since nor is the tune distant when a powerful force in the southern local press will turn the logic and speculation at its command to discussions of the best means for removing the evil of slavery the time being past to discuss the point whether it be an evil and one which every consideiatkm of profit i as well as right impels the american people to prevent spreading any more there are several papers at the south which are even i now on the eve of taking this stand papers i which see nothing to dread in that terrible wilmot proviso that capital will be sought for out of abusing such a course by base and pandering politicians is very likely at first but though the first plunge of a cold bath makes one wince the effect is none the less salutary and thus it will be with those of the southern editors who form what you will seethe vanguard of antislavery in the south itself among the difficulties you radicals at the north may have to annoy you let the least of your thoughts be giveu to any obstacles from the pt opk of the south for such obstacles you will never see thousands ol hearts imbued with freedom and patriotism watch you from the slave states with earnest prayers for your success in putting a bar tc the territories w here human bondage is established by law thousands will hail youi j triumph as the triumph of the real interests jof the future generations of the south foi years the sons of virginia the carolinas and other slave states have seen themselves outstripped in wealth power and enterprise j by the north and now see the same superiority increasing at the west they know the reason they will soon begin to think ol applying the remedy it is exceedingly difficult to plioe muck confidence in these prediction still thej point to the fact which will not now be die puted that the freemen of the south art beginning to discover that slavery has beer working against their interests and tha they can never

albany journal describing the scene at the railroad depot i mentioned the fact that yon being present greeted the baltimore slavedealet by extending to him the hand of friendship while he was actually employed inone of the most revolting crimes that ever disgraced humanity lam unaware that that statement or any other part of the letter contained any slur upon the church with which you are connected unless a discredit may be reflect od upon it by the circumstance that it contains within its bosom those who uphold by influence of position the abomination of slavery it temains to be seen sir whether the course you pursued at the cars could by fair inference be supposed to encourage slavery and slavedealers in your address to me through the columns of the union you say distinctly shook hands with mr and that you would do so with any one the accuracy of my description of other parts of thedrama you do not in the least deny you do not say that the tears were not falling from the eyes of separated husbands and wivesparents and children you do not deny that the scene was revolting to a feeling heart yet in the midst of this revolting spectacle you strike hands with the prime acor you are so little aifecled by the brutal business that you can calmly tecognize and shake bands with the dealer now sir ask you if from these circumstances which you do not deny and those which you distinctly admit an honest inference might not be drawn that you justify slavery let us see upon this point you say you went into the care to see henry a member of your church it is true that while one of henrys hands was heavily ironed to that pf a fellow victim you shook the other and passed the ordiuary salutation with him when he was about starting to a land of torture and early death to that hades of tills nationyou had not a word of consolation no word of hope for this tender lamb of your flock but you did enter into conversation with his tormentor with hun you talked freely and smiled in the pies j ence of those victims amid a scene that should have pierced with pain and horror the hardest heart what must have been heurys emo j tions when he saw that hand from which he had received the emblems of christs body i and blood now extended to greet the wretch who was consigning him to a premalure grave by this act expressing not censure but encouragement did you not justify the trade in human beings did yo i not assume i the moral resionsibility of the slavedealer can you give countenance to one engaged ina crime w ithout partaking of liis criminality would you grasp the red right haud of the assassin w ouid you reach forth your hand in amity to one that holds the torch of incendiarism would the communitywould  your own consciencehold you guiltless of i the blow that pierced the victim or of the act j that fired the dwelling you cannot give aid and countenance to a man engaged in crime without assuming ins moral responsibility j yes while a person is engaged in what i your chuich esteems to be a crimewhile heis doing an act which you should utterly and unequivocally condemn you meet him shake hands with him converse in a smiling manner utter no reproof or warning and ask you if the inference is not fairly drawn justify his deed of baseness and crime if this inference expressed plainly as first with the j circumstances that gave birth to it as correctly as i could then ascertain them seems to you to be an unkind slur upon your church beg to assure you that you wrongly interpret my meauing the reference has reference solely to yourself and loses its weight when extended to others if you believe that the reputation of your church will sutler when it is known that one of its ministers encourages traffic in the bodies and souls of men you will also see tht the responsibility rests with you and not with mei have thus far through life entertained ahigh opinion of the doctrines of the methodist church as well as the general character of its members did not mention the facts alluded to for the purpose of casting odium upon that body of christians neither christ nor bis real followers were disgraced by the conduct of judas nor did christ teach us to cover up the sins of hypocrisy on the contrary he himself was the first to proclaim the wickedness of his unworthy follower in my letter i desired to inform my readers that professing christians not only bold slaves but sell them and that a professed christian minister gave the hand of friendship to a slavedeafer engaged m the actual perpetration of outrages at which humanity shudders but i have since made full inquiry as to slaters relation to the methodist church i find that his connections generally are of that faith i that he himself contributes to the support of that denomination from the treasure acquired in the traffic of human flesh that he owns a permanent pew ia a methodist church ia baltimore and that his wife and daughter are members but that he is not actually a cotn i muiucant with these facts i presume you i must have been familiar and when you took i him by the hand and east your eye over the i victims around him you must bare been conscious that a portion of the treasure for which the bones and muscle the blood and sinews ol those moth and babes that were to be sold would go to sustain the church and attuistry to which you belong i you intimate that such

out of my way raised a good hickory cane that held in my hand but was immediately pulled aside by a gentleman who accompanied me and who boards in our mesa he begged of me to leave as some few of the

it matters little in what aspect we view the mighty influences these heroines centuries past exerted over the destinies of men and empires on either hand we see their fearful power in it we recognize those remarkable traits often strikingly exhibited in the female character which commend them to us as objects worthy our profound regard and deep solicitude which furnishes evidence that rather militates against the somewhat accredited doctrine that man is the lord of creation and evidence that the term man when used in this connection is to be taken in its generic sense and evidence too that in thisuniversal administration neither one could with propriety say to the other i have no need of thee if then the deduction drawn be true and is that it would be hazardous to annihilate from the face of the earth either species of the human family the conclusion follows that the relations between the two are and must be of a deeply interesting character that these relations should be fostered with the greatest care the interests of each should ever be regarded as the mutual interest of both that as they are concomitants of the physical world only moving in different spheres and are each by their immortality equally allied to the spiritual existence the ir physical being should be nurtured educated exercised differing only as to the orbits in which they move while their spiritual being should he equally subject to and receive the same discipline then away with the idea that after man woman was created to pander to his wants his passions appetite and lust woman was

letters she soon attains tt literary distinction does she crav her minstrelsy the museat her bidding adds numbers to her song by her frequent investigations of developments ir solid soience she soon merits more solemn praise if like man she i subject to passion while the fortnci feels but little compunction of conscience for his crime she like althea kills herself in grief patient enduring she is scarcely less irresistible that man in the accomplishment of anv object that she possesses a large share of mans affections in every age ol the world is now too well under j stood to require further argumentative support the heathen idolator having but afaint idea of the christians goddeifies the object of his youthful passion hei spirit having flown to the spirit land fruitful in his imagination as to the transit of the cherished object of hia devotions and subject to wild vagaries the fruitful progeny of ignorance he thinks he discovers in the starry panoply a new constellation it is the lonely star of his idolatry it is to him the spirit of his love beckoning him hence to join her in her celestial residence and if he does not at once with the hand of desperation give exit to his life he sacrifices to the object of his deification with a devotedness that should put to shame the faint adoration of the christian worshipper if then tis thus that by the heathena people with whom virtue and chastity possess no charm and speak a language unheard by the savage ear woman is regarded what a rising greatness awaits her when a knowledge of the arts and sciences and refinement shall supersede ignorance and barbarism when fanaticism superstition and bigotry shall give place to the peaceful elevating influences of christianity by nature she is fittted to occupy a position as elevated and dignified as her selfcreated master and though she is often treated by him as his drudge or a convenient piece of household furniture tis but a striking evidence of his mental imbecility

like man others of the sann kind mr thomason a missionary ban lately told in a public meeting held oi the subject of slavery a young physician of much meril and knowledge made a journey aon his native town in one of the northers states to a town in mississippi this young man whose name was wallis took lodgings in a furnished house the mistress of it a young warn as about twenty years old inspired in hia the most ardent love although th color of the young woman was not othe purest white the doctor having n prejudice against the colored race offered her his hand which was accepted the marriage took place almost secretly and the happy couple went soon afterwards to establish themselves in washington in the district of colum bia they had not been there long where they lived peaceably and retired when one morning an invidual who had the appearance of a gentleman presented himself at dr walliss under the pretence of business the conversation proceeded when the stranger addressed the following indiscreet question tc the doctor did you bring a woman with you from the south sir no sir i do not understand you how rejoined the stranger did not your wife come with you from mis sissippi i believe she was born in that country said the doctor well your wife as you call her is piy slave and unless you pay me immediately nine hundred dollars for her purchase i will tomorrow advertise her as a runaway slave in fact she is worth a thousand dollars at least but as you have married her will abate something your slave exclaimed the astonished doctor that is impossible whether you believe me or not cried the ether you must give her up or pay the money if in twentyfour hours the money is not sent to my hotel i promise you my dear sir that you will see the name of mrs wallis in the newspapers as that of a fugitive slave as soon as the man was gone the loctor went to his wife whose good ualitics virtues and graces rendered ler so dear to him my dear angel said he when ive were married were you a slave yes i was she confessed at the same time shedding abundant tears why did you not tell me before the ceremony was performed i did not dare do it could i have expected you would ally yourself to e slaver well now i know it i will give the nine hundred dollars required foi i love you too much to consent to a separation during this short dialogue mrs wallis was laboring under the most lively agitation she asked her husband to describe the appearance of the claimant which he did as exactly as possible then he asked her whether the description answered to that of her ancient master yes said she casting down her eyes he is more than my master heis iny father theodore d weld mr stanton while on his way tc washington called on that remarkable man and thus writes in the emanci pator i spent half a day with theodori d weld he is living somewhat retired on his farm at belleville new jersey about ten miles from this city though his views of some subject have materially changed from what they were when in years gone by his helmet shone conspicuous in the thickest of the fray he is still an observant spectator of the great conflict and in my judgment certainly in my hope the time is not far distant when he will again mingle in humanitys battle would it not bo a gallant sight to sec the early champion of the antislavery enterprise once more with shield and buckler and lance in rest taking the field how his clear and courageous voice soundiug to the charge used tc send the lifeblood of freedom galloping through the veins of the consecrated host what compactness of argu mentwhat keenness of analysis what fertility of illustration what splendor of imaginationwhat fervor of appealwhat mastery of the vast outlines and of the minute details of question used to mark his efforts with tongue and pen and though he is now in retirement and may never strike another blow for the cause and may sink into his grave years hence almost forgotten yet who shall complain

little mischievous by liquor came sailing down and when opposite the old woman saucily puhd her aside and with a pan of his hand knocked the pipe out of her mouth he than halted to hear her fret at his trick and enjoy a laugh at her expense but what was his astonishment when she meekly picked up the pieces of her broken pipe witkout the least resentment in tier manner and giving him a dignified look of mingled sorrow kindness and pity said god forgive you my son as l dolt touched a tender chord in the heart of the rude tar he felt ashamed condemned and repentant the tear started in his eyehe

tins paris printers about the middle of september tbe t l journeyman printers of peris made the i usual arrangements to celebrate their annual dinner for several years not the slightest opposition bad

no fear was felt for the result but with the idea which now actuated the prefect of police guided as he was by the cabinet legality wan of little moment scarcely had the printers reassembled at the locale which had been generously placed at their disposal era some hundreds of soldier municipal guards and s commissary of police presented themselves anew entered the printers house and forcibly dispersed the assembly which however as a last resort scattered itself in knots of ten and fifteen in the neighbouring estaminets restaurateurs and wineshops here however again the indefatigable police appeared and summoned the proprietors to turn them out this insolent outrage excited little notice at the time but that it waa not without effect may be surmised from the fact that every journeyman printer in paris turned out against the government during the three days ol february st johns revolution in the fate or the investor or the guillotine his retreat was so profound that it
