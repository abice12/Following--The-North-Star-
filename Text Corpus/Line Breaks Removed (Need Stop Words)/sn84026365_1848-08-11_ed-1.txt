their little accounts sewing being the principal object of at tention the teachers say it will not do to educate them you unlit them i for servants we grant that wo i mans intellect is feeble because

res dutions were now adopted with but two or three dissenting voices resolved that we petition our state legislature for our right to the elective franchise every year until our prayei be granted resolved that it is an admitted principle of the american republic that the only just power of government is derived ir in the consent of the governed and that taxation and representation are inseparable and woman be ingtaxcdequally with man therefore she ought not to be deprived of an equal representation in the government resolved that we greatly deplore the apathy and indifference of woman in regard to her rights it restricts bet to the occupancy of an interior religious political and domestic station ir society and we wish to inspire hei with a desire to stand on an equal basis

medical lectures at geneva and ha now gone t europe to graduate as a physician we seea harbinger of a day when woman shall stajid forth edeem ed and disenthralled and perforit those important dunes which are sc truly within hoi sphere whereas the husband has the legal right to litre out his wife to service collect her w ages and appropriate them to his exclusive nr independent benefit and whereas this ha contributed to establish that hideous custom the promise of obedience in themarriage contract effectually though insidiously reducing her almost to the condition ola slave whatever freedom she may have being granted her as a privilege not as a right therefore resolved that we will seek the overthrow of toe barbarous and unrighteous law and encourage woman no longer to promise obedience in the marriage con tract resolved that the universal doctrine of the inferiority of w man has ever caused her to distrust her own powers and paralyzed her energies and placed her in that diffident position which requires the most strenuous and unremit ing efforts to overcome but which will he effected by faithful perseverance in the practical exei cie ol those talents so long wi i

valuable hints on the duties of wives to their lords pointing out the modes in which they were to secure in the husband the chivalric devotion which had characterized the lover the most infallible

characterizes those situated like i myself for if theres anything in which i thine li in anangng all my frien affairs not having of uiy own domestic cares it has often recurred to me therefore that it was rather singular that all this good advice should always come froiii one side how it is that there are so few guideposts to point the way to innocent young gehtlenien whohave recently submitted their neck to the noose and the halter why is it not ofiener insisted upon that the husband should always return to his fireside with a smile and endeavor to soothe the perturbed spirit that has for hours been subjected to the thousand annoyances of the nursery and the kitchen there is many an unfortunate mrs rogers among my acquaintance with nine small children and one at the breast who need all the soothing tenderness erst bestowed by the lover to enable them to forget the troubles so wearing to the nerves by the way it has sometimes occurred to me whether it was not mrs rogers who was the

husband goes frth to the workshop his counter bis countinghouse or his office greets pleasantly his acquaintances by the way and passes the day among the evervarying scenes of evcryday business life the wife meanwhile amid incessant clamor must renew the treadmill task of yesterdaymust wash the same faces make the same bedssweep the same rooms must give directions for the succeeding meals and perhaps assist in preparing them must settle disputes in the kitchen and quarrels among the nine fallen little sons and daughters of htr jldon i stid amid all occupations must find occasional moments

tar isa spectacle not only stiaoge hot inexpressibly touching there is a man in that capital of friv olify and revolutions who has within the compass of a lew weeks expert tnced all the perils and vicissitudes of i statesmanship yesterday he was revert need almost to idolatry today ho is shunned as if the touch of his hand or the sound of his voice were contam i inatingyesterday he was the glory of the republic to day he is the victim who is this man he is the poet j whose sul was intoxicated with the i beauty of freedom and from whose lips cme those words of eloquence which only a day or two back thrilled through the beau of christendom every citizen of trance felt ui sincerity of this towa enthusiasmit was attested indeed hyfthe purity the j consistency and the dignity of a wholfe life and it is again this man under whose nostrils to use an expression lately uttered by the hentaine she had recently burned the last grain of her incenseit is against this man that the slanders of all parties in the republic are now directed ns by a species of unanimity it is upon his head that the jealousies of alllegitimists commun j bonapailists the carriers the i bourgeoiae and the aristocrats are be mg poured out today like asheg it j against him that the obloquies of the j parisians are being thrown unstinting i if to afford to future historans a new and unparalleled example of the mutft j bility of political fortunes of the vicissitudes of popularity and the fickleness of the people but there is doubtless reason for this sudden charge in the opinions of french citizens oh yes there ars reasons when it was said after the first insurrection that lsinrtine had conspired with the insurgents of the th of may lamartine himself answered that accusation from the tribune of the national assembly he saidev erybody remembers it yes i have conspired with those menl have conspired with them as the lightning con doctor conspires with the thundercloud the metaphor was splendid and has been verified by events the lightning conductor of the revolution otherwise the fame of lamartine has been melted warped literally blasted by carrying off the terrible electricity of the conspiracies to shield france from peril the poet statesman called down upon his head the lightnioga of terrorism lamartine has secured the salvation of the republic but only by the sacrifice of his immense and magnificent popularity as has been nobly said already of this great man by ona speaking from the opposite side of the channel m de lamartine was no actuated by ambition but was a patriot to the extent of selfsacrifice he consented with his eyes open to pulvarix his name in order that be might preserve the national assembly thai is the explanation of this otherwise inexplicable problemthat is the solution ot the enigma of the downfall of the executive commissionthat is the clue which can alone guide our reason thro the labannth ol these tgtraordinery and bewildering occurrence hubert there have been only whispering td inaendoea ia deprecation of laamrttoes character and in s musi on i these tame whispers sad louendoes he has himself thus written to the conatuß

wednesday thursday and friday th th and th of august commencing at amlet a full representation of the slaves friends come up on this occasion from all parts of the great world the political leaders are marshalling their hosts for a conflict their followers are rallying by hundreds of thousands to the support of their party banner time and money and labor are expended to secure their object and shall the friends of freedom whose faith should be strong in the power of truth be lukewarm and indifferent while politicians are so earnest in their labors so untiring in their zeal the events of the past year should encourage us to renewed e libra for every movement of importance which has been made having any bearing upon the question of slavery foreshadows the destruction of the system and the oppressors feel that it is so the political parties will make a desperate effort to save themselves from the destruction their corruption has brought upon them and the efforts of the abolitionists to maintain and enforce the right should lie proportionably great arrangements should be made at the coming meeting to continue the antislavery agitation by the lips of the living speaker and to extend more widely the circulation of the so cietys paperthe antislavery bugle let none of the friends who can be there absent themselves for any light cause for the presence of all and the couesel of all is

we are happy to be able to state that we learn that the colored ladies of cincinnati and columbus ohio are about entering into some measures preparatory to the holding of annual anti slavery fairs ot bazaars the proceeds of which will be appropriated to the north star similar to those yearly held in boston for the support of the antislavery cause particularly the sustenance of the liberator and antislavery standard a friend recently wrote to us inquiring what proportion ox how much of the proceeds of the great annual bazaars go to the support of the north star we now for the information of that much interested friend answer that and ail other inquiries we wish it to be distinctly understood that there ia no part whatever of the pioceeds of these fairs or bazaars goes to the support of the north star ol this we do not complain for the best of reasons those fairs were got up by the antislavery ladies w ho sympathize with the doctrines of the american antislavery society the principles advocated by the liberator and standard long before the existence of the star which papers are the organs ot that society and although we are members of the society our paper is eotirely independent of it end we control hence although an antislavery paper sympathizing with the american antislavery society did ever we receive anything from the proceeds of those f airs it would come as a favor and not aright t is by this means those excellent papers are sustained we do not look up to the ladies of the american antislavery society but should we desire assistance from any such source will be mainly to the colond antislavery ladies we shall look fnr such assistance for this end we wunld suggest the formation of societies in different cities to be known aa societies for the moral elevation of the colored people tiie ladies of whom shall hold annual bazaars si radar to those held in boston for this s great degiee of industry is necessary the ladies must bold their weekly

sixtysixtl year in his early career and during th stormy times of the first french revolution he was thrown into active life and in che was placed in command of an austrian army and became extremely popular when relcasej from military duties however he preferred living the si npje life of a mountaineer in the sty nan hills to a residence in the capital bat veil in the campaigns of  frnd but when

being held for eleven years as a slave in the land of cuba and rescued from slavery by general rb campbell the american consul at havana on thursday last arrived at thia porta a passenger from havana in the bark rapid a colored man named john i lytle a native of philadelphia who returns to his country after an absence of twelve or fourteen yearsaril hin which period his history has been a singular and interesting one some short time ago a gentleman o this city while travelling in the island of cuba stopped at the ingenio a sugar estate of a wealthy planter named don gaepar hernandez about twenty miles from matanzas while examining the machinery of the sugarworks he was addressed in english by one of the apparent slaves employed j about them and the result of a guarded conversation that ensued was to inform him that the slave was in truth a free american citizen wrong folly held in slavery his story was this he had been shipwrecked many years before on the coast of africa hi the shii jupiter employed in the service of the colonization society with the rest ol the crew he had made his way along the coast for about miles to the slave station at gallivas where he was well received by the proprietor don pancho ramon who promised him passage in the first vessel to cuba from which island it would be easy to reach the united states the slave cargo which he thus accompanied being duly landed in the neighborhood of matanzas lytle was cooped with the rest of his color in the barracoons and soon found himself at work as a slave on the estate where he was thus found by astray wayfarer from his own country he had made more than one unsuccessful attempt for his freedom and had at this time given up tlie thought of it in despair conscious that secrecy was the first condition of success in any attempt to procure his liberation in that couutry where he soon would have disappeared irrecoverably and without trace the gentleman thus providentially made acquainted with his situation abstained from giving him any other hope than a general remark that he would not forget him the result of the matter was that after farther inquiries had becu made the case was laid before the secretary of state who fully entered into it and readily responded to the call made upon him to demand the liberation of the man and to urge it if necessary with all the energy of the government and xation on the same grounds as though its subject had been the highest in the land instead of a poor and oppressed negro our popular and excellent consul at havana gen rb campbell of south carolina also entered into the spirit of the instructions which he received from the state department with his characteristic zealand ability great caution and prudence were required the danger being that no such slave would be found on inquiry if a suspicion of the object in view should have p eceded the effective action of which its attainment was to he secured the upshot of the whole has been the arrival of the man as a freeman at this port ns above slated with a sum of money of as his wanes during the li years of his servitude with interest besides his expenses home gen campbells conduct of this matter is entitled to all praise the moie so that he is a south carolinian and not a northern barnburner the letter in which he announces the result of his efforts is so creditable to him that we have asked permission of the gentleman to whom it was addressed to publish the following extracts from it on the th day of june i received certain instructions from the secretary of state accompanied with a letter from you to him in relation to the free negro john l lytle in the possession of caspar hernandez i have this day july th received the negro and shall tomorrow dispatch him to the united states under the charge of mv son lucius campbell to be delivered over to the secretary as a freemanwith  as his own property after expenses of small outfit passage care paid i thank you for refer ring the secretary to me as a suitable person to accomplish your object and secure to the negro those just rights which have been so long and cruelly withheld from him it has cost me some trouble time rmney and odium also with a certain class but these are all trifles in comparison with the victory achieved the rights asserted wrongs redressed and the happiness i hope conferred on an unfortunate man who had so unjustly been made the creature of anothers will and the degraded victim of the taskmaster for although not an abolitionist i feel as strongly for the kidnapped black as for the oppressed of another color you are aware my dear sir that my proofs were deficient and that the courts here have already decided that i the possession of a slave is satisfactory j evidence of the right and justice of  jmssession unless the negative is proved under these circumstances deemed it advisable to secure certainly the liberty of the negro under the most advantageous compromise possible andi flatter tnyself that the compromise made will meet your approbation the records of the state department i am t ld will show that john was claimed in tacons administration but the best terms that could be made was the freedom of the negro upon amg the amount of the purchase n ney in this instance and with megen roneaii has behaved with great propriety another letter from an american gentleman in havana received at the same time thus testifies to the merits of gen campbells skilful and efficient proceedings in the matter gen campbell has been exerting himself strenuously in favor of a colored american citizen named lytle and l think he has succeed dnr ably x should be much gratified that you should lend him vur truthful testimony among such of your friend as imagint it very cejr lo aoefaio and aarvy forth their principles no matter on what sod or amid what people aod institutional a timely compromise has done away with tfit chance of dangerous measure on the individual for the removal of proof of the act the captain general bae lent a ready cooperation in this case and again l think j that the consul deserves much credit for his agency reaeosable wages with interest and expense homeward are quite favorable terms especially when you learn what gen tacon answered on n previous examination of the earns case during bis government also i think at the request of eome american agent it was to the purport that the man should obtain bis ransom by paying for it gen campbells hospitable kindness to all bis countrymen arriving in havana and satisfactory performance of the duties of hit office have long made him eminently popular as our consul at havana as be had formerly been in washington in his former capacity asa member of congress from south carolina whatever may be the chances and changes of parties it is tobe hoped that such an officer may long be allowed to serve the country in the poet which he both graces and liunors two curious circumstances as we understand have occurred in the history of his case the first is that when hernandez at first learned the man tobe an american and not an african he required the slave merchant martinez to take him hack but the difficulty of the defective title was got overby reducing the price to a quarter of the sum first agreed upon showing that the precious pair of bargainers in free flesh and blood perfectly understood what they were about the dealer on the african coast don pancho ramon had anted fairly by the men and given him a letter to the house in havana explaining his true character the damages which have been now paid to lytle have been we understand contributed equally by the two the other circumstance is that at the time of his being landed and taken to the barracoon lytlesent a letter to the american consul then at matanzas named shoemaker according to h s recollection and had an interview with him in which he claimed protection the functionary was on the point of sailing for the united states and replied by telling him to go and renwin quietly at the estate of hernandez fora month or two and he would see about his case lytle never heard farther from or of him and twice when he made his way to the consulate at mat nnzas he was told by the person iiii charge that there was no record of the case on the hooks of the officenow we know nothing of the manner in which the aforesaid consulate of matanzas has been filled through this period but we commend these statements of the rescued free slave to the attention of those who may tiie auction slavery l am happy gentlemen to he able once more to offer the presidency of these united states with nil its patronage for the next term of four years to the lowest bidder aod as we met at the south do things in a summary manner i shall receive but one bid from each individual who bids liberty john p hale slavery understand megentlemen i said the lowest bidder give us a bid league gerrit smith slavery do not trifle gentlemen i feel the importance of the occasion this is probably the last time in which i shall have it in my power to make such an olfer i find that my health is declining and ere another four
