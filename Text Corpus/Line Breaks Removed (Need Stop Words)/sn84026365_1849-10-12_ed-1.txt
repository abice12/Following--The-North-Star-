that vote must be given with a will that shall send it like a bullet through the very vitals of slavery cheers our difficulty has been not so much to find men holding our doc trines as to find those who could stick to them in all weather several rounds of applause the taylor men and the cass men both hold to our doctrines but both pause and tremble before a pledge of their fulfilment cheers vou yourselves in worcester have furnished the most striking instance of devotion to freedom and defection from it in a man who sullied the glories ot alife in an hour and took upon himself the voke he taught you to spurn cheers thank heaven the spirit that buoyed him up when his eye was sunward still lives and treads unawed the path he trod b fore he lost his principles and changed his constituency great enthusiasm his punishment was severe but it w as just applause and i tell those men who betrayed us at baltimore and philadelphia their doom too is sealed hear hear it is true their surpassing eloquence planted in our youthful breasts the principles we hold so dearthat they nourished those principles there until thev became the intensest convictions of our youthful livesit is true they hive

whether there is not aman among the eight hundred thousand nonslaveholding voters of the south fit to hold office as well as among the slaveholders if we can get a nonslaveholder in the union we will not take a slaveholder how shall we achieve these things we shall do it by calling together such large hearted conventions as thiswe will do it by going out on the hills of massachusetts and speaking gods truth to honest menspeaking tht truth manfully with a proper regard to the feelings of our candid opponents but coming down like the hammer of thor upon those free soil men who will agree with us by our firesides that slavery is a curse but who will go among the slaveholders and attempt to show by their bibles that the institution is of divine origin thus attempting to involve the author of all good in their own criminal inconsistency aye the great god who thundered from sinai opposition to all oppressionwho suspended the laws of nature for the sake of delivering an oppressed people who smote with death in one night two and a half millions of the first born of fifteen millions of egyptianswho dealt out thunder and hail and darkness against the oppressor who made the nile run blood all day long purpling the great mediterranean for thirty mileswho sent plagues to persecute a whole nation and all to show his abhorrence of a servitude which compared with american slavery is as

carolina and prove him one by the record applause if a slaveholder shall come herehis pockets a blacksmiths shop and himself a miniature arsenal and in undertaking to visit our new england manchester shall find in the cars a person with a black akm and if he do not choose to ride in the same car with him let him walk to lowell on foot if becalls our lowell girls slaves as some slaveholders have falsely styled them let him tell it openly it he dare to them and we can safely leave his punishment to their indignant tongues and flashing eyes if a slaveholder comes to you and says introduce me to your wives and daughters say no say a than who sells wives and daughters shall not be intrusted with the honor of our homes sensation say to him i will not introduce yeu among my little ones lest you may instil into thair youthful minds sentiments born of the bottomless pit good i we will do here as the celebrated irish oconnell did in the streets of londonrefuss to shake their slave stained hands a slaveholder can hardly be shaken by the hand among the better classes in england we will make the same sentiments prevail here a word more and lam done goon go on why we let loose the vials of our wrath upon a person for selling rum but his business is saiutly compared with slaveholding a rum seller makes a man a slave of his own free will but the slaveholder does it by force shuts him out forever from the sweet cheering voice of father mathew who may wish to raise him from his debased condition true you that can beard the rumseller who is weak go brave the slaveholder who stands behind and looms above him i invoke the assistance of my youthful brothers in this holy crusade the victory must come if it come at all from your fiery hearts for men in middle life are engrossed in the pursuits of business and tremblingly hug the shores the more advanced send down their anchors of hope and turn reverently to the past but youth with eagle eye and lion heart looks forward and upwardcourting the uncertainties of the future defiant of its dangers applause we have tha young men thm by the necessity of their natures yes thanking you gentlemen and mr president with all my heart for the kind manner in which you have listened to the few desultory remarks i have made i will give way and allow you to call to the stand some person more capable of doing justice to the great cause we have in hand cheers and applause proslav fry theology slaveholders and their defenders having been supplied at the hand of northern clergymen with biblical protections for their system and sanctions for their crime are daily growing more devout and constant in their appeal to the bible more sanctimonious in their pious twang about the dealings of providence and the authority of moses and the apostles and more bold and shameless in charging upon god the authorship and patronage of slavery the extract below from an influential southern journal will give an idea of this growth in grace and at the same time a portrait of the popular religion of the south which we foster and cherish by church fellowship and ministerial intercourse the following is an extract from an essay on the evils of abolitionism and the glories of slavery by a correspondent of the augusta ga rtpttblu the writer should be hunted up and the title of d d conferred on him by some one of our northern theological schools he is ahead of dr rice and dr junkin when we last heard from them with regard to the patriarchal institution but there a no telling how far they may have progressed in proslavery theology since isis we invite any who are not blind to madness to look into the holy wise and merciful work of the beneficent i creator and in defending the character of the christians god as the auihor of southern slavery we only ask thst its history may be traced goback then into the wilds of africa and see two of her savage tribes engaged in the din of deadly battle theone and perhaps not the aggressor proves victorious in the conflict and now the broodiog spirit of the god ol mercy says to the conquering party do not butcher your captives though they may have unjustly assailed you and if conquriog might jhnve put you te i death and paved their yards with yout skulls as many savage tribes of youi country do with their captured enemies but do you act upon the principle ol mercy and benevolence make ilei your servantstun them nte your moneymad then they will be arete ful to von and you will love and project them the divine influence prevailed over their savage minds um poor captives destined to destruction were spared by their conquer nd became their hied aod submissive slaves but to go badk to the caae ro corded in the ninth of genesis when übmxi hit ca rochester n y friday october i whom hams descendants ate subjected to the prophet arose had committed a most atrocious offence el some kind was it not wondrous mercy in god instead of the decapitation ol ham to simply punish him in cantui the first son perhaps born to him aftai l the offence by flattening his band kinking his hair and blackening bis akin and turning him loose with ku mind in chains to be a servant of mp vants to his brethren thus giving him time and opportunity for repentance upon the same principle that the nan englanders confine their free negroes in their penitentiary instead of haqf  them for corns nsv is the wtsdetfl mercy of god less marked with infinite benevolence in allowing thesa captive sons of canaan to be trana ported from bondage in their own land of degradation and darkness to our country while their enlightenment and religious opportunitias would not only elevate thir civil character but secure to them gospel privileges through which thousands of them have rejoiced in past ages and thousands will rejoien in redeeming mercy in every generation down to the judgment trump at the sound of which we are told thsf every bondman and every freeman together with men of every rank and society found in impenitency will say to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall he able to stand i but putting the institution upon the footing that many of the forefathers of our slaves were kidnapped though the avaricious dark hearted thieves meant it for evil god meant it for good and while he holds those avaricious manstealers responsible to the decisions of the eternal judgment he has greatly improved the condition of joseph by providentially causing him to be thrown into our honest possession and as the steward of such a trust we feel bound to take good care of our charge and god forbid that the vandalism of yankee and british fanaticism should bring against us any iniqui tious pharoah to wield the sceptre of oppression over them and in after generations your correspondent would insinuate that the fact of our southern men voting in congress to prohibit the importation of slaves from africa and also to prevent the extension of slave j ry to some of the territories denoted their disapproval of the institution of slavery they voted against the slavetrade not because the condition of the outdoor slaves would not be vastly bettered but mainly because it wasbecoming a rather strong temptation to the iniquitous sin of yankee and british kidnapping and we think your correspondents attempt to use as precedents to entirely justify the unrestrained overleaping of the constitution those compromises voted for by southern men and sanctioned by southern presidents for the sake of the union and for the peace of the north but one out of many instances of proof that the spirit of abolitionism is marked by the characteristic trait of basest ingratitude we hesitate not to assert that all those compromises admitted by the south to conciliate the north were founded in injustice for though we hold that every state who might feel it to be her interest to put out of her limits negro slavery should be allowed to do it if compatible with the rights of her citizens and neighbors yet all territory becoming the property of the united states should be held in common by all her citizens and that ail should be entitled without restraiut to participate in its occupancy and why should not the people of the south with their por perty and with the god of justice and mercy overshadowing them with the protecting banner af his truth go into new mexico carrying the flag of the gospel to unfurl to her inhabitants debased far below our negroes in civil condition and religious opportunities ah we ask in truth and justice why not and the sound of this question having reverberated upon the zephyrs iof the far west the echo as the voice of god back from the mountains ofj california thunder forth in truth and justice why noti have no pretension to prophetic vision but upon the showing of your correspondent our slaves are greatly prospering and the god of heaven has placed net only new but old mexico in such geographical and clirnaticai  juxtaposition to our sunny south that i know net but wheu enlargement for our slaves may reuire k who has ever favored those walking under the banner of truth and rigbteousneas may open the way in peace and goodwill too for his peculiar institution of slavery to carry its blessings still farther west ah why wc ask should it not he destined to past over thv battle fields i of mexico to the halls of the moote zumas bearing thither this glorious

england i london england june l j dear sir l witnessed an incident a few days ago which have no doubt will be interesting to you being at  newbroad i was introduced to a fugitive from american slavery he was a man about my color and sire he could not tell his age but i should think he was he had been the shive of william hunter of new orleans he attempted to fly from slavery about two years since and was overtaken received one hundred and sixty lashes and wore an iron collar six months his next opportunity occurred to get on board of an english vessel after they had been out three weeks he was discovered in the hatchway where he was concealedthe captain appeared to be enraged he ordered a sandbag to be tied to his feet and said he would throw him overboard that freak over he ordered him to be tied up saying be would flog himwhen all was ready he went to him looked at his back and said well i dont see any place left to flog when he arrived at liverpool he ordered him to be kept concealed until night and then he gave him a suit of clothes four shillings in money and started him for london he came to london and presented himself before the lord mayor who was then sitting in court he gave him some tammy out of the poorhwrfifld ordered lodgings tobe provided for him the next day he was brought to the antislavery office and will go from here to one of the british islands one fact in this case has struck me with great forcel may say alarming forcethat an english captain should hide a fugitive from american slavery after he gets into liverpool here you see american slavery reaching forth it bloodstained hand all over the world feeling after its victim and seizing by the throat all who dare aid him brother i tell you we need not fly from american slavery to any part of the world

of the jlsath scene on a charge of having committed a burglary since the trial the accountability of slavery the responsibility which they assume who undertake to control the conduct of others is a fearful one this kind of responsibility slavery always imposes on masters thsy who voluntarily assume such a relation to others shauld have brave hearts as it is not unlikely that occasions may arise in which great sternness and rigor and perhaps cruelty will be exacted of them for the effect of which they must be held accountable to a power higher than of man whoever undertakes to control others necessarily makes himself acconn tabsfor the conduct of those under him this cannot be set aside it adheres of necessity to the position of a master the servant cannot exert his own independent volition and where there is no freedom of volutions reason teaches that accountability cannot exist if the accountability of a human being is affected or lessened he who lessees it must to the extent which it is lessened assume accountability it is impossible to avoid this conclusion aman is accountable for his own conduct only because he himself determines what that conduct shall be if he voluntarily step in and assumes the control of another he necessarily by that act assumes to himself the accountability of all such conduct as he requires what a fearful thing it is thus voluni tarily to assume accountability in the sight of heaven for the conduct and character of others allminded true baarted men feel that to be accounts ble for themselves is s perilous thing and he who adds accountability for others to his accountability for himself places himself in a position of greatdis advantage and great danger a kentucky master owns a negro child ha brings that child up in astate of moral and mental blindness in consequence of that blindness the child commits many blunders and is guilty of many crimes can the child b hamseevmiwme for the cfttnes which resulted from the control which his master exerted over him if a man oould render his neighbor insane and could induce him while in a state of insanity to cut the throat of a third person no one would hesitate to excuse the madman and to hold the man who caused the insanity and induced the murder responsible now although the master who holds a slave may not be to that fatal extent accountable for the slaves transgressions those vices and crimes perpetrated by the slave that are directly clearly and only traceable to the power exerted over him by the master must be charged on the master we cannot see how masters can escape accountability for the conduct of slaves to the extent that the will of the slave is directly under their control if thorp was no other objection to slavery tfaftn that it imposes additional accountability on the master that consideration of itself ought to deter all reflecting men iroro involving themselves in its perils all parents fool that they are accountable to some extent for the conduct and character of their children this conviction cooperating with paternal affection induces them to studiously endeavor to enlighten the hearts and instruct the minds of their offspring in relation to subjects of the most solemn importance all agree that if a father eta an example of drunkenness to hie son end the son adopts u and lives a nuisance and dies in a gutter in consequence the father csnnotjbe guiltless or if a child is debarred by the perent from acquiring a knowledge of sound moral principles and in consequence of hie ignorance of those principles leads an ungodly lift the parent cannot bo excused he is nearly as gailty for the childs ungodliness as if he had committed it himself those parents who strive to discharge their doties to their offspring are net accountable for the conduct of their eff spring while they who in consequence of their vile examples incite their children to the commission of sin or by keeping their children in a state ot

publisher of sort ama magazine and all in any wise connected with it one person especially the writer ot a tale published in the magazine in which a negro is allowed to justify himself dor escaping from the peculiar institution was earnestly invited to make his appearance south of the potomac and was assured if he did so he would be murdered by a web tbe instant he became known a lady of this city of distinguished literary reputation stated to be connected with the magazine was at the same time warned under the penalty of outrage not to present herself in those latitudes it has since beau discovered that the author of tliis obnoxious tala is a southern incendiary by the name of wiley a native and citizen of north carolina a graduate of her state university and a practising lawyer in hat courts the south carolinian a print as sharp as any even in the state where it is published on the scent of an incendiary has an article upon the case of mr wiley from which we learn that he is to be required to give reasons and explnatjona for permitting wild bill who personates the character of the fugitive slave to talk in tbe heretical manner which has excited ae much alarm and indignation but tbs south carolinian is fearful that the unfortunate tala writer will be unable te satisfy his fellowcitizens whom he has ao grievously outraged the worst part of the w hole story is that ta the dialogue in which wild bill ax dresses his sentiments to walter another character in the slory on tbs subject of escaping from bondage he does not make walters refutatioa at all satisfactory this is very unfortunate ami wt fear beyond remedy for every body will admit that if wild bill ie a person of any acuteness and viger of intellect he will so apply those faculties in the argument upon the propriety of rnnmng away from slavery as to render any attempt to reply quite futile and that he has employed a very forcible style of reasoning on the subject it is evident from the sensation of his conversation with walter has occasioned anorth carolinia editor who aeema tobe a neighbor and acquaintance of mr wiley and who is altogether lass sanguinary and obdurate than his brothel of the south carolinian proposes te postpone the hanging of his friend until he has had the opportunity of finishing his story for he suggests that niter all the tale may have a vary fitting catastrophe w r iid bill may be floored in the argument by walterand then tbe fugitive colored logician maybe caught and strung up and so all end happily what is to be done with wiley becomes a vary important question hie treatment will form a precedent in the code lynch which may exercise agreat iufluence in the future administration of it hie crime ih certainly far more flagrant than that with which barrett stands charged for the document signed brutus which this unlucky person is said to have put into the mails makes no reference whatever to slavery but is simply a ealm address to the whits citizens ef south carolina showing them that they live underran aristocratical despotism and are denied a portion of their political right this is denounced as a celebrated incendiary document and a respectable citizen of a free state is threatened with death for attempting to circulate it through the governments mails of course if they ceuld catch the author of that address he would be account dated with a short shift and a long rope mr wilev therefore stands in a ve critical position and it would net surprise us to hear by the next naml that tbe services of the hon mr ketch now in the united stales senate had been brought into requisition and the first indiscreet storyteller had been hung up on the first limb and if tbe bones of thomas jefferson should be exhumed and suspended by that body tbe memory ef that prince of incendiaries would at length have received tbe crowning honor to which the fanaticism of the hour in carolina and virginia no doubt considers it fully entitled it strikes many as a singular circumstance that all three of the person who are at this time exciting the leers and tbe violent passions of the more bigoted partisans of slavery in tbo south are themselves natives of that region ihe most dreaded and detested of them tbe author of tbe political tract signed brutus v man bom in south carolina and until within a few yuan a resident preacher in that stats mr barrett

that the girl in question had been sent by the tennessee detendent to ohio the last summerbeirg his slave in tennesee he in company with two ohioans attempted to take her back to slavery for w hich

on friday and saturday oct sth and th and may be set down as the most successful of the numberthe gross receipts amounting to one hundred and forty dollars considering that there were one or two drawbacks this sum is large there had just been held quite a popular fair in the lutheran church in ets own behalf and the public of course felt less interest in ours than would have been the case under other circumstances the weather too was unpropitious cold and rainy so much so as to make it difficult for ladies to attend we however are highly gratified by the result besides the pecuniary advantage arising from the fair we think that much good was done by bringing the subject of slavery prominently before the community and actively enlisting the energies of a number of persons in practical efforts for advancing the antislavery cause there are in every town a number of persons who feel more or less deeply the necessity of doing something towards abolishing slavery but whose energies lie dormant solely for the want of some person to lead and mark out the way they need something iu the way of fairs and sewing circles upon which to bestow their attention activity and skill we would respectfully suggest to the ladies of lockport the desirableness of forming among themselves an antislavery sewing circle such an organization while it would do much towards furnishing the sinews of our antislavery warfare would also keep alive the interest in the subject already excited will some lady in lockport lead the way in this benevolent work previous to the fair we had the pleasure of addressing a large and respectable audience in the congiegational church a most commodious building which was very kindly and readily granted for our use it always gives us pleasure to record a fact of this kind i the proslavery press and public frequently charge us with a studied inattention to the good deeds of the chnrch and the constant e af fetation of its ahortcomings the charge unfounded we hail with delight the slightest indication of liberality from that quarter our controversy with the american chuich and clergy ends just w here their antislavery action begins let them make slavery a disciplinary offence let them exclude slaveholders from their communionkt them deny vue sacred name of christian to slivehoid cis let them declare slavery to be what itis s monstrous and deadly sin against god fraught with the most horrible consequences o both slaves and slaveholdersand let them in the spirit of ihe prophets and apo tles merely denounce the colossal iniquity d do all in their power for its removal from the length and breadth of the land and none would be more ready to bestow the rueed of pnuse upon such a church and clergy than ws so far from

obtaining accommodation there but were infsrmed that the court of supervisors was insession and that its members occupied tbe whole house we hare every reason now to believe this was true though our frequent experience of being excluded from hotels induced at first the suspicion that this was but a mere subterfuge we next called at the lockport house but could not induce the keeper to take any notice of us thence we went to the eagle hotel from which we were spurned iu a most vulgar and insulting manner bythe contemptible creature who presumed to be the master we next tried our fortunes at a small hotel near the eagle the unpretending proprietor of which welcomed us kindly and would undoubtedly have paid us every attention in his power had we remained under his roof but as soon as our kind friend mr spalding ascertained our whereabouts he extended to us to mr post and to tbe misses griffiths a warm and hearty invitation to make his house our home so long as we remained in lockport and on our accepting his generous offer he promptly sent his servant and carriage to convey us to his hospitablegmansionwhere we noware oh how delightful it is to meet ever and anon in this howling proslavery wilderness a resting place where we are neither shocked by vulgarity nor chilled by patronizing condescension our antislavery life would be hard indeed but that our lot is sometimes cast in pleasant places in this respect nothing can be more distasteful to us than to receive the hospitality of one who makes a merit of granting it and who takes pains to assure us that he is sacrificing public esteem by giving us entertainment we are aware however that this is in many cases asin of ignorance and we can therefore excuse it but such persons tuust not be surprised it they find us maintaining a respectful distance and avoiding rather than seeking a second visit it is heedless to say that the hause oi our excellent friend mr spalding it not oi this class we have never been made

published in pamphlet with the proceedings it will probably appear in an early number of the north star after mature discussion on each the following resolution were adopted i resolved that we regard the right of the electivefranchise as one of the most valuable and sacred rights of man and at once the glory and the shield of civil government resolved that to deprive any class of men of this invaluable and inalienable right and for a pretext release their property froma state tax when at the earae time they must beai their part of the expenses of the general government is not to be considered as a favor but is rather s measure calculated to fix upon them more deeply the mark of political degradation resolved that the constitutional disability under which colored men labor in the state of connecticut being founded upon that color with which the almighty creator has clothed them is impious before heaven unjust and cruel to those effected by itab bot rent to the religion of jesus christiu suiting to humanityx dishonor to the state and an obstacle in the way nf that spirit oi freedom which is abroad in the earth struggling to redeem man the world over and should therefore be speedily removed resolved that we believe that the day has now come when the people of our beloved stale of connecticut should remove ibis blot from her constitution sod proudly and uobiy take her place with that of every other state in new england in giving to all tbeir eitixens the right of suffrage resolved that we pledge ourselves to each other u use all honorable means to induce the good people of ibis stste to arise in their moral strength sad in the majesty of their political dignity and remove from the stales escutcheon that blot which now identifies her with the spirit of political tytanny  resolved that we rejoice in the efforts sod progress which our brethren have made and are to procure property especially land in this sad various other states and qua we regard this

the education of theii children and that they use their beet endeavors t givr them a thorough mental and moral training and then introduce them into the mechanic arts and ibus prepare them develop and sustain a virtuous and honorable station in society resolved as there appears to be s crisis m our condition as a people it u our duty to regard carefully the position of those who in this cause identify themselves wnh un and those among us who deny ihtir identity with us should be looked upon in the light of tones and enemies to the social and universal freedom of man resolved that notwithstanding weare deprived of the right of the elective franchise and deprived of the privileges ot citizenship we will use our utmost omleavora to cultivate the principles ol a pure morality and high intellectual attainments aud by industry and economy gain property resolved that this convention deem it advisable and expedient to present the claims of the colored citizens of connecticut to equal rights to the body of the people by the means of lecturers discussed hy messrs spellman and w est and adopted  resolved that those lecturers should be colored men of intelligence and ability residents in this state and should be sustained by our contributions adopted resolved that the central state committee be and are hereby instructed to perfect this plan of effort anil employ a sufficient number of men properly qualified and apportion the expense among the districts represented in this convention doings in south carolina the hairbrained fools of south calhounia are at their work again the post office seems destined to keep up an everlasting fever in that region of slaves and patriotism in the charleston mercuty appears an account of one of the most arbitrary and illegal proceedings which the history of modern times can furnish the tyrannical acts of russia have given occasion for much railing so have those of austria algiers turkov japan isc but the tyranny of these countries must henceforth cease to be regarded as at all to be compared with the unmitigated despotism of south carolina the mercury besides is apparently unconscious that there is anything disreputable in such proceed ings more abolitioism by the following letter from an esteemed correspondent ii will be perceived that the abolitionists are still active in their incendiary efforts pendleton sept gentlemen by the mail of friday there were received at this place a number of copies of an abolition circular directed to the members of the committee of vigilance the executive committee of that body on the following day demanded the letters ol the postmaster on his refusal to deliver them they entered his office and took them by force this oase presents a new feature of an important matter which is deeply agitating the public mind among the reforms which our enemies propose to accomplish in this state it will not escape your notice that the election of president of the united states occupies a prominent position it need scarcely be remarked that the war which the fanatics of the noith are so perso veringly waging against the peace and security of the south cannot be much longer carried on only by one party an offensive attitude by the other it will be impossible to restrain the people very shortly from as suming respectfully yours s we should like to know how long the general government means to submit to such indignity what is particularly remarkable about this case is that the incendiary document which has caused the disturbance says not a word about slavery but is simply an exposure of the working of the constitution of south carolina and the unequal representation among the white population by all means let that little nest of hornets lake themselves off and fiud a post office that will answer the purpose of keeping them in that deep and everlasting darkness which they seem so much to covet decent men who have no evil deeds to hide or to be a shained of would then give them a wide berth and allow them to stumble along by themselves the short but rough road to perdition which they seem to have chosen the case of dr brisbane a baptist minister of south carolina who among other things was accused of praying that universal liberty may prevail and for that and hia opinions against slavery was harried out of the state under threats of tar and feathers is another striking illustration of the barbarous state of feeling in south carolina these violent measures resorted to by the j slaveraongersmay be regarded as evidence that they see their weakness and the untenabieness of their position the mao who has truth on his side never attempts to smother discussion tne more his views are talked about and argued upon the more apparent does their truthfulness become not so with tyrants and evildoers they hate the light they dare not eome to the light they know they are in the wrong and they will try every means in their power to keep their dark deeds  aud darker doctrines huddled away and bid deu but it will not do even into the murky regions of south carolina the light oii troth will ere long penetrate slaveiyisei ten now acknowledged on all hands to be an unnatural condition and productive of evil not leas to the master than to the slave when printed even slaveholders are foiced to make this confession though they are slow to act upon it so slow indeed that it may well be doubted whether they are really convinced of its truth there must be few however who bold the doctrme of perpetualism it is so clearly abeurd and its absurdity is every day becoming so much more apparent even to the prejudiced underfundings of tbe haughty and self sufficient t chivalry that there is reason to hope the highpriest of

been cheered and gladdened bv the progress already made and the good lleadv done and while we rejoice to observe that friends have been raised up to plead the cause of the bondman among persons and in quarters where we had least expected them we still see the harvest to be great and the laborers to be few and instead of relaxing our efforts we are impressed nth a sense of the duty of doubling our diligence and applying more closely our energy to the means if advancing this holy appeal the more boldly to our ftiantto because those for whom we plead cannot plead lor themselves while we are surrounded by our domestic circle with none to molest or make us afraid there are three millions of men and women in our own land doomed to abject shivery and chains tobbed of every rightcivilsocial personaland political remembering those uf bonds as bound with them we desire to plead their cause as though they were on our swn limbs and the knotted lash were applied to our own backs while to obtain means for enlightening the public mind is the strong motive for holding our annual fair it is not the only ooe agreat amount of good may be traced direvtlv to such occasions many who are now active workers in behalf of ibis holy movement became first interested in it through the instrumentality of those annual exhibitions of antislavery industry tact and skill the present object of the

dimmed as by a heavy fall of snow darkness increased and it became night and in the depth of that endless winter night she heard lamenting voice from the east and from the ivest from plant and from

seemed to hei no eyes even as there was no heart all was dead or rather all was dyinj excepting pain there is a significant picture at tin commencement in every mythology in the beginning there is a

of the eternal stars if it be desired to hear anything o my writings it may he said that the began in the eighth year of my age when i apostrophised the moon ir french verses and that during tha part of my youth i continued to writ in tie same sublime strain i wrote under the impulse of restless youlhfu feelingsl wrote in order to write afterwards i seized the pen under the influence of another motive and wrou that which i had read horrible adventure the writer of the following letter having been out shooting at kirdee near poonah lay down to rest under a tree when suddenly he was aroused by he furious baying of his dogs on turning round beheld a anake of the cobra da capella species directing ite course to a point that would approximate very closely on my position is an instant i was on my feet the moment the reptile became aware of my presence in nautical phraseology il boldly brought to with expanded hood eyes sparkling and neck beautifully arched and the head raised about two feet from tha ground and oscillating from side to side in a manner plainly indicative of a relentless foe i seized he nearest weapon a short bamboo left by the baaters and hurled it at my opponent a head i was fortunate enough to hit beneath the eye the reptile immediatelyll and lay apparently lifeless without a moments reflection seized it a lulls below tba head haul ad it beneath the shelter of a tree and very coolly began to examine be mouth for the poisoned fangs of which naturalists apeak so modi while in the act of forcing open the month with a stalk i felt the head sfi i ding through my hand and to mr astonishment became aware that i had i now to dontead with the moat deadly of reptiles in its foh strength and vigor indeed i was in a moment convinced of this for as tightened my hold of the throat its body became wreathed around my neck and arms if the reader is aware of the universal dread in which the cobra de oapeua is held throught india and the almost instant i death which invariably follows its bite he will in some degree be able to ira agine what my feelings were at that moment a faint kiud of disgusting sickness pervaded my whole frame as i felt the clammy fold of the reptile lightning round my neck i still held the throat but to hold it much longer would be impossible immediately under my grasp there i was an inward working and creeping i of the skin which seemed to be assisted by the tightness with which held itmy hand was gloved finding in defiance of my efforts that my hand each moment was forced closer to my ace an idea struck me that were it fn my power to transfix the mouth with some sharp instrument it would present the reptile from using its tangs hould it escape my hold my gun lay at my feet the ram rod appeared to bethe very thing required which with some difficulty i succeeded in drawing out having only one hand disengaged my right hand was trembliog with overexertion and my hold became less firm when happily succeeded in passing the rod through its upper jaw to its centre it was not without considerable hesitation that i let go my held of the throat and seizing the rod with both hands at the same time brought them over my head with a sudden jerk and disengaged the fold from iny neck which had been almost tight enough to produce strangulation lhere was then but little difficulty in freeing my right arm and ultimately throwing the reptile from me to the earth where it continued to twist itselt into a thousand contortions of rage and agony torun to a neighboring stream to bathe my neck hands and lace in its cooling h waters was my first act after dispatching my formidable enemy this concludes a true though plainly told tale as a moral it may prove that when a man is possessed of determination l coolness and energy combined with reason he will generally come off tri uinphant though ire may have to cirri cumvent the subtlety ot the snake oi the ferocity of the tiger health of cities as a general rule when a body it examined after death whether of a child or adult one or more organa are found in a diseased state a fact which i induced a physician to state that he looked upon every adult he met in the streets of london as a walking mu iseumof morbid anatomy one grand means to prevent such diseases is to have well ventilated houses and to keep the air in motion for in warm weather the air always contains a large quantity of animal anc vegetable matter in the form of ova o infusoria and the seeds of vegetable or ganisms the act of breathing too is a great cause of rendering the ail j impure i the air in the lungs is exposed tc l of cells having a surface equal to thirty times that of the body so that during respiration the air it deprived of oxygen amd becomes loaded with deadly carbonic acid gasanc is rendered totally unfit for a seconc respiration being no longer atmospher i ic air but a poisonous gas a seconc cause of the deterioration of air is the combustion of lamps gas lights can dies tc a single candle is nearly ai injurious to the air as a human being two fourteen hole argand burners con suine as much ait as eleven mena third source of atmospheric impurity is the vapor loaded with anitna  matter given off from the lungs anc the skin each of these parts pour oui r an ounce of fluid every hour so that in a church containing people gallons of noxious fluid are given of in two hours j a fourth source of bad air in towni is the large quantity of decomposing animal and vegetable matter left tc give off efhuvia and the difficulty there is in the renew al of the air in towns b means of the w inds on account of the vicious mode of their construction anc their very large size certain diseases are traceable to the want of fresh air such as fever con sumption scrofula deafness and thai most fertile ongin ot numerous disea es the commoni cold in england and wales peo pie die annually of consumption anc i the geater number of cases is amonjj indoor laborers and m the city of new york about die of consumption per annum most of these being confined within doors one grand means ot promoting health would be the construction of better ven ulated houses no living sleeping ior working room should contain lest i than superficial feet nor be lest than a feet high and it should have one window at least opening at the top also an open fireplace to the chim i ney every building in which uaed should have plans to carry off the products of combustion and not allow them to escape into the room and also to supply fresh air diseases that arise from a want of ventilation are a scourge to society those who are merciful to animals should not forget that they need plenty f fresh air likewise this we are sorry to say is but little thought of by the majority horses are housed most miserably in our cities and this is one great cause of a disease called the heaves the high rents for both dwelling bouses among the poor and for stabler of our carmen are no doubt the cause of potting op with mall apartments what the remedy for this evil is we sre not able to divine and a great and growing evil it is slay hot until tomorrow and yoor present sorrow will be
