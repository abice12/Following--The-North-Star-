from the boston chronotype sermon on the memory of john quincy adams the little state of rhode island could produce organizing mind enough t organize the potomac or the missis sippiyes even the cataract of niagara ioto a cotton mill but the state of south carolina can manage both the north and the south and make the whole nation turn its wheels so the south gives laws because her chief men turn their hau ls to politics it is so in peace but in time of trouble convulsi n revolution like the old one j then you see men of tall heads come up from the shops and taints of the north from the oflice the bank and the shoemakers shop they are born discoverers and organizers the aristocracy of god they come up from everywhere and sit in the councils ot the nati n and control the state ihe north made the revolution ihe south made the constitution and the south breaks it just when it pleases great sensation no northern politician ever had much influence at the south none has ever been twice elected for president v e think ita great thing even to get a northern man lor speaker in the i louse ot re presentatives the south is an aristocracy which the democracy of the north would not tolerate one year if it were in the north now it has the northern democracy completely under its thumb democrats and whigs both if the south says go they hasten if it says come they say here we are it it says do this they obey in a moment does the south say annex it is done does it say fight northern men puton thecolor they lie lies and declare it moral treason even for the humblest the most insignificant clergymen to preach against the war these things arc so great sensation mr adams said was a northern man with northern aims methods ideas and habits and therefore how could such a man whose business was as of the rest of the new englanders to gain empire over nature and not over men contend with men whose business lay all the other way that is the explanation of a great many northern defeats of past times andi d ubt not it will explain a great maiiv northern defeats that are yet to conic in a brief discourse like this i can say but very little in detail respecting the events of mr adams life he was born in in he went to europe with his father remaining there most of the time till then he returned and entered harvard college he graduated therewith distinguished honors in he studied law with the celebrated judge parsons of newhuryport till k he practised law in boston till m this may be called the period of his education he enjoyed the advantages of a residence abroad to acquire a knowledge of foreign tongues of foreign inode of life and habit of thought which gave him an advantage all his life h father position brought tint in contact with the ablest hi ii of the nation and thus he became acquainted witli i ranklin and jeffers mi hi bis very boy hood the three years spent under judge parsons one of the most extaordinary men of new england whose hard philosophy wide the worth star learning and exact habits of thought were seldom exceeded and more than that a pemd of intense moral activity in america aud europe the character and objects of which claimed human attention to the laws which lie at the foundation of human society when the state the church and the family were discussed as never before were the influences which educated him mr adams drew in liberty at his mothers breast his cradle was rocked by the revolution his lallaby was sun by bunker hill lexington concord brandywine monmouth mr adamsearly attention was drawn lo the most important matters and hat was one great advantage in re was appointed by washington minister to holland and remained ibroad in various departments of diplo italic service in holland russia and england until thonontheao ession of jefferson he returned his csid ncc abroad during the formation f the two great parties was of great idvantage he was not necessarily nixed up with either lie was elected o the senate of massachusetts in ind in to the senate of the united states though not by a strict party ote he resigned that office in n he became professor of rhet ric in harvard university where he emained three years in lie ias sent to russia and remained till in various ministries in ic became secretary of state aud filled hat office till when he w as chosen resident from to lie vas in private life from to he was in the hbuse of repre tentatives f such arc the eveats of his life the th of may will be years since he jntcred upon public life what did lie tiin at in this long course of public ife sometimes it is very easy to secj lie aims of men thus with mr clay lis constant and persistent effort is to build up what is called the american system by protective duties mr cal h u i on the other hand aims to buildup free trade and in that respect these two men are exactly opposite to each other one is the north pole and the other the south pole of american politics lsut in these two men we see another aim and in this they agreewhich is to build up the institution of slavery at the south and this is the main poli lical aim of each of these men to which mr clay is ready to sacrifice he tariff and for which mr calhoun would forego free trade there is a continuity of action in mr clayi md mr oaliionn at first sight you lo not see that apparent continuity of ictini and unity of thought in mr adj uns he has worked with every party ind against every party in the land all have claimed none have held him j sow he opposes france then england hen nullification then gen jackson j who put down nullification with a rough j land now he is for the united states hank against free trade against ma jonry against slavery for the whole of oregon then against the whole of texas and now it is said covetous for ihe whole of mexico there appears no unity in his plan of operations but there is one sentiment and one idea which runs through his whole life and that sentimeut is an intense love of freedom not for himself only but for every man and womanfor every slave there is an idea also that ran through his whole life that every man n matter how humbly born and bred lias inalienable rights these too are what i call the american sentiment and the american idea mr adams had them in a heroic degree for brevitys sake let me cail both together the principle of freedom meaning by that the love of freedom for all men and the idea men have of inalienable rights this is the golden thread w hich runs through all mr adams works on this his jewels are strungand some things that arc not jewcls remembering this his life seems pretty consistent he saw very easily the peculiarity of the american government that it rested on the natural rights of man not on form not on power but on rights this explains his adherence to the constitution but with him the constitution was not an idol but a means of gaining an end he looked back of the constitution to the declaration of independence to learn the ideas of the constitution and he looked behind the declaration of independence to understand and verity the ideas of the declaration lie looked to human nature he saw that the constitution of the united stales was a compromise with the ideas of the declaration of independence and while lie i nnored the ideas he could not so much honor the compromise he had this american sentiment and idea in a heroic degree think no tnan now living ever expressed it so fully now a man like him having a good deul of pugnacity aud no great power of organization would uaturally developc it iu the negative form of opposition to the wroo oftener than in the form of organization of the right this would especialv he the case if brought into collision with men building up and supporting positions which contended with his idea accordingly in him the principle takes this shape of what he called the inalienable right of resistance to oppression he thought the indians were unjustly treated aud cried out against the wrongs of the american government and when president endeavoring to secure justice to the indians in georgia be came into collision with governor troup he saw that england opposed the american idea and he forgot the service that england bad rendered in the same cause and he hated englandand the commercial policy which restricted right wof no hextruth is op no colorood is the father op vs all and uil we are brethren rochester n y friday march mr trade her legislative policy and he octarchy and her aristocracy ami pet he loved the english blood and the english name and thought it no small honor to be able to speak the language f milton and of chatham the rea lon why he hated england was he bought she stood in the way of free jom he defended the right of petition in the house of representatives as other man dared to do he cared not whether it was the petition of a ma ority or a minority of men or of wo nen of freemen or of slaves to him here was one nature in them all in nan and women in bond and free it vas human nature and every child hough born of the lowest beggar that rept through the streets had inaliena de rights which am the powers of the votftf though bound into one mighty irm could never take away could not ven abate though it might ravish and injustly hold at naught this principle it was which led him o oppose tyranny in the house of representative the tyranny of the majority in this spirit he exposed and pposed that infamous gag law by vhich the south stopped the mouth of he north and the north was quite lad to have it stopped for the north lid not want to speak upon slavery ut though it stopped the mouth of the there is one mouth it didnt stop the mouth of the pirae a general smile take away from the north its lonors and its rights and it will not omplain but if you touch the dollar straightway there is an uproar mr dams loved the dollar as well as most ncn he provided carefully for its income and he guarded against its out he has never been proved to be generous he is said to have been close ind sometimes it has been hinted that lie was mean he loved dollars as well is most men in new england but he loved freedom more honor more inalienable rights more far more than he loved the dollars or more than new england men love their dollais this principle of freedom led him to oppose any violation of the constitution the constitution was an instrument for the defence of the rights of man lut only to be used as the people told the federal government was not sovereign the state government was not sovereign but the people were sovereign and he therefore guarded against every violation of the constitution as a wrong done to the people if jefferson wished to take louisiana by a confessed violation of the constitution mr adams opposed it ifthe federal government wished to collect a revenue from it before it was astate mr adams opposed that too because it was government without the consent of the governed and therefore ivas unjust and wicked this principle of freedom led him to hate and oppose slavery especially in its most wrongful form negro slavery he hated nothing as he hated this he fought against this with all his might it was a lion in the path of freedom a lion which frightened most of the north east and west a hon whose roar could still the clergymen of the north which could silence the forum the bar the pulpit and the press which rent the constitution trampled the declaration of independence under foot and tore the very bible to pieces but mr adams was ready to go into that lions den and take him by the beard he opposed the annexation of texas the mexican war and wonderful to tell he actually voted against it and never took back his vote great sensation this now was the great idea of his life it was not what free trade is to mr calhoun nor what the tariff is to mr clay it was more than that it was what the institution of slavery is to both of those gentlemen he germs inconsistent with himself and yet his general course is in that direction it began so and ended so in the massachusetts senate in he found a majority federalists and the minority democrats he stood out for the minority on the th of may and won the day by putting democrats in the governors council that was the very first of the legislative actions of john quincy adams in the house ol representatives of the united states in the first thing he did was to present fifteen petitions from the state of pennsylvania for the abolition of slavery in tiie district of columbia the last act of his ilfe was this a resolution was before the house giving medals to the men who had distinguished themselves in the mexican war the previous question was moved a trap often sprung to prevent debate in that and other houses and mr adams for the last time voted no with usual emphasis the great and loud no of an old man going home to his god full of the inalienable right of resistance to oppression the great no on his dying lips there was the beginning there was the middle there was the end and they were all three in the service of man not of party not of the country but in the service of man and they were all three alike somebody asked him what were the great recognized principles of politics mr adams said there are none auch none such he was asked again no for the recognized principles are bad and therefore not principles but precepts but is not this at leant a good onethe greatest good of the greatest number no said mr adams it is the worst of ail because specious and erroneous for in that case what shall the minority do this is the only rule ihs greatest good of all it waa worth i a long life to have said that such was his chief idea ido not say thee were no exceptions to this there were some not easy to explain la early lift ha was evidently araw uous of place rank and power i roust ronfh it sento me that sometimes fie vaa not scrupulous enough as to his modes of obtaining influence he has been censured for his rote on the embargo in his vote in that matter mar however easily hare been an honest vote it seems to me it was honest bat his defence of it i certainly cannot think was an houest de fence i am not here to praise a man because he is dead it is no great merit to die the egyptians judged their kings more severely than american citizens i know what coals of fire are under my feet when i speak of this matter i know that they are veryj thinly covered p with a coating if ashes that with the slightest ureath of hartford convention or j embargo those ashes are ail scatj ered away and the old fire blazes outgain in the forms of federalism and lemocracy come to life you know he story of the embargo the message of mr jefferson came to the sen ltc was given to a committee a bill vas draughted debatedpassed and engrossed and alt that in about four hours a bill of embargo which involved he whole commerce of the united states and prostrated that commerce bill which involved the welfare of hundreds of thousands of men in that debate if such it could becalled mr adams said the president has recommended the measure on lis high responsibility i would not consider i would not deliberate i would act doubtless mr jefferson has reasons which will justify the measure that was the worst act ol his public life i could not justify it i wish i could find some excuse for it i the massachusetts legislature censured mr adams he resigned his place and was sent to russia and his father said aristides has gone into banishment he was too just judge of the temper of the times when such athing could be said by a man who hadj been president when a famine ocj rurs most frightful diseases unknown before take possession of human boj dies and in times of political strife may arise similar mental and inutab diseases no man who did not live in those days can easily understand the mental obliquity the moral depravity of the age which displayed itself even among otherwise good men this remark of mr aduni in the senate was the worst act of his public life where were the rights of man at that time where was the sovereignty of the people he wofttd not consider he would not deliberate but he would act without doing either it is a shame to say it it would have disgraced a senator in st petersburg what would mr adains have said it jackson tyler or polk had sent such a message and their tools had coun soiled acquiescence without consideration or deliberation would not the tempestuous eloquence of that old mafti have caused the hall of representatives to ring against such a departure from the first duty of a statesman this is particularly glaring in mr adams the north very often sends men there who might have done this without any great inconsistency men whose weakness is not in the head but in the knees and the neck who bend before the slave power just as the air gives way before my hand mr adams never was accused of weakness either in the knees or in the neck it was therefore more palpable and glaring in him he was forty years old not very old but old enough to know better at this moment a heavy roar as of distant thunder was heard and a partial obscuration of the skylights took place causing considerable sensation in the audience i wish resumed the preacher the imputation coum idc off froinffiis character as easdy as that snow has slid off from our warming roof but can it be while he was president hayti became free but he did not express any desire that the united states should acknowledge its independence here are circumstances he said that had hitherto forbidden the acknowledgement and he mentions additional reasons for withholding the acknowledgement in the instructions given to the commissioners to the congress of panama he says he is not prepared now to say that havti ought to be recognized as on independent sovereign power he does not think it proper to recognize it as a new state and the reason is plain enough the hayti ana were negroes and for us to say that negroes ought to be free and were free would be dangerous to southern institutions he was unwilling to encourage the independence of cuba fir fear ot an insurrection of slaves which would endanger the safety of slaves at heme the duty of the u ited states would be to defend themselves against the contagion of such near and dangerous examples when we consider that to imply all the means necessary to their security that it would be necessary to put down tlsc inalienable righta of the blacks it becomes painfully inconsistent with bis guiding principle the de fence that his eyes were not yet opened is e good defence if a true one and it seems to me a true one even the greatest do not always open their eyes in adi vance of others especially if they are i not discoverers or organizers there are some other things which must meet the censure of just men as his justifying the conduct of england is forcing opium into china at the point of the bayonet one excuse waa that the chinese had abut themaelvea up from the rast of the world but who told mr admass and who gave him aright to tell the of dm chinese that they had no right to be governed by their own views of the laws of nature but the enlib were chnaiuu and carried hibt if that were true the chinese might well be fustified for refusing christianity when it came in the abape of opium and cannon balls he utter forgot his old hatred of england his devotion to human freedom the sovereignty of the people and the inalienable right to renet oppression he justified the american claim to she whole of oregon up to m o he did not sulhciently establish the right of america thereto by the law of nations and of nature but he cut th matter short and claimed the wh le ot oregon on the strength of the first chapter of genesis the argument here was very subtle and not easily un lerstood the human race claimed j she earth from the command to possess ihc earth be fruitful nud multiply afterwards it is said iu the psalms spoken to the messiah i give thee the lieathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thv possession here wlmt was originally given to the whole human race ivas preeminently given to christians then christ when departing from life jaid preach the gospel to all nations thus it was supposed the i ight rf eminent domain was given to christians therefore christians had the supremacy by the right of eminent domain this argument is not drawn out at length but appears in quite early productions of his hand this notion seems also to have influenced him in justifying the chinese war end would have led him to contend for the absorption as it is called of the whole of mexico certainly for consistencys sake he should have gone for that these are the exceptions to the general rule of his life i wish they were not there put should not dare to stand up in this place and pretend to bea christian minister if i undertook to gloss over these faults and say they were not there let us be guided ly their guiding light and warned by their warnings when president his chief aim was to promote internal improvement especially for communication between the states for this purpose roads and canals were built by the united states and more than four millions of dollars were voted in his tion yet he was exceedingly carefuf to observe the limits of the constitution in this respect no man was evermore conscientious to hint the con stitutionmeant something atidfhe oath to keep it meant something as a public servant he had many great qualities seldom united in the same person he was simple unostentatious humble modest and retiring he carried the simplicity of a new england man into the presidents house he spent less than a fourth part as much in tour years successor the most important thing in it was the master the house the man was never eclipsed by his brass and mahogany to be continue from the lilertj bell for incidents in the life of an antislavery agent few persons have any just ccncepi tion of the trials and sacrifices incident to the settlement of a new state tobe understood they must be met in actual encounter to besiege and subdue a moral wilderness is accompanied with still severer endurances a sketch from iny notebook may afford a faint idea of some ot them it describes no murderous mob but only scenes of every weeks occur rence it was iu the forenoon of a cold cloudy day in november in the year t thp wind at northeast and prophesying an autumnal snow storm that i entered a small village in one of the back towns in new england the village consisted of a number of indifferent houses dropped irregularly on a long street which widened at the western end into a broad green surrounding this and on it stood a gunhouse and liberty pole the townpound an academy and two meetingbouscs besides the hearse house over at the north by the graveyard gate on either side of the street stood a grijy looking tavern with a wellstocked barthe patron saint of patriotism and proslavery a few consumptive maples adorned the village planted hardly within hailing distance ot each other and at this season undrest of their foliage standing as rude organs oo which the mournful east m ind played th funeral dirge of departed summer with my valise and umbrella i bad walked several miles that morning over rough and hilly roads and was ina condition of both mind and body to need a very different reception from that which awaited me nor had i yet forgotten the advenlnres of the preceding night passed at one ofthose wretched country caravansaries known by the name of meadow hay tavern the surly landlord wanted my change doubtless the whig doctrine of paper currency being at that time no part of my practical griefs but hedrraded the efftct of patronage so dark clouded as mine on the reputation of his house a foresight that i could not but approve in bis particular ease he finally consented to keep which ha certainly could do without inconvenience other customers the house being that l aubt as usual without them was left to sit afooe to eat alone and to sleep alone this had been no caaee of complaint only that my par lour bad neither fire nor furniture the table was almost without food and the bed without comfort or clothing on retiring i had the precaution before a midi toning tnrvsiiuc il lid llk network of the cord hud oa it a light layer of straw and feathers that appeared to hare seen much service the sheets but forbear i opened them and closed them as i now do this description of them forever bad drawn their dbarmeter but with loathing and disgust i dashed it out they gave me another bed such a night and mr long walk that morning had not i confess schooled me into the most felicitous frame of mind for worse encounters depositing my luggage in the best looking tavern i went to the postoffice and aked whether anybody in tow n took the liberator or herald of freedom there was one onlya subscriber to the heraldhut they said lie lived three inilcs off was very poor and without influence a common description ol abolitionists at that period i next called on the orthsdox minister and respectfully solicited his cooperation in an antislavery lecture he answered me as gruffly as any savage i heard of you and want nothing to do with you at the same time violently seizing his pen and resuming his writing i said will you consent that your vestry be opened for a meeting i am writing a lecture he indignantly exclaimed for the young people on the existence of a god and wish not to be disturbed by your further impertinence the baptist minister was absent but the tones and looks of his family when i called on them were fearfully instruct ivc my stay there could not well have been shorter i applied to the committees of both meetinghousesbut it was in vain for schoolhouses i succeeded no better the tavern halls were also denied though one landlord cursed the bigotry of the church committees in no measured terms they hud censured him for selling ardent spirits by this time it was long after noon and i had taken neither breakfast nor dinner through the day the w ind was howling mournfully through the leafless trees the two meetinghouses seemed to be scowling at me the pound and gunhouse grinned in derision and the lank libertypole looked down and laughed fatigued hungry borne j sick and sad there i stood like a new settler surrounded by devouring wolves ny nearest neighbor full ten miles off was about to surrender in despair when a rough and shaggy specimen ol the mountaineers bailed mewth hey there you niggermnngot a place fora mcetn yetr i told him none well said he thcrs that are old shop ll hold all youll get out on this ere abolition business youre welcome to that and if the mob tears it down why d n em let em tear it ll save me the trouble for its got tocome down next spring if it dont afore i accepted his rude offer with abounding heart and immediately posted some printed notices which i had in my valise in every conspicuous place in the village almost as fast as they were put up they were torn down but the tidings flew as cn the wings of the wind for sixpence i next filled my pockets with raisins and buisouits at a neighboring shop anti took possession of my building i piled its ample stone fireplace w ith wood and kindled u tiie j breakfasted and dined on the contents of my pockets and then commenced iny preparations for the evening i procured a pound or two of tallow candles and a few large potatoes a pile of which lay in my meetinghouse cut in halves and drilled composed my candlesticks boxes benches and rough boards furnished ine with seats and a corner by the fireplace was my pulpit and by the time my arrangements were completed the people began to assem ble the house was filled with men and boys some smoking pipes some cigars and the rest chewing tobacco all laboring in their respective vocations most industriously the greater part heard wth respectful attention some even taking kindly part in the discussion a few raged and swore at my doctrines hut more complained of the barbarous treatment i bad received at the hands of the church and ministry at the close was invited by the only abolitionist present to accompany him home he lived three miles off and owning no horse w as there on foot the clouds had all pawed away the moon shone brightly but the wind had changed to the northwest and it was piercing cold we scampered over the three miles in little more than half an hour the house stood on a high hill facing the west a very old two rtory structure and glass was a luxury of which the chamber windows had never boasted indeed bundles of tld rags and the remnants of last year s jain leaf bats m the lower windows stopped many a bole to keep the wind aw ay clapboards were a superfluity not indulged in and the featheredged board iing was fast dissolving the union with the rotten timbers beneath there was no yard about the bouse nor a tree to shade it in summer or break off the w ind in winter green brush and decayed stumps composed the woodpile we entered by the front door over a broad flat stone into the room where the family lived and where the wife and sundry chidren were already

before the committee on the duunv n petiti n mr chairman as one of these petitioners i appear before you this afternoon to enforce as may be able the reasons stated in the petition itself for a dissolution of the union i oliserve that one of the morning papers presumes to dictate to the committee and expresses the opinion that any attention paid to these petitioners is waste of that time which is paid for by the public it would be idle to look for candor independence or consistency in that or any other political pcss but perhaps we might lie pardoned for imagining that a decent respect lot the common sense of readers would lead the papers just now to touch with a reverent hand anything relating to the right of petition the grave has just closed over adams amid testimonies of national respect but once if ever j before equalled on this side the ocean what j is it that has blotted from our memory tbe many bitterly disputed acts of his liie what has taken his name from tho list of every day statesmen and made it a household wordlulling tho strife of parties and turning every angry tone into eulogy it is the last ren years the heroic years of his lifeyears during w hich he lias linked his memory forever with freedom of speech with the right of the humblest human being to ire heard by j the government it was for presenting the petitions sf the few and the despised that he was threatened w ith censure it was for pro suiting petitions whose request he thought the j legislature had no authority to grant lhat hew as threatened with expulsion from the house of representatives let us hear no more thenat lust till the snows of one winter have melted from his graveof disregarding petitions because in the opinion of the majority the object itself is not constitutional sir the majority never petitionthey legislate of course it must always be the minority who petition it is through this channel that the first humble utterance of a new thought or an unpopular and unheeded principle finds its way to the legislature whoever limits the right of petition destroys it through it the humblest and the most unpopular must have leave to speak on all sub jeets and propose measures of every character otherwise the right is but a name if they are to receive attention only after they have grown numerous and powerful the right of petition is a mockery for then they can command it in readier ways if they are tobe allowed to ask only what eveiybody thinks best and legal they may as well be silent snce it ts nothing hut an interest in principles generally denied trampled under foot or lost hi the clamor ot interest and partythat brings them to the door of the legislature whatever therefore mr chairman maybe the opinion of the committee as to the expediency or even legality of our request at least w hile these walls are shrouded in mourning for adams you will not make that opinion any reason for refusing us a candid and attentive hearing mr chairman you may think it idle to urge upon the legislature the consideration ofa measure so generally denounced as the dissolution of the union but this is not the first time that the abolitionists have approached the legislature of massachusetts while these seats are filled year after year with different individuals we may be said in the french convention phrase to be in terms nent session under a sense of duty that will not allow us to rest we have eomo up here year after year our first appearance with any new proposal inet with the scorn ofa w eathercock pressthe half indifference half indignation of tbe legislature and sometimes the insults of its committees but we have ypt to meet our first failure all that we have hitherto asked has been granted j twelve years ago a few women asked the state to change its law as to marriage a statute a century and a half old yeu remember the insulting epithets the labored contempt with which they weru visited if you will open the statute ifook of you will find in four shortlines the result weshall eenainly persevere till our ardor is damped by one defeat and we confidently trust that the day is not distant when the legislature recognizing its own principles wui be w illing to draw from them the very inference which we are to urge upon you this aflcr noon j we ask for disunion and we are read to meet with all the obloquy

informed reepect ing the different reform movements without as a public journalist taking sides with any parly i aend yon a few thoughts which that debate suggested to my own mind the hall was filled some time before the committee took their scats with gentlemen and ladies snd a pretty fair sprinkling of members nf the state government mr paillit s opened the discowien and proceeded to matte one of the most brilliant and eloquent addresses i ever heard it was listened to throughout by the large audience in attend ancewith profound attention and most evident satisfaction admitting his premises that the encroachments of ihe slave power are such as to demand ihe immediate secession of the nonslaveholding states from the union that there is no remedy in any other measures that salvation cannot be looked for from any other effort and his logic is a chain of steel linkshis conclusions irresistible it is impossible to give you anything like a sketch of whar he said yo say it was beaiuiful heartstirring and chae that it was the soul of eloquence embodying itself in the simplest and purest forms of speech that it was the spontaneous gushings forth of liberty in all her glowing nature and fitted to charm tbe despot even from his deeds of wrong and cause him half repentant to forego the wickedness which his soul proposed is to say nothing to be appreciated it must have been beard no second person caa pen it down cannot report him f i try and therefore will not attempt it many persons who listened to his manly eloqeeuce were convinced that the slave institution is the great trouble in our national affairsthe paramount the absorbing question which we must meet as men and decide fot humanity net a fjw of the members of the legislature have remarked in my presence since that if the slave power continues to make its encroachments this question of seccession is only a question of time that dissolution or slavery are the only alternatives for northern freemen this t do not advocate and my prayer is god save us from slavery and preserve ihe union inviolate it was nearly six oclock whon mr phillips finished his speech mr garrison then arose aud after ascertaining that the committee could not give them another bearing proceeded to address them but the circumstances under which he labored were embarrassing it was nightthe shades cf evening had already closed in around us many people arose and left the hall having been gratified with the eloquence of phillips they wished for nothing further mr g however went on in his usually calm argumentive and solemn manner llis reasonings were impressive and forcible and however absurd the measures he recommended may appear to many yet that the advocate was a sincere and honest man an ardent lover of his race possessing a soul overflowing with a worldwide philanthropy was nadoabt the irresistible conclusion of every peraen who listened on that occasion the debate was closed before seven oclock and nil rovv feel anxious to know what the report of the committee will lie it is not at all probable that ihey will favor the prayer id the petitioners neither do think tliey will report leave to withdraw b the north star rochester m ircii march th dear readerswe are again absent from our editorial post though not from antislavery duty the urgent demands upon us to attend and address public meetings and the absolute necessity of increasing our subscription list and the fact that we can do much towards the latter result by attending public meetings will we fearfor the present make it our duty to travel much more than we con tcmplated at the establishment of the north star the difficulty of combining successfully the duties of the editor with those of the lecturer will be readily seen the two positions are so dissimilar that to be proficient in the one is to be almost necessarily deficient in the other one feels little like sitting down at the close of an exciting meeting in the midst of warm friends of the cause anxious to exchange opinions and write an editorial article there may be those wlto can do so but we have not the gift when among our friends we are one with them we love too well to sail alung the pure tide of social regard and intercourse to leave the cheering circle of friends cither to read or to write besides the duties of the antislavery lecturer are not completed by an address from the platform to be effective he must enlist the interest of the social circles in which he may have the privilege to move and to do this j and travel from lace to place as wc now must do will leave little time for writing we will persevere however and do the very best we can and our publisher and printer doing the best they can will leave little cause for complaint on the part of our readers during our absence wc find a strong desire in the ptiblie mind of this region to hear antislavery set forth in its most radical form the field is white fur the harvest and it is sad to think that the laborers are so few western new york looks almost forsaken deserted and desolate for the want of tbe voice of living earnest and disinterested antislavery laborers even tbe liberty

march we held in company with j c hathaway aod charles lenox remood a meeting in canandaigua the churches of this place being closed against antislavery lectures we held our ij meeting in s hall belonging to our staunch antislavery friend mosher the meeting was opened with prayer by rev mr whit tey and ihough thinly attended the interest j manifested by those present was satisfactory j and refreshing we were cordially wel j comcd and kindly made at home in the family of or esteemed friend henry johnson who is one of the few colored men at the north who understand and appreciate the humble efforts of the antislavery men to improve and elevate their condition as well as to emancipate tbe slave friday th march we went to rnsh ville a town about ten miles distant from caoaadaigva where a meeting was appointed for us at two oclock that day the roads wcie in very bad order and in some places almost impassible on arriving in rushville remond hathaway and ourself were invited o make our home at the house of mr oliver harwood a writ known antislavery man during our stay the kindness hospitality and religious interest of this dear family in the cause of the slave made our visit to rushville exceedingly pleasant and leads us to look forward with pleasure to the time when we shall enjoy the privilege of meeting there again our meetings on friday afternoon and evening were held in the congregational church and were very well attended and tbe spirit which pervaded them showed that some good was done friends remond and hathaway both performed noble work for the cause saturday th march penn yanwe found here quite a spirit of opposition to our meetings the rer silas i fa wifi pastor sf the congregational church in this place being bitterly averse to ourself and friendsand for some time previous to our arrr valhad been busily engaged in circulating prejudicial reports against us and charging us with infidelity and various heresies through the kindness and faithfulness of our friend jacob platt we obtained the use of liberty hall a room which would accommodate about three hundred persons this was i densely crowded by a rcspeclable and intelligent audience friend hathaway and ourself occupied the attention of the audience during the evening at the closs of this meeting three were announced to be lield on sunday during the hours of religious worship and with this announcement we announced our intention o attend to the case of rev silas hawley as well as the revival going on under his auspices sunday morning at the hour appointed the ilall was again crowded by an interesting and earnest audience after a hymn anda prayer by the wesleyan minister who by the way gave up his own meeting and urged his congregation to attend ours thus making common cause with the slave and his friends we proceeded to address the audience on the subject intimated the previous evening we were followed by mr hathaway in a speech of great force exposing in a masterly and earnest manner the insidious and despicable proslavery manceuvreings of rev silas hawley and his sympathizing friends before our forenoon meeting came to a close the trustees of the spacious baptist church in a spirit worthy of the faith cherished by knibb and burchell champions of west india emancipation generously offered tbe use of their church for our afternoon meeting at four oclock this kind offer was thankfully accepted wc however commenced our afternoon meeting at two oclock in the ball and i adjourned from thence in a body to the baptist church at four oclock mr remond and myself addressed the meeting an evening meeting was appointed and though quite rainy we again enjoyed a large audience who appeared to listen with an increasing interest from an early boor till near ten oclock tbs meetings in this place have been the most interesting and successful which wc have attended since nor residence in western new york and if we do not very much misapprehend tbe character of the peo pie who attended our meetings a large dud her of them have been permanently attached to our holy cause thus has the cunning ofa crafty proslavery canting priest bsen confounded and his designing schemes brought j to nought about two years ago an antislavery agitation took place in penn yan which resulted in rupturing the presbyterian church in that place the seeeders from

strange to say this is as true as ever of the world the worlds governors have been stammering along nuking experiments here sod experiments there without having any fixed principle to guide them in the science of government and rather titan be doing nothing they w ill do mischief indeed it doubtful whether government has ever been reduced to a science like what is called the science of medicineif one prescription foils try another keep trying never mind if you poison the patient there is only one thing that is never forgotten by legislators which may probably be considered tbe principle of lawmakingthat is the protection of the interests of class and property now it aanumeu one form and now another at one time the law is fiamed for the protection of the man who has property to the injury of the man who has none and again it a to protect the white in oppressing the block man now it is for a tariff in one place and a corn law in another various are the inodes and the

which were the good timo coming and the old granite state both of which songs were filled with antislavery sentiments several new verses having been added to them the antislavery sentiments were sung i with great boldness and heartfelt expression and truly this little band were noble champions of tbe noble cause which they advo cated several antislavery friends were present and we all felt as though a great work had been done for the slave for harry of tire vveat hark never before listened to antisla eery troth in sueh a soulstirring form the efleet on tbe old man was good hia heart was touched and tear trickled down over his aged face as lie listened to the melting vuiun of these minstrels of freedom would to red that the hutchinson family ought smg before every slaveholder ip the land the effect would be to greatly hasten on the goodtime eomif when every slave should b emanripaard and maakind should love each other tha tflfeet of yoor article is injurious loth reputation of the hutchinson family whose only motive in singing to henry hay waa to do good lo mankind by spreading the great truths of freedom and brotherly love henry clay is a non of great influence and here waa aa opportunity to try aad to that ihleenc on the side of freedom mi im only will diadoee the effirt of their visa pray god that the trtihs which were m eloquently advocated in song hy our friends the ifutchinsmns may sink deep into thof the aped stateamaa and that he wil in due tunc bring forth fruit meet for re prnunce thus you sec the mot ire which induced friends to siag w a good one our eitf paper in piung as arr nmt of the proceedings refrain frvnt mentioning the antislaver and tempersncs scntfinenl that were song and so a false and erroneous impression ha gone abroad lhe

to gain admisrioi into the musical fund flail or the binesi museum except upon the odious ami slavisl conditions of excluding colored people an omitting antislavery songs these conditions thv refused as selfrespect and a regard to principle aliko required that they shouli do their fidelity to their avowed principles though it mav eot them the favor and patronage of a few of ilia negrohating aristocracy will a icure to them the respect even of those slavcocrath who would have triumphed in their fall and despised them for their cow ardice had they suenimhed to their demand the rchuke which they have given to the unchristian unmanly and contemptible prejudice against color and the servile proslavery feeling which prevails both among churches and people will he felt not many years will goby we presume before the proprietors of those halls will he heartily ashamed of their conduct and glad to redeem their character from the shame which thiir present course is branding upon it we hope that our friends from the old granite statu will he welcomed to our city by a generous patronage and overflowing houses what the world thinks it is an old saying hilt more false than it is old that what everybody says must be true this everybody has often been most cggrcgiously mistaken kverylwdy is a very dull and untouchable monster much more ready to act than to think and that blunders along always attempting to do something but as oft on doing wrong as the reverse everybody however is more to ire pitied than blumd lie means for the most part to do righthe tries to do right and when lie is doing the greatest wickedness will sum li nes even imagine that he is doing god rviet the worst trait in the character of everybody is that he stops his cars against the words of those who would instruct him he says i dont want to hear you w hat you siv is fils i dont know what it is but i know it is falsa you are a foolyou area fanaticyou are mad f this is melancholy and vet it is in some hsur useful it is one of the means hy which truth is tested some men are fools some nr f matinssome are mad everyman is so more or less in the opinion of his neighbor one man holds certain opinions and a neighbor who does not hold the same calls him a fanatic and perhaps that fanatic thinks the other a fool said one maniac to another looking through tiic window of the cu id house see those mad people outside th v think we are mad they arc all mad we are not there is a picture of ia caus the french discoverer of steam power which i can never contemplate without emotion treated as ain imae he is exhibiting the title of his work d s hfos do in apeur from the grating f his prison there are a number of people around who are laughing and hooting t hi ii the marquis of worcester who w s engaged in similar pursuits is one of the onlookers lie listens to what de caus has to sav am in an offhand manner remarks there may be something in it the world in the end always comes to see its error as it has done in this case it would almost seem that the world lias hated its prophets and teachers jeremiah for prophesying the truth against his people is let down into a dungeon where there is no water hut mire so jeremialwsunk in the mire him of nazareth u called mad and killed paul of tarsus was called a babbler and killed and so on through sacred and profane history down to the present day the world has always endeavored to stop the mouths of its teachers all this of course lias no effect upon ths man who has any truth to communicate it is not of the slightest consequence to him whether the world calls him a fool a fanatic or a madman oie or other of these or a similarly opprobrious epithet he must but be called but it moves him not the truth is all to him everything else is nothing he is by no means careful to make friends with the world for the world will not be on friendly terms with him unless he will tolerate its errors this he w ill not consent to do truth is utterly intolerant it can make no compromise there are no such words as expediency policy compromise in the vocabulary of truth it ceases to be truth as soon as it consents to join hands with error as soon as it docs so it becomes a mixture of truth and falsehood so with the man who lias discovered the truth to whom it has become a reality everything else must give way to this with jaither lie aavs can do no other he rests his foot firmly on that rock and unshaken unseduced unterrified remains there immovable our own day is not without its manifestations of this spirit and probably it arises out of the fart that it is much more easy to call names than to reason almost any one with the help of a dictionary can find a hard word to cast at those who take the liberty to differ from him but after all it may not mean much the hardest word m the dictionary docs not mean much it only means when spoken of a person or thing that it is the term which he who applies it considers applicablesometimes not even so much as that the man who savs it may possibly not be any more infallible than uie man about whom it is said you are an aa saida loafer to his companion you are another he retorted whereupon they went to fisting each jtiluir a pretty conclusive proof that they ware both right though the mare fact that the one said to of the other didi by no meym pro it jiorimo another example of this vety

deep ami abiding impression of the duty we owe to god and our fellow beings the antislavery women of rochester feel constrained to continue to persevere in their ellorls for the oppressed and millering bondmen who still remain toiling unrequited in the southern prison house we are frequently brought painfully to remcmlier that not only i their labor wrested from them unremunerated not only do they suffer from intense hunger and cold not only are the females ova sisters subjected to the cruel and passionate outrages of their tyrannical masters and overseers but there are daily instances of sundering the doarest tics in nature thus separating them forever and can w e expect anything bttercan we look for benevolence or fine feelings from a system so foul and fiendish as slavery it would be unreasonable because a corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit therefore knowing that without associative anion we cannot render efficient aid to tliis holy cause wj affectionately invite the cooperation of the citizens of rochester and the public generally we ask them to bear in mind the injunctions of jesus all things whatsoever ye would men should do to von do ye even so to them remember also the beautiful parable in which he call our attention to the sick and to those who are in prison and conclud es by the forcible assertion inasmuch as ye have done it looneofthe least of these my brethren ye have done it unto roe we feel assured all that have hearts to feel ami are careful to attond to the monitions of conscienceall who are determined to live fur the good of our race instead jof devoting all their time to their own personal easeall who feel bound to improve the precious time allotted to theta here by pio moting as much as possible the cause of truth and righteousness in the earth will come forward in the work oflaboringto banish forever the demon of slavery from our land and in so doing instead of an example of corruption and wickedness we should be a light to the world j c hope no one will feel too poor nor any too rich to enlist in this holy cause the christian s influence in whatever situation is always salutary and will certainly produce its good effects e ask for the aid of men and of women we call on ths old and the j young the farmer the mechanic and the j merchant an c ask all and every one to give us their help to devote what they can spare either of money or of the frmtsof their labor to the work of restoring inen and women to themselves to their manhood to the rights j and blessings with which they were endowed j by our creator for this object we propose holding a fair in december next we ask the finales in the adjoining towns and country around us to get up sew ing circles and prepare such articles as will lie most saleable and to mme fnr  nisli tables give us their company and help us not ouly to selling those things thus prepared but in convincing the public mind of the uecessily of our perseverance and

that consent thereupon the eloquent old patriarch of congress the tongue of fire now silent in death that never faltered with fear or favor or hope of reward thanks god god be praised said mr adams at the close of mr palfreys speech the scads are broken now the door is open and an eyewitness describing the scene of the speech says it was especially interesting to witness the eagerness with which the southern men crowded around bis seat and listened to his discourse and as frequently in his philosophical manner he would illustrate some of their weak points particularly those of clingman in his famous historical erjwse they wore quite unable to contain themselves and slapped their sides in childish glee it was the first antislavery speech i ever saw slaveholders listen to patiently what power isin the northern man with northern principles what respect waits upon his words when they represent conscience in congress before the south southern men cluster round him with eagerness to listen to his principles and slap their sides in childish glee at the ridiculous absurdities of their own principles which have ruled and wellnigh ruined our country and what was true in congress ut tine speech of mr palfrey was always true there northern conscience would always tave had its respect tlierc if northern conscience had dutifully set itself toi speak it is late now but not too late the seals are brokenthe door is open through that door those who have the will to save their country may enter in to their sacred work the natural and the spir itual the impressions made upon the sands of human actions and human passions during the year that is passed are now hardened and fixed in stone as the soft substance of clay receiving the impression of the waters and marking their motion course and flow becomes at length a rock whose imperishable engravings are read by succeeding generations and as the growth and products of trees and the anatomy of animals of different ages

endless exist encedr lord george thompson f t there is not a public man in england who has risen so rapidly from the crowd of common men into public j notice as george thompson reputed to be one of the most eloquent men in britain now m p for the tower hamlets the progress of a man of genius is an instructive lesson illustrating as it does the inherent strength of an independent mind and its gradual victories over seemingly invincible ciri ctrmstances the history of george thompson gives powerful evidence of high intellectual courage and moral firmness and it afso shows to what seemingly fortuitous and trivial occuri rences meu may owe the bias of their lives george thompson was born in liverpool and received a common education we do not know that he was bred to any profession in youth he however early began to educate himself as a debater the active minds that were being developed in britain during the first quarter of the nine j tcenth century associated themselves i into clubs for the discussion of the various political questions that agitated j society and george thompson when quite a youth was a prominent member of one of these young as he was and strong as the passion for intellectual victory would assuredly be in a youngman conscious of his talents he formed ia resolution which w f as as creditable to his heart as his lifelong adhesion to jit has been honorable to his consistency jit was never to argue in favor of what he did not believe to he rightless than twenty years ago a lady j called at a certain mercantile house in london soliciting a situation for a young man to whom forty pounds a year would be an object the applica i tion failed and luckily for himself and his country george thompson was left awhile longer on his own resources some time subsequently a vestry meeting took place in clerkenwell for the purpose of levying a rate in order to carry out some scheme in c jnnection with the state church pompous j portly men who had hitherto settled ail these things in their owa way assembled and engaged in grave debate the people w ere not so well schooled then in opposing corporate mandates as they are now and they looked oil iand listened to the serious process ol pocketpicking that was going on be fore them but had not power to oppose ij at last a young man who kept a coffee j house in the church ward rose and raised his voice feebly at first and falteringly did that eloquent tongue utter its first public protest against corruption deacons and vestrymen looked great and grave and profound and there was a sort of traditional veneration attached o their names and station which the orator fell as he looked at their fat spectacled faces turned up to him in wonder and ainaze mciit but he was not to be frowned down and a few encouraging demonstrations from his astonished fellowj citizeqp dispelled his timidity he warmed with his subject and as hew armed he rose in courage and clo quence until he fairly overwhelmed the venerable clique with derision and sarcasm and led the people to reject the proposed rate by an overwhelming majority an account of this meeting and of the party played in it by the coffeehouse keeper reached henry brougham then engaged in the struggle for negro emancipation and the result was that george thompson left his business in clerkenwell to some less talented or more congenial spirit and mounted the public rostrum as the advocate of the slave mr thompson is a most accomplished and splendid orator he possesses every qualification of such and from the lips of lord brougham himself atone time styled the british cicero he has received the highest laudations for his eloquence eloquence is not the highest of george thompsons qualifications however he possesses in an eminent degree the quality of moral courage no matter how strong the prejudice agaiust his principles or how j virulent the opposition manifested to himselfthis fearless man never faltered in h and he traversed great bntain lifting his voice against the apprentice probation from boudage to liberty which was to continue inoperation for seven years in the west j indies in the negroes in the british colonics were free in full o fjoy st the triumph of justice and liberty in his own land he went to america in order to peed the advent of emancipation there but the spirit of slavery was far more virulent in the j land of franklin and john quincy adams than ever it had been in britain for in the city where stands old j fancuil hail the tar kettle was heated and the gibbet erected in order to debate with this foreigner who bad i dared to come from a land of monarchy and aristocracy to tell to republican j awcrirlhat americans were men if the mb uf george thump could have secured freed to the american stare we believe that he would have cheerfully usd ft down hut neither defy nor utility culled upon him to weed leaely expeee htepreewms life to the fbry of a proslavery mob and so shaking from bis feet the dust of new englands ground as testimony against her he returned home to speak in favor of freedom where bn at lend dared to speak he was engaged by the pence socirty of london to propagate their principles sod to edoeate public opinion regarding an international arbitration policy mid he also lifted bis voiee for the repeal of the corn laws while the country was agitated to her core upon that quest ion five or six years ago he went to india with the celebrated parsec merchant and philanthropist tagore baboo dwaranatb and returned after a short residence in the east the accredited representative of the emperor of delhi while in india mr thompson turned his attention closely to the policy of that corporation of merchant kings who sit in london and sway the destinies of a great continent and be made discoveries which were neither credka hie to their honesty or humanity aye if the recking bloodstained soil of xir dia had a tongue there would arise such a voiee of accusation against british cupiditv as would make this nation tremble the pretence of restraining despotism and of carrying civilization and good government into india has enabled the east india company insidiously to extend its territory over almost the whole of hiodostaoj and northern india from belochistan in the northwest to assam in the east ah it is not benevolence or love of liberty that prompts a merchant comj pany to maintain thirty thousand fightj ing men the sons of the british aris j tocracy after a short residence come home fortuneladen from these sunny climes these fortunes are too often purchased by crime while in india mr thompson became cognizant of a case of flagrant injustice which had been perpetrated on the rajah of sattara by the east india company with his wonted courage and zeal he took up the case of the injured man and began he returned to englandthe hopeless task of appealing to the companys directory he could hardly obtain a hearing and wa treated with a contumelious disrespect which might have disheartened one less firm the electors of the tower hamlets by the largest majority ever known in england have placed him in a position however in which not only the east india company but the whole british government shall listen to him pleading the rights and wrongs of india in fie made one of his mot brilliant public displays against slavery t and electrified the people of scotland with his adjurations to the free kirk to send back the money which she had meanly consented to receive from american slaveholders if oratory could havs carried moral conviction to the hearts of candlish aed cunningham the money would have been cast out from the coffers of their treasury as an unclean thing if humanity and justice could have been enthroned in the bo smos of these reverend doctors by the force of eloquence scotland would soon have been free of the shame of that money but alas our countrymen have the bad fame of loving gt id too wellof worshiping plutos too devotedly aud verily these free kirk doctors have conduced to deepen this national stain they uttered a few mystical metaphysical sentences conj deinnatory of slavery in the abstract and then they followed these sentences by a few others approving of it in the concrete they shouted down the members of tfieir own synod who dared to talk broadly out in condemnation of the acceptance of that slave money and they scornfully derided memorials that j were presented to them by their christian fellowcountrymen in favor of cur poor brethren in bondage they wrote ja few sophisms which they called a ret remonstrance and testimony to the l churches in america against slavery and hear it ye of gath publish it abroad in askelon they kept the money george thompson is above the common height and possesses a handsome active frame his form inclines t lightness in its proportions rather than strength yet hi shoulders are broad and his fine flexible voice issues from a wellformed capacious chest in complexion mr thompson is dark his features are thinnish but his face is highly intellectual his eyes are especially keen and piercing when they are lighted up with that enthusiasm which appertains to his fine nervous temperament he made his debut lately in the house of commons and it was a successful one canning and sheridan two of englands most accomplished orators during the days when the british parliament was engaged in debating parliamentary reform and in the impeachment of warren hastings both failed w r ben they first attempted to address the house george thompsons maiden speech was in connection with indian affairs and it was well delivered and as well received he is now studying english law in order to qualify himself for he duties of a barrister and as unlikely things have come to pass as that be may yet be high chancellor of england and sit upon the woolsack where his first patron sat if george thompson has attained to wealth and lame it has never been by worshiping the wealthy greater spending his talents in defence of wrong however powerful he has erar pled the cause of suffering humanity with a strong earnest eloquent enthusiasm since

views of such a man are worthy of the deepest consideration it was his intention at one time to introduce a bill into congress for the abolition of the death penalty his words now come to us in solemn
