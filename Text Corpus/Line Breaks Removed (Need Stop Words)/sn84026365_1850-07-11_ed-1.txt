he thinks is much injured just now by a certain pestilential potions respecting selfgovernment reform popular rights and so forth it is also the victim of a grand delusion called philanthropy the object of his nn measured scorn and reprobation what men most want is to be well dragooned instead of governing themselves they should be placed furfhwith under a salptpry despotism the people must be regimented and disposed under captains who should keep them to their work this blessed process mr carlyle imagines wopld accomplish our redemption and in the course of generations make us all once

following mr carlyle into the redtape jungle and introducing the doleful creatures that tenant it we must not omit to notioe a blot which deforms the opening pages oi the pamphlet on downingstreet our authoris the victim of a strange monomania on the subject ot negro emancipation he is positively mad exterhall has turned his brain certain aspects of philanthropy as there presented having disgusted him he vents his spleen relentlessly on his colored brethren even in a book on the political wants ot england he must go out of his way to renew his attack on the unhappy race which though long ages has endured utterable wrong from the cruelty and avarice of civil ised man and those sufferings if nothing eue should secure for it ras pectful sympathy to us t lie re is something unspeakably mournful in this perversion of genius mr carlyle starts with the proposition that there is something radically wrong in our sublime establishments in downmgstreet and that a reform in these must precede all other reloims whatsoever nvhat we want is not a reformed parliament but a reformed executive not a better talkingap paratus but a better actingappa ratus we suffer from want of wisdom in our rulers we have men in high places unfit for them work in bondage to traditions and formalities mere histrios and dexterous talkers instead of heroes and herculean men we must have abler rulers or perish the great practical question lor us is this can we by no industry energy utmost expenditure of human ingenuity and passionate invocation of the henvens and the earth get to attain some twelve or ten or six mento manage the affairs of this nation in downingstreet and the chief posts elsewhere who are abler for the work i than those we have been used to this god is the father of us all and all men are brethren frages will not be likely as yet to secure us the ablest men as govetoors the question then recurs how shall they be obtained mr carlyle can suggest no other method than this that we should pray for an increase of reverence for human intellect amongst as we shall certainly not object to this it is excellent in its way but gives us it must be confessed no immediate prospect of gaining our oligarchy of heroes the fact is that mr carlyle inspeaking for his remedy has begun at the wrong end he ignores the ex nsnnra ftsfanar tm evils thirty thousand men a cannaught fallen into potential cannibalism and the idle workhouse everywhere burstingthese terrible realities haunt him he infers hastily enough that the tendencies of the modern era are in a wrong direction thus our political reforms and principle of selfgovernment are a delusion he sees no safety but in submission toa few strong intellects that shall substitute divine order for the present chaos and maintain an obsolute con trol as we have seen he is unable to give us any receipt for obtaining and perpetuating our oligarchy of wisest and best in no way could he be sure of such his proposed remedy therefore is little better than a mockery after all but could we find tomorrow the able despots whom mr carlyle commends to us who could reform us and regiment us in the most approved style we should decline to accept them could wc be sure of a succession of good and wise despots which he could not we should prefer our present liberty with all its attendant evils the great lesson which the nations are learning in this epoch amidst many discouragements and much severe discipline that of self government we have all faith that they will master it in time and amidst their many blunders and the sad evils remitting therefrom the very process of acquiring it is not without its salutary fruits the stern experience of failures is teaching wisdom which indue season we doubt not will enable them to command success mr car lyles philosophy would almost seem to he the fruit of impatience he would seek to cure by the speedy application of force those evils which necessarily attend the evolution of

one or other of his followers for j heir blackguardism in pointedly and offensively carrying on an espionage over his conduct it would have been natural enough and what a very m id mannered sort of man might have been well prompted to by puch audacity this however we must suppose would in the free stale and under the equal laws which are theme of such bombastic praises not only from our yankee brethren but from their admirers here and elsewhere have subjected the hapless negro to being not merely isropped but in all likelihood lynched the free and enlightened we shrewdly surmisefrom reading the extract which we publish would in a burst of wild justice have lorn the wretch in pieces to understand fully the atrocity of tht conduct of these new york gentlemen ihe atrocity of the social code

has read and travelled and thought he has the mind and heartthe intellect and the fetling of a oran but his i lipv are somewhat thick his nose rathei flat i mmii i inn to frederick dougins mr dear friend on perusing your remarks on my letter to mr ward i perceive that your feelings hare been woucded because of the impression you are under lhai my strictures were intended to apply entirely to youtself and that i compared you to the mississippi ruffian this was not the case and no one i am persuaded who reads that letter will place any such construction upon it it would be useless lete for me to state the estimate that i set upon your talents and ability as a man among us i have often announced that with pen and voice and have ever felt proud that we had so noble a specimen of our oppressed and enslaved brethren who with a righteous indignation cursed the slaveholder spurned slavery and with the power of a hercules had riven the contemptible fetters that bound his manly form dashing them to atoms and walked fopth untrammeled as nature had designed ifim a godlike native nobleman i borrow not the term of native noble as applied to you for i find in the files of a paper before me the term used by myself towards you more than six years since believe i need no endorsement to prove my abiding if did i should apply tono other than yourself but this think will be conceded at once and should rot have sa d a woid on this point had not desired wastes w vwfietomtw to put at rest any miscomprehensions or misconstructions that might follow the tone ol your remarks the letter though addressed to mr ward contained atrictuies upon your late review o his course yet i will go and so intimated it mr ward an even length in attacking or condemning the posit on of mr ward on that occasion as stated by you but i cannot admit that in doing this ii is necessary to impugn his motives unless he was an avowed or known enemy which do not accuse you of charging designedly to injure mr ward but such my dear sir was the enor of your whole course towards him my letter was intended as much a review of past feelings that existed among you as for the presentas much to mr ward as yourself only on presumption as had no means of ascertaining his course toward you and indeed not only mr ward and yourself but that distinguished eloquent gentleman of whose manly beating and unexceptionable ability i have often borne testimonymr h h garnet but his name being disconnected with the late transaction i did not feel at libeity to drag it in although during the controversythe unfortunate unhealthy controversy that existed between you last summer and fall i sat down to write a letter similar to my recent one but forebore lest it would be received with a different feeling and spirit from that which it was intended and instead of good evil might result therefrom in the connection in which i made refei ence to the uncivilized vulgar attacks of the mississippi ruffian far very far be it from an intention on my part to liken you or any other gentlemen for whom i entertain sentt menis of respect and this tedairner was particularly made at the timel repeat that it was not so intended bu simply to illustrate the fact that the position occupied by those to whom i then addressed myself could easily be construed to emulate such persons only you re ji l ypwm he excep menu of the great body of the eople west when i say that it h to me painful in ihe extreme and mortifying to see talent usefulness ability and acknowledged greatness amoug our leading men unconscious though they may be of their attitude in the eyes of the public brought to no higher aim than driving each other into obscurity this dear air is precisely the position occupied by our great men as viewed by the scrutiny of public observation uncharitable though it be considered yet let the fsult be whose it may with which we have nothing to do there is true cause for such reflections subsequent to the publication of ray letter a friend placed in my hand the september number of the maryland colonization journal and although coming from an enemy everready to faultfind and torture yet its conductor dr haji is a competitor with whom i have had mjmyan editorial conflict and have found him generally candid generous highminded and more libera than might be expected of a cdonizaiionisi the article which i extract therefrom precedes the letter referred to copied fiom the njflh star and serves at least to show the bad impression such personal controversies make upon the public mind as the public has an indisputable tight to inquire io and pass judgment upon the acts and duisgsuf all public men and his letter but reifcratea the true spirit of the controversy t trow thormttlotn svmrn jrr i other considering the intense sympathy manifested for the slaves by abolitionists itis a matter of astonishment that so little jraler j tiling xit between these philanthropists lor each other i rom all quarters we hear of strife and wranglings not only between the whites where it might reasonably be expected but between the colored leaders hem selves asa specimen of this interchange of friendships offerings we copy a letter from the rev h h garnet a colored man f education and trlents to his brother and fellowlaborer frederick douglass it is one f the most able and most courteous of the class wo have seen it seems this being lionized in england causes no little jealousy and heartburning among our colored adven turers hat i have written has been dene in jove as an act of justice not only to yourself and our deai and esteemed friends and brothers ward and garnet but also our people at large and the cause in whicli you have em barked lot me repeat again that what i have said in humbleness is exeupt from all attempts of censure believing that whatever errors do exist are the result of oversight and not design and that a suggestion alone is sufficient to induce a sufficient remedy and that greatness should fully appreciate the design of one however humble and obscure when approaching you with every manifestation of kindred sincerity with every hope and desire for your continuance prosperity and eventual success in the sacred cause of our elevation i am dear sir oure for god and humanity m r del any pittsburgh july copenhagen ib of th n o h redekick douglass although our national legislation the past season has been as good as could have been expected it is a disgrace to a free people when we look at the opposing elements of liberty and slavery that are in the natirwif i j n ciaa guoiip mast meeting of colored citizens at a mam meeting of the colored citizens of pittsburgh and alleghany cities june th convened in the basement of the wley fcireet church to take into considers tioo a case of kidnapping which has recently taken place in our midst by unanimous consent thomas norris was called to the chair and john n ttnettron chosen ss secretary the chairmen havhg taken his seat called on the rev a r green to open the meeting w ith prayer after which the chairman biiefly stated the object of the meeting the following preamble and resolutions were presented and read to the meeting by dr m r delany chairman of the committee which on motion were received whereas by an act of congress of i the right of seizure of a person claimed asa fugitive slave by the person calling himself master is made sacred and inviolable and whereas by the power vested any white man has a right to claim seze bind and carry away into bondage any colored person at any time and from any place as his own slave without the semblance of s trial or legal inter feranco from any source provided the contrary is not proven by law the weight of w hich proof rests on the defendant and whereas it is known to be difficult with si great majority of cases to prove their freedom according to the requirements of law the difficulty being mttcii greater with those free hy birthright and frequently impossible thereby the more endangering the liberty vf i fi r fd persons wherever located in the r united states tnererore oe n l resolved lhai the time has fully arrived when it becomes imperatively necessary that we should enter into some judicious and effective measures for the protection of our wives children and ourselves resolved that we have learned with astonishment surprise and alarm of ihe f decoy seizure and carrying away into slavery of a colored man on thursday the ih inst from the livery stable of benjamin f hancock on fifth street pittsburgh by a white man by the name of ellis in the employment of hancock the name of which colored man we have not yet been ab e to learn and from the previous conduct of ihe aad htncock while acting as one of the city constables in a base attempt in assisting ezekel showers of martinsburgh a virginia slaveholder in kidnapping violet strickland of this city we have every reason lo believe the said benjamin f hancock guilty of partjcipalioo in the late nefarious transaction resolved that we cannot feel ourselves safe while such outrages are committed with impunityspreading desolation around our hearts and firesides ravaging she sacred ties of relationship and self protection compels us to use every lawful means in our powei in ferreting out the particulars of this case and biioging the guilty parties lo justice if p byto be had resolved that we have good reasons to believe that there are some other persons covertly concerned ip the abduction of this unfortunate man prompted only so to do by the impulses of their prejudices aud desire to enslave the colored people and duty as well as selfrespect requires us to find out such persons and furwarn and caution all colored persons and friends of humanity and lovers of liberty generally i avoid patronising supporting or in any way encouraging such peisons in business of whatever frow they may be ngagedas we are determined to distinguish between our friends and our enemies resolved that we recommend to the colored people throughout the nonslavehold tng states to coincide with us by the adoption of similar resolutions as the time lias come when we must stand by our own rights or fal still deeper into degradation the mangled victims of ireachery and despo titin aud that we will pe ition congress against all proceedings in any way infringing upon our liberties those states wjtere the law provides against this violence n is permitted it done in a quiet and peaceable manner thus shielding the claimant from litigation and it must be forcibly apparent that in a great majority ol caaes it is a difficult matter for any person according to the requirements of law to prove their freedom the difficulty being greater in l cases with those free by birthright and frequently impossible thereby endangering the liberties of each and every colored person wherever located in the united states as for illustration one or more persons in the south becoming free by emmncipaiion or the putchase of their liberty according to the laws of those states hsve their titles and privileges immediately recorded which may at any time be referred m by a recourse to book volume and folio as security to themselves and offsprings therefore in the event of such persons recently after becoming free being reclaimed according to the act of congress made and provided for the arrest of fugitives not only may the recorda be obtained in their defence but their former holders and many other persons competent to defend may still be surviving with full recollection of all the concurrent circumstances so that in he event of a destruction of the records which may occur by fire or otherwise they have still the living witness in their behalf but not so with those born free in the nonslaveholding states and consequently without the necessity of recordpioof of theii freedom also those from the slaveholding states who have for any length of time bteii at liberty because in ihe event of the absence of tecordproof and the demise of those having personal knowledge of the transactions any such persons claimed under the act ot would be left to the mercy and discretion of tbe claimant and theicfore without anv recourse or redress wtiatctcr in view of all these circumstances alarming and teinble in their aspect thereby subjecting our hearths and firesitjps ro dismay and desolation our wives our children end ourselves to outrages against which all other americans are most sacredly and securely protected and at the thought of which every feeling of humanity recoils and claiming io be american citizens by birth education association and in every relation known to ameiicar therefore we the colored people of alleghany county in the slate of pennsylvania do most respectfully and solemnly remonstiate and petition against the provisions of the act of congress relative to the recapture of fugitive slaves and against all and every act bill or provision now in existence or that may hereafier be introduced into eiihet house of congress of the united states in any way or manner infringing upon our liberties as american citizens resolved that our people throughout the united states be requested to adopt this or similar memorials to be as unanimously signed as soon as possible by male and female iand torwarded immediately to congress a thought or two about the late antislavery convention by m hobbs the late antislavery convention held in boston was one of the most distinguished and efficient ever convened in the country whether we look at its measures its men or its discussions we come to one and the same conclusion it signally marked by valor mind energy union putpose heart soul life its meetings from day t day were a series of active and efficient effort directed by plan principle jove devotion earnettness when such are the elements ofa body ot men il need not be wondered that its result will mark histqrize the time the sterling abilitythe chivalric fortitude the mental acumenhe talent at extempore oratorytie powers at argumentationi the manly eloquence of the heart as well as of the head and tongue were indeed admirable and we think were never surpassed by any assembly of any kind or nature in the country among those who took an active part in theodore p r l igartii bhhhhfenl iimiana ondly the mm of extraordinary ability energy and perseverance that are gathered around it in these two elements wo find the sequel the philosophy of the power tint has built up strengthened and made healrby this body and it is these elements in their steady and irresistible action that now wield a power on the genera seniimcnt of the country that is feared by one section of the isnd ss much as it is admired by the other we repeat that these conventions affect it q public opinion to a measureless extent this pinion alters and shifts its position every year to get imo the geniality and reason of the advancing light men see feel act and every motion wafts them on these same antislavery grounds they cant help it reason reason common sense humanity duly religion our noblest interests and aspirations hope god will be obeyed if men thinkand think with their btains consciences souls conceptions of right and justice they must come to the right conclusions and tight grounds lo these grounds no one who attended this convention could but be impressed with the fact that the anti slavery party is having s most rapid energetic and healthy growth the crowds that filled the capacious metodeon lor four consecutive

contrary to the declared wishes and order of that government he understood that that expedtion had not only sailed but had escaped the spanish cruiiere at sea and had actually landed in lhat island hi hope was that those piratefor the individual composing that expedition and going to plunder and make war on an unoffending peopie were nothing elae bu pirateswould meet with condign punishment he wished to know whether any communication of the sailing of that piratical expedition had ben made by the american minister iu this countiy to her majesty r government he considered the government of the united states though of a republican class to be a respectable government and he hoped that it had power and strength enough to prevent it subjects irom engaging in a piratical expedition upon a large scab against a peaceful anj unoffending people the marquis of lansdowne replied that it he had the good fortune to meet his noblt and learned friend yesterday he did not know that ho could have giver him any further information than that which he was ready t give him at prsssnt this piratical expedi tionfor a piratical expedition it certainly was ad th it too of the very worst descrip slon

fjally succeeded in landing at cardenas lord brougham would have been much better satisfied if the american government had gone something further lhan the mere disclaiming and repudiating that expedition that expedit on was formed for the express purpose of practicing piracy and piracy of the worst description private plunde was s great wrong to indivirtuals but in this case an expedition was collected of fome or men with the intention of carrying fire and sword with a view to subsequent plunder into an unoffending countiy not only fn amity with ua but with the united states the marquis of lansdowne ought to have stated lhat the government of the united states had not only disclaimed and repudiated this expedition but had actually given orders to the commanders of its avustjipns and its cruisers tp stop and prevent it in case it sailed from the ports of the united siatea or in case it were met upon th open seas lord brougham considered lhat statement to be a satisfactory addition to lhat which had cen previously made by the noble marquis ha could ro s however understand how pgoo or men could be armed and sent off from the united states without the knowledge of the government theie the eirl of aberdeen had no doubts s to the iiiicerty of the proceeding of the government of the untied states on this subject it ha i lo ig been supposed that cuba was an obj ct ol desire to vaiioua power we had ourselves been suspected of looking with an eye of desire upon that island and he recollected weli that when twenty years ago we were suspected of unlawful designs against cuba he had proposed that the uniied state and france should concur with us in guaranteeing that island to the crown of spain the untied state however refusd to accede to that proposal he hoped that the force in that island was sufficient to give agood account of the buccaneer who bd undertaken this expedition lord brougham as a lawyer not unac qiainted with the

he was not aware that there was anything like a duty incumbent either on the house collectively ot on noble peers individually to stop an inquir merely because the minister gave an answet with which another peer thought that tbr house should be satisfied the answer which had been given them that evening by host who were supposed to be in the seciet jus amounted to this that there was no secret to tell what ministers had to d them this opening was nothing more than this wt have no certain knowledge on the question ft was however a very serious question the law was clear that these men wet pirates there should be no delicacy about treating them as pirates though they wen six thousand or eight thousand in number they should be treated as rajah brooke had treated the pirates whom he met

had made us lukewarm with respect to interfering with that expedition ureal culpability would rest on the heads other majestys government earl greythue who had heard the speech of his noble friend and colleague must be aware that he had condemned this expedition in terms quite as strong as those employed by the noble and learned lord opposite he had described a as a piratical expedition of the veiy worst character it was one thing to call on the government to make a statemeut of that description and anolhet to call upon it to explain the nature of the instructions which were sent to the com manderin chief of our naval forces in the west indies to answer such a question would be not only inconvenient but detrimental to the public service it was not until further inform itton was receivej from that quarbr of the globe that her majestys ministers would be justified in answering that question no one doubted our right to check a piratical expedition but it was very difficult to determine

hardly expected but as it has resulted in the rejection of slavery by the people of the territory we heartily rejoice in it it has already raised the wrath of the south and all manner of threats are

the toil of the night but while these thoughts were agitating my mind the day dawned upon me in the midst of an open extent of countrywhere the only shelter i could find without risking travel by daylight was a corn shock but a tew hundred yards from the road and here i must pass my first day out the day was an unhappy one my hidingplace was extremely precarious i had to sit in a squatting position the whole day without the least chance to rest but besides this my scanty pittance did not afford me that nourishment which my hard nights travel needed night came again to my relief and i sallied forth to pursue my journey by this time nota crumb of my crust remained and i was hungry and began to feel the desperation of distress as i traveled i felt my strength failing and my spirits wavered my mind was a deep and melancholy dream it was cloudy i could not see my star and had serious misgivings about my course in this way the night passed away and just at the dawn of day i found a few sour apples and took my shelter under the arch of a small bridge that crosted the road here i passed the second day in ambush night came on and he once more proceeded on his wearisome journey i requently he was overcome with hunger and fatigue and sat down and slept fora few minutesat the dawn of day he saw a toll bar and here he ventured to ask the best way to philadelphia this information he received and set off in the right direction his taking the open road was fatal shortly he was observed by a man who was vigilant in detecting runaway negroes and by him he was ordered to give an account of himself after a little parley james took to his heels buta hue and cry being raised he was speedily captured led to a tavern as a prisoner his fate appeared to be no longer doubtful to all questionings james persisted in saying he was a free man but he could produce no papers and his case was desperate here takes place what the writer calls a moral dilemma in imminent risk of being sent back to slavery and punishment was he justified in trying to escape by telling a falsehood we may hope that the recording angel will blot out the unfortunate negros offence against truth on this occasion james fabricated story was ingenious he had belonged to a slavetrader who had been taken ill and died of small pox while on his way to georgia with a lot of slaves several of the gang also died of this infectious disease and no one claiming or wishing to have anything to do with the survivors they all dispersed on hearing this account the assembled bystanders moved off toa respectable distance and some voted for letting him go he was however retained during the day and received some food which was the first meal he had eaten since sunday towards night being watched only by a boy he contrived to slip away and again was lost to pursuit among the woods wandering in darkness the north star being shrouded in murky clouds and stumbling through bushes ant marshy grounds the miserable fugitive was totally at a loss as to what course to pursue at a venture says he i struck northward in search of the road after several hours ol i zig zag and laborious travel dragging through briars thorns runvines emerged from the wood and found myself wading marshy ground and ovei ditches i can form no correct idee of this distance i traveled but i came to a road i should think about three oclock in the morning it so happened that i came where there was t fork in the road of three prongs no arose a serious querywhich is the right prong former i was remindei by the circumstance of a superstition firoverb among the slaves that tin eft hand turning is unlucky but ai had never been in the habit of placing faith in this or any similar super stitition i am not aware that it had tini least weight upon my mind as i hat the same difficulty with the right ham turning after a few moments parlej with myself i took the central pronj of the road and pushed on with all mj speed it had not cleared off but i fresh wind had sprung up it was chilly and searching this with my we clothing made me very uncomfortable my nerves began to quiver before tv searching wind the barking of mas lifts the crowing of fow ls and the d tant rattling of market wagons warned me that day was approaching at this juncture h sees a farm established with a sma hovellike barn and into this he glaaly skulked am buried himself among tiie straw hen he lay the whole thursday his onl danger being the yelping of a smal dog who had noticed his entrance into the barn in the course of the nf ternoon he heard with terror the noisi of horsemen who passed in search o himthey spoke a few words to thi farmer mentioning that the runawa j nigger was a blacksmith and that i reward of two hundred dollars was offered for his recovery it was now to evident that the country was arouset on the subject of his escape nigh came and he was again on the route but speed was out of the question all i could do was o keep my legs ii r motion and this j continued to do will the utmost difficultythe latter par of the night i suffered extremely fron cold there came a heavy frost expected at every moment to fall on thi road and perish i came to a cornfield covered with heavy shocks of indian corn that had been cut i wen into this and got an ear and thei crept into one of the shocksate a much of it as i could and thought would rest and start again hut wear nature could not sustain the operatioi of grinding corn lor his own nourish meat and i sunk to sleep when awoke the sun was shining around started with alarin but it was too lat to think of seeking another shelter therefore nestled myself down ary j concealed myself as best as i coub from the light of day after recover a little from my fright i common ced eating my whole corn grain bj grairi l worked away at it when mj jaws grew tiv a flften did j would rest and then be k ir thds although i began an breakfast i was nearly the whole of the forenoon before i had done nothing of importance occurred during the day until about the middle of the afternoon when was thrown into a panic by the appearance of a party of gunners who passed near me with their dogs after shooting one or two birds however and passing within a few rods of my frail covering they went on and left me once more in hope friday night came without any other incident worth raming as i sallied out i felt very evident benefit from the oar of corn i had nibbled away my strength was considerably renewed though i was far from being nourished i felt that my life was at least safe from death by hunger thus encouraged i set out with better speed than i had made since sunday and monday night he now believed himself to be near the boundary line of pennsylvania and under this impression skipped and sang for joythe day dawned and the fugitive continued his course on the public road what ensued may bein his own words a little after the sun rose i came in sight of a toll gate for a moment all the events which followed my passing a toll gate on wednesday morning came fresh to my recollection and produced some hesitation but at all events said i will try agaiu on arriving at the gate i found it attended only by an elderly woman whom i afterward learned was a widow and an excellent christian woman i asked her if i was in pennsylvania on being informed that i was i ask her if she knew where i could get employment she said she did not but advised me to go to w w t quaker who lived about three miles from her whom i would find to take at interest in me she gave me directions which way to take i thanked her and bade her good morning and was very careful to follow her directions in about half an hour i stood at the door of w wafter knocking the door opened upon a comfortablespread table the sight of which seemed at once to increase my hunger sevenfold not daring to enter l said i had been sent to him insearch of employment well said he come in and take thy breakfast and get warm these words spoken by a stranger but with such an air of simple sincerity and fatherly kindness made an overwhelming impression upon my mind they made me feel in spite of all my fear and timidity that i had in the providence of god found a friend and a homehe at once gained my confidence and i felt that l might confide to him a fact which i had as yet confided to no one from that day to this whenever i discover the least disposition in my heart to disregard the wretched position of any poor or distressed persons with whom i meet i call to mind these words come in and take thy breakfast and get warm they invariably remind me of what i was at that time my condition was as wretched as that of any human being can psssibly he with the exception of the loss of heath or reason i had but four pieces of clothing about my person having left all the rest in the hands of my captors i was a starving fugitive without home or friends a reward offered for niy person in the public papers pursued by cruel manhunters and no claim upon him to whose door i went had he turned me away i must have perished nay he took me in and gave of his food and shared with me his own garments such treatment i had never before received from the hands of any white man we have copied the whole of this passage its simple eloquence is the best tribute that can be paid to that spirit of benevolence which so universally distinguishes the society of friends by vv w cf it might be imprudent to give the whole name ol this good man the wretched wanderer was as he tells us fed clothed and employed not only so but was instructed in reading writing and much useful knowledge here for the first time also did he learn one word of the truths of religion as my friend poured light intomy mind i saw the darkuess it amazed and grieved me beyond description sometimes i sank down under the load and became discouraged and dared not hope that i could ever succeed in acquiring knowledge enough to make me happy or useful to my fellowbeings my dear friend w w however had a happy tact to inspire me with confidence and he perceiving my stato of mind exerted himself not without success to encourage
