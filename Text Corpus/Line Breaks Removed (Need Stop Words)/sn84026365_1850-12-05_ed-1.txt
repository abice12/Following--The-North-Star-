fact worthy of notice and one which may be properly mentioned here that almost simultaneously with the introduction of the fugitive slave bill in congress was a project started for the revival of the old scheme of colonization early in the session a certain judge bryan of alabama memorialized congress for authority on the part of himself and his associates to establish a line of african mailsteamers to run between new orleans and other american seaports and liberia one of the principal objects of which it was professed should be the suppression of the african slavetrade mr webster in his infamously memorable speech of the th of march indirectly but strongly lent his support to this move menta few years since it may be remembered mr webster in declining to act on a coriunittee appointed ata colonization meeting in boston said emphatically i understand the whole project ll is a scheme of the slaveholders to get rid of lltetr free negroes i jeill hare noticing to ao tpith but in his recent speech he held the following language if any gentleman from the south shall propose a scheme of colonization to be carried on by this government upon a large scale for the transportation of free colored people to any colony oi to any place in the world i should be quite disposed to incur almost any degree of expense to accomplish that ob ject there have been received into the treasury of the united states eighty millions of dollars the proceeds of the ales of the public lands ceded by virginia if the residue should be sold at the north star frederick douglass editor and proprietor vol no the same rate the whole aggregate will exceed two hundred millions of dollars if virginia and the south see fit to adopt any proposition to relieve themselves from the free people of color among them they have my free consent that the government pay them any sum of money out fits proceeds which may he adequate to the purpose the tendency of this speech was to prepare congress to look with favor upon the project of judge bryanand in the course of the session the naval committee to whom it was referredre ported in favor of its adoption they recommended iftilt per cent stock with a credt of thirty years be advanced to judge bryan and his associates for the construction of three mail steamers to sail alternately every month from new orleans baltimore and new york that the am ri ean colonization society shall have the privilege ol sending at each voyage of me of these steamships as many as free colored emigrants at lo ipiece for adults and apiece for children and that the government ihall have power to take any and all of said steamships for war purposes by jaying cost of construction and a cotn nission of ten per centum r i he whole iffair is an illconcealed attempt to five the support ol the government to he scheme ot the american ooloniza ion society and to fill the pockets of i few il treasury under the pretence of luilding up the navy and suppressing he african slavetrade it finds favor vith the slaveholders at the south be sause it promises to rid them of an ele nent dangerous to the safety of their ostitution and pleases the negro ha ers at the north by proposing to de iver them from the objects of their iversion viewed in any light it de lerves nothing but execration and op lositiou from every true friend of the iolored man it proposes at each nonthly trip of its steamers to carry out o africa free negroes that is km a year how such a number iso be induced to go whether by coer ion or persuasion it is not stated hut rom the circumstance of its coming ast does hand in hand with the law or he recapture of fugitive slaves and sustained as it is by the men who were ictive in the passage of that measureit s not unreasonable to suppose that lome degree of force direct or indirect is ultimately contemplated theres such a thing as compelling people to folunteerjv an expedient which the colonization society very well understand laws have been passed under he influence of that society iucreas ng the burdens and diminishing the privileges of the free people af color with the hope of inducing them to emigrate but thus far thank heaven they lave most signally failed of their purpose our colored friends have until his time been proof equally against the persuasions and the persecutions of their oppressors and that they are now going to change either their feelings or their course of action on this subject we have not the least reason to believe they have with remarkable unanimity opposed the american colonization society from the beginning and denounced every project lhat contemplated their removal from this country declaring their purpose never to leave the soil ot their natrvity nor tor sake their brethren in bondage in this they are clearly right and deserve to receive the support of all true friends of freedom let them maintain their position and this new scheme for their expatriation will fail as signally ns all others that have gone before it the union and the fugitive slave law f a priva le letter communicated for the tribune saturday nov after these remarks somewhat diffusive and excursive it is acknowledgedit is i trust unnecessary for me to say i am as i always have been for the union at whatever sacrifices and at all hazards i am also of course for the law without which that union would be a curse rather than a blessing i did not mean to say that there is nothing in the constitution or law that would not admit ela salutary change but i do mean to say that it is the dutythe imperative duty of an american citizen anywhere and everywhere to bow in obedience to the law so long as it continues tc bt the law nevertheless i am utterly opposed to theprinciples of the recent fugitiue slave bill and will legitimately contribute all in m power toward its modification and repeal that it is unjust i have no doubt but it canreadily be shown so tar as itis unjust it is ineffective that it is in some respects unconstitutional have as little doubt but so far as it is unconstitutional it is virtually no law and probably will be so declared by the appropriate tribunal it is unjust because it offers a bribe to the commissioner who shall surrender an alleged fugitive to his claimant ten dollars for slavery and bul five for labertyt it is unjust because it allows exparlt evidenceor to speak more criticall and technically exparte testimony tc be received against the alleged fugitive which upon no principle known tc the common law could be received upon the claim of a horse or a dog itis unjust because it sacrifices the sovereignty and dignity of our own state to a mean subserviency to the clamor rapacity and overweening pretension of other state u is uncomtitutmal because it p right is of no sex truth is of no color god is t father of us all and all men are brethren points commissioners or rainer authorizes united states judges to appoint themwhich commissioners are invested with high judicial powers in re j gard to the liberty of the citizen white well as black wno is an alleged fugitive from service for under this law any white boy or man in any state in the union may be arrested and carried into any other state upon a mere summary hearing founded upon testimony taken in his absence and of course without cool examinationo catiou of imyof itic usuatteat oftruth f on i show hie true color of this law y divesting it for a time of the complexion with which it is usually associ ated that congress has the right to appoint judges no man questions the president nominates and congress confirms such is the provision of the constitution but whence congress derives the authority to impart to the judges thus appointed the power to create other judges under the title of commissioners which other judges or commissioners by their decision may deprive their victim of the benefit ol the habeas corpus i may be wrong in all this i lay no claim to infallibility and all i can say is thafi whenever i shall be satisfied ol my error i shall be most happy to cor tect it you willpardon me for having thought proper lo say thus much upon a subject ro which the question in your letter obviously relates my attention shall now be directed to the letter itself you are perfectly right in believing that for the last thirty years i have been engaged as counsel in almost every important case of alleged fugitives from justice brought before our judges and courts in philadelphia and always on the part of the fugitive and hope it will not be immodest for for me to add that my services have not been confined to this state that they have rather been the services of aman to his lellowmen a lawyer to hir client and that i have never upbn an occasion here or elsewhere or from anybody received one farthings compensation for my humble efforts on behalf of human liberty and in vindication of human rights my only inducement was a sense of conscientious duty and ask no other earthly reward as i have elsewhere intimated thanthis simple inscription on my humble tomb here lies the friend of the frit ndless although my dear sir i cannot say of you as you have said of me that you have been engaged in lehalfof alleged fugitives i will at least do you the justice to say though if may be considered but a negative compliment that i have never during that period of time in a single instance known you to have been enlisted or engaged against them you ask me if i remember any instance in which a colored man has been delivered to his claimant and in which i have reason to believe lie had been adjudged to be a slave contrary to the truth of the case i answer you very frankly and freely that i never have thanks to the humane interference o that society which was established under the auspices of benjamin franklin and aided by the zeal and talent of such men as william lewis william rawle jared ingersoll john sergeant and others and with thanks also to those upright impartial and independent judges by whom the rights of the parties were finally determined i wish could stop acre but i have known hundreds who have been illegally and unjustly claimed and i think you will agree with me that it requires little casuistry to detrmine that such claims or traffic cannot be justified or excused merely because in their result they proved unsuccessful in addition to this i have known attempts of the most shameful character to impose upon the alleged fugitive in every variety of way that cupidity could suggest or cruelty adopt can you then wonder mj dear sir that with a mind imbued by such facts the friends of the oppressed should look with great caution great jealousy if you please upon almost every claim that may be preferred against these unhappy beings there is no disposition or at all events no effort to defeat the legitimate claimant jn his demand all that is required is that he shall show his titleshow it satisfactorily to the court and there is anend of it but when he selects doubtful agentsor exhibits a doubtful title or fails in proof of identity or purchases the slave running from any one who will sell him certainly the constitution never designed that such claims should succeed and such has been the general character of the claims that have been defeated very respectfully and truly yours david paul brown from the pittsburgh visitor womans rights convention and people op color dear mrs swissiielm ln the last visitor you say of a resolution relating to people of color offered by mr wendell phillips in the late convention of women at worcester mass we are pretty nearly out of patience with the dogged perseverance with which so many of our reformers persist in their attempt to do everything at once and again in a womens rights convention j the question of color hat no right to a hearing it seemed as though the usually kindly spirit and good judgment of the visiter were a

and mr phillips has ever been very watchful to prevent any other topic from creeping to whatever platform he occupied devoted to any particular reform and those two worda look strange indeed to some of us standing in connection with his name and the resolutions to which you have taken exception but by way of explanation or if you please apology permit me to say that colored persons arc held in such estimation in this country that you must specify them whenever or wherever you mean to include them lyceums circuses menageries ballrooms billiardrooms conventions everything the public are respectfully invited to attend but who ever drepmed that the public meant anything colored from church and theatre from stagecoach steamship and creeping canalboat from the infant school law school and theological seminary from museum athenaeum and public garden the colored race are either excluded altogether or are admitted only by sufferance or some very special arrangement and under disadvantages to which no white person would or should submit for a moment fr e masons must be whiteboth face and apron odd fellows too must be constitutionally light of skin and even the sons of temperance and daughters likewise must be bleached to the popular complexional standard or they are beyond the reach of sal vation the methodist discipjine provides for separato colored conferences the episcopal church shuts out some of its own most worthy ministers from clerical recognition on account of their color nearly all denominations of religionists have cither a written or unwritten law to the same effect in boston even there are churches whose pews are positively forbidden by corporate mandate from being sold to any but v respectable white persons our incorporated cemeteries are often it not always deeded in the same manner even our humblest village grave yards generally have either a negro corner or refuse colored corpses altogether and did our power extend to heaven or hell we should have complexional salvation and colored damnation unless vre could first blot the unfortunate unfashionable race altogether and forever out of ex istence we have striven to separate the ethiopian from all claim to human recognition and human sympathy nobody but abolitionists ever mean colored people no matter how often they speak of the public or of their fellow citizens or fellowsinners we have proscribed our colored brethren every wayeverywhere and under the late fugitive slave law everv colored man is to be presumed a slave unless there is proof positive to the contrary and if any one is only claimed and sworn to as a slave such proof is at once made impossible before this law was enacted his life was was a lingering torture before we were killing him by exclusion and oppression now we are murdering him with fear we have barbed the iron arrows that pierced him we have poisoned the fangs which were already tearing him in pieceswe have heated red hot the chains that bound him as in adamant before we have separated him from us by a gulf which has neither shore nor bottom so far as human sympathy and regard are concerned almost everywhere the horse and hound are as human as he and his race know it and feel it as we cannot even the womens convention demonstrated this for scarcely a colored person man or woman appeared in it on the large committees appointed to carry out the plans of the convention embracing many persons in all not a single colored member was placed itis to be presumed that nobody thought of it for we are not expected to think of colored people at all undr such circumstances is il strange it unpardonable sin is il dogged ponweranceto declare ina cnnvntiim culled to demand and extend i n rights of women that we menu women of sable as well as sallow complexion ol the carved in ebony a well as the chisssled in ivory if we did thus mean jthe convention should not have been held or being held it would only deserve the scorn and contempt of every friend of god and hia children color was not discussed thereit need not have been but it was needed that the declaration be made in regard to it thai any women have

proceeding at a proslavery lecture given in this city a few evenings since at which i son of senator soule from louisiana undertook to enlighteo the good peoph of worcester upon the subject of conquering their prejudices and support ingthe fugitive slave law hi i plenty of itjw w orleans and nor cester decidedly the richest public exhibition of the season came oftin this city on wednesday evening it having been announced during the day by means ol large posters that mr neville soul son of senator soule ol louisiana would hold forth at w ar ren hall upon ihe subject of the fugitive slave law and the importance ola union of all parties for the preservation ofhe union the hall was filled at the appointed hour and the meeting was called to order by e b stoddard esq who disclaimed all sympathy with its objects and stated that he consented to do so only through motives of personal friendship for mr soule who was a fellowstudent of the cambridge law school he informed the meeting that it would be necessary to choose a chairman but the liouor of presiding not seeming to he coveted by any one and several unsuccessful attempts having been madeto induce some person to take the chair it was finally suggested tlrat mr soule should go ahead with his remarks without a chairman which he did at once in a style which we think would have done credit to senator foote he alluded to the j contemplated meeting in boston for the purpose of recalling the people of massachusetts to a sense of their constitutional obligations and read the call for the same with a list of some oi the signers first among whom in close juxtaposition wo noticed the names of wm appleton daniel webster and charles goidon par nobile frat rum he said it was the wish of the people of boston that worcester should send a large delegation and that after the meeting any persons present could have the privilege of signing the call here the audience brake forth in peals of hearty laughter but mr s not at all abashed dashed away into the middle of his subject and went on with a doleful story about northern aggressions upon the rights of the south hethen flourished the sword of his rhetoric about the head and shoulders of henry clay and shook out the political liver and lights of that distinguished statesman as a dog would a woodchuck he thought that daniel webster was a true patriot and deeply regretted that the people ol massachusetts had turned such a deaf ear to lus counsels he then invoked the spirits of our ancestors to the assistance of mr webster and assured the audience that the threats against the union made at the south did really mean something and that if the ultraists of the north persisted in their course they would rend the union he then undertook to show that it was necessary in order to conciliate the south always to preserve the equilibrium of slave and free states never would the south submit to a majority no she had letter sit forever under the sway of nicholas of russia the north had shown her power ir the st congress she had trampieu on the south laughter long continued at which the speaker seemed amazed vv e will resist and we will have the consolation that the harder the struggle the more glorious the triumph you have in passing the calitornia bill said he violated the constitution and destroyed the equality of shares much laughter he then quoted from mr calhoun and sam houston and wound up this part of the speech with the declaration that no civilized people were ever so oppressed as the south was by the north and no other people would have so long and so patiently submitted to the indignities placed upon them what is to be done now submit no death were preferable to such dishonor it the fugitive slave law is not enforced do you suppose said he that the south will submit if they do may they be consumed to ashes before it shall be said as it was by cromwell the lord has delivered them into our hands here the speaker paid another passing tribute to the exgodlike senator from massachusetts and especially commended the patriotic speech of thof june and then went off in a rantankerous explodation against abo litonists having exhausted by their redundancy in his rhetoric all the figures of speech be was master of he next proceeded to open the understandings of his audience by the figures of arithmetic and went into a calculation to show the pecuniary value to the south of the slaves who had run away in the last thirty years he estimated that forty millions of dollars would be required to satisfy the south on this score as the north had sheltered the negroes and not delivered them in accordance with the constitution and they were bound in honorand in law to pay this just claim of the sooth tbe north owed it it was spoliation and robbery of the south and we all knew that tie refusal to render indemnity for spoliations had in ail aga been considered just cause for baring the sword and redressing wrong by that last resort the north talked about humanity when the meaning of the word was utterly unknown among them laughter but we have no time or space to termss per anniw livariably avaif s things said by this sprig of chivalry suffice it to say that we in common j with ail present felt grateful to the gentleman for his visit as a lad re marked upon the stairs after it was over it was better than the theatre and twice as good as the circus when the gentleman had relieved himself of bis pent up magniloquence upon a unanimous rail nf trrvrrnretr esq came lorward and in behalf of the meeting thanked mr soule for the interesting exhibition ho had made of himself but for his kindness in coming here many present might have never had the opportunity of listening to a real southern speech such as the fireeaters at the south were in the habit of regaling themselves upon and it was indeed gratifying to all to hear the talk of the young gentleman from cambridge mr maxwell then took up the points of the gentlemans speech seriatim and in astrain of eloquent railery and keenest sarcasm which kept the audionce in aroar of laughter and in which mr soule could not help participating showed the absurdity and folly of all the assumptions of the gentleman from the south other gentlemen addressed the meeting in a more serious strain but was the prevailing sentiment that ruled the hour the meeting had no chairman but with the exception of irrepressible bursts of laughter at soules folly and maxwells wit the proceedings were conducted with good order and decorum and the only regret among our citizens yesterday seemed to he that a wider notice had not been given and a larger hall obtained so that more might have been present to see the fun and participate in the proceedings of a union meeting a unanimous vote of thanks to mr soule was passed by acclamation and the meeting adjourned in the happiest possible mood w o had amost forgotten to mention that one signature to the call for

d ult to hear the report of a committee on resolutions appointed at a previous meeting i he meeting was organized by calling e w fields to the chair and appointing j mcsimpson secretary the chairman of the committee submitted the following preamble and resolutions which were adopted whereas we hold these truths tobe selfevident that all men were created free and equal and whereas the fugitive slave law takes from us all these rights and urges on and supports slavery in all its forms in free as well as slave states and not only deprives us of our liberties but infringes greatly upon the rights of those of our white friends who would do us good therefore resolved that we treat this law with utter contempt and that we will never in any case yield to any of its unjust requirements first because it isin direct opposition to the laws of god and secondly because it is detrimental to the peace and safety of all clasess and parties in the united states whereas the fugitive slave law gives us no chance of self protection nor self defence neither by law nor by mig t therefore resolved that we will doall we canto have this law repealed both by praying to god for the outpouring of his spirit to soften the hard and unfeeling hearts of our lawgivers and by petitioning them for its repeal until it is blotted out resolved that we will throw the arms of protection around our fugitive brethren and sisters and that we wil feed hem and clothe them concea whem and assist them in their escape from the negro hounds and blood men and we will perform all the deed of love and mercy toward them that lie in our power let the consequences b what they may resolved that whatever dissection there may now be among us on othei subjectsor whatever prejudices wt may entertain against each other

municipality yesterday and who has resided in this city for many years upon the state of public opinion here upon the slavery question we were altogether amazed and confounded to hear him declare his belief that if the question of the abolition of slavery in louisiana were submitted to the people of new orleans the question would be carried by a twothird vote believing ourselves that so monstrous a proposal could not command a five per cent vote out of the whole population we mentioned the subject to several of our friends and though they all agreed that the opinion expressed was extravagant and excessive we were hardly less amazed and confounded to hear them admit as they distinctly did that upon such an issue it was doubtful upon which side the majority of the citizens of new orleans would be found we are constrained to admit that the gentlemen referred to have had greater opportune ties than we have to come to a safe and soilhd conclusion upon such a matter but the solace we derive from the counter opinions which have always been ours are altogether too precious and conservative of the peace and of the rights of the south to be parted with and surrounded but upon fuller

deputy i must say that though can see no evidence of any particular activity n d energy on their part it seems to me there does not sufficiently appear any cause for the censure of their conduct or the removal of the marshall from office he thinks a mote commendable activity might have been manifested by them but says that they acted in consultation with mr hughes the agent who states that he has no ground of complaint against them mr attorney general in the closing paragraph of his communication to the president makes an indecorous display of his own feel ings if i could have discovered

some few have done so it is true out the great majority of persons who have lost slaves have as yet taken no action to recover them it is desired at the south and will be urged in congress this winter to amend the fugitive slave law by adopting the amendment of list spring which was then lost to remunerate from the public treasury the owners of such slaves who may fad to obtain them by due process after they may have identifier their property if the north permits such an amendment it may anticipate paying for several thousand of those who have absconded balt cor tub singular proceedings joe

country we commend it to the perusal of the curious without undertaking to controvert or endorse its teachings books that come to us backed up by the affirmations of clairvoyants ot the tappings of spirits are difficult to dispute with because they both ifsslr from a alata of heins into which we have never penetratedf da word to subscriberstwo more numbers will close the third volume of the north star we have had little to say during the present year by way of pressing the claims of this journal upon its subscriber nor do we mean to say much now nor in future to urge upon them the importance of giving it a generous support but we do feel at full liberty to solicit prompt payment of all subscriptions this is absolutely necessary to the very existence of the paper few subscribers are aware of the immense expenditures attendant on the publication of a large weekly journal like the north star and when they consider that the funds for this purpose must necessarily come in very small sums they must know that the utmost promptitude on the part of individual subscribers is our only hope of success we therefore beg that such of our sub sctibers as are in arreats will favor us by remitting to us immediately and that those who have already paid up will lay us under greater obligations by forwarding us as many new subscribers as they may be able to get f d lecture no idelivered by frederick dottflais in corinthinn hall on sunday evening dee ist i come before you this evening to deliver the first lecture of a course which i purpose to give in this city during the present winter on the subject of american slavery make this announcement with no feelings of selfsufficiency if i do not mistake my own emotions they are such as result from a profound sense of my incompetency to do justice to the task which i have just announced and have now entered upon if any then demand of me why i speak i plead as my apology the fact that abler and more eloquent men have failed to speak what perhaps is more true therefore more strong such men have spoken only or the wrong side of the question and havt thus thrown their influence against the cause of liberty humanity and benevolence there are times in the experience of almosi every community when even the humbles member thereof may properly presume tr teach when the wise and great ones the appointed leaders of the people exert theii powers of mind to complicate mystify entangle and obscure the simple truthwhet they exert the noblest gifts which heaver has vouchsafed to man to mislead ihe populai mind and to corrupt the public heart tha the humblest may stand forth and be excuse for opposing even his weakness to the torrem of evil that such a state of things exists in thii community have abundant evidence learn it from the rochester press from the rochester pulpit and in my intercourse witl the people of rochester not a day passes over me that i do not meet with apparently good men who utter sentiments in respect t this subject which would do discredit tc savages they speak of the enslavement ol their fellowmen with an and coldness which might lie looked for only in men hardened by the most atrocious and villanous crimes the fact is we are in the midst of a greal struggle the public mind is widely and deeply agitated and bubbling up from it perturbed waters are many ami great impurities whose poisonous miasma demands a constant antidote whether the contemplated lectures will in any degree contribute towards answering this demand time will determine of one thing however i can assure my hearersthat i come up to this work at the call of duty and with an honest desire to promole the happiness and wellbeing ol every member of this community as well as to advance the emancipation of every slave the audience will pardon me if i say one word more by way of introduction it is my purpose to give this subject a calm candid and faithful discussion i shall not aim to shock nor to startle my heareis but to convince their judgment and to secure their sympathies for the erslaved i shall aim to be as stringent as truth and as severe as justice and if at any time i shall fail of this and do injustice in any respect i shall be most happy to be set right by any gentleman who shall hear me subject of course to order and decorum i shall deal during these lectures alike with individuals and institutionsmen shall no more escape me than things i shall have occasion at times to be even personal and to rebuke sin in high places i shall noi hesitate to arraign either priests or politicians church or state and to measure all by the standard of justice and in the light oi truth i shall not forget to deal with tin unrighteous spirit of caste which prevails this community and i shall give particulai attention to the recently enacted fugitive slav bill i shall keep my eye upon the congres which is to commence tomorrow and fullj inform myself as to its proceedings in sword the whole subject of slavery in all iti bearings shall have a full sod impartial die caution a very slight acquaintance with the his ton of atonican slavery is sufficient to show tha it is an evil of which it will be difficult to rit this country it is not the creature of a moment which to day is and tomorrow is not it is not a pigmy which a slight blow may demolish it isno youthful upstatt whose impertinent pratings may be silenced by a dignified contempt no it is an evil ol gigantic proportions and of long standing its origin in this country dates back to the landing of the pilgrims on plymouth rock it was here moie than two centuries ago the first spot poisoned by its leprous presence was a small plantation in virginia the slaves at that time numbered only twenty they have now increased to the frightful number of three millions and from that narrow plantation they are now spread overby far the largest half of the american union indeed slavery forms an important part of the entire history of the american people its presence may be seen in all american affairs it has become interwoven with all american institutions and has anchored itself in the very soil of the american constitution it has thrown its paralysing arm over freedom of speech and the liberty of the press and has created for itself morals and manners favorable to its own continuance it has seduced the church corrupted the pulpit and brought the powers of both into degrading bondage and now in the pride of its power n rvmi threatens to onng aown tnat grana political edifice the american union unless every member of this republic shall so far disregard his conscience and his god as to yield to its infernal behests that must be a powerful influence which can truly be said to govern a nation and that slavery governs the american people is indisputably true if theie were any doubt on this point a few plain questions it seems to me could not fail to remove it what power has given this nation its presidents lor more than fifty years slavery what power is that to which the present aspirants to presidential honors are bowing slavery we may call it union constitution harmony or american institutions that to which such men as cass dickinson webster clay and other distinguished men of this country are devoting their energies is nothing more nor less that american slavery it is for this that they are writing let tets making speeches and promoting the holding of great mass meetings professedly in lavor of the union these men know the service most pleasing to their master and that which is most likely to be richly rewarded men may serve god for nought as did job but he who serves the devil hasan eye to his reward patriotism obedience to the law prosperity to the country have come to mean in the mouths of these distinguished statesmen a mean and servile acquiescence in the most flagitious and profligate legislation in favor of slavery i might enlarge here on this picture of the slave power and tell of its influence upon the press in the free slates and upon the condition and tights of the free colored people of the north but i forbear for the present enough has been said i trust to convince all that the abolition of this evil will require time energy zeal perseverance and patience that it wifi require fidelity a martyrlike spirit of selfsacrifice and a firm reliance on him who has declared himself to be the god of the oppressed having said thus much upon the power and prevalence of slavery allow me to speak of the nature of slavery itself and here i can speak in part from experiencel can speak with the authority of positive knowledge more than twenty years of rny life were consumed in a state of slavery my childhood was environed by the baneful peculiarities of the slave system i grew up to manhood in the presence of this hydraheaded monsternot as a master not as an idle spectator not as the guest of the slaveholder but as a slave eating the bread and drinking the cup of slavery with the roost degraded of my brother bondmen and sharing with them all the painful conditions of their wretched lot in consideration of these facts i feel that i have a right to speak and to speak strongly yet my friends i feel bound to speak truly goading as have been the cruelties to which i hive been subjectedbitter as have been the trials throughjwhich i have passed exaspeiaiing as have been and still are the indignities offered to my manhood i find in them no excuse for the slightest departure from truth in dealing with any branch of this subject first of all i will state as well as i can the legal and social relation of master and slave a master is one to speak in the vocabulary of the southern states who claims and exercises a right of property in the person of a fellow man this he does with the force of the law and the sanction of southern religion the law gives the master absolute power over the slave he may work him flog him hire him out sell him and in certain contingences kill him with perfect impunity the slave is a human being divested of all rightsreduced t the level ofa brutea mere chattel in the eye of the lw placed beyond the circle of human brotherhood cut off from his kind his name which the recording angel may have enroled in heaven among the blest is impiously inserted in a mast rs leger with horses sheep and swine in law the slave has no wife no children no country and no home he can own nothing possess nothing acquire nothing but what must belong to another to eat the fruit of his own toil to clothe his person with the work of his own hands is considered stealing he toils that another may reap the fruit he is industrious that another may live in idleness he eats unbolted meal that another may eat the bread of fine flour he labors in chains at home under a burning sun and a biting lash that another may ride in ease and splendor abroad he lives in ignorance that another may be educated he is abused that another may be exslted he rests his toilworn limbs on the cold damp ground that another may repose on the softest pillow be is clad in coarse and tattered raimmtthat another may be arrayed in purple and fine linen he is sheltered only by the wretched hovel that a master may dwell in a magnificent mansion and to this condition he is bound down as by an arm of iron from this monstrous relation there springs an uneeaaing stream of most revolting cruelties the very accompanyments of the slave system stamp it as the offspring of hell itself to ensure good behavior the slaveholder relies on the whip to induce proper humility he relies on the whip to rebake what he is pleased to term insolence he relies on the t whtp to supply ke place of wages as an incentive to toil be relies on the whip to bind t down the the slave to imbrate andi to destroy his manhood he relies on the whip the chain the gag the thambsciew the pit lory the bowieknife the pistol and the ioot h k rheae are the necessary and of the aysiem wherever alwtty found these hoi rid instruments aie also found whether on the coast of africa among the savage tribes orin south carolina among the refined ami civilized slavery is the same and its accom panyments one and the same it makes no difference whether the slaveholder worships the god of the christians or is a follower of mahomet he is the minister of the same cruelty and the author of the same misery slarvry is always slavery always the same foul haggard and damning scourge whether found in the eastern or in the western hem isphere there is a still deeper shade to be given to this picture the physical cruelties are indeed sufficiently harrassing and revolting but they are but as a few grains of sands on the sea shore or a few drops of water in the great ocean compared with the stupendous wrongs which it inflicts upon the mental moral and teligious nature of its hapless victims it is only when we contemplate the slaveas a moril and intellectual being that we can adequately comprehend the unparalleled enormity of slavery and the intense criminality of the slaveholder i have said that the slave is a man what a piece of work is man how noble in reason i how infinite in faculties in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals the slave is a man the image of god but a little lower than the angels possessing a soul eternal and indestructible capable of endless happiness or immeasurable woe a creature of hopes and feats of affections and passions of joys and sorrows and he is endowed with those mysterious powers by which man soars above the things of time and sense and grasps with undying tenacity the elevating and sublimely glorious idea of a god it is such a being that is smitten and blasted the first work of slavery is to mai and deface those characteristics of itsvictimi which distinguish men from things and persons from property its fust aim is to destroy all sense of high moral and religious responsibility it reduces man to a mere machine it cuts him oir from his maker it hides frotr him the laws of god and leaves him to gropr his way from time to eternity in the dark un dr the arbitrary and despotic control of frail depraved and sinful fellowman as the serpentcharmer of india is com pelted to extract the deadly teeth of his venomous prey before he is able to handle hiu with impunity so the slaveholder must stnki down the conscience of the slave before h esn obtain the entire mastery over his victim it is then the first business of the enslave of men to blunt deaden and destroy the central principle of human responsibility conscience is to the individual soul and to society what the law of gravitation is to the universe it holds society together it is the basis of al trust and confidence it is the pillar of amoral recitude without it suspicion woul take the place of trust vice wouid be mon than a match for virtue men would prey upon each other like the wild beasts of th desert and earth would become a hell nor is slavery more adverse to the conscience that it is to the mind this is slown by the fact that in ever state of the american union where slaver exists excqt the state of kentucky ther are laws absolutely prohibitory of educatio among tbe daves the crime of teaching slave to read is punishable with severe finei and imprisonment and in some instances with death ilstlf nor are the laws respecting this matter dead letter cases may occur in which thei are disregarded and a few instances may bi found where slaves may have learned to read but such are isolated cases and only provi the rule the great mass of slaveholders l upon education among the slaves as utterly subversive of the slave system i well remember when my mistress first announced tc my master that she had discovered that j could read his face colored at once with surprise ana chagrin he said that i was ruined and my value as a slave destroyed that a slave should know nothing but to obey his master that to give a negro an inch would lead him to take an ell that having learned how to read would soon want to knowhow to write and that bye and bye would be running away think my audience will bear witness to the correctness of this philosophy and to the literal fulfilment of this prophecy it is perfectly well understood at the south thatto educate a slave is to make him discontented with slavery and to invest him with power whieh shall open to him the treasures of freedom and since the object of the slaveholder is to maintain complete authority over his slave his constant vigilance is exercised to prevent everything which militates against or endangers the stability of his authority education being among the menacing influences and perhaps the most dangerous is therefore the most cautiously guarded against it is ttue that we do not often hear of the enforcement of the law punishing as crime the teaching of slaves to readbut this is not because of a want of disposition to enforce it the true reason or explanation of the matter it this there is the greatest unanimity of opinion among the white population of the south in favor of the policy of keeping the slave in ignoranee there is perhaps another reason why the law against education is so seldom violated the slave is too poor to be able to offer a temptation sufficiently strong to induce a white man to violate it and it is not to be supposed that in a community where the moral and teligious sentiment is in favor of slavery many martyrs will be found sacrificing their liberty and lives by violating those prohibitory enactments asa general rule then darkness reigns over the abodes of the enslaved and how great is that darkness we are sometime told of the contentment of tbe slsvee snd sre entertcined with vivid pictures of their hsppiness we me told thst they often dance and aiog that their master frequently give them wherewith to make merry in fine that that they have little of which to complain i admit that the slave does aoroetirnes sing dance and appear to bel merry but what does this prove it only prove to my mind that though slavery is armed with a thousand stings it is not able entirely to kill the elastic spirit of the bondman that spirit will rise and walk abroad despite of whips and chains and extract from the cup of nature occasional drops of joy and gladness no thanks t the slaveholder nor to slavery that the vivacious captive may sometimes dance in his chains his very mirth in such circumstances stands before god as an accusing angel against his enslaver but who tells us of the extraordinary contentment and happiness of the slave what traveller has explored the balmy regions of our southern country and brought back these glad tidings of joy bring him cn the platfoim and bid him answer a few plain q uestions we shall then be able to determine the weight and importance that attach to his testimony is he a minister yea were you ever in a slave state sir yes may inquire the object of your mission south to preach the gospel sir of what denomination are you a presbyterian sir to whom were you introduced to the rev plummer is he a slaveholder sir yessir has slaves about his house v h j r were you then the guest of dr plummer yes sir waited on by slaves while there yes sir did you preach for dr plummer yes sir did you spend your nights at the great house or at the quarter among the slaves at the great house you had then no social intercourse with the slaves no sir you fraternized then wholly with the white portion of the population while there yes sir this is sufficient sir you can leave the platform nothing is more natural than that those who go into slave states and enjoy the hi pitality of slaveholders should bring back favorable reports of the condition of the slave if that ultra republican the hon lewis cass could not return from the court of france without paying a compliment to royalty simply because king louis phillippe patted him on the shoulder called him friend and invited him to dinner it is not to bo expected that those hungry shadows of men in the shape of ministers that go south can escape a contamination even more beguiling and insidious alas fox the weakness ol poor human nature pleased with a rattle tickled with a straw why is it jthat sll the reports of contentment and happiness among the slaves at the south come to us upon the authority of slaveholders or what is equally significant of slaveholders friends why is it that we do not hear from the slaves direct the answer to this question furnishes the darkest features in the american slave system it is often said by the opponents of the antislavery cause that the condition of the peo pie of ireland is more deplorable than lhat othe american slaves far be it from me to underrate the sufferings of the irish people they have been long oppressed and the same heart that prompts me to plead the cause ol the american bondman makes it impossible fur me not to sympathize with the oppressed of all lands yet i must say that there is no analogy between the two cases the irishman is poor but he is not a slave he maybe in rags but he is not a slave he is still the master of his own body and can say with the poet the hand of douglass is his own the world is all before him where tc choose and poor as may be my opinion ol the british parliament i cannot believe that il will ever sink to such a depth of infamy as tc pass a law for the recapture of fugitive irishmen the shame and scandal of kid napping will long remain wholly monopo  lized by the american congress the irishman has not only the liberty to emigrate from his country but he has liberty at home h can write and speak and cocperate for the attainment of his rights and the redress of his wrongs the multitude can assemble upon all the gieer hols and fertile plains of the emerald islethey can pour out their grievances and proclaim their wants without molestation and the press lhat awiftwinged messenger can bear the tidings of their doings to the extreme bounds of the civilized woild they have their conciliation hall on the banks of the liffey their reform clubs and their newspapers they pass resolutions send forth addresses and enjoy the right of petition but how is it with the american slave where may he assemble where is his conciliation hull where are his newspapers where is his right of petition where is his freedom of speech his liberty of the press and his right of locomotion he is said to be happy happy men can speak but ask the slave what iahis condition what his state of mind what he thinks of his enslavement and you had as well address your inquiries to the silent dead there comes no voice from the enslaved we are left to gather his feelings by imagining whatours would be were our jouls in his souls stead if there were no other fact descriptive oi slavery than that the slave is dumb this alone would be sufficient to mark the slave system as a grand aggregation of human hor rors most who are present will have observed that leading men in this country have been putting forth their skill to secure quiet to the nation a system of measures to promote this object was adopted a few months ago in congress the result of those measures is known instead of quiet they have produced alarm instead of they have brought us war and so roust ever be while this nation is guilty of the enslavement of three millions of innocent men and women it is as idle fb think of having a sound and lasting peace as it is to think there is no god to take cognizance of the affairs of men there can be no peace to the wicked while slavery continues in the land it will be con demnedand while it is condemned there will be agitation nature must cease to be nature men must become monsters humanity must be transformed christianity must be exterminated all ideas of justice and the laws of eternal goodness must be utterly blotted out from the human soul ere a system so foul and infernal can escape condemnation or thia guilty republic can have a sound and enduring peace george thompson speech our leader are aware that mr thompson was not permitted in cneeeqnence of the riotcaa behavior of certain of the whig of boston to pronounced the speech which he had prepared for deliver at the reception meeting in the city acmujed to him by bin friend and now we can scarcely find a whig newspaper that does not justify the outrage upon the sacred right of jiheiiy of speech the new york expiesa gives encouragement to all patriots of the rvnders school to expel mr thompson from the country and the editors themselves openly advocate the propriety nf lynching him here is what that immaculate sheet say editorialy upon the subject considering the present excited and almost insurrectionary state of the public mind in this country we have no hesitation in saying that we hope thiscounirv will be made too hot for this hon feed british emissary in case be attempts to patrol our country and to excite and to exasperate one portion of our countrymen against another as wc would repel a foreign enemy we have a right to repel him as the british government would hang an american in iteland there exciting one portion of society to an insurrection against the other so here we have the right not to hang this british feed emmissary tobe sure but to silence him in every way consistent with the laws of our country we owe him no hospitality we owe himvio respect we owe him no decent taeatmeni he is an alien enemy with a firebrand m his hand a paid alien spy from portion of the british people who wish to destioy our country and the quicker he is made to feel the ignominy of his traitorous misssion the itlrer fie will go back with his gold to the mischievous hum imre the time haa been when a higher morality thn breathes in the above characterized the leading articles of the most influential organa of the whig party but the apostacy of the leaders has corrupted the satellites and it is not to be wondered at that with daniel webster fallen to a level with the honorable michad walsh prominent w higs should be foremost in provoking riots as in boston nr that the sentiments of the empire club should find a voice in the columns of whig newspapers most unfortunately for hose maligners of mr thompson and his motives the speech which he had intended to have given was written down beforehand and was laid before the public through the colums ol the chronotype on the following morning while it carried upon its face throughout the most ample refutation of all the slanders of his opponents it showed likewise the too potent influence of a venal pres over the prejudiced the unprincipled and the vile we copy a few brief extracts from the speech as published without from the authty and ask our readers candidly to judge if for the utterance of such sentiments as these the threat of the new york express should be carried out and the country made too hot to hold the man who utteis them mr thompson is speaking of the political institutions of his own country and says our system is a fetid duughill out of which springs with frightful luxuriance under the warm sun of every general election all kinds of rank weeds and poisonous plants ii is a stagnant reservoir of putrid water breeding from year to year every pernicious exhalation and all sorts of noxious reptiles to find their way at every election into the regions of pollution and iniquity and wh chare always to be traced by the filthy slime thev leave behind them this sounds very much like the language of a feed agent of the british government it must be confessed he refers to massachusetts and to mr webster as follows massachusetts has not forgotten the god that guided the mayflower to plymouth rock and though the peerless intellect of massachusetts may suffer from the stroke of a southern sun the heart of the old bay state is sound and still beats responsive to the instincu of nature the dictates of humanity and the claims of the trembling outcast who asks a shelter on her soil relative to his advocacy of slavery emancipation here he speaks as follows if it be imputed to me that i have identified myself with those who are held in slavery on this soil and have sought to promulgate the doctrines of emancipation i acknowledge the justice of the impeachment and plead guilty my offence reaches far beyond the limits of the united stales my aspirations for freedom are as wide as the soil polluted by the footprints of a tyrant in advocating the rights of humanity i know of no geographical boundaries i walk upon gods earth among gods children and wherever i see one of them smitten down i will denounce the aggressor and demand the deliverance of the captive he makes an extract from the speech of mr webster at the hungarian dinner relative to kossuth and the austrian government and substituting crafts for kossuth and tire south for austria makes it read as fol lows i see that the south demands of massachusetts that the noble crafts and his equally noble companion should be given up and i see that this demand is in derision of the established law of nations gentlemen there is something on earth greater lhan arbitrary or despqltc power the lightning has its power and the whirlwind has its powei but there is something among men more capable of shaking despotic power than lightning whirlwind or earthquakethat is the threatened indignation of the whole civilized world worcester spy free labor intelligencea recent letter from trinidad speaks of the lively interest of the inhabitants of that island on the subject of cotton growing and of

defenders and advocates of human rights that the world has erer known mr george thompson member of the british parliament it is well known to all of our readers that mr thompson visited this country some fifteen years ago when the antislavery movement was in ita infancy and that he did most effectual service to the cause at that time by his eloquent pleadings in behalf of the slave his conduct on the occasion of his former visit endeared him to the hearts of many who coincided in his views and who labored with him in the same holy cause and after his return to his native land he continued to lake the deepest interest in the progress of a movement in which he had labored and for the success of which he was so deeply interested during the fifteen years of his absence mr thompson has in his own country by hie efforts in behalf of downtrodden humanity on f r himself ihe enviable position of aplace in the fust rank of englands reformers and occupying such a position he has of course not been unmindful of the friends he had left upon tuts side of the water hut has kept up a constant correspondence with the pioneers of progress in the united states wishing to see with hisown eyes the indications of progress and to exchange gtatula tions again with the friends of former yeats at the close ot a session of parliament he resaues to visit the united states again his personal ftienda

a special train from boston with five long cars brought some two hundred and fitly passengers from the eastern part of the state who were determined not tobe deprived of the pleasure f hearing mr thompson speak by the audacity of boston whiggery or the lenussness of the city atij thorities to sustain the laws ai the appointed hour the meeting being an adjournment the same officers were rem stated and edmund quincy upon taking ihe chair addresseil the audience in brief but appropriate terms after alluding to the circumstances connected with the breaking up of the boston meeting and slating that it was only a small part of the audience which was engaged in those disorderly proceedings he said boston having thus disgraced herself it is for the heart of the commonweallh to administer the rebuke and we are here today cheers we have come to your homes knowing that here we shall be safe from disorderly interruption and even if theie should be evil disposed or riotous persons vou have here a mayor and a police who are able and willing to do their duty in the name of that meeting thank the citizens of worcester lor the welcome they have given us thank them for having opened this spacious hall for our accommodation and that they are here in such numbers to greet usa series of resolutions was then offered by mr garrison a part of which were highly complimentary to mr thompson and a patt expressive of the strongest indignation against the coriupiion tnd venality of the boston press and the remissness of its city authorities in enforcing the law s the question being upon the adoption of the icsolu tions wendell phillips of boston was called for and came forward and said mr chairmanl do not know that i can add anything to the topics of w elcome w hich the resolutions have suggested they cover j the whole ground of the reasons of the call of this meeting that we are clieered by the presence of an old ftiend in our midst and they exptess with becoming indignation the feelings which every lover of the commonwealth must cherish at ihe sensation which his presence has excited in the capital of the state applause i do not know mr chairman but that we chose the time of our meeting inauspiciouly in the good city of boston we did not remember the staie ol mind in which the conservatism of massachusetts was then existing applause we had forgotten that we call a meeting to welcome to the shores of america one of the most eloquent and efficient laborers m the aulislavery vineyard at a moment w hen the spasms ol recently defeated conservatism had hardly paaaed away cheers that massachusetts to long passive in the hands of its wealth and its capital had atisen at last as it to sweep frotji the seaboard the pests that have dsgraced the policy of new england for so many yeais cheers thus swept by an avalanche of country indignation we could not expect at such a moment that ihe minds of our fellow citizens in the capital should be at ease in view of any new accession ol strength to the antislavery sentiment of tte country cheers we should have paused we should have given to the spoili child us way awhile applause and laughter but we had fondly hoped that even the boston of was a very different city from the boston of we tried ihe experiment and were disappointed but for one when look hack upon it am not sup prised the battle is not jet finished it is not yet at the hottest cheers i he opposing aimies have not joined in the conflict they are only marshaled lace to face the eloquent speaker ihen reviewed the

de scribedwith a telescope perhapslar back in the distance internal improvements are heard of m the last edition ol emma willards history and no where else cheers and laughter daniel webster who boasted that he had never opened his bps on the sub i slavery has at last been obliged to peak nevet did any man make such antislavery wr as he has done mr p thv n alluded to the political contests of the panics particularly to ihe overthrow of henry clay by j k polk on the texas issue when his party ta iso well marshaled ed and continued l say this is the difference in the antislavery enterprise

the rising of george thompson who next addressed ihe meeting as follows george thompsons speech at the city hall in worcester saturday nov mr thompson rose amidst the most enthusiastic applause which was again and again renewed he spoke aa follows citizens of worcester ladies and gen tlemenl must acknow ledge in very brief terms this your very cordial welcome to the heart of ihe state of massachusetts my speech must be wholly unpiemeditated arid delivered under ciicumstances ijke these it is likely to be extremely imperfect and unconnected for however qualified may be to withstand

their partiality and friendship io pronounce an encomium upon mo cheers to me it is much more congenial to liavs to fight with beasts at ephesus than to contend will the smile and approbation of those who sympathise with me loud beers therefore ladies and gentlemen if you expect from me this morning an ploquent acknowledgement of ihe compliments which have been paid me by mv fiiend who has just sat

that mobs arc again to be summoned to the easy work of silencing my voice be it so if i am not to be peimilled to be a quiet sjieciulor and sojourner and traveller among you in this country if it must be so that am lo be every hour identified with your peculiar national struggle lor the freedom of three millions of slaves and made answerable fur the principles and sentiments of such men as those who sit on this platfotm bo it so cheers and further if it be necessary in the year or for a man to endme and suffer in defence of tho right of speaking in any pan of the world ins mind on ihe subject

free winds that fill our sailj rebuke me no will the chainless billows that play around our ship forbid meno shall i meet with no rebuke unless it be from some fellow passenger claiming ihe right of insulting any man that lifts up bis voice in behalf of the slaves that are weeping or bis plantations cheers when does my right cease to be a right why have not ihe right here i have yet to learn that i have been rebuked by ihe voice of your own institutions your forefathers very plainly and veiy openly one fine morning spoke out their mmds ami you are what you are today because they declared in the face of the world the light of very human being to free action loes it rebuke me for piocla ming this selfevident truth that god has created all men free and equal cheers but then the question is said to be american and lan to be put down but who says so do the three millions of slaves at the south say put him down if they were not smittep with dumbuesa by the rod of ihe enchanter they would answer that they desired not that should be put down am told to be silent by the five hundud thousand colored persons who are scattered all over the free stales of america i have not met with a single colored man who conjured me to be silent in reference to the wrongs of his race on these when at faneuil hall l was told that i had no right to speak by whom ws told this by the orderly and the decent no by the intellectual and moral no by the sober and the patriotic no by any portion of the community ot this great counliy for whom could entertain any respect and by whose judgment lam likely to be guided no but by those who had come together to enjoy an hours s amusement in preventing even their own citizens from being beard and who in a temple consecrated to liberty insulted the goddess at her own altartremendous cheers if lam to follow the advice of any portion of the american community shall follow the advice of some hundred and fifty boys who mingled their voices together on ihe occasion referred to certainly not but my friends with or without permission of such persons claim the right to speak my thoughts on the question of slavery tony audience either here or elsewhere and shall not be terrified by any opposition may meet with whatever form that oppositions may take i will follow the example of ame f rica and americans in this respect ltave e travelled in many parts of this woild qave i met americans in all parts of the world ami i have not found that the cilizens of the united states of ameiica hare of all men been the most prudent or the most taciturn y in reference to their opinion of the institutions cf the countries in which they have travelled i have met an american missionary on the t shores of madias f have heard him standup and revile the gods of a hundred millions i of the human rad and they the subjects of i the british queen have heard him de nounee all that fpsmost connected with the prejudices and intimately associated with the government of the country i have me with americans even under the walls of the great mogul of delhi american missionaries there grappled with the supeistilions and eriors ot the mahomed an and i have commended them for their boldness of speech i which led them in the midst of danger i declare the whole counsel of god i have before me at this moment an illustrious example worthy of all imitation and shall take the liberty of citing in my behalf this morning a senator of the united stales the document which have here pnrports tobe a speech delivered by hon lewis cass o michigan in the senate on friday th jan on suspending onr diplomatic relatione with austria what does the honorable senator say heely confess that shall hail the aj w ith pleasuie when this government reflecting the true sentiments of the people shall express its sympathy for smuggling millions seeking in circumstances of peril and oppression that liberty which was given to them by but has been wrested from them by mani do not see any danger o the true independ j ence of nations by such a course and indeed am by no means certain that the interchange of public views in this solemn manner would not go far towards checking the progress of oppression and the tendency to war why sn the very discussion in high places and free placesand here is one of them even when discussion is followed by no act is it setl a great element ot retributive justice to punish n when a atrocious deed is done anda great dement of moial power to restrain it when such a deed is contemplated i claim fin our country no exemption from the decrees of these high tribunals and when we are guilty ot a tithe of the oppression and cruelty which have made the austrian name a name of reproach through the world i hope we hall leceive and we sall well merit the upprobiium of mankind now sir say it without reserve that a power thus setting at defiance the opinion of the world maik lie speaks ot government action and not ot the expression of indep n dent opinion by one individual iandvio lating the best feelings of our nature in the veiy wantonness of successful cruelty has no bond ot union with the american people the sooner the diplomatic intercourse is dis solvedand dissolved with marks of indignant reprobationthe soonershall we peiform an act of public duty which at home and abroad will meet with feelings of kindred sympathy from all wherever ihrv may be wiio are not fit subjects for the lender mercies of austrian power finally he commends the sultan at constantinople tor having cherished ihe fugitive slaves that fled from the banks of ttie danube lronical cheers he thinks it highly to the credit ot this head of lie ottoman empire who has taken up and sheltered ihe rotugees and refused to yield to the remon stiauce ot austria and russia he says the divan faithful to thp traditions of eastern hospitality il not to the obligations ot the law ot nations fitmlv refused the delivery of the lugiiives and tflus spared another deluge of blood to use and words of the great roman historian lit this sad drama ot a nations oveithrow now sir contend that the true reason why m se and tiiera are denied liberty ul speech upon american affairs is that there is in your midst a system which cannot bear investigation and the opposition to which is at variance with the interests and prejudices and lusts of a large portion ol this community cheers hut sir were it nor so still should claim the right on this and every occasion of offering an explanation of my views upon the question ol slavery and on every question connected w ith the interest ol mankind rut permit me to say that england has a peculiar right in the person of any one of her sons to interfere it the booth will call itin ihe question of slavery have been tuld again and again on the other side of the atlantic that england is answerable for tins insiiiuiion thavwe bought planted and watered here from age to age this deadly plant that to and upon england and not on america rests the responsibility and the guilt of this atrocious system well be it so cheers if this be the factand for the present am not going to deny itcertainly an englishman who regrets that england ever entertained tfie crime of enslaving any portion of the human lace may be permuted lo come and make his friends an earnest appeal to the political principles ihe moral feelings and the religious sentiments of ihe people of america in behalf of the liberation of the descenderits of those whom england enslaved before the era of your revolution loud cheers rut sir is it not a fact that the subjects ol her majesty the queen of england are not free to go to any ol your southern ports that the colored crews of vessels trading irom the islands of ihe west indms are taken out and imprisoned not as the free subjects ot another nation hut as criminals and are not restored to liberty until the vessel is ready again to embark upon the ocean sir as seit that as an englishman i have a right to protest against tins applause i contend that i have a tight to claim for my col oied fellow subjects the liberty which every sailor ori board united states ehips enjoys on entering the jiorls of england i any of eng lands dependences in any part of the world loud cheers but sir i have the right to complain of your inflicting upon the objects ol reform in england a most serious injury and ot retarding the progress of liberal opinions there by enabling the enemies of human treedom to quote the example of america as that ol a nation having adopted the form of republican institutions to erush closer to the earth onesixth ot her population again sit let those who seek to silence me in america be consistent and silence the men they have sent over from thiscountrv to the other side why sir it has been my unpleasant task to track americana over our country during the years have been absent from you again and againto make indeed almost the circuit of

movements they have misrepresented the abolitionists ot this country they have wholly caricatured the condition of the slaves at the south many of those who ran well lor a time in england have been turned aside from the right courseby the effoits of men who if not lor this purpose sent over the water one of their objects at least on getting over there was to murder the public mind of englaud on ihe question of american slavery cheers in return lor the visits of tlieh gentlemen  persume to offer myself to the attention of the citizens of the united states of america loud cheers did your hear

country free no no and if your country is not free what must be the effect upon other countries why that every advocate of kingcraft and state and priestcraft in the old world quotes this damning fact and throws it in the path of those who are laboring for reform under other governments applause why my friends i should not venture to have any part in tlie antislavery agitation of this country if i felt myself tebuked fur any lack of sympathy for the reform movements of england but can truly say that have never in any public addresses that i i ave made in my life uttered one solitary sentiment repugnant to the principles which you cherish in this country applause everywhere have i endeavored to prejmte men or a great struggle forthe esablishanent of those princ pies everywhere have i sought to recommend whatever was aohle in vour own conduct to the imitation of those wto sought to be free having done this and feeling quite sure thut it was my solemn duty to promote the cause of freedom and being confident that no man can quote anything ever uttered derogatory to the principles ol other lands or inimical to the intetestsof the institutions of america i think may ask when i am invited

country can put them down they are putting tlipmselves down from their high places of power aad cruelty and in thus addressing the abolitionist they might be made to speak of him as john the baptist did of the coming of christ i must decrease but thou shall increase applause lot no man who expects to live seven years longer talk of putting down abolition let no man desirous of fame the aspirant

family during a recent short stay in the city of rochester went to corinthian hall to hear the hutchinson family sing and made some pencilmarks from which transfer the following with such touchingup and softenings as i choose to make it is saturday night aud rainy at that corinthian hall is finely illuminated the people come in slowly but what they lack in numbers they makeup in respectability i will take that seat in front of the platform so that i can see the singers as well as hear them i wish some one would taketne seat right before me so that i can draw those who draw so many others without being noticed by the gifted objects of attraction lam lucky for once for a bouncing man and four beautiful women have taken possession of the unchartered seat suppose we look at the hall until the nest of brothers with a sister in it commence warbling this spacious room is truly magnificent the settees are handsomely cushioned and can accommodate nearly two thousand persons there are thirty long narrow windows staring like eyes of fire into the surrounding streets there are four splendid chandeliers let down from the ceiling and gasburners project from the walls with fingers of fire like the mysterioas hand whih wrote with the telegraphic pen in the temple of belshazzar hear that aristocratic donkey in the next seat would like to hear jenny lind sing but barnum is a showman and it is vulgar to countenance the company with whom he associates now i have no doubt the silly fool who made that remark is a lowborn fellow who is indebted to somebody else for his fortune iflie has one but the s ngera have just made their appearance how can write whils they sing there is abby with her laughing lips and eyes the harvest of brown ringlets about her neck seem to vibrate with vocal sweetness see her sway from side to side between two of her brothers as though they were magnets and she idumc iu motion abby is a dear fittle love of a woman and her husband must not be jealous if everybody loves her it is not a matter of wonderment tnat such a small body contains such a large heart for nature puts up her choice articles in small parcels vvere diamonds as large as rocks they would not be so valuable as at present this american jenny lind is apparently about twentyfour years of age has dark brown hair a round pleasant face and eyes that shine like stars i am compelled to stop it ig impossible to sketch while they sing confound the fiddles they spoil the melody file saws while thecanary pours out its rich music if you will but never oh never scrape catgut when the human voice can bo heatd amalgamating poetry with melody there is an indescribable liquid sweetness in ab bys voice which is truly charming in its sober tones it seems like the subdued and distant voice angel from the upper deep judson sings the air and makes the air sing judson he looks like a live yankee his face is long thin and closely shaved his hair is rather long and blushed behind his ears which are not long he is pressed as are the other two brothers in a superfine black cloth coat and pantaloons a white vest silk neckerchief with collar down a la byron he is unmarried and is now giving us the bachelors lament amid roars of laughter he is no mean mimic the three brothers are now giving usa funny thing and bythebye it is a ppr thing some of the sourcroui school are wondering if it aint vulgar john sings tenor he look ike a sailor in a citizens dress he lings the pathetic and thrilling sons the ship on fire admirably it is the very best thing tp which have listened for many a day it must be heard to be appreciated john is not quite so tall as judson he has dark hair i think his eyes are blue he wean a goatee or tuft of dark hair under his chin but i must halt again for they are singing now the crows in the corn fielda piece which calls into exercise their powers of ventriloquism and the room rings reels and reverberates with jollity i long to be at home is a plaintive piece which moistens the eyes of those who like myself are absent from home now we have uncle sams farma good song and well sung asa sings bass and is not surpassed by either of his brothers he has a deep full voice that comes not only from his chest but from the heart my impression is that he is the eldest of the group jesse who is the author of several songs which this family sing was not present at any rate i did not see him there are some peculiarities which are prominently developed by this company one is the happy and perfect blending ot their voices in a confluence of sound like the mingling of waters another is the moral courage they manifest by introducing songs in praise of the holy but unpopular reforms of the day the sunshine is the smile the rainbow the autograph and music the voice of heaven there is music in the woods where the birds hold concerts and the wildflowers have free tickets where the grasshoppers are worshippers and the whole insect tribe make the temple of nature ring with song there is music in the clouds when shivered by the boltand shaken by the thunder and music still when the tempest has passed away and the lark sings where the lightning shone the cataract with a voice of many waters shouts an everlasting anthem of praise to him who smote the rock and unsealed the fountain the flocks and herds sing on the hillside the feathered minstrels sing in the forest the waves the winds the brooks belong to the choir of nature but the chief singer the chorister is man immortal man made but little lower than the angels there are no notes that can compare favot ably with the human voice the violin the harp the piano the organthc flute are tqa degree sweet instruments but they are hollow and have no hearts the streams the birds and the oratorios of insects with their drums pipes and tambourines make sweet music but there is no soul in their songs we should be grateful to the author of our being whenever we behold a pleasant voice and tnis we do most satisfactorily when in attendance at one of the entertainments of the gifted the genial the good hutchinson family crayon are we to have an european war it seems uot unlikely that the patiem and noble people of hesse otinsel instead of being rewarded by the return of the worthless elector to wis i dona moderation and loyalty by the complete restoration of their wellbe loved constitution and the peacefu enjoyment of their peacefullyassertec r ireedotn will have the painful honor furnishing a field for the tirst battle ina great european war the electoi will neither yield nor abdicate he will not dismiss his ministers he will not be reconcded with his people he will not observe the law he will not respect the constitution he calls upon austria bavaria and wutiemburg to interfere in the name of the old departed confederation to let loose their troops upon his unoffending people and restore him to the glory and happiness ol despotic power the governments applied to are perfectly willing to undertake the congenial business they are gathering together their forces and marshaling them around the devoted electorate on the other side prussia stands sword in hand ready according to her own to meet force by force and beat back the invaders who shall first venture to make their hostile appearance in hesse cassel eighty thousand prussians are within a short distance of the disputed land and can be brought together in two days should an hostile demonstrations on the part of the austrians and bavarians ensue already it is said two prussian divisions have occupied two roads through hesse the use of which is secured to prussia by treaty it is reported likewise that the bavarians and austrians have marched into the electorate if go it seems almost impossible that blood will not be shed and if one drop be shed it is pretty sure to be the prelude to an oceanone skirmish will be followed by many battles if austria and prussia will tight russia and france will hardly be kept from following so good an example and if germany insists upon tearing herself to pieces europe will scarcely be prevailed upon to leave her alone in her glory souse reckless prophets gives out that ranee and russia have already taken their purt and have resolved to take advance of the happy opportunity of partitioning prussia russia making a meal ol the grand duchy of posen and france helping herself to the long coveted rhenish provinces we havt a pretty ample faith in the mingled vileness and recklessness of the present french government we believe it utterly lost to the cause of freedom and unblushingly reckless ot the rights of nations we believe that the spirit which dictated the horrible expedition to rome is by no means extinct and are almost inclined to think that the french government would have no objection to cooperate with austria and russia in inflicting upon the prussian monarchy the destruction which she assisted austria to inflict upon the roman republic bat while we hold the present rulers of france by no means indifferent to the pleasure of extending her frontiers to the rhine and base and reckless enough willingly to lend a helping hand m destroying a state from which they have suffered no wrong yet we hardly deem even these men foolish enough hus kindly to labor for the aggrandise ment of russia to bring the cossacks uuo the heirt of europe to remove from before the country the bulwarks i of a free and independent germany and to purchase a temporary enlarge i ment of territory at the expense oft permanent national degradation and almost inevitable destruction for sup i posing the monstrous league triumphant the infamous victory won supposing prussia divided between france russia and tbe two spoilers become nexl door neighbors they could not continue happy or harmonious ones the spoilers would soon long to despoil each i other and as a policy of aggression is natural and becoming in russia while i the championship of freedom is the suitable policy and proper business of france russia would not merely have extended her frontiers by the partition of prussia but have added to her real power and strengthened her principle of life and action while france would have diminished her power and impaired her principle by the addition of territory he result of such a struggle between the enfeebled and the invigorated spoiler would not be doubtful france would assuredly fall as she would most richly deserve to do and paris would be again occupied by the cossacks not to be relinquished in a lurry but we do not look for the evil consummation we do not expect such folly such wickedness and such woe vve have a large belief in the shortsighted ambition and utter want of prinriplp of ik president ana his ministers we have novery ample faith in their profound wisdom but we do not think them prepared for this surpassing tolly vve do not then expect this confederacy of austria france and russia against prussia i but even were it realized had the three glorious confederates formed their designs and marshaled their forces should france march to the rhine should russia fall upon posen and austria rush into silesia we should s not even then in face of these dreadful odds in face of this formidable coni lederacy we should not give prussia up in despair we should not consider her as lost for if she went to war wisely she would not go to war alone she would have oppressed nations for i allies she would gather iu ber camp the whole strength of germany democratic europe would take the field with tier italy would strike a stronger i stroke for independence than she struck in hungary would once more grasp that mighty sword which treachery alone could wrest from her i prussia with the nations at her back might in the end prove more than a match for the three governments andi the three armies and the wouldbe i spoilers might repent the reckless am bilion which arrayed them against l prussia and brought down the nations upon them but we have left one nation out of the accountwe have said nothing of one governmenta government anything but faultless and acceptable in our eyesyet certainly not sold to the despots of europenot shamefully and recklessly indifferent to the freedom of the world what would england sayio such a league and such an aggression how would the english gov eminent take this threatened destruc i tion of the balance of power in europe how would the english people t ke this confederacy of the despots against the nation god forbid that we should rusn hastily into war on an account and in anjf case god forbid that our debt should be recklessly increased and our blood lightly shed but likewise heaven forbid that we should stand tamely by and see the freedom of the world trodden down that we should suffer a great kingdom to be blotted out from the map of europe and the free states of the continent parcelled out among audacious spoilers selfinterest too would not allow us to remain unconcerned a confederacy between france and russia cannot but be a peril to england the continent once crushed england would most certainly be assailed after the confederate hosts had made the continent their own the confederate fleets would pay a visit to the inviolate island of the savage and free prussia and england are old allies connected by their common teutonic blood and their common protestant religions by a fellowship of race a fellowship of truth and a fellowship of glory they have struggled and triumphed together before now in the meven years war they stood alone against the whole of europe the most successful war that england ever undertook she waged in company with prussia the glory of chatham and the glory of frederick the great were won together lord palmerston to be sure rs no chatham and the present king of prussia is a frederick the great but thepeople of prussia was nothing then and it counts for something now the people of england too has more to do with its own affairs in this century than in the last and a war which the people undertakes into which the people throws its whole soul and casts its whole might unless as in the case or hungary treachery be udded to tremendous odds may begin awkwardly and unfortunately but is almost sure to have a glorious and successful end birmingham mercury baltimore nov tha despatch from nashville says dr collies of macon ga owner of crafts and his wife has received a long letter irom president fillmore of the most satisfactory characterhe says the fugitive slave law shall be enforced to the very letter and should any officer fail to perform bis duty he shall be punished and dismissed and he pledges himself to employ the whole disposable force ot the government for the efficient execution of the law the letter has given unbounded satisfaction to the people jenny lind coming to utica the buffalo courier of wednesday states on the authority of barnum that jenny lind will positively give one and probably two concerts at buffalo the courier man has seen barnums list which puts her down for one concert in rochester one or two at albany one in syracuse and one in utica her th concert is to be given at buffalo the above will be given early next spring herald ffronihechristian cuius london oct i am just returned from a lortnights tour into tbe weal and have held large meetings ia bristol newport plymouth davenport and modbnry i never found friends more heart or enthusiastic or the leagne cause more promising in its aspect two or three of these iseetings were in aid of the free labor movement and i had the company dr pennington of n va wish some of y ur fugitive slave law makers could have been present at bristol once the stronghold of the proslavery party in england and could have seen the reception given by of its citizens to the fugitive slave the negro p p they stood up and gave him three tremendous hurrahs and they manifested the deepest sympathy as he detailed the provisions of the last act of american slave legislation surely this iniquitous law must ensure its own overthrow and must husten the final destruction of the accursed system altogether i think that if the american people really knew what an intense feeling of disgust and contempt this measure has created in englandwhat a weapon it has placed in the hands of the despots here who taunt the men of progress and say look at your pet republic do you want to pull down our goyious constitution and give us such liberty as wbt can we say why i tell our friends manfully to take their own share of the odiumto say to themselves yes it was england that first introduced slavery in the american colonies it is english gold that now mainly buys american cotton rice and tobacco but now in answer to the american fugitive blave hill let england run up the free labor flag and starve the system to death i have been attending a large meeting of ladies and gentlemen at the antislavery office this morning and we have formed a central free labor produce association it was resolved to open a warehouse in london for the wholesale supply ot ail kinds ot free labor cotton goods the demand is rapidly springing up and it will soon be found that capital cannot be more profitably employed tharv in the cultivation of free labor cotton a colored gentleman from jamaica studying for the church in this country was present and informed us that much interest is beginning to be felt in jamaica in the growth of cotton and that the planters in that island are looking forward to agood division of the british market with the southern states garnetts lectures in the north have been much and thousands are coming into the movement cannot say what progress is making in the mediation between denmark and holstein but it seems certain that the meddling protocol of england france and russia is the great obstacle to the progress of that mediation denmark is so completely in the hands of the great powers that she cannot freely act as she would still we hope for ultimate success friends are beginning to look forward to prepare for our next years bazaar with great enthusiasm there is no doubt that the attendance will be immense the bristol friends say they will charter a special league train and will bring up probably visitors hurrah for the rail bringing people miles merely to visit a bazaar and an exhibition edmund fry the boston slave case mr j knight of macon ga publishes in the southern press a detailed account of his experience while in boston endeavoring to nab the slaves william and ellen craft the story is amusing and well told and had we room we would print the whole of it here is the conclusion to which mr knight ar rives from all i saw and heard and experienced while in boston lam convinced that public opinion there in regard to the fugitive slave law is underg ing a change it is true the abolitionists and negroes are very numerous and apparently have things very much their own way at present the business men and men of property with whom i conversed generally took but little interest in the matter but said the law ought to be executed that they wished to get rid of the negroes and that if it came to a trial of strength the negroes and abolitionists would be put down this however will take time i believe that mr hughes will ultimately succeed in getting the negroes my only regret is that my own private business compelled me to return home before seeing him out had i leisure and means to spare i should return with pleasure even at the risk of gratifying certain gentlemen of macon by rotting in a boston jail i what a pity that mr knight is deprived of the pleasure he desires the gentlemen in macon to whom he alludes must be possessed of most inhuman malignity moore the poita scottish pa er says this fine geniusand it is a iad fact that intemperance is the cause is but the wreck of the brilliant ac
