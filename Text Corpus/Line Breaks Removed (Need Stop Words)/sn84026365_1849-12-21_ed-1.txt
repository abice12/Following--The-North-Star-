reposed in the intelligence and virtue cl an enlightened community the conviction is fully entertained by the superintendent that by lnr the larger portion even of those who felt constrained to oppose the act in question were actuated not by hostility to the principle of free schools but by considerations drawn from objections whether well or ill founded to the particular details of the bill upon which they were specifically called to act i these objections it is confidently hoped and expected may be obviated either by a more full explanation and understanding of the provisions referred toor

of the house of representatives to which was referred so much of the governors message as relates to slavery presented to the house on thursday last the following spirited aud wellwritten report whether we refer to the official action of the representatives of the peo i pie of wrmont in general assembly from the declaration of rights in down to the iast session of the legis i lature or to the declarations of the people themselves in their primary as sembhes we find that vermont has but one voice to utter and but one course to pursue in reference to slavery her voice has beeo and is and ever ought to be in utter condemnation of the systemher course one of determined and persevering opposition toit by all allowable means such is the position of vermont the reasons for that position are ample but your committed deem it unnecessary to repeat arguments which are already familiar as household words your committee therefore recommend the adoption of the following res olutions resolved that slavery is a crime against humanity and a sore evil in the body politic that was excused by the framers ot the federal constitution asa crime entailed upon the country by their predecessors and tolerated solely as a tning of inexorable necessity resolved that the so called compromises of the constitution restrained the federal government from interference with slavery only

so as to prevent the extension of slavery into territory now free and to abolish slavery and the slave trade wherever either exists under the jurisdiction of congress resolved that our senators and

to the union of territory already acquired or which may be hereafter acquired without express prohibition of slavery either in the constitution of each new state asking admission or in the act of congress providing for such admission resolved further that our senators and representatives in congress be requested to support every just and prudent measure for the exclusion of slavery from the

at syracuse it lias been determined that a convention f the abolitionists of the state of new york shall be held at syracuse on tuesday the thof january the present aspect of national affairs in regard to the question of slavery the present position of political parties in relation to those affairs the present relation which abolitionists who have pie served their faith inviolate hold to those parties and the relation which abolitionists now sustain to each other and the cause demand that such a convention be held in this state that it be held dining the ensuing session of congress and that it shall represent the entire strength of that portion of our people who are hostile not ouly to the extension ot slavery into new teititories but to us existence anywhere who are determined not only to resist us establishment on the coast of the pactiic or in the valleys of new mexico but are equally determined on its extermination on the atlantic coast and in the valley of the mississippi the events of tbe jjhst year the events of the passing week the events probably which will signalize the present winter appeal to all who aassume to themselves the name of abolitionists to arouse themselves at once to the work of making this the largest and uiostinriueutial antislavery convention that has ever been held in this state the warning cry of no union auk slaveholders and their abettors was never more needed than at this moment and has never bean so needed as it will be in the present crisis particulars of tune place and probable continuance of the convention and names of the distinguished triends of the cause who will be present will be given in futuse notice the north star pair we would call the attention of our loaders in philadelphia to the north star fair which

legation the first candidate started on the democratic aide waa howell cobb of georgia a wellknown aad inveterate slaveholder he came within a very few votes of being elected the northern democrats

exceptions voted for him mr welland the only democrat in this state excepting preston king who isa free soilei from the very commencement stuck fast by this georgia slaveholder aa a fit and proper

on the ground of the wilmot proviso and refusing to give their votes for any man who was not prepared touse his influence against the farther extension of slavery all that followed our readers will find under our summary of congressional proceedings both parlies seem now to beat their wits end they find that unless they coalesce without the help of the third patty they cannot sir a loot they remind us ol two wellmatched gladiators both keen cool and resolute eaoh looking in the eye othe other and fearful to strike a blow lest u so doing he should make a false step an thereby give his antagonist a blight bu latal advantage how long this state o things may last it is impossible to predict we do not sec any particular reason why i should not last for several weeks or perhapi months no matter congress is as profitably and properly engaged now as it will lx after it succeeds in organizing the grea difficulty now is slavery after the house has elected a speaker it will still be slavery in one shape or another this haggard iniquity will rise up and demand a hearing the southern members are now making i furious and we would fain hope a final effor for the pieservation of that power which fo so many long years they have held and b which they have succeeded in crushing dowi the hopes and energies of millions th northern membeis of both parties are for th most part sufficiently subservient many o them have time and again sold themselves t slavery nd would gladly if isy dared do now but there is heard in all parts of thi north a voice waxing louder and louder ii favor of freedom there is a strong feeliiq amongst their constituents against the continued dominance of slavery and it is at thei peril that they refuse to listen to that voice that they despise that feeling antislaver and fanaticism are not now considered synon yrnous radical abolitionism is still nearly if not quite as unpopular as less uncompromising opinions not long since were yet i has become fashionable rather than otherwise to profess antislavery sentiments the idea which some years ago burned in th bosom and aroused the indignation and energies of the poor young printer in a bostot garret has taken deep root spread itself fai and wide and is now responded to by mana free boin soul in all the northern states o this union the members of congress both whigs and democratsknow this thej know that in a few years at the farthest t day of reckoning will come round and unlesi they now pay some regard to the will of theii constituents they may be sent to ruminate ii merited oblivion on lost opportunities for advancing the cause of suffering humanity and disgraceful acts of purchased subserviency tc to the tyrannical destroyers of human happiness and impious obstuctors of human pro gress meanwhile it is amusing enough for a lookeron to note the vigor and energy with which the organs of both the old parties denounce the free soil members as the immediate cause of the difficulties m tbe house they are named disorganizesenemies of their country men who huckster theit votes from one party to the other c and al this simply because they in some measfie act up to the

notice ofa meeting held in the court house last week to take into consideration the illegal ejeetraent of colored children from the district schools in this city the house was well filled and the unfortunate victims of colotphobia and prejudice who were guilty of the cruelty and injustice of excluding children from the schools simply because they are colored met with merited exposure and reproof we were satisfied before the meeting that the majority of the citizens of rochester disapproved of the proceedings of the board in reference to colored schools the liberality of sentiment there displayed fully confirmed our opinion with the exception of dr long who we apprehend is the cause of all the mischief not one raised his voice on behalf of the measure the doctor tried to have it believed that a regulation of the city required the tablishment of colored schools we almost pitied the poor man when another member of the board read the regulation to which he referred and showed plainly that it was only permissory not imperative to such mean tricks of tergiversation and falsehood will prejudice reduce otherwise respectable enough men the democrat speaking of this meeting says if as is alleged the colored people have been taxed for the election of schoolhouses and the support of schools in the several districts there would appear to be injustice in the matter somewhere we do not believe that the prejudices against the colored people are such or so general as to prohibit theii children from attending the ordinary day schools as a matter of right wherever the franchise is allowed them at least there car be no doubt that they have the same privilege as others this is pretty well for the democrat bui we think it might have been a little more bold and explicit without forfeiting either influence or esteem for we do not expect any political paperat all events not one belonging u either of the old parties to utter a wore where these are at stake ifthere is nt if about the matter the democrat knows well enough that colored men have beer taxed for the erection of district schools anc if they had not still the injustice of excluding colored children from the district school would be abundantly manifest while uu children of white parents who have nevei paid a cent of taxes either for schools or anything else are admitted freely and wiihoui question as to the matter of the fraanchise that too is quite irrelevant to the case inasmuch as the children of foreigners the da after they arrive in the city can and do claim admittance we cannot at all agree with the democrat that it is best to leave the subject in the hands of the board of education they have already overstepped their powers the law of the state is that all persons over five years of age and under twentyone are entitled to the privileges of the district schools so far as we know the word color is never mentioned in that law the board must not be permitted though they are in authority for the gratification of their unreasoning prejudices to violate the lawespe cially when it is en the side of justice meantime the colored schools are almost deserted the new school on the east side of the river which has been established at acost to the city of five hundred dollars aycar has some seven or eight colored childrenwho are ashamed of themselves for being there and about a dozen ragged white children w hogo there as their parents say because it is convenient we trust that before the next meeting of the board they will have discovered the folly and irrationality of their procedure and willing to retrace their steps by the bye where is the remonstrance we have seen nothing of it i d the mysterious rappingpublic meetings for investigation by the kindness ot a friend i have been furnished with the north of november d and find an article in it over tbe initials j d which although using my name prptty freely the publisher had not the courtesy or frankness to send me this may serve for an apology for the late appearance of this contradiction of some of tbe most barefaced misrepresentations contained in that article in doing so i will endeavor to be brief and convey as piamly ss possible my meaning by coming dissetiy to the point would accuse j d of no intentional wrong as aman is coaaidered innocent until be is proved guilty althoughn this ease the presumptioo will he atroogiy against him in the minds of au who were present n corinthian hall aud have read his article ooe of the first errors or fake tnmnuations will notice is this mr caproo of auburn late editor of the auburn branch of the national reformer appeared on the pfctfotm accompanied by tbe two young woman through whom the spirit or whatever else it may be makes itself nwfims iby no means object to the company here assigned to me bet i do object tn any lake statement in regard to facts which y he wmthy of the nuenikw of even the jnejedioed tffed of i d at some future time if not the present when the two young women appeared on the mr capeen had not yet snivod end they were oonnmpomed by six or eight ladies aed gentlemen of rochester who were well hpdjl them and whom i d

io those lectures for these mysterious sounds the facts were stated sod an io test igathsfaf led for sod others called upon to decide whatit was and what it was not if they were capable of doing iso again j d says that mr capron staled that the spirit or wbat erer it was foiled htm home to aider and rapped to lum in his own house there never u any such statement made by roe in corinthian hall or any other place it is an entire misrepresentation of my language if fa spirit or whatever tt was followed roe home that spirit or it could not have been at rochester at the same time it is a language i nevet use neither is it the language of any one pietending to any degree of knowledge or intelligence on this subject it sounds mote like the language of persons who with all the stubbornness of mules would not or could not from the nature of their organizations candidly and lairly investigate the matter and who stand ready to abuse their best friends for hearing or seeing something they will not or cannot previous to making the statement you doubtless allude to all in tbe hall had heard me state that these sounds were not only heard in rochester but in many other placenot only in presence of the two young women but many other persons who have no knowledge of these young women j d next attempts to play the critic and show an inconsistency in ray saying inone lecture the words you had better go there and in the next you had better do that and evidently wishes to give it a coloring against the truthfulness of the lecturer it would be a sufficient answer for him to say physician heal thyselfbut foi the readeis of the star will say that brief as the sentence is i quoted from memory and very possibly might have left out some word in both statements i intended to state the substance and if j d will show the discrepancy in that i will give him farther explanation if he requires it again the sounds are supposed to be made by two young women supposed by whom by the fifteen citizens of rochester who spent three days in the investigation by those who have embraced every opportunity for investigation for the last two years orby those who have never given the matter a moments candid thought are the sounds in the other families in rochester in the towns adjoining in hydesville in auburn in sennett and in various other places all at the same time supposed to be made by two young women if so they must be supposed to be very nearly omnipresent in regard to his failing to get conect answers i have only to say that have known others equally unfortunate and that none of his friends who know most of the matter deny this but i know and he knows unless he is willing to brand some of his best friends as fools or liars that there have been questions of the most absolutely definite character answered correctly and that has evinced an intelligence not a meaner but a far higher intelligence than mans persons wffiom j d would believe on any other subject but thisand who were at one time as skeptical as himself are looked upon as telling that which is false or at least treated in that way by many who know them to be incapable of falsehood passing over his attempt to ridicule a weapon very cheap and within the reachjof those who stand in very mirey places i wish to correct another error in his article i am sorry to have the bench of that county or any county disgraced by calling mister josiah bissel the leader of the rowdies at corinthian hall a judge he is evidently a judge of a few things which decent men generally are not but the sense in which j d mentioned it he has no claim to nor never will unless anarchy pievails and iow dies and ruffians bear s ay mister bissell is undoubtedly a good judge of torpedoes or hp would not have taken the responsibility of making a purchase and distributing to the audience at corinthian hall on the night alluded to in concluding i will say that i can conceive of no one who is better prepared to judge of the spirit of an old bachelor than j d having for some years occupied that whimsical fidgetty positiof himself e w c remarks  the above letter by mr capron of auburn u as will be seen an attempt to explain i or rather contradict the account given by us of ius laetuies in this city a few weeks since on what is called the mysterious manifestations we fear however that the writer has sadly failed in his present effort to throw any light on this dark subject we feel that he lias rather cceefied in rnoje so what was already sufficiently suspicious tho course which he has taken in replying to os affords evidence to our mind that he is not himself quite satisfied with the evidences affi rded he is clearly ill at ease in hia new belif when one is quite sure of his position be calm composed unmindful of seeming misrepresentation mr ciproo is petulant iin iy nmtifliind like the little snarling terrier ready to pounce upon any and every pas set jer without cause or provocation we have one apology to offer mr ca pronthat is fur nut sending him the paper in which hia lectures were noticed he will pk ise attribute our negligence to forgetfulness and not to any want of respect about ibt first of our barefaced representations we may aay that wo did not know w hot far or not tfa lecturer came into tfa hall io company with those yoong women sod do not imagine moreover that any candid reader of oar notice would understand us to rey that be did beaidea it does not appear trier all to be a very unpardonable offence supposing we did say so mr capron io our opinioo whatever fa ghy himself think of it did nothing wrong if fa brought there all tfa way from tfaii ovrii bouse we did see a number of persons oo the platform so wo mwflmli number of chairs aad a desk fat did oot think it worth while to enumerate thorn more they were not known j supposed to take nny strive part the proceedings t wa would recommend mr apraa to lock mm man at wr articles and be will see dm we sever soerasil him of setting op ai far a wfb origin fat tbia thing for the aery simple tenoon that bn coaid not we nay now however that whatever might he its origin be left h to be infarred that he thought it was the opening op of a new world or the discovery of a new science from h ie ferences to tho unpopularity at first of harvey jeulrir and others if he did not mean us understand him thus what did he mean he rarely does not intend it to be understood that be took all the trouble of getting up a ecture on a subject which he considered of no importance merely from a desire for notoriety or some mercenary motive we never supposed any such thing respecting him and cannot do so now mr capron does make one explanation he nays that the spirit did not fallow him to anhum well one uf the fraternity was there and rapped to him in auburn we will not dispute with ha about that we certainly understood however that he meant the rochester branch of the fiim had communicated with him and we are at a loss now to tell by what piocess of rcaaoomg he arrives at the conclusion that it was some other the various spiritt communicate their ideas in a language and tone so marvellously alike that he musthave a very acute ear who can distinguish a difference between them and the mere fact of their saying that they are tnis that or the other is noihing to the purpose inasmuch as we have oftentimes proved them liars as to this thing being a high intelligence whatever may have happened to others we have had no proofs of its intelligence what a man would ay in ten minutes and make perfectly clear to every understanding takes this thing a day and after all it leaves in a quite unsatisfactory state besides what would he thought of the intelligence of the man who would say to you when sitting in a room in company with some dozen others l have something to say to youcome into a back rsom or into the passage and l will talk with you there and after he has got you there says nothing except perhaps to send you back from where you came or to sitdown by a table with a further promise of some important communication which promise is as much fulfilled as the other every reasonable person would of course conclude at once that he was either an idiot or was playing a trick yet this as mr c and all the other friends of the rapping wellknown is its constant inode of procedure or suppose the case of a man who knew that a dead body was in the canal and was to be found at a certain place suppose further that this man in consequence of some physical incapacity was himself unable and that he communicated his information to two women and told them to go into the canal and get the body out would not most persons come to the conclusion that such man was either very silly or very tipsy l yet this is exactly what the spirit did not a very great while ago and one of the persons favored with the commission came nigh being drowned indeed as she heiself says would have been drowned had not her husband accompanied her and taken the precaution to tie a rope round her to prevent such a catastrophe or what would be thought of a man who continually putting forward high pretensions to knowledge on one or another scientific or abstruse subject yet when you come to converse with him and put his knowledge to the proof fails to give any evidence calculated to convince even the most credulous that he has such knowledge we should call hima very silly braggart fit for the latitude of south carolina and no where else yet this is exactly the spirits plan such illustrations might be multiplied indefinitely but one or two will answer our purpose as well as a host they prove to our mind beyond a shadow of doubt that this thing whatever it is knows very little and pretends to know a great deal more than it does the fact of other persons being more fortunate than we have been is no evidence to us this is one of those sort of things which we cannot without throwing our reason to the winds take vpon hearsay evidence and we need not in consequence of our unbelief be accused of supposing any one to lie either a fool or a inr all that we say is that we suspect as we have seen in cases of answers thought to be remarkable given to our presence that some persons are quite too tender with the spirit and do not take proper precautions to guard their countenances and their questions so that not even a yankee could guess at the answer we do not think it worth while to follow mr capron farther and do not fear that any candid reader of our notice who was present at those meetings will accuse us of unfairness we had no intention to misrepresent mr capron ali that we desire is u get at the truth to expose imposture if there beany either in this or any other affair that comes under our notice and we think that in doing so we have a right to point out any discrepancy or difficulty that presents itself without subjecting ourselves to the supposition that we intentionally either misstate misrepresent or falsely insinuate it our readers sre not much the wiser or the better for the perusal of the above letter they w ill not be much the worse in the meantime

those representing the whig party from he north would not and the others dare not hen brought before their constituents say it the wilmot prptrtso was a humbug and tomfoolery mr koot yielding for explanation mr rxvlv l think it due to myself and llonc to say that since i was last up i oe had a conversation with the gentleman n indiana mr brown j was mistaken win mint no correspondence had

said he would like to kuow it these two ureal parties were brought into such a terrible predicament that they vihj not ogams tl house w ithout cutting t seme of those who happened to differ with them and depriving them of their rights l it uf as great an outrage upon him mr r t they deprived him alone of the right to peak ote and act upon this question as it would be to cut of forty or eighty or one hundred au l twelve from the same right hi v had no right to do it and it they want d to preserve their character they would noti prive the humblest member on the floor of tie ftco exercise of his rights if this resolution took clicet the fiec sutlers were done as iu ns an ufluence in the organization of the house was concerned he did not feel that die remarks w hich had been made in relation to mnething being loiten in denmark affected luiri at all they would ail be wiser tii reaftei the peculiar state of things in dll body at this particular time may perhaps lie somewhat illustrated by an anecdote which have heard ol one of my countrymen member the universal yankee nation lie was traveling on a steamboat on the ohio river and having made the acquaintance of a fellow passenger from the lower country they jot up a friendly game of poker by way ol killing tune after playing for awhile the mississippi in a tone of vexation exclaimed should really like to know what has u ome of all

application mr brown of indiana said that he mr n hail come on in washington city never tor a moment dreaming of being a candidate for ilie speakership of this house he had rn experience in such matters had never made them his study when the suggestion had been made lo him that lie occupying middle ground and coming from free state would in all probability be able to concen trito as great a number of votes as any other individual on the democratic side of the ijjj huil recwivuii she with perfect astonisbrnwr in tliis state of the case he first received a tetter from the gentleman from

with whom he had served in a lormet congress and w ho he believed had generally voted with him for they were on ihe democratic side of the house desired a oiili ience with him that conference took place and in the course of h he found that the objection which they had against voting fm him as speaker the great objection which had impressed itself on their minds was iliat lie was selected as the favorite of the souththat the gentleman from north carolina in his eye mr venable had said ihat lie was pledged not to vote for any wilmot proviso mail lor speaker and that lie would turn round and vote lor him in reply the expression of these fears he had stated t these gentlemen that fie had not made any ledges to any individual as to the committee jipou winch he should be placed he had mated to these gentlemen that he would so onsiitutc these committees as that all sections of the union should he represented this much he had stated and by that position he would abide now they had asked a fair representation of all interests and all opinions nothing mote if lie had desired to put in the hands d those gentlemen that with which they might go forth aud break the heads of those who differed from themrf lie had desired to f urnish opportunity and cause of complaint against the south his policy would be to constitute these committees ot southern men and to take these eight freesoil gentlemen and put them away on the corner ut some unimportant committees wrth the permission of the house he would now read the letter mr brown having yielded the floor mr wilmot said that he had a conversation with the gentleman from indiana mr blown of which with the permission of gen lemen he would state the substance he mr w expressed to that gentleman the convirrnin which he honestly entertained that the putti voice in respect to the great question which now agitated this country would be stifled in the committees of this house all dial lie and those who were associated with him asked or desired was a fair opportunity to give expulsion to the great public sentiment of the people u f the country they wanted am they asku nothing more all that he and ins friends had desired ar

slavery where they have the constituiional power to abolish it am yours truly w j brown hon david wilmot during mr browns remarks and during almost the entire day great confusion andex citement prevailed through the house mr burt resumed he was one of the representatives fiom the southern states who had given his vote with some mistrust to the gentleman who had just taken his seat he begged his honorable friend from virginia from the accomac districtwho had more minute information on the subject than he mr b possessed to the up now and state w hat communications had been made to him he referred to mr bayly mr baylyl take pleasure in responding to the inquiries of my friend from south carolina mr burt it was known that had served in the twentyeighth congress with the member from indiana mr brown and when he began to be spoken of as speaker frequent inquiries were made of me as to his opinions and votes on the slavery question among others such inquiries were made of me by my friend from georgia mr wel bornj i told him that noone could have taken a more unexceptionable course when a gentleman from massachusetts the late speaker of this house mr winthrof had in moved an amendment to the oregon bill containing the principles of the wilmot proviso the member from indiana mrbrown voted against it and that upon all jther occasions as far as i knew he had vo ed with the southern democracy upon all ther questions touching the subject of slavery assured him that no one could pre lent a fairer record had i known of the ex stence and character of the correspondence which has just been read and of theintei riews preceding it no earthly considerations would have induced me to vote as i did mr venble said i feel it due to uiyself hat i shouldjbe relieved fiom

known the transaction or opinions disclosed this morning ould not have voted for him mr robinson of indiana made some remarks explaining and extenuating the course adopted by his colleague mr brown mr hubbard said that after his arrival here he had addressed the gentleman from indiana a letter requesting that he would call upon him the gentleman came and showed him the record of his past course with that he mr h was satisfied the gentleman said something in reference to what would be his course in appointing committees he mr ii had told him lie wanted to hear nothing about that mi stanton of tennessee nit man can regret more than do the necessity for this discussion but i do not regret since the facts existed that they have been brougit to light i feel it incumbent upon me sir to say one word in explanation i am miforunately among those who voted for the gentleman from indiana even to the hitter end i feel sir that the odium of this transaction however unjustly will in some measure tall upon mysell in common with the whole south i desire to throw off this odium and i deem it a complete justification to say that could never have supported the gentleman if had entertained the least suspicion of such a transaction as that which has lieen disclosed after some further remarks by various speakers en motion ot mr dunham of ind ihe house adjourned thursday dtc mi brown of mississippi rose and said that he would ask leave of the house to offer the resolution which he would send to the clerks desk the resolution was lead as follows resolved that howell cobb of georgia is hereby chosen speaker of the house of the thirtyfirst congress mr butler suggested that the proposition of the gentlemen from mississippi be received in blank and that the house proceed not knowing exactly where their votes would fall this morning to fill the blank that the name receiving the highest number of votes should be inserted and the vote of the house then be taken upon the resolution if it did not carry in that form that the name receiving the next highest number of votes should be inserted and the vote again taken upon the resolution thus filled mr thompson of penn we have been nine or ten days endeavoring to organize this house by the election of a presiding officer a gentlemen from ohio a lew days since proposed to ballot for speaker voted against the resolution because i believed we could still elect by the course adopted and in practice for the last ten years this expectation has failed some other expedient must be adopted this is the only one theone w hich am about

until ilia boar above named shill hart arrived mr carter of ohio offered the following resolution feaatwrhat any oetsoo who may be elected speaker of this house shall be diverted of the pswet to construct the district and temtsria committees and that tbe same shall be made by a vote of the house he mr carter thought that the house was involving itself in a premature controversy on thestibjqff of slavery presenting itself before the country in the ridiculous attitude of making a grave issue upon a mere ceremonial matter mr meadk said neither of ike resolutions before the house strikes at thu root of the evil which affects the house we bare been acting for eight days a farce before the people at a cost io them of a day which all will agree is leconamg fo s and less entertaining i have anxiertcgtjnuated for some ourtius from the nustkfo dpi regardless ol personal consequcimpjmof it will leap into the gulf which yawitslbt the peace and happiness of this union sir leta proposition be made and supported by those who are desirous of crushing this demon of discord for the puipose of uniting the conservatism on uih sides in opposition to any measure which shall look to the abolition of slavery in the district or a prohibition of itin the territories if such a proposition should be adopted should be willing to take a speaker from either side of the house relying ipon him to carry out the views thus express by a majority ol this body hut if the organization of this house is tobe followed by the pissagpof laws which wilf enslave a large portion of this confederacy if these outrages are to be committed upon my people i trust in god sir that tny eys have rested upon the last sjeakgol the house of representatives mr hoot rernaiked upon the great difficulty which he had in telling what was the precise question before ihe house three propositions he said having been made viz the first to elect the speaket by ballot the seeond to deprive the speaker of powers usually exercised by him in reference to constituting tbe committees and the third to moderate the spirit of anarchy which was abroad in the land he would endeavor to notice these propositions tn their order he was opposed to the proposition to vote by ballot liecause it would be likely to be con strned hy the people as a proposition to enable genllemnn by skulking under the ballot to vote differently from the manner in which they would vole where a record was mnde he was opposed to the proposition made by his colleague from the stark district mr carter to deprive the speaker of the power of appointment of certain committees and said it reminded him of the performance which he had heard had somewhere been advertised to be playedof hamlet with the part of hamlet omitted a laugh it would not answer for a good dodge if it were intended to open a hole for tender footed free soil democrats to escape by it would not answer the purpose he now came to the other matter the dissolution of the union or that kind of moderation which was to prevent it he trusted with the calm moderate counsels ol such gentlemen as the honorable gentleman from virginia mr meade we would get along without dissolution a laugh he noticed the computation made by mrbrown of mississippi tor show that the democratic party had the majority in the house and expressed his doubts as to its correctness he did not know the gentle mans data but bis word for it to make outa majority to enable them to elect a speaker that party would have to reckon some of the rankest kind of free soilcrsnot only wil motproviso men but the wilmot proviso himself and referred in a manner which elicited much merriment to the attempt hy which they bad yesterday by combining so mcoiirtmoua elements come ko umur cfeciina a iwiwucf wm ocictihw try a very few leaks owing to a defective cooperage a laugh they had almost come it not quite there was nothing however in that result he thought to discouiage them they should keep on trying he did not w ant to interfere in this difficulty at ll he knew belter he was not so fond of a fig lit as to lead him into it he had seen enough of the chivalry to make hint a little cautious he had heard the din een the dust and smelt the smoke of the fight and the way the chivalry had charged upon their quondam candidatepar ticularly towards the close of the battlebad satisfied him mr r that it would be aswell never to get into any fuss with those gentlemen it lie could help it well now if that man was not brought to a condition where he could lie trusted on the slavery question he would like to knowhow any man could be laughter mr duek the gentleman from mississippi mr brown has introduced a proposition declaring the genileman from georgia mr curb to he the speaker of this house in other words a proposition calling upon his mr di ers side ol ihe house the whig side to make an unconditional surrender it apieared to him that this was asking altogether lot much for his own part so anxious was he that an organization should be effected that he was willing to organize in almost any way hy electing to the speakers chair eilher a whig or a democrat or a freesoiler any one in short except a dis umonist he never would give his vote for any man whom he believed to be inimical to the union mr luyly interposing said there are no disumonisls in this house mr disk i wish could think so but fear there are mr bayly who are they point them out mr dler believe there are some from your own slate think i see one of them now jointing to mr meade of va mr meade it is fake mr dler you re a liar sir quick as thought mr meade made a rush towards mr dler but was immediately surrounded by his friends as was also mr dler who remained standing in the sition in w hich he had spoken indescnbable contusion followed threats violent gesticulations call to order and demands for adjournment were mingled together the house was like a heaving billow tire clerk called to order but there were none to heed him some time elapsed the sergeantataims of the late house of representatives nathan saruent esq now took the mace ir his hand and descending along the ctowd of members held it upon high cries it take away the mace it has no authority here mr dler at length obtained a hearing he would he said continue his remarks and in the first place he would beg pardon of ihe house for having uttered language winch he hd fell himself called upon to utter but of ihe impropriety of which he had not at the time beerrfiilly conscious he was no prepared at ibis time to rote for any proposition bat he thought it probable that if the l house would consent to adjourn for a day or two some understanding might be arrived at mr toombs said the difficulties in the wf ot the orjjamxationofihia house are apparent ami well understood here and should be understood by the country a great sectional question he at the fo audition of all these trouble we hate just listened to strong appeals upon the neceßsity of organising the ilouse confess do m foel that neeesw j ty from the best fights before me cannot twe that my constituents base anyth tog to hot from your legislation

ready to concede aad sacrifice for it whatever a jest aad honorable nan ought to naenfice i will do no more but ido net hesitate to avoir before this house and the ceunitv and in rhe presence of the living that if bvj your legislation you seek to drive as from the territories of california and new mexico purchased by the common blood and treasure f the whole people and to abohh slavery ia this lhstriet thereby attempting to fix a national degradation upon half the states of thta confederacy jam for dumnton and if toy physical courage be equal to the maintenance of my convictions of right and duty i will devote all am and all f have on earth toits consummation h e must arouse and appeal to the nation we mast tell them boldly aad frankly that we prefer any calamities to submission to such degradation ami injury as they would entail upon us that we hold that to be the consummation of all evil have stated my position j have not argued them i reserve that for afuture occasion these ate the principles upon which i act here give me securities that the power of the uigantsation which you seek will nut be used to the injury of my constituents then you can have my cooperation but not ul then gram them and you prevent the recurrence of the disgraceful scenes of the last twentyfour hours and restore tranquility to the country jlrfuee them and as far as i am concerned tut dia coid reign forever several times during the delivery of these remarks mr t was interrupted by loud i bursts of applause mr baker of i avow myself in the first place as decidedly in favor of what is called the wilmot proviso it embodies a principle approved by my judgement and dear tojny beau and yet i may say that have not sought to make this a test in the selection of a speaker or the organization ol this house desire in ihe next place to remark as to the threats of disunion listened to so painfully and so intensely sir i deny that the great body of the people from the north have w ished to raise j such a question or to excite unreasonable agitation nor when the scenes and speeches of this day shall he spread before them will they believe our brethren of the south to be in earnest gentlemen when you threaten a dissolution of the union we shall doubt when you protest we shall disclaim but no fervid declarations no fiery appeals to southern feeling no solemn invocations to the almighty asif indeed he was a god of discord will make us believe that here in this hall there is one man who chambers in his secret heart apurpose so accursed and so deadly sir we do not believe the union can ever be dissolved no evidence shall convince us until the deed is done yet if such a thing be possible it hall not be our fault we shall not be intimidated by threats of violence we shall not shrink from the calm expression of our deliberate judgment we are here as freemen to speak for freemen and we will speak and act as becomes us in the face of the world and of posteiity mi stephens rose and said that he never expected to live to see the day when upon i this floor he should be called upon to discuss the question of the union of these states if in early life continued mr s there was anything in my heart cherished above all others it was the glorious conpact formed by our fathers of the revolutionary struggle sir as has just been said i believe that so long as american hearts beat in american bosoms tiie day will never come when the union of these states shall be dissolved but tell that gentleman mi baker and i tell this housewhether he believes it or not and whether the people of the north believe it or notthat the day in w hich aggression is consummated upon any section of the country much and deeply as i regret it this union is dissolved il gentlemen suppose that by singing paeans iff t cxrrtrt it ia uf fccrjjr wxia r tru nod themselves mistaken the union was founded upon justiceimmutable justice and right it was not to render the weak subject to the aggressions of the strong itis ag well that tins debate should have come today as at any tune so that the great american heart may he awakened i believe that it has been slumbering would rather that the southern country should perishthat all her statesmen and all her gallant spirits should be buried in honorable graves than submit for one instant to degradaiinn mr cleveland of connecticut am not a little astonished at the exhibition of passion i hate witnessed on this occasion by gentlemen of the south charges are made of aggression upon the rights of the south when and where have these rights of the south ever been trespassed upon by the north l what does the south ask of the north that we shall forget that we are freemen the representattves of freemen that we should yield our opinions our principles to their dictation this cannot be republican government rests upon the will of the people expressed by majorities our differences must he decided upon this principle after some further discussion the house proceeded to vote viva voce for speaker the roll was called when the tellers reported that the whole of voles given was necessary to a choice of which mr wintlirop received mr cobb the rest scattering amongst b names the house then adjourned fnday and saturday passed over m a somewhat similar manner various resolutions were offered and after a desultory conversation upon

faithfully lobe adhered to remembering it is by united efforts that the bonds of the fettered slave must be broken we know that the laborers in the great w ork of reform are comparatively few but truth is mighty and we are encouraged in believing that the day of redemption draweth nigh as we are assured that the faithfulness of the few tried and devo the chains and set at liberty many a desponding captive and the reflection stimulates us to a greater devotedness knowing full well that the corrupting and demoralizing effects of slavery on our white as well as our colored brothers and sisters call loudly and imperatively upon our holiest feelings for energetic action while opportunity is yet afforded considering the disabilities we are laboring under and the apathy of the mass around us on this vitally interesting subject much has been done in these parts during the past year but a steady peisevering uncompromising devotion is indispensable and we hope that while we lalmr with unliring zeal to strike at the root of this infernal system we shall remember that bursting the fetters should be followed by the genial influences of sympathy and elevation and that during our deliberations some suggestions may be made with regard to devising means to place the escaped bondmen in situations in which their long buried intellect their manhood shall be called out that they may be prepared to receive the truth that they may be recipients of gods love and thus be enabled to enjoy the boon of liberty of which they have so long been robbed we again say to our friends far andi

legacy from a person one has never men and scarcely ever heard of i am glad to hear it replied mr henderaon one may congratulate him on hia accession of wealth without fear of giving rite to painful regrets six thousand pounds would no console one for the lons of a very dear friend six thousand pound would be ver pleasant to inherit phillip re pi it t the lady in a tone which seemed to imply thst it would cossole her for agreat deal i wish somebody would leave as much for you how happy it would make us i am not so sure of that such an addition to our income might possibly make us nsither happier nor richer than we are at present not richer why phillip you are jo ng would not three hundred a yearmake us a great deal richer what an advantage it would be what do you need sophia that you do not at present possess tbat you i are ao extremely desirous of a larger income oh a dozen things at least we would put edward to a firstrate school and have a capital governess for the others what a pleasure that would be i should be no more tied to teaching as i am now but should be as independent of the nurser as mrs andrews and then perhaps you would ndulge me with a week in london and lam dying to hear an opera i am sure you could afford that for once ina way hope we shall manage to send edward to a good school my dear said her husband rather gravely j though as to tuition of the girls i think you must still be contented to act the part of a mother towards them and permit me to say tbat i trust your desire of going to london is as visionary as your expectation of a legacy our happiness does not depend on either event i should imagine certainly not so much as on the cultivation ofa cheerful and contented spirit such as you have always hitherto exhibit ed no more was said on the subject and mr henderson trusted that as the first excitement of this intelligence subsided his wifes inclination to discontent would likewise die away and jhal she would gradually resume the use ofher reason and her habits of active usefulness the inheritor of this unexpected legacy meantime did not view the affaii hi tk kipkl lki jncted mr henderson on the contrary he hac many and serious thoughts on the subject he was at the first moment it is true much pleased with the sudder accession of property hut when he came to consider the matter he experienced a great revulsion of feeling and he began to doubt whether he was sc lucky a man as his acquaintance universally denominated him it was after all so small a sumonly six thousand poundsit would hardly add to his income or increase bis credit why had it not been ten thousand he would he thought have been quite satisfied with that that would have been a handsome legacy a something worth talking about a gift to be grateful for peniaps had it been ten thousand he might have risen a step in the world and from senior clerk of the extensive firm to which he belonged he might have been admitted as partner a change which he ardently desired why could not his cousin have made his legacy larger how provoking that either from want of interest in hih welfare or from any other cause he had stopped short of a sum which would certainly have procured him as he imagined perfect happiness the gloom which overspread his brow was not unmarked by his affectionate wife and supposing that he was overwearied with his work and standing in deed of relaxation she one day proposed tbat he should beg a short holiday from the office and spend it with them at the seaside i cannot afford any such extravagant pleasures tth reply somewhat

tka whiapera ofa newlyawakened avarice mr andrews after pacing tka room foronto minutes seated himself again ky his wife and triad to make her understand the ambitious projects he had formed and tba great poaitioo he believed be had so narrowly missed but he was too clearsighted and wall principled to encourage visionary projects which tended only to diaqaiet tba mind and prevent bis anjoying tka bleaaings which ware lawfully hie to hu plan of laying by tka whole of this addition to their incoma aka did not of course object if it was to enable bar husband at some future time to retire from business but his wish to become proprietor of the concern to which he belonged made her sigh as aha thought of the increased responsibility he desired for himself ami aha dreaded lest the sudden passion for accumulation which bad now seised him might lead him farther in the road of covetousness than be bad at all anticipated but hit project was fixed and be resolved at ail aventa to become possessor of ten thousand pounds a preliminary step as he imagined to this great advancement and seeing that she must subunit she wisely submitted with good grace ahd resigned her hopes of change of air for herself and children without a murmur mr andrews and mr henderson were clerks in tha same concern but the ormer both in station and income was considerably the senior and mrs henderson had long been accustomed to eye with something approaching to envy the superior comforts and even elegancies which mrs andrews enjoyed not that there was anything like ostentation in their manner of living and in truth most of the indulgences which mrs henderson commented on or coveted were purchased from the comfortable portion which mrs andrews had inherited of her latherlt was this which enabled them to send their eldest son to a superior school and it was out of this fund that the excellent governess was paid who shared with the mother the task of educating a numerous and increasing family that people already possessed of so much should inherit more seemed an unnecessary addition and almost an unfair division of worldly goods to the jealous apprehension of mrs henderson but had she known the truth her envy mußt have subsided into pity from the possession of that fatal legacy was the wife iorced to date a melancholy and most distressing alteration in bet husband his whole nature seemed changed every honorable generous and even affectionate feeling appeared smothered in a passion for gain quickly to accumulate the desired capital was his thought by day hia dream by night and to accelerate that object he tried in every possible way to curtail all expenses not strictly unavoidable gradually but surely mrs andrews found herself deprived of numerous trifles which her delicate health seemed to require their household was oimmrstieo woscnptions to charities withdrawn their pleasant and commodious house exchanged for a cheaper abode in a iess healthy situation and when il appeared that it was of too contracted dimensions to receive them all she was told that she must therefore give up the governess by degrees the whole expenses of the household were reduced to the sum which was in truth her own and her husband was not to be prevailed on to extend its limits or allow her to touch his salary had honor jionesty or prudence dictated this proceeding mrs andrews would have submitted without a remonstrance her zeal in economy would even have exceed his but to feel herself and children deprived of those advantages to which they had been accustomed from birth only to gratify a fatallyincreasing disease of her husbands mind was bitter but bittterer far was the loss of his affection and confidencethe painful coldness which had insensibly grown up between them it was after a few years of such a system that a new prospect was suddenly opened in an offer of partnership from another and a rival house the prospect was alluring in every respect the concern was supposed to be peculiarly flourishing and the terms in which it was made were as flattering as they were advantageous eagerly was the proposal grasped by mr andrews it being superior to his hopes and much beyond his expectations and the impartant step was taken which raised him from servitude to a masters place the vacancy this change occasioned was offered iomr henderson aad by turn thankfully and gratefully accept eij but his wife though now raised to the situation wtuah ska bad long courted found it kf no moans replete with all the advantages she bad been accustomed to ascribe

the contrast which her husbands coromoions exhibited but uufflng and complete termination wwfat length put to their trials and sorrows for it suddenly became known that the two senior partners in the business had fled taking with them every pound on which they could lay their grasp and leaving the whole concern in estate of complete ruin debts to an enormous amount appeared due on every side and it was evident that the business had long been on the verge of bankruptcy which had only been kept off for brief period by the capital andrewa brought themof course though clear of their guilt he was involved in their ruin and at one blow the labors of the last six years were destroyed and the money on which he had set his heart was swept away forever the legacy the source alike of pleasure and of pain wai now become as if it had never been and the vafn desires and ardent hopes which had been founded on it had proved vanity of vanities but k was a happy blow for him he awoke as from a dream and with the demolition of his ambitious projects there came other and better plans and feelings after honestly giving up every farthing he possessed to his creditors he looked around for employment to provide bread for his family nor did he seek in vain a situation was once more offered him in mr walkers house and here he began the world again as at first well said mr anderson to his wife agree with you in thinking andrews a very fortunate man it is true that he has lost the legacy but he has gained a lesson which he will probably never forget and when j seo him now so quietly pursuing his business and his wife with a contented or rather a happy look must class him among the most happy men of roy ac quaintance indian jugglers one of the mentaking a large earthen vessel with a capacious mouth filled it with water and turned it upside downwhen aft the wafof flowed out but the moment it was placed with the mouth upwards it became full he then emptied it allowing any one to inspect it who chose this being done he desired that one of the party would fill it his request whs obeyed still when he reversed the jarnot a drop of water flowedand upon turning it to our astonishment it was empty i examined the jar carefully when empty but detected nothing which could lead to a discovery ofthe mystery i was allowed to retain and fill it myself still upon taking it up all was void withinyet the ground around it was perfectly dry so that how the water had disappeared and whgre it had been conveyed were problems which none of us was able to expound the vessel employed by the jugglers on this occasion was the common earthenware of the country very roughly made and in order to convince us that it bad not been especially constructed for the purpose of aiding his clever deceptions he permitted it to be broken in our presence the fragments were then handed round inspection of his highness nd the party present with him the next thing that engaged our attention was a feat of dexterity altogether astonishing a woman the upperpart of whose body was entirely uncovered presented herself to our notice and taking a bamboo twenty feet high placed it upright on a flat stone and then without any support climbed to the top of it with surprising activity having done this she stood upon one on the point of the bamboo balancing it all the while hound her waist she had a girdle to which was fixed so iron socket springing from her upright position on ths bamboo she threw herself horizontally forward with such exact precision that the top ofthe ple entered the socket of
