from parkers letter on slavery slavery considered as a wrong i am now o speak of slavery considered as a wrong or offence against the natural and eternal laws of god you all know it is wrong a crime against humanity a sin before almighty god the great men who call slavery right and justdo they not know better the little and humble men who jisten to their speechdo not we all know better yes we all know that slavery is a sin before god is the union of many sins on this theme i will gay but a word the roman code declares liberty the oalural estate of man but culls slavery an institution of positive law by which one man is made subject to another contrary to nature liy the hebrew law it was a capital offence lo steal a man and sell him or hold him ns a slave now if that doctrine he true which the american people once solemnly declared selfevidentthat all men arc created with equal rights then every slave in the united states is stolen then slavery is a continual and aggravated theft it matters not that the slaves mother was stolen before to take tile child of a slave must be theft a much as to take the child of a freeman it is stealing mankind he that murders a child has no defence in the fact that he first murdered the sire when wc hear that the emperor of russia or austria for some political opinion shuts a man in the spielberg or sends him to siberia for lifewe pity the victim of such despotic power thinking his natural rights debarred hut the defence is that the man had shown himself dangerous to the welfare of the state and so had justly forfeited his rights when we reduce a man toa slave making him a thing we can plead no extenuation of the offence the slave is only guilty of a skin not colored like our ownguilty of the misfortune to be weak and unprotected for this he is deprived of his liberty he and his children slavery is against nature it has no foundation in the permanent nature of man in the nature of things none in the eternal laws of god as reason and conscience declare that law its foundation is the selfishness the tyranny of strong inen v c all know it is sothe little and the great letter say it at once and with mr rutledge declare that religion and humanity have nothing to do with the matter than make the miserable pretence that it is consistent with reason and accordant with christianity even the boys know better in the last century your fathers cried out to god against the oppressions laid on them by england justly cried out yet these oppressions wer but little thingsa tax on sugar parchment paper tea nothing but a tat allowing no voice in the granting theroof or its spending they went to war for an abstraction the great doctrine of human rights they declared themselves free free by right of birth free because born men and children of god for the justice of their cause they made solemn appeal to god most high what was the oppression the fathers suffered to this their sons commit itis no longer a question about taxes and representatives a duty on sugar parch merit paper tea but the liberty the persons the lives of three millions of men are in question you have taken their liberty their persons and render their lives bitter by oppression was it luihw√ü tttmha srl the north star ajlxai ii ull m illlr r i right in your fatherf to draw the swore and slay the oppressor who taxed their for his own purpose taking bat theii money nor much of that wereyoui  fathers noble men for their resistance ij when they fell in battle did they fall ir j the sacred cause of god and theii country do you build monument to their memory and write thereon sacred to liberty and the rights ol mankind do you speak of lexington and bunker hill as spots most deai in the soil of the new world the zion of freedom the thcrmopyla of oni i versa right do you honor the name of washington far beyond all political names of conqueror or king how then can you justify your oppression how refuse to admit that the bondmen of the united states have the same i right and a far stronger inducement to draw the sword and smite at your very life surely you cannot do so not in america never till lexington and bunker hill arc wiped out of the earth never till the history of your own revolution is forgot never till the names of the adamses of jefferson of washington is expunged from the memory of men when the rude african who rules over dahomey or the gaboon country burns a village and plunders the shrieking children of his fellow barbarians to sell them away into bondage forever far from their humble but happy homes and their luxuriant soil their breadfruit and their palms far from father and mother from child and lover from all the human heart clings to with tenderest longingyou arc filled with horror at the deed what steal aman say yon great god you ask is the gaboon chieftain a manor but a taller beast with mind more cunning and far reaching claws that chieftain is a barbarian he knows not your letters your laws the tenets of your religion the nobler nature ol the man sleeps in his savage breast his only plea ishis degradation his defence before the world and before god is this he is a savage he knows no law but force no right but only might alone for that plea and de fence the civilized man must excuse him perhaps god hold him guiltless but when a civilized nation comes with all the art and science which mankind has learned in the whole lifetime ol the race and steals the children of the defenceless stimulating the savage to plunder hs brothers and make them slaves the offence has no such excuse it is a conscious crime a wrong before the judgment of the nations a sin before godin your case it is worse still the autocrat of all the russias may have no theory of mails unalienable rights adverse to the slavery he aims to abolish on his broad estates and widespread realm the bey of tunis deals not in abstractions in universal laws knows nothing of unalienable rights and the inborn equality of man liut you the people of the united states you ana lion of free men who owe allegiance to none you a republic one of the fore imst nations of the earth you with your theories of human universal justice you who earliest made national proclamation to mankind of human right and those three political ideas w hereon the great american cominou i wealth now stands and

right you who would found a state not on cannon ballsbut universal laws thoughts of god what pica can you put totth in your defence you call yourselves christians it is your boast christianity say the courts is the common law of the land you have a religion which tells that god is the father equal just and loving to all mankindthe red man whom you murdered and the blackman whom you have laid in iron hurting his feet with fetters it tells you all are brothers african american red man and black and white it tells you as your highest duty to love god with all your heart to love his justice love his mercy love his love to love that brother as yourselfthe more he needs to love him still the more that without such love for men there is no love for god the sacred books of the nationread in all pulpits sworn over in all courts of justice borne even in your warships and sheltered by the battleflag of your armies the sacred books of the nation tell that jesus the highest dearest revelation of god to men who loved them all that he laid down his life for them for all and bade you follow him what is a natural action in the savage a mere mistake in the despot of turkey or russia with you becomes a con j scious and fearful wrong for you ito hold your brothers in bondage to keep them from all chance of culture growth in mind or heart or soul for you to breed them as swine and beatas oxen to treat them as mere things without soul or rightswhv what a mistake in political economy a wrong before your ideas of government becomes a sin foul and heinous before vour ideas of man and christ and rod  when you remember the intelligence of this age its accumulated stores of knowledge science art aud wealth ol j matter and of mind its know lodge ol justice and eternal right when you consider that in political ideas you stand the first people in the vanguard of mankind now moving towards new and peaceful conquests for the human race when you redact on the great doctiinea of

by millions multiplied am spread throughout the peopled work in every barbarous and stammerinj tongue and then remember that ski very is here that three million men an now by christian republican americi held in bondage worse than egyptian hopeless as hellyou must take this matter to heart and confess that american slavery is the greatest foolest wrong which man ever did to man tb most hideous and detested sin a natiot has ever committed before jmt ah bounteous god a wrong and a su wholly without excuse they are a stupid race made to be slates two slaves in louisiana were lei out by their master at a considerable distance from his own residence thej were skilful intelligent mechanics and of course h e obtained high wages foi their work what time remained aftei their daily allotted tasks were finished they were allowed to have for themselves and these precious hours they employed most industriously with the view of purchasing their freedom when they had accumulated by patienl toil a sum which they deemed sufficient they endeavored to negotiate with their master hut without success again they went to work and after twe or three years were enabled to offer a sum so large that they felt almost certain it would tempt him to accede tc their wishes but he found them toe j profitable to be lightly parted with moreover whatever they had of property was in reality his he might with perfect impunity have taken all their hardearned wages and kepi them in slavery still as thousands ol slaveholders had done before him but whether he doubted their having sc much money as they pretended oi whether he was too honorable to steal more than ninetynine hundredths ol their earnings i know not at al events he would not listen to their proposition on any terms finding they could not purchase liberty they wisely resolved to take it the enterprise was a perilous one foi  tlirough a long line of slave states they must run the gauntlet of patrols bloodhounds lynchers jail keepers and rifle and if they reached the states called j free they must dodge constables and kidnappersbacked by the glorious con stitution they were sufficiently intelligent an wellinformed to understand the dangers they would incur and to devise a most cunning method of avoiding them they made themselves acquainted w ith a white beggar and made him offers large enough to secure his secrecy they dressed him in a handsome suit of clothes and through his agency purchased a carriage and a fine span of horses they brought the carriage to an appointed place stood hat in hand while lie entered and then mouuted outside as footman and groom ol course no patrol thought of challenging i such au equipage and a white geutlc inan travelling through the couutry attended by his servants was welcomed at all the inns the obsequiousness oi their manners was an admonition to their brethren in bonds yes massa and certainly massa were accompanied with the most profound bows and spoken in the humblest tones the trio arrived in buffalo unmolested there the carnage and horses were sold and the white beggar paid handsomely for consenting to play the gen tleman the slaves passed over to victorias i dominions whence they wrote a very friendly letter to their whilom master begging that he would feel no uncasi ness on their account as they were most comfortably situated l m ca s standard french revolutionslavert at home mr palfrey of massachusetts moved i the reconsideration of the vote of yes i terday upon the french congratulatory i resolutions his motive was a speech of course upon this revolution and upon kindred topics at home he avowed the doctrine that despotisms might exist in the form or name of free institutions he meant slavery but meant by this speech to say something in reply to the member from virginia tmr bayly mr palfrey reminded that gentleman that though massai chusetts was by no means a perfect commonwealth she was not too old to learn as he feared virginia was mr bayly wished to know whether massachusetts allowed colored men to sit in the jury box mr palfrey said he did not know but there was nothing prohibiting it the selectmen of massachueets could put such names among those selected l if they wished but the time had been he believed when a colored mao was elected to the legislature of masse chusetts mr bayly did he take his seat mr palfrey believed nut perhaps the man was modest aad did eot like to take bis seat in a body where all were of a different color wuald the gen llemaa like to have his seat in an assembly composed entirely of black men jlrotnense laughter mr palfrey went on to show what massachusetts had done in this matter t and defended her liberal measures fo wards the colored population of the state many ef tbeee were worthy men and many of them were wealthy bochesteb n y friday april and intelligent mm among these hi had the pleasure of affixing the seal of i massachusetts as secretary of stater to one of the colored men claiming toi be admitted to the bar he assured i the gentleman from virginia if hei shoe id come before this magistrate that be would be treated with a mark of caorteay and kindness he had amu attending a high school which wast open alike for free macks and whites and if his son would treat any one noti his own color with less respect than others he should foel leas affection for him than he now entertained mr johnson of tennessee wished i to know if be mr palfrey would allow one of these blat boys to be i wedded to bis daughter mr palfrey said be should intro dace no one to bis family who was aot agreeable to them aad the defence ela principle of liberty did not suppose that be should be required to change the social relations of his own family the gentleman might ask much more important and difficult questions than this mr palfrey spoke further in defence of the meliorationg laws of massa chusetts mr bayly rose to reply he did not mean to say anything unkind to the gentleman whom for his courtesy of manner and great propriety of conduct he esteemed but whose sentiments were most abhorrent mr bayly commented with some severity upon the massachusetts law which did not allow her state officers to provide for the rescue of fugitive slaves there was quite a running debate upon this topic from which it appeared pennsylvania had done precisely the same thing as massachusetts there was much comment upon the celebrated law of and constitutional power in regard to fugitives from labor mr bayly argued these questions just half way leaving out all matter material to the other side he forgot to say what none was pleased to state that chief justice taney had given it j as his opinion that the state legislatures had power to pass a restraining law prohibiting her officers from executing the law of in regard to fugitives from labor pensylvania and j massachusetts have done this and no more bayly was at a loss for facts j in sustaining the laws of massachusetts pennsylvania and new york upon the question of legislation touching runaway slaves mr ashmun spoke of the overbearing and insolent manner of the gentleman from virginia of his arrogance and superciliousness of temper he should not reply in any such spirit but would administer a rebuke to the geu j demon for the manner in which he had i addressed the house and mr ash mun in good taste good temper and j even great good humor did administer this rebuke i have heard nothing better in the house for a long long time mr giddings was allowed to explain the law of and to define and defend it at some length j mr ashinuu reminded the southern i members haw massachusetts inen had been treated in carolina louisiana and elsewhere they were itnpris j oned punished maltreated and their owners compelled to pay the cost of this illegal punishment they would not even allow the validity of the constitution to be tried upon this point of debate mr bayly of va was permitted to rejoin in a few words and the debate i was now upon personal topics though i comparatively calm mr bayly ami used the house by his arrogant man neralways arrogant though he appealed to the house to say whether it was so or not as if members one by one were to rise and tell him he was arrogant and supercilious and haughty as he really isin regard to the colored citizens of massachusetts imprisoned at the south the act was defended out and out the fight ran from massachusetts into virginia the virginia delegates were all appealed to by mr bayty to endorse him and their silence was tobe construed into an approval whether they had heard him or not mr pendleton of virginia was not willing thus to endorse in the dark j and said not having heard he could not approve or disapprove mr bayly in much temper then there was no occasion for you to rise mr pendletonand there was no occasion for your appeal mr bayly said now he cared not what his colleague thooght and mr pendleton retorted with s mw just rei kuke of the uniform bad temper of his i colleague whose manner now he cer i tainly did not endorse however much he might concur with him on the subject of slavery there was no abolition party in virginia the question was now taken at alate hour and the motion to reconsider laid upon the table by yeas and nays to csrr v v exprtt washington april ll rkpi three very excellent things ami of great utility are reading i conversation and reflection by reading we treat with the dead by eon i vernation with the bring and by reflee tion with ourselves reading enriches the memory conversation polishes the mind

two since without tending contemplation is fruitless td conversation dull and insipid buck law or illwoul the people of ifthnon have adopted by a large majority the clause of the new constitution which was separately submitted to them authorizing the legislature to adopt measure to prerent the immigration of negroes to that state any provision of that character which the legislature may frame win he ia flagrant violation of the common constitution and void it will be so declared by the proper tribunals of illinois and no actual mischief will be done to those against whom this decree of chinese barbarism is directed the question was settled so far as the opinion ot congress could determine it upon the admission of missouri site presented a constitution containing a similar power of exclusion but was obliged to declare her assent tea funds mental condition that no such law should ever be passed before the act erecting her into a state took effect she hasviola ted it to be sure with the habitual shamelessness and bad faith which characterizes the legislation of the slave states but the principle has keen solemnly decided by the representatives of the people including those from the infected region citizenship does not depend upon color and the free black man has therefore pledged to him by the bond of our union an indefeasible right ot going to and settling in any part of our common country with no restrictions which are not imposed upon other citi zens the only thing to be lamented then is the ungenerous base and truckliug spirit which has been manifested by this impotent injustice it is base and truckling because it is dictated by sycophancy to their neighbors of missouri and by unwillingness to undertake the defence of their colored citizens against the bloodhounds two footed and four footed from the opposite side of the mississippi it is ungenerous because it is an assault upon the weak and powerless the stain upon the j character of illinois will remain indelible while the purpose for which her people have filed their mind will fail of accomplishment it is in the language of talleyrandworse than a crime it is a blunder think upon it a little and upon what reason can it be justified suppose the power was clear has the great com tn mwealth of illinois no land to spare in her borders does she abjure tjie proud claim of the other members of the confederacy to be the refuge of the oppressed of all lands is she fearful that her internal quiet will be jeapor dised by the advent of a few poor ignorant friendless negroes seeking only toe means of subsistence and debarred from all political power why they are few at the most and the sure progress of mortality exhausts them in a northern clime with greater rapidity than the whites the truth is that the tyranous and the slavish spirit are made of the same elements cowardice is the fundamental basis of both those who arc most jealous of their own rights and most ready to defend them to the last extremityrespect most the rights of others those who live in abject fear of the strong compensate for their self abasement by oppressing the weak that the naked prejudice of color may have had sxnething to do with the action of the illinois majority is very probable that its being one of the strongholds of what styles itselfdcmoc racy may serve yet better to account for it is beyond question nobody is more averse to any measure of genuine equality that regards man as man and looks to that elevation of masses which is the eternal cry of the party than your thoroughbred democrat

instrument of his downfall no sooner had loots become fairly warm in his seat than he attempted to make the press of paris wholly subservient to his dictation this he found an impossible task to accomplish persuasion had no effect threatening did not silence the utterings of thought as a last resort prosecutions were brought to bear but that did not stifle the cry of reform it only resulted in tbc dethronement and exile of the i monarch and the liberty of the french nation t the number of prosecutions against i the press during the reign of louis j philippe almost exceeds belief they amount according to the national newspaper to add to this there have been fifty seven newspapers suppressed by order of government upwards of a million and a quarter of dollars have been drawn from

is the only animal that drowns naturally he does so because he is endowed with reasonthat is to say with a large spherical brain with a skull on it which rises above his nose if he falls into deep water in spite of his great brain he has not presence of mind enough to stick his nos out and keep it out as he might easily do but lets his heavy head like a stone press his nose under water in this position he inhales and tilts his chest with water so that he becomes on the whole so much heavier than water an to sink while the lungs arc filled with air the body is lighter than its bulk of water and and of course sniriis just as an iron vessel does all therefore which is necessary to keep a person from drowning in deep water is to keep the water out of the lungs do you ask how this is to he

kcinond was in this place some two weeks since lecturing at slavery and getting subscribers to the nortl star an abolition piper published at roches ler of which douglass is editor in the lasi number of this paper we discover a somewhai flattering notice of our village and its inhabitants among other things it is alleged thai we have just completed an elegant unior school housethat the blacks have been taxet equally with the whites for its construction al of which is true and that recently a petitior to exclude the ch idren of the blacks from al participation in the benefits of the school has been circulated and numerously signed by the white inhabitants which is not true nr such petition lias been circulated or signed by any one it is however the intention of the trustees to exclude from the union school though not from the advantages of a good and what is more a free school the childrer of the blacksand these facts were wellknown to mr douglass the state has wisely made some provision for the education of the blacks in places like our own w here they arc somewhat numerous by appropriating a year for ihe support of a school for their exclusive benefit during six months of the year while our village trustees have i employed a competent teacher at some j per mouth and the amount beyond the sura appropriated bv the state is paidout of the village treasury so that in fact the blacks oj this village are schooled at the public ex pense had mr douglass stated the whole truth l instead of designedly s uppressing a material portion of it there would have been less i occasion for lus crocodile tears and his fierce denunciations against the inhabitants ol bath we do not justify the principle of excluding colored children from the uuion school upon any other ground than mere expediency we have lived king enough to take the world as il i is and things as they exist and we are fully satisfied that the admission of negro children into the union school with the whites would prove fatal to its prosperity and the result ol the experiment of a union school would be a complete failifre die course contemplated i will undoubtedly be better for all concerned no pecuniary injustice has been done or is premeditated towards the blacks for tini whites pay much more towards the schooling of their children in a separate school than they pay for the building of our school house the denunciation in the same article of one of our respectable clergymen as a sell righteous ruffian is an exhibition of taste on the part of mr doughs which shows the want of an early education i it was doubtless necessary for the editoi to qualify the gentleman with the word colored it would have been quite out ol character to have said this gentleman the statement pronounced untrue was made to us frequently while in bath and by persons j of the first respectability on their authority i we made it at several meetings in the dace and solicited a denial if any could be made none was made and we therefore believed it true and our editor will pardon us if we micro that still his assertion of its untruth nevertheless the expression that no pecuniary injustice will be done to the colored citizens of bath will be duly appreciated both by our readers and the colored people j themselves the promise from such a quarter is not to b relied on the men that ean take our money to build schoolhouses under the pretence that th schoolhouse is for the common good of all and then exclude os are not the persons in whose promises wei con confide no pecuniary injustice the community that can degrade our children stamp them with inferiority and unfitness to he j taught in the same schools with white efaild rsn ha done more positive injury than any i pecuniary injustice

but a large slaveholder and landholder to reach their local legislatures this is a well known and undeniable fact and what is the result upn our s senate tbcso legislatures appoint these senators and hence we have onehalf or more of that august dignified body made up of actual slave holdersin fact none but a slaveholder hasa sat in that body the united states constitution first makes a league w

from ohio one iivtino a horrible inatancc it was when this process of universal emancipatioi was done at a blow with a single das of the pen it was tle wellknown ca of st nominee then its thing ha been effected by the busy interfiled dling of visionary fanatics just as i was now sought to be done by the gen tlemon from ohio and his associates there was then a band of fanatics ii london who met in the old jewry and who passed resolations very simila to the amendment it was now sought t foist on the pending resolution it was then proposed to aid thew i negroes with men and money in i jstruggle for their freedom and simila resolutions were at the same timi adopted mv france by an associu tron similar to that to which the gentleman and his abolition friends bejnngct among us these fanatical visionanci set the revolt of the blacks in st do juiingo in motion their machination succeeded in exciting a servile insurrection in the course of which ever white man and woman and child in th island were massacred with the exception of a small remnant who fled to um shipping in the harbor and barely escaped with their lives whole hecatombs of dead bodies were piled up ir the streets amid burning murder anc pillage nay so great was the fury ol the blacks that their rage and revenge could not glut themselves with the butchery of every white person an they found no diihculty in drauing that line of distinction which the gentlcmar thought so great a mystery it was no problem to the negrees but they thee turned upon lie muluttocs and exterminated them they seemed to hate every human creature that had white blood in his veins with a bitterness that had i no parallel unless in the breast of the member from ohio mr bayleyjust before making these statements remarked that the house knew very well that he was not in the i habit of speaking of what he had not looked into or of making assertions without knowing on what they were founded we shall soon demonstrate to the satisfaction of every reader we enre not what his prepossessions that in regard to st domingo mr bayly has made assertions which he cannot prove and spoken on a subject without j knowing anything about it if we may judge by the extract above quoted his loose declamation we presume was stimulated by an editorial ih the national intelligencer which appeared on the morning of the day when the speech was made betraying a similar misunderstanding of the subject referred tola amis des jvotr says the intelligencer having in the old revolution just as they have done now procured the passage of a decree to the same effect as that to which wc have referred the government of their principle colony st domingo knowing that the decree was one of desolation and death to them and theirs made by persons who either knew not or were reckless what they were doinghesitated to carry into effect impatient of the delay les jvbtrr took the execution of it in their own hands the assertion is here made that a decree for the immediate abolition of j slavery in the french colonies was procured by la amis des jvoirs andi that from this sprung the horrors of st domingo it is utterly groundless as we shall presently show one word in regard to the amis des jjvbii fanatical visionaries an j association similar to that which the gentleman from ohio and his abolition i friends belong among us says mr bayly the leader of this abolition association of these fanatical visionaries whose machinations succeeded in exciting a servile insurrection was lafayette the friend and ally of america whose fulllength portrait in the hall of the house was looking down on the man who ventured to stigmatize him as a fanatic lafayette condorcet brissot and the abbe gregoire were tho controlling spirits of la amis des jvoirs this is a matter of history into which we presume i the gentleman from virginia had never looked preliminary we now ask the attention of our readers especially the southern portion of them w hile wc present a record well authenticated facts in relation to the horrors ot st domingo wei have carelully examined standard authorities upon the subject and if mr bayly or the intelligencer choose to question our statements there is not a member of congress who may not verify them by consulting the several volumes treating of st domingo in the library of congress it is a shame j that the american people should permit i their minds to be abused by the inconsiderate reckless assertions of men either too prejudiced or too carries to examine before they presume to assert the population of st domingo in was estimated as follows in the french sections h cb i free colored slve total  spiitlt suhon free people of ail colors slaves total grand total never was there a more heterogeneous and inflammable population tt white were divided into three classes the creole planters or large proprietors constituting the native aristocracy the european residents couijxjsing the

compelled to do aoy kind of public seri vice without compensation degraded and insulted in every possible way t short of absolute enslavement the sfevea or negroes were idost brutally treated in the french part rtf the island this is the testimony of all who have written upon the subject r masses of them consisted of africans recently imported who still retained the heathenish superstitions and usages of their mother country t it is obvious that whatever temporary prosperity in a pecuniary sense such a colony might enjoy it was doomed to ruinous convulsions the state of so j ciety was unnatural abhorrent repug i nant to every principle of humanity i morals and we may add political ee nomy any violent change in the i mother country would he certain to j array in fierce conflict elements so fearfully discordant we shall prove ist that emancipation was not in any sense the cause of the troubles and insurrections in st domingo dly that the history of that doomed colony furnishes conclusive evidence in prool of the entire safety of immediate emancipation os it is called the beginning of troubles the beginning of troubles may be dated in the year december thof that year the statcsgcneral ol france passed a resolution to admit toi that body a number of the tiers eof equal to that of the other two orders when the news reached st domingo the white colonists iininedi ately resolved to assert their right tobe represented and commissioned j delegates six of whom after much discussion by the statesgcneral were recognized about this time the society of ies amis dt votes was organized next arose in paris a secret association of the planters called the massaic club with branches in the colonies instituted ostensibly to port the revolution but really to sustain this movement so far as it might strengthen them against the colonial authorities who were supposed to favor the rights of the free people of color every blow struck for liberty in france electrifies the colonies when the fall of the bastilc was announced in st domingo the colonists became wrought up with intense excitement liberty and fraternity sounded from the lips of all classes all were seized with the fever of imitation and whatever france did was regarded asa pattern for her dependencies just at this time a rumor was started of a servile insurrection and a large force was marched to the locality designated as its scat but everything there was tranquil the rumor was groundless still the preparations made against this imaginary horror it is thought suggested to the slave possibilities never dreamed of before the real struggle meantime in the general discussion of the subject of human rights the inulattoes or free people of color began to take a deep interest many of their number were at paris receiving an education and their correspondence with relatives at home stimulated them to the demand of rights which the french revolutionists could with no consistency deny october d the wealthy mulattoes despatched a deputation to paris to urge their claims to representation in the colonial assembly they presented livres to the government and pledged onefifth of their property to aid in the liquidation ol the national debt the deputation received great encouragement lafayette and his associates deeply sympathized with them the president ol the national assembly said that no pari of the nation ever reclaimed in vain its rights from the assembly of the representatives of the french people m charles de la met h declared that although he was one of the largest proprietors in the colony he was in favoi of the admission of the mixed races tc a share in the legislative power encouraged by these indteations the free people of color in the colony begar to press their claims on the attention othe authorities but they were at onc met by the most unrelenting oppositior from all classes of the whites lacombe a mulatto was hung at cap francois for having merely signed s petition on the subject m ferrand dt eaudiere a magistrate at petit goave a venerable old man who had drawn u a petition of a similar kind for the uiu lauoes was dragged from his home am

the assembly of th colony convened consisting of som members who were implacabh against the inulattoes and disposed t assume tor themselves independent legislative powers lafayette and his friends were meanwhile urging the claims of the fre people of color and had the aatisfac tion of procuring the passage of decree by the national assembly datei march bth that every persoi of tpentyflve years

disturbed state of the colonies and of apprehended violence in martinique having been received by tha home government the national assembly passed a decree explaining away that ol march bth so far as it conferred political rights on the free people of color and in effect licensing the slave trade an act of tergiversation which aroused the indignation of lafayette and lei amis dts jvoirs bitter feuds continued to prevail k the colony until the principal provinces were arrayed against each other and open war broke out between the governor general and the colonial assembly in tha struggle the free people of color were invoked by the former and he made such head againsl the assembly that the whole body driven to desperation resolved to embark for france and lay its grievances before the national assembly meanwhile the mulattoes continued to be subjects of the grossest outrages and insults and began to lose their pa tience vincent or james ogc an educated mulatto in paris who had for a longi time been laboring for the reclamation of the rights of his class disgusted at the explanatory decree of the national assembly out of heart irritated and desperate abandoned paris and oni the d october landed at cape francois where without much deliberation he put himself at the head of two hundred of his friends resolbedto compel concessions he demanded of the governor general that the decree ol march bth be carried into effect expressly excluding from his demand the negroes or slaves with them lie would have nothing to do no rights but those of the mulatto were in question the response to this demand was a force of six hundred men sent out tc punish him these were routed another force twelve hundred strong with artillery was more successful oges band was scattered he and his fellowchief baptiste chavannc took refuge in the spanish part of the island whence they were reclaimed they were tried secretly the whole mulatto population was deeply excited at last after two months confinement they were sentenced led bareheaded ci chemise into the public square with ropes round their necks and then placed upon the wheel where with faces upturned to heaven and their thighs legs and arms broken they died a horrible lingering death this took place on the th of march it was never forgotten it filled the hearts of the free colored population with undying hate similar efforts were made by them in the southern and western provinces but they were peacefully put down by the governor general and his adviser colonel mauduit but for this they received no credit the planters suspected them of having made secret promises to the mulattoes to be fulfilled ata more convenient season september ltith the assembly of st marks arrived at brest and soon made known their complaints but the decision of the national assembly was against them it passed a decree extinguishing all the legislative powers of the colonial assembly prohibiting its members from being elected thereafter sustaining the governor general and the king was besought to issue commands for a new election conformably to both the decrees of the bth and the th of marchdecrees by the way clearly contradictory the consequences of this unwise vacillating inconsistent legislation by the national assembly were most ruinous this decree was dated october th  nothing could exceed the consternation of the great planters they looked wiih dismay upon the elevation of the peis blancs and both were fired with deadly animosity against the mulattoes the authorities were overwhelmed col mauduit was horribly murdered blanchelande the governor general was compelled to fly from portau prince and the colonists there usurped independent powers cape francois actuated by rivalry with portauprince received the governor general with open arms but everywhere else the wildest anarchy prevailed amid all the varying animosities of party warfare says brown in his history of st domingo on one subject the unanimity was perfect tha whs the doggedness of creole prejudice when the question was hrought up to establish the political rights of the mulattoes up to this moment despite ad the me as a res of

alston accompanied by a distinguished transcendental friend drove in from cambridge to attend a party in j boston upon arriving at the door he calmly said to the utter surprise of his companion i shall not go in but why not i have discovered a small hole in my stocking but is it so situated as to be very visible on the contrary said alston itis directly on the hall of my foot of course then said his companion it can never be observed shall know it said the poet in a decisive tone and ordered the coachman to drive back to his residence in the country the old and new world i observed that a considerable number of passengers carried a comfortable picnic box or basket with them and spread their own table with some doubtless this provision proceeded from a fastidious taste that feared some poisonous dirt would be found in the common fare of a steamboat but with many i presume it arose from a habit which presents a marked dillcreuce between the people of england and of americal mean the habit of economising in america we are ashamed of economy it is this feeling which would forbid among us such a practice as that referred to and not only tlusj but a great many more and better practices in england economy stands out prominently it presides over the arrangements of a family itis openly professed arid fears no reproach a man is not ashamed to say of a certain indulgence that he cannot afford it a gentleman says to you drive a pony chaise this year i hnvt put dow n my horse and gig because cannot pay the tax a man whose income and expense and style of living j far exceed almost anything to be fount among us still says of something quite beyond him which his wealthier neighbor does we are not rich enough lot that one of tbe most distinguished men in england said to me when speaking of wines at his table the wine i prefer is claret but i cannot afford it and so i drink my own gooseberry i have hcaul that many families carry the principle so far that they determine exactly how many dinners they can give in a year and to how many guests nay more and how many dishes they can put upon the table when they do entertain this frankness on the subject of economy is among us a thing unheard of nut that we are more wealthy but as i conceive less wise r i he competition of domestic life am ng us is ton kern to admit of any such confession of internal weakness we practise economy by stealth nor is that the worst of it tin one consequence of this habit of feeling is that we practice too little when a stranger looks upon the strife of business in our villages and cities lie imagines that he sees a very covetous people but a nearer observation would i show him that much of this eager and absorbing and almost slavish occupation is necessary to sustain the heavy drains of domestic expenditure this extravagance at home chains imny a man to the counter and countingroom i and this extravagance is of his own choosing because he knows no other i way of distinguishing himself but by the style of living would he but conceive that he might better elevate himself in society by having a wellread library by improving his mind and conversation by cultivating some graceful but comparatively cheap accomplishment he might live a wiser inan and die richer who would hesitate to choose between such a family and one whose house was tilled with gorgeous furniture where the wife and daughter are dressed in the gayest of the fashion and the husband and father banishes himself tbe livelong day and half the night from that pleasant mansion to

was to pay her masters debts who was then in embarrassed circumstances tbe poor creature seemed in the wildest grief her hysterical screams and sobs were most heartrending in fact so exciting was the scene that it seemed to affect even the calloushearted slave holders around who were accustomed to such exhibitions the young man her husband was not to be sold the party who wished to buy his wife was a trader from the for south and in all probability she would be separated troin him for ever many hundreds of miles a person in the town with more humanity than the rest wishing e prevent this separation bought her in much to the satisfaction of the bystanders tims by a mere accident was the nearest and dearest tie of lift prevented being sundered no thanks however to the mini man system

indescribable he attempted to speak but was saluted by cries of off off and a shower of hisses rilcnce was at length restored and cooke addressed the audience in these words ladies and gentlemen if

w ho took only three days to write a threeact comedy in erse is credited by marvelloving chroniclers witn having accomplished i twentyone million three hundred thousand lines ot printed verse in his

he has a regular manufactory where numbers of young men woik he only putting his name to their productions here is however one very strong objection to the cun out thcorv that ihi mas sells under his own name the works of others and in justice to the literary curiosity of the case wo must adduce it it is this if a number oi men were employed writing novels which dumas had only to retouch or if he only gave them a plot which they had to woik out dumas would never heat a loss tor copy t satisfy the demands of those journals to whirh heis engaged but in the trial beforementioned it came out that not only had the journals great difficulty in getting from him the promised copy but that having printed one or more volumes they were much to their disadvantage compelled to publish volumes by other writers because dumas had not furnished them with the continuation thus considerable periods were allowed to elapse between tho delivery ol one volume ami its successor when we know that dumas is in the habit of publishing several works simultaneously and to this moment has no less than six unfinished and in course of piecemeal publication we can understand the delay he has not six hands to write six novels at once so he must finish volume three of this novel volume three of that volumesix ol another volume ten of another and volume one of anotherin this way he has volume by volume to satisfy tho claims upon him and on the suopo sinun that he in conjunction with auguste maquct and perhaps also his son really does write the works published under his name the delay becomes intelligible on the supposition of a manufactory the delay is inexplicable x n t a n opposition to the idea of a manufactory that aft the woriu sold by dumas arc bound to he handwriting otherwise the publishers would be easy dupes now it is absurd to suppose umus undertakes the task of copying rhe words of his young workmen absurd because every one knows that a man who writes with ordinary celerity will compose much quicker than he can copy anythingand it is the question of time which in dumass case form the diffi tultr on the whole we belter hit witt s i i jnctio with auguste maquet invents and dictate the

feelings the springs of his thoughtyou may yoke him to your labor as swan ox which liveth only to work and worketh only to live you may put him under any processs which without destroyingg his value as a slave will debase and crush him as a rational being you may do this and the idea that he was born to be free will survive it all it is allied to his hope of immortality it is ethereal part of his natures which oppression cannot reach it is a torch lit upon his soul by the hand of deity and never meant to be extinguished by the hand of man gov mc dowell
