tliedeclara ration of independence itself in its application to the vast and fertile region would have been deprived of its power to confer blessifigs and prosperity upon it and it is a fart never to be forgotten that the original declaration and the original ordinance were both drawn upby the same great champion of human rights whose hatred of slavery grew strong and deep by ins persona knowledge olits wrongs and itscalami cs w ithout the ordinance the revolution itself in its application to that territory and the treaty of by which its ample domain was secured to thel nion would have been shorn of their glory and robbed of their value without the ordinance the discovery of this western continentso far as that territory constitutes a part of it would have given us no occasion to

states ol this union many thousands of men recognized by the laws of those states as citizens entitled before the law to enforce all i lie rights and privileges of citizenship in their respective slates who by mr clayton are denied the protection of the american flag the moment they put their feet upon foreign soil our shipwrecked seamen discharged servants outraged or insulted citizens who find themselves destitute in foreign lands if they arc persons of color are to be thrust from he doors of our foreign ministers and onsus and to be denied the aid sympathy and protection which our

such citizens by the constitution of the united states these citizens are entitled to all the privi eges immunities and rights of itizens in the several states one f the paramount rights of every citizen of every state is the protection of he american government not only in tus own but in every foreign land this protection the secretary of state virtually denies to a larger number of the citizens of the state of new york alone than are contained all told in the little state where he has played the triton for so many years and where he earned for himself the privilege of occupying a wider sphere in which to display a serpents cunning and more than a serpents inhumanity mr clayton has just as good a right to refuse a passport to any white citizen of new york as to any colored citizen he has no more authority to deny the protection of the american government to a man with a dark skin than to a man with red hair or with a pug nose or crippled or distinguished in any other way by some physical peculiarity if the people of the state of new york are content to admit any or all these descriptions of men to the privileges and immunities of citizens it is not for the secretary of state to jay that the protecting arm of the na ional government shall not extend over hem when they visit foreign shores that mr clayton is fully aware of he outrage he is perpetrating upon hc rights of the states where colored persons are recoguized as citizens is ipparent from the discrimination he makes in favor of these who are in lie service of diplomatic agents going ibroad if

which he was born and it insults very state whose citizens he has vir ually disfranchised we presume that the secretary of state will attempt to justify his course ty appealing to the usage of the department over which he presides what that usage may have been we arc not advised as the state department has been in the hands of slaveholders almost uninterruptedly since the foundation of the government it is very possible that mr clayton may find a precedent for his course which his instincts and associations would make him but too happy to observe if any such precedents exist in our

report but it is somehow misplaced in the paper of the city but lit has been though prudent since to omit this publication it was in this abouinuble house that the brave nicholas was confined it was amid such seems that he lived no wonder that his manhood was aroused and to this add the fact that a female relative a dear sister was also there incarcerated soon to be sold in fact the slave trader named gilchrist had already bought her and had come to this very house to remove his property this so aroused nicholas that he swore vengeance he declared that his separation should not take place but by death hismannerso terrified gilchrist that he immediately called the master of the work house j c norris who threatened nicholas but seeing that he was determined and not to be intimidated sent an express to the mayor of the city with notice of this insurrection in a little time the vhole city was alarmed the keeper of the jail which is adjacent to the work house whose name is james mccollin having heard the noise girded on his sword and with pistols in hand went to the aid of his valiant countryman gilchrist and norris hut the three pale faces with swords and pistols were afraid to approacn this roused man until his honor the mayor arrived with his posse when being outnumbered and hacked by the sword j nicholas was subdued with his few followers mcccftin slated at the trial that nicholas exclaimed at the top of his voice set us at liberty and we will show you what we are which expression alone lrom a slave is worthy of death ys the chivalry of the south after a night of agonyfor be it known that the city that night wa doublv guarded no slaveholder went to bed without a loaded pistol under his pillow and his chnmber door locked barred and bolted for conscience make cowards of them all to their great relief the morrow arrived and nicholas and his follow eis were brought to trial before a court of freeholders and magistratea mock trial i ire men who are freeholders and two magistrates doomed these men nicholas george and john to death after a trial of a few hours and in hve j days it was carried into execution the court was continuing its sittings upon the others implicated when i obtained the information from which i quote how many more will be murdered by hanging or the bloody lash a few days will evince thus it is that men are murdered under the cloak of law southern christianity with bishops priests deacons sanctioning such bloody pro ceedings  bibles for slaves dr plumer stated on the floor of the old school general assemble that in the d report of the american bilile society was a long list of contributions for sending the bible to slaves more than had been appropriated for that purpose the assembly aresaid to have taken action in favor of giving the rible to the slaves this is good to take also such action as would break down all the harriers which slavery sets up would be yet better and not any less christian the cause of truth demands a counterpart to the above showing how the business of distributing the bible toi the slaves is at least sometimes conducted it is the usual if not universal policy of the american bible society to leave the ultimate distribution ot bibles to the local auxiliaries j within whose limits the work is to be done consequently it may often happen that the oflicers of these auxiliaries are themselves slaveholders the case is thus presented by mr henry bibb in a a speech befoie the j am for a s society he said he called on dr brigham secretary of the american bible society to ascertain what steps had been taken if any to supply the slaves with the bible as he saw from month to month in the record published by the society acknowledgments of money for the slaves dr b un utrtook to show him what was doing for the circulation of the bible among the slaves he turned to the annual reports and showed a list of the auxiliaries he asked me said mr b what state i came from i said kentucky look here said he and see the auxiliaries we have in that state he came to bedford county the county i came from who are the officers here mr a i know him well he is a slaveholder who next mr gatewood that is my old master he an officer of your auxiliary marks of astonishment yes william gatewood was the man who in ft loaded me with chainstook me to the blacksmiths shop to have the chains rivetedhad niy feet tied under the horse had me handcuffedsaid me to a company of gamblers on speculation who too me to new orleans and sold me he it was who separated me from my wife and dear little child whom i shall never see again till meet them at the judgment day i great sensation my wife was sdd at a great price toa french profligate for vile purposes this gatewood said mr was a brother in the methodist church that is the man who is the secretary of one of the auxiliaries of the american bible society what were the slaves to expect from such a man as well i might they expect the fo to guard the geeese or the wolf to protect the lamb as to think that slaveholders would circulate the word of god among their slaves the slaves had prayed lor the bible but their prayers had been in vain the liberty and spiritual salvation of millions depended upon the sacred volume where were they togo if not to the freemen of the north o great spirit how long has crushed humanity to plead in vain when wilt thou break down the guilt of the nation ft estern christian the presidents fast to return j to the idea ol a special divine visitation for the sins of the landwhich the presidential proclamation obviously recognizesit is a fact worthy of note that no call to repentance is made by the president his proclamation differs from that of the king of nineveh who when the prophet jonah predicted its oterthrow proclaimed in addition to lasting humiliation and prayer that the people should turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands and itis written that god saw their woiks that they turned from their evil ways j and he repented of the evil that he said he would do unto them and be did it not not their prayers be it observed but their turning from sin averted the threatened calamity with that respect which is due to the supreme magistrate of our country wc cannot but feel that his proclamation u fatally deficient much more so coining from a christian ruler as compared with that which came ot old from a heathen king and was effectual again says the prophet isaiah to the jews ls not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bands of wiededness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ve break every yoke tbea shall they light break forth as the morning and ay htullh hall torrng joriu peeai ty is ivii what moral grandeur would have invested such a proclamation coming from the president of these slaveholding and slave oppressing united states the late procla mat ion seems based on tne vaia notiou entertained bv the je s that humiliation fasting and praver are alone sufficient to avert evil aud it is to be feared that over the vast south and west where the calamity has been most felt and where either iirectly cr indirectly oppression has been most exercised especially is it to be feared that throughout the great presbyterian church and the baptist and methodist church south the day will only he observed in the manner in w hich the jews observed it and the great moral evil of the land w ill be utterly ignored when in the course of events the scourge shall he staved as indeed itis already beginning to be stayed let not the churches take to themselves the assurance that god has heard their prayers one right use of the appointed day will be to show the immense inconsistency of prayer without turning from sin boston christum register white slavery ix georgia the muscogee ga democrat gives the following details of an incident which occurred in that neighborhood and which is only one of many going to show that slavery is by no means particular in the color of its victims on tuesday last a young white girl of the name of nancy fann who had for two years been an inmate of the house of james r jackson formerly of alabama hut latterly of shell creek in this county was on petition of her mother a mrs gilder from huwkinsville brought before his honor judge alexander on a writ of habeas corpus and after an investigation of the case delivered in charge of her maternal parent the circumstances of the affair are briefly these fanns wife had obtained several years since a divorce from him for some cause and subsequently married a man by the name of gilder who has since deceased the girl nancy was taken off by her father fann and brought to girard alabama whence he removed to wvnnton where about two years ago she was sold by him for a blind horse and jersey wagon to james r jackson as a slave by some means the mother heard of the situation of her daughter now years of age and came on here three months ago with a view to release her from bondage to jackson accordingly she visited the house of the latter and staid three days when she was ordered off and otherwise abused tor seeking subsequent interviews with her daughter wtio was treated in all respects as a negro slave by jackson and his family this becoming known in the neighborhood mr jas m guire and other gentlemen interested themselves in the matter and by the generous and voluntary aid of col s jones and col rutherford the sheriff assisted the mother in the recovery of tier child as aforesaid by a writ of habeas corpus to the credit ofthc has of this city and of girard not one oi the lawyers would undertake to defend the illegal claim of jackson to the services and person of nancy indeed the public jeeling was getting excited both against fann the seller of his own white child and jackson the purchaser the latter is a church member and cxhorter in holy things and yet treated the female most shamefully she was the only servant about the house or in the field of jackson and was compelled to perform the most laborious and menial drudgery as to fann he is said to he a

exercises under the auspices of tbei american antislavery society at the hoei pita grove the meeting was through the day with only one hours intermission at noon and the attendance was very large al special train from boston consisting of fourj teen long cars brought about delegates from the eastern part of the slate and multitudes came in from the adjoining towns mr garnson presided and upon taking the chair briefly addressed the multitude upon the subject of the interesting etent thev had met to commemorate after which rev samuel may one of the secretanea of the society read letters from

eloquent remarks for nearly an hour and wan followed by rev theodore parker of boaion who enchained the attention of the audience for some tune by the power of his eloquence the originality of his

were commenced by a speech from rev adm ballou of hopedale which we were not so fortunate as to hear lie was followed bv wendell phillips esq ol boston ralph aldo emerson concord james v buffum of lynn and win lloyd garrison of boston mr phillips was suffering from ill health but he did full justice notwithstanding to his high reputation as an orator mr emerson was too unwell to speak but upon being called on be said he felt it his duty to make some sort of a response to the call unaccustomed ashe is to addressing mass meetings of the pen pie extempore he seemed to find much difficulty in getting ins great ideas into a proper clothing of words several times he looked up into the sky and far off into the woods and fields as if for help in his difficult and unaccustomed task but the ideas only seemed to put on more fantastic airs in the scholars brain and savings remark or two the audi j ence only caught a glimpse of what he was striving to exp ess however all knew that the root of the matter was in him and that you had only to jet him sit down by himself in his study and put his hand to paper and ins thoughts would run as cleat as a fountain and his great loving heart would expand with the kindliest sympathies for humanity after quite another fashion and so all were satis fied the north star rochester august i father jlntthew we have received a letter from our friend mr schermerhorn regretting the remarks we made last week on the course pursued by father matthew with respect to the subject of american slavery he says do not myself understand the motives which induce any to endeavor to thwart the purpose of father matthews visit to our country in my opinion the attack which has been made upon him is entirely without reasonable provocation and as it is calculated to inflict severe injury on the cause of temperance it should j be met whth the firm rebuke of every sincere j friend of the cause we think our friend wholly mistaken as to the spirit and object of our remarks as well as to the effect which they were calculated to produce nothing could be further from our intention than to thwart the purpose of father matthew s visit to this country and we have no wish in any way to turn him aaside from that high mission of good will to man in which he is engaged but we cannot be silent even with respect to such aman when he lends his influence to the cause of the oppressor and withholds his testimony from the cause of the slave with aview to standing veil with the slaveholder the invitation extended to him by our boston friends to attend the celebration of west india j emancipation on the ist of august was not only reasonable but respectful considering f ather matthews reputation at home as an antislavcty man it was just what he had a nght to expect at their hands if he could not comply with their invitation because of his numerous temperance engagements he could easily have said that such was the case and have bade them in a private way godspeed in the good work of giving freedom to three millions of imbruled outraged and helpless people m our land such a course would have been gratifying to the abolitionists and honorable to father matthew but no he did not even deign to reply to their letter ror offer a word of consolation or encouragement but virtually summoned the bible to the sup poit of the horrid system of rapine and j wrongdaring to assert that he did not know that there was any scriptural injunction against it and thus throwing the whole weight of his religious and philanthropic character on the side of the slaveholders argument what could the slaveholder ask or desire more than this grant that the chnstan scriptures do not condemn slavery and you have given the slaveholder a moral license to perpetuate slavery forever calhoun himself could not ask a larger admission in favor of the institution of slavery than that so gratuitously made by tins great apostle of temperance it is on j this account that we have felt it to be our duty l to exjose and dem tut e the conduct of father matthew his great popularity as a temperance man and his high standing as a priest and philanthropist ought not arid shall not shield him from tin rebuke which his unwarrantable and injurious course nchly merits if an angel from heaven should array himself against the cause of freedom and caat his influence with the oppressors and tyrants of our land his fate should be no better than that j f father matthew ob when will men learn that there is a god in the universe andi that he cannot look upon sin with any degree j of allowance when will they learn that i they cannot serve god and mammon nor promote the cause of righteousness in one particular by sacrificing it in another  atfier matthew proposes we understand to share the hospitality of president taylor j tins may be perhaps an explanation of hu unw lilmgness to comnut himself on the subject of slaveryat the same time that it elucidates the cause of his inability to ue anything in tfu titbit against ilacery j p fair at lacrdoa i hie annstavery exhibition of art and skill was conducted with much spirit and pawed off he gratification we believe of everyone present the loom in which it was held j was very tastefully and abundantly decorated with evergreens and the tables were beautifully furnished with useful and fancy articles of a rich and choree description arranged with neatness and elegance the refreshment table was abundantly supplied with delicacies of various descriptans macedon is not distinguished foi its antislavery there are bat few abolitionists m that town so that the burden of making the necessary preparations for it and especially the furnishing of the refreshment table fell upon two or three families we were par ucularlv indebted for aid to mr and mrs doty and familyto mr esick wilbur and family asa smith and family and william getch ell and family to all of whom we return our l sincere and heartfelt thanks several towns around were represented at the fan our friends from west walworth made themselves very efficient and contributed much towards the success which attended this antislavery effort the receipts of the fair as was expected were small being little more than fifty dollars the value however of the fair is not to be estimated by the money realized those who labored industriously add zealously in n behalf must seek their reward in the happy moral effect produced by the occasion a large assemblage of persons was secured to heat the antislavery subject considered and to see antislavery principles practically carried out in a manner that they had never seen before and we have good reason to think there was much prejudice removed and much interest excited among them they saw perhaps for the fiist time that white and colored persons could meet together in the same room and treat each other with kindness and respect an important end attained in this christian country the evening previous to the fair we delivered a lecture to the macedonians in the baptist church which ws kindly thrown open to us by the trustees without cost but there was so little antislavery in the place that no one volunteered to light up the house and our meeting would have been defeated but that our friend doty succeeded in purchasing a few candles at a late hour after the house was lighted the villagers came ingiving us a large audience who listened with attention and manifested considerable interest in the important subject which we humbly strove to set before them the moral daikness here is great and must be keenly felt by any antislavery lecturer who may visit the place we obtained three subscribers for the north star and have the promise of four more in a few days we hope the lecture together with the fair has prepared the way for other laborers in this part of our antislavery vineyard and that the seed now sown w ill yet produce a large antislavery harvest f d

is so much needed the truth is a union of sentiment and concert of action in our cause asin all others of like national character is the i starting point to any successful national re foim and i am encouraged to contemplate that reforms once wisely commenced never go backwards no people have ever achieved anything favorable to their united or general prospcriy without harmony union of sentiment and concert of action now as for my own part i most heartily subscribe to your plan of organization in order to bung about an union of our brethren of the free states and i sincerely hope that every colored man has the least spark of public spirit about him will give you every encouragement to pushpins plan forwaid and to bring it into practical operation as speedily as can le done go on friend

visit that she goes to make her morning call on her poor sisther hibernia the visit is supposed to be a private one but the dublin authorities probably thinking they may catch a stray baronetcy or two were intending to improve the occasion and make itas public as possible and had issued a proclamation for a procession and other rejoicings and instructing the citizens to illuminate on the evening of tbs queens arrival the dublin trades however who have no expectation that the rays of royally will shine upon them are otherwise minded they say that the queen should give them back john mitchell ore

of the illumination will take out my win dews lest they should be broken the sirit of this man is of course highly com nended by the more vioent of the irish pa tnots if it was meant as a personal insult to the queen in our humble judgment this manifestation of singularity was scarcely worth while for the queen as everybody knows is only a tool in the hands of her aris cratic advisers if on the other hand it was meant as a reproof of the queens whig counsellors and an expiession of disapproval of their course towards the irish rebels we imagine again that with a few exceptions oi oppressive restrictions of the press the steps they have taken have been characterized by justice and moderation the chief cause ol complaint against the whigs seems to be tlial while they are energetic in

hangdog cry of saxon misrule as peculiarly applicable to the irish in any respeci that it is not equally or even more applicable to the english and scotch the irish suffei most because they are the most ignorant priestridden and improvident not because they are the victims of a peculiarly oppressive misgovernment we object to the entire ays tem of aristocratic and irresponsible legislation we object to it however not because the irish suffer from it for what but suffering can be expected for those who are from their cradles taught to place implicit reliance upon priests or any other human and necessarily selfinterested authority but because all irresponsible power is always has been and always will be abused the idea of the ruler being the father of his people is pretty and it is founded on what seems to be a natural tendency of the human mind to heroworship but it is false the worlds kings will and must govern the world not however by the power of the sword but by the power ol mind at cork the popular voice has prevailed against an illumination great complaints are made against the hurry in which business has been huddled through parliament at the close of the session

that comes up the talk musl occupy the larger portion of the time while the legislation is lost sight of some rule tc limit the endless garulousness of a few legislative old women must be adopted in

much in time and money as sr vv ard or fl h garnet would have done had they attended made speeches and paid their own expenses ou say you doubt whether the committee asked mr fleman to come from new haven simply for his traveling expenses the expression of this doubt shows that you do not understand the character or motives of either party and suppose the committee to be as regardless of truth and their plighted word and mr beman to be actuated by the same mercenary motives as yourself and mr garnet you also ask when will black men learn to pay their own laboiers as liberally a ihey pay white men f and desire that buffalo folks may improve in this matter in answer to your query we would say that had it been our desire it is probable that we could havo obtained white speakers as cheap as colored and probably gratuitously but on such occasions we want no hireling advocates ot freedom of any color no matter how great their talents we want those who have souls enough to apeak in favor of freedom for her own sake as well as f r the almighty dollar and you need never expect to see any improvement in the people of buffalo that will cause them to prefer the mercenary advocates of freedom however talented to those who act from philanthropic motives however humble i he committee invited as speakers on that occasion s r ward h h garnet ag beman and a h francis mr s r ward replied that fie wanted twentyfive dollars besides his traveling expenses and wastoid in answer that all the committee could afford was to pay his traveling penses and make provision for his accommodation while in the city these conditions he accepted and said he knew nothing that would prevent his attendance some time after he wrote to the committee again stating that his pecuniary embarrassments were such l that it was necessary for his whole tune tobe devoted to his business and asking to be released from his engagement as a speaker adding that if it were m his power he should endeavor to attend as a sjectator tbe om mil tee on this representation generously released mr aid fiom his engagement a step which if it allowed him at then expense to form a mote profitable engagement elsewhere ought certainly to nlueld them from ins unjust censure h h garnet replied to the committee that he would corne on the same terms agreed upon with other speakers but soon after about the same lime that mr ward receded from his engagement mr farnet wrote again to the committee saying t hat in his first letter he had not fully stated his teiou which would be forty dollars the committee replied expressing theu regret at hu receding froru in engagement and stating their inability to engage him on any other terms this letter seemed to give offence to mi garnet snd he answered stating if hie lasted andi rovuience pet tin tied he should be in buffalo on the first of august without asking or receiving anything f lotn the committee and that when we saw him id buffalo on that day recomog nothing for his aeivicts we would learn that he did not seek our money but only to carry out a great principle we did not see mr garnet in buffalo oo that day but lor all that we at wu tt rained to believe that he is actuated not only by one principle but bv wen namely the fiveloaves and two finite lire com m lice wishing to have a lull understanding with mr harnet addressed to him another letter inquiring if they were at liberty to use in name as one of the speaker they received an answer sating that it was not j v r him to dictate to the com miltcc authorizing them to make what m they pleased of hi nime and repeating the assurance that it hie lasted and providence permitted h would be heieonthat di so dosed lie correspondence with the her henry highland carnet from the published exit act of im speech delivered on that day it appears ihrst life lasted and in what manner providence prevented lus attendance we are unable to tell we have heard it intimated however that it was a special proud nv in the shape of twentvfive dollai that prevented him from coming to ifuttulo and carried in in to auburn perhaps you can inform us accurately about tlia and at the same time do the public some service for it fie is in the market as it appears it is well that the people should know his price mr homan on being asked with a spirit ot philanthropy which more noisy and avaricious advocates of liberty would do well to imitate replied that it was not his desire to make a speculation out of such an occasion but from the great distance w hich he would have to navethe tax would be too great fur huri to prepare a speech lor the occasion and pay his own expenses but it the committee would be responsible for the necessary traveling expenses it would afford him great pleasure serve them i pon these equitable terms he came and nude one of the most powerful and eloquent speeches in behalf of universal freedom that ever lell from the lips of any human being a speech which did honor alike lo the head and heart from which it emanated and which will ever j be remembered by those who had the pleasure of listening to it we expect that it will be published shortly in connection with the able and eloquent oration of a ii francis on the same occasion when you and the public will have an opportunity of contrasting the j noble and exalted sentiments the pure and loftv principles and enlarged philanthropy which they inculcate with the bitter and vindictive spirit manifested in the speech of mr iarnet we are glad that providencu prevented him from coming here and spared us the humiliation of listening to such a base and cowardly attack made in the name of liberty and religion upon two uf the most able and devoted advocates of free dom w e cannot conceive how a man occupying the high position of mr flaruet as a reformer philanthropist and minister ot the gospel could so far forget himself as to lake advan j tage of such an occasion lo make a wanton attack upon an absent opponent one to who with the magnanimity which should ever characterize honorable and right minded men had freely offered the columns uf jus paper to discuss ail points of difference between himself and mr larnet wheic the statements and arguments on both sides could be read and calmly judged by the same i parties which ol course was all that any honorable opponent could ask to add to the turpitude of the affair lie wilfully mil represents the position of mr douglass and charges him with sentiments which he never uttered and which the whole community j know him to hold in abhorrence he brands mr douglass as an infidel because he de j nounces the american t hurches as corrupt prosavery and therefore antichristian yet in a resolu mon presented by himself on the same day as cv rnian a oinmittee he denounced them for v e same cause and in language which might hav een lom douglass his assertion that ou g ass h not a believer in the iiible every ne lo has read the writings of mr d knows t false it is because of his belief in the high and holy truths contained in its sacred pages that lie denounces those organizations that prostitute its glorious doctrines to the support ot such an abomination as slavery that receive women whippets and baby stealers to their communion and fill their pulpits with dealeis in the bodies and souls of men we respect religion and religious institutions and as far as their conduct will allow all religious teachers hut we know of nothing so well calculated to disgrace religion and promote infidelity as to see distinguished ministers of the gospel under the pretence of vindicating religion and sustaining liberty resorting to such a tissue of gross misrepresen j tation and t low as is contained jin the short extiact from mr harriets oraj tion and we feel to regret this the more deeply flora the high estimation in which we have heretofore hold mr harriet and the general approbation ot jus measures of t moral and political reform and we sincerely t hopethat both he and mr douglass maybe led to see the folly of expending ibeir strength upon thus who ditler from them j jhl in regard to the means neceessary toa comphsh the same ends and disregarding j those minor differences oi opinion which all men may honestly entertain direct their blows each in the maunci in may deem most j effective against the common enemy andi mr harnet has not sufficient hluisiuu

was organized in the choice of j w butler for the president g washington vice president and e b lawton and isaac if snowden as secretaries a committee of three was appointed to prepare business for the meetingjohn t jlil ton b f roberts and lemuel burr they presented the following resolutions resolved that common rights are the undisputed claims of every inhabitant of this commonwealth resolved that when a portion of the people in consequence of a long established custom are deprived of the enjoyment of their rights it is their duty to use every ellort to obtain an unqualified and an uncompromising possession of them resolved that as common school instruction is refused to all persons who differ in complexion from the whites in the cily of we regard the sufferance of such a distinction as a disgrace to civilization resolved that all exclusive schools are injurious to the welfare of the community and therefore should be discountenanced resolved that the school known as the smith school located in belknap street in this citv being a caste an exclusive school we regard it as a gteat public nuisance which bhould he immediately annihilated resolved that we will not regard with confidence any contrivance to quiet our efforts in relation to its abolition resolved that it is our hope that no individual who is identified with us in complex j ion will suffer himself to be used as a tool to prolong the existence of that school the above resolutions were unanimously passed the committee then presented the following appeal to the mayor and aldermen which was also
