protection of property in the district of columbia agreeably to notice mr hale asked leave to introduce a bill for the protection of property in the district of columbiamaking any city town orj corporate place liable for injuries done by mobs mr hale l wish to make a single remark iti order to call the attention of lie senate to the necessity of adopting ihe legislation proposed by this bill the bill itself is nearly an aostract of at similar law now in force in the adjoining state of maryland and also in many otuer states of the union the necessity for the passage of the bill will be apparent to the senate from facts which are probably notorious to every member of the body within the present week large and riotous assemblages of j the people have taken place in the district and have not only threatened to carry into execution schemes utterly subversive to all law with respect to the rights of property but have actually carried these threats into execution after having been addressed upheld and countenanced by men of station in society whose character might have led us to suppose that they would have taken a different course and given wiser councils to those whom they addressed it seems to me then that we have approached u time when the decision is to he made in this capitol whether moblaw or constitutional law is to reign paramount the hill which i now propose to introduce simply makes any city town or incorporated place within the district liable for all injuries done to property by riotous or tumultuous assemblages whether any farther legislation on the part ot congress will be necessary time will determine but i may be permitted to sav that at the present in ment we present a singular spectacle to the people of this country and to the world file votes of congratulation which this senate sent across the atlantic to the people of france on their deliverance from thraldom have hardly ceased when the supremacy of moblaw and the destruction of the freedom of the press arc threatened in this capital of the union without farther remark i move that this hill he referred to the committee on the judiciary mr bagby l rise for the purpose of giving notice that whenever that bill hull he reported by the committeeif it ever should bel shall propose to amend it by a section providing a sufficient penalty for the crime of kidnapping in this district was struck by a remark made by the senator from ncwhumpshirc he adverts to the rejoicing of the people of this country at the events now in progress in europe and thence infers that the slaves of this country arc to be permitted to cut the throats of their masters i shall certainly sir attend to this subject mr haleto avoid misapprehension purposely abstained from saying a word in regard to anything that might even be supposed to lie beyond the case which it is the object of this bill tc meet did not make the most distant allusion to slavery refrained from it purposely because wanted to pre seul to the consideration of the scuate the simple question of the integrity ol the law and the rights of property unembarrassed by considerations of the character alluded to by the honourable senator from alabama shall accordingly unite with that honourable senator in favour of a law agaiuat kidnapping because if i am correctly iiformed by individuals upon whose the north star testimony dace the most implies credit that one of the moat ovtrageoui cases of kidnapping was commute within sight of this capitol no longei ago than yesterday and that too in tht i case of an individual having in hit pocket an injunction issued by thi highest judicial authority in this dm trict to restrain all persons from molesting him yet in violation of tht injunction be was forcibly seised nonly without law but against lawnoi only in utter neglect but in flagrant contempt of the most sacred guarantee jof the constitution this outrage wai perpetrated within the limits of the city i in the very neighbourhood of the capi toll will then go with the senator from alabama heart and hand in the adoption of any legislation for the prevention of such outrage but i mint say that that is very foreign to tbs object of the bill which i have introduced mr benton there is some very pressing business awaiting the action ol the senate and ido not know that the remarks whitch have been made arc applicable to any motion pending at present may ask if there be any question pending the presiding officer the question is shall the senator from new hampshire have leave to introduce his bill mr calhoun what is the bill the presiding officer the bill will he read the secretary then read the bill which is as follows die nature of the bill has been stated above mr calhoun l suppose no senator can mistake the object of this bill anc the occurrence which has led to iti introduction now sir lam amazee that even the senator from new hampshire should have so little regard foi the laws and the constitution of the country as to introduce such a kill ai this without including in it the enactment of the severest penalties againsl the atrocious act which had occasionec this excitement sir gentlemen ii would seem have at last come to believe that the southern people anc southarn members have lost ail sensibility or feeling upon this subject know to what this leads i have knowi for a dozen of years to what all this ii tending when this subject was firs j agitated i said to my friends there ii but one question that can destroy thii union and our institutions and that is this very slave question for i choose to speak of it directly i said further that the only way by which such a result could be prevented was by prompt and efficient actionthat if the thing were permitted to go on nnd the constitution to he trampled onthat if it were allowed to proceed to a certain point it would he beyond the power ot any man or any combination of mento prevent the result we are approaching that crisis and evidence ol it is presented by the fact that such a hill upon such an occurrence should he brought in to prevent the just indignation of our people from wreaking their vengeance upon the atrocious perpetrators of these crimes or those who contribute to them without a denunciation of the cause that excited the indignation i cannot but trust that idc not stand alone in these views i have for so many years raised my voice upon this subject that i have been considered almost the exclusive defender of this great institution of the south upon which not only its prosperity but its very existence depends i had hoped younger members who have coine into this body who represea portions of the country at least as mucl interested as that from which i come might have taken the lead and relieved me from the necessity of ever agaii speaking upon this subject i trus we will grant no leave to introduce thii hillthat we will reject it and if any t ring be referred to the committee oi the judiciary it will be to make pena enactmentsto prevent these atrocitiei these piratical attempts on our owi rivers these wholesale captures these robberies of seventy odd of our slave tat a single grasp delay is dangerous on this question the crisis has come and we must meet itand meet il directlyand i will add we have ample means to meet it we can put the issue to the north if they disregarc the provisions of the constitution it our favorit their seagoing vessels cannot safely come up into our porta i we can prevent them from coming here and thus make the issue at once j the stipulations in the constitution it our favour are not to he respected why should we respect those in others do not intend to make a long speed on this occasion but i would here fee myself to be lacking in my duty j tht people of the district to the people othe south and to the people of tht united states had nit raised mj i voice against the introduction of such i bill on such an occasion mr h estcott i am not going t make a speech on this bill for the simple reason that intend after a fee observations to move to lay this motion for leave to introduce the bill upor the table and ask for the yeas an nays mr calhoun the bill is not yet in i troduced mr if toftthe senator from nei i hmpiire ulu ke to introduce tht i bill and i move to lay it upon tht table j mr calhoun better reject it i trust we will meet it directly and reject it mr westcott i did not understand the honorable senator from soutl carolina but now that i do an pretty willing to adopt the suggestion mr calhoun i would greatly prefer to meet the motion directly and reject it bight is of no sextruth is of no colorgod is the father of us all and all we are brethren mr wesustt l have no objection to that and bad taken hat another mode of attaining that object in answer to the suggestion of the honorable senator from sooth carolina that it was the doty of other senators representing the south to speak on this matter will state one reason only why i could not do so i could not trust my own feelings when i heard the senator flum new hampshire introduce this bill sir there has been no outbreak so violence in this district there has been no disturbance except on the part of a set of men wo it seems have come into the district for the purpose of assailing slave owners in the peaceful en joymept of their property secured to them by the constitution which we have allswqgp to support there baa bcea public indignation manifested by an assemblage of those who have been thus wronged but has there been any violence as yetany destruction of property no wonder that there has not been and when the senator from new hampshire proclaims that there is danger of this i call upon him for his testimony in relation to this matter where does be get evidence that any portion of the property of citizens of this district is to be burned down or destroyed i was present last night as a spectator at a large assemblage of the citizens of this district i heard law officers of this district and other gentlemen speak on the occasion but heard nothing by any means so incendiary as i have heard since the honorable senator took his seat upon this floor it is true indignation was expressed but leading citizens of this district and slaveholders declared that they were averse to any act bf overt violence indeed this assemblage which has been called a tumultuous mobpeaceably appointed a committee of fifty citizens to wait on the editor and request him to remove his incendiary publication which had provoked this excitement i have only to say sir that i readily yield to the suggestion of the honorable senator from s carolina mr daris of mississippi the senator from south carolina has remarked that he expected that some younger member of this body would notice the motion of the senator from new hamp shire to introduce a bill the purpose of which is the protection of incendiaries and kidnappers i have only to say that it is from no want of accordance in feeling with that honorable senator but from deference to him who has so long and so nobly stood forward in de fence of the institutions of the scnth that i remain silent it was rather that i wish to follow him than that i did not feel the indignation which he has sowell expressed the time has come when if this district is t be made the theatre of such contests congress should interpose the legislation necessary for the punishment of those men who come within our jurisdiction acting in fact and in morals as incendia riescoming here to steal a portion of that property which is recognized as such by the constitution of the united states why is it that in this body looked to as the conservative branch of the governmentonce looked to as so dignified that it stood above the power of factionthat wc find the subject of this contest so iusulting to the south so insulting always when it is agitated and introduced on such an occasion is this debatable ground no it is ground upon which the people of this union may shed their blood and that is the first result if it be pressed any farther and if this senate is to be made the theatre of that contest let it come the sooner the better we who represent the southern states are not here to be insulted on account of an institution which we inherit and if civil discord is to be thrown from this cham her upon the land let it germinate here and i am ready for one to meet it with any incendiary who dead to every feeling of patriotism attempts here to produce it mr foote ou the th of march the american people of all parties assembled at the capital for the purpose of witnessing the inauguration of the president of the united states the president was a northern man i had the honor of listening to his inaugural speech and in it he wisely and patriotically asserted a principle of which i approved at the time which i still admire and which has a close af i unity to the question so suddenly presented to this body martin van bu ren dared to declare in his inaugural speech that though it was his opinion aqd it certainly is not mine that congress has the power to abolish sla i very in the district of columbia yet he conceived that it could not be done without the most odious and uupardon able breach of faith towards the slave states of the confederacy especially maryland and virginia this declaration not altogether unexpected gave temporary quiet and satisfaction to tke south i had thought until recently that there were very few men in the republic claiming anything like a prominent standing among their fellowcitizens who entertained a different opinion jfrom that thus expressed or who if entertaining it would uxdertake to ex arena it in the national councils of thin republic but the abolition movement has not been quite so successful a some desire it to be and now we see plain indications that individuals for i cannot conscientiously call them gentlemen i asserting themselves to he champions of freedom have resolved to carry into execution n scheme an attempt to remove by ear meins whatever all tke slaves now within this district an that those who have been in the habit of retaining rinvna in their possession will be disc waged from bringing others rochester n y friday may here and that dtmenn who may hero after settle hers will of noaim an the principle of obvious pecuniary policy deckee bringing sack property with them and that then in this covert sad insidious manner the abolition of slavery in the district of columbia maybe accomplished the attempt to legislate directly upon this subject in the national councils is at war with the constitution repugnant to all principles of good faith and in violation of all sentiments of patriotism with whomsoever k originates this movement made directly or indirectly within congress or out of it which has been so quietly denounced by my colleague is simply a nefarious alteiujt to commit grand larceny upon the owners of slaves in this district i undertake to any that here is not n non who bos given hi countenance to this transaction in any shape who is not capable of committing grand larceny or if he happened to he a hero as such men are not of perpetrating highway robbery on any of the roads of this union he is not n gentleman he would not be countenanced by any respectable person anywhere he is amenable to the law i go farther and i dare say my sentiments will meet the approbation of many who do not live in slave states and i maintain that when ihe arm of the law is too short to reach a criminal he may justly be punished by a sovereignty not known to law such proceedings have taken place and there are circumstances which not only instigate but justify such acts i am informed upon evidence on which i rely that this very movement out of which the bill originates has been instigated and sanctioned by persons in high station it is even rumored and it is believed by manyl am sorry for the honor of this body to say sothat a senator of the united states is concerned in tbe movement certain it is that a member of another body not far distant meeting in a certain hall was yesterday morning engaged in certain reprehensible contrivances and but for his abject flight from tbe place of bis infamous intrigues he would have been justly punished not by the mob but by highspirited citizens convened for the purpose of vindicating their rights so unjustly assailed why is it that this question is continually agitated in the senate of the united statesthat it is kept here as the subject of our perpetual discussionis it simply that gentlemen wish to be popular at home i suppose so is it because of their peculiar sympathies for that portion of the population which constitutes slavery as recognized in the south what is the motive is the object to attain popularity is it to gain high station is it to keep up local excitement in some portions of the north with a view of obtaining political elevation as the reward of such factious conduct but i care not for the motives of such acts i undertake to say that in no country in which the principles of honesty are respected would such a motive as that now attempted be proposed or even countenanced for a moment i feel bound on this occasion to say that the hill proposed could not have any good object what docs it declare it declares that any attempt on the part of the people of this district though the only means which they may have in their power to protect their property and prevent it from being taken from them either by stealth or open robbery shall subject them to be mulcted in heavy pecuniary damages it amounts then to this that if hereafter any occurrence similar to that which has recently disgraced the district should happen and the good people of the district should assemble and proceed to the vessel in which their property had been placed and the captain of which had become the agent in the nefarious transaction and should then and there use the only means to prevent that vessel from sailing and their property being taken away before their eyes they would be compelled to pay very heavy pecuniary damages it is a bill then obviously intended to cover and protect negro stealing it is a bill fox the encouragement and immunitity of robbery that is its true character and whatever opiuion the gentlemans own selfsufficiency may induce him to entertain of his own conduct on this occasion i only tell him now the judgment which every honest man will pronounce upon it if tbe object of the senator was as have described it and is apparent on the face of the bill he is as guilty as if he had committed highway robbery i regret that i am obliged to use harsh terms but they are true tbe senator from south carolina asserted with great truth that the time had come when the south should not only let her voice be beard bnt disclose to all her enemies that she not only knows her rights but knowing dare fhjiiiß them maintain them by all constitutional meansby all legal expedients necessary by bloodshed the senator from new hampshire is evidently attempting to get op a sort of civil war in the country and is evidently filled with a nf of insurrection and incendiarism he may bring about an ovent which wifl end in the sputiag ol human mood i to ham however let him come forward boldly and take the proper respoasibdtfy let kirn say now i am ready to do battle in behalf of my friends the blacks tke slaves of the district of columbia let mm buckle oa his armor let mm mnheath me mwi and at once commence tbe contest and i have no doubt he will have a feir opportunity of shedding ms btood ia this holy cause ou the sacred sod of the dhtrict of columbia if be is really m eatnc he is bound w a conscientious ana to pursue this cowrie which cannot he persevered it without those awful scenes of bloodnbec and desolatioß long anticipated by goodmen m every pert of this republic when i ask was it that soothers mi ever undertook to invade the quiet and happiness of the north i hope i maybe pardoned in making the suggestion i do not wish to insinuate any invidkxm comparisons i thsnk hearea i hare an abiding confidence in the good sense the virtuous patriotism and regard fix the rights of property of my northern brethren end i believe that there are many of them of both parties who are perfectly sound on this question and who will condemn the set of this morning the south has been forbearing she has exercised more than complaisance more than forbearance but when i ask has any southern man occupying a seat in cither house ol congress attempted to interfere with any local interests in the northam must see that the courts of the senator from new hampshire is calculated to embroil the confederacy to put in peril our free institutions to jeopardize that uuion which our forefathers established and which every pure patriot throughout the country desires shall be perpetuated is he so enlightened friend of freedom or even a judicious friend of those with whom he affects to sympathize who adopu such s course who does not know that such men are practically the worst enemies of the slave i do not beseech the gentleman to stop hut if he perseveres he will awaken indignation everywhere and it cannot be that enlightened men who conscientiously belong to the faction at the north oi which he is understood to be the head can sanction or approve everything that he may do under the influence of excitement in this body i will close by saying that if he really wishes glory and to be regarded as the great liberator of the blacks if he wishes to be particularly distinguished in the cause of emancipation as it is called let him instead of remaining here in the senate or instead ot secreting himself in some dark corner of new hampshire where he may possibly escape the just indignation of good men thro out the republiclet him visit the good state of mississippi in which i have the honor to reside and no doubt he will be received with such shouts of joy as have rarely marked the reception of any individual in this day and generation i invite him there and will tell him beforehand in all honesty that he could not go ten miles into the ioterior before he would grace one of the tallest trees of the forest with a rope around his neck with the approbation of every virtuous and patriotic citizen and that if necessary i should myself assist in the operation mr hale l beg the indulgence ol the senate for a few moments though i did not exactly anticipate this discussion yet i do not regret it before i proceed further as the honorable senator from mississippi has said it has been asserted and he thinks on good authority that a senator of the united states connived at this kidnapping of slaves i ask him if he refers to me mr foote l did mr hale l take occasion then to say that the statement that i have given the slightest countenance to the procedure is entirely without the least foundation in truth i had nothing to do with the occurrence directly or indirectly and demand of the honorable senator to state the ground upon which he lias made the allegation mr foote lt has been stated to me and i certainly believed it and believing it i denounced it i did not make the charge directly my remarks were hypothetical i am glad to hear the senator say that he haa had no connection with the movement but whether he had or not some of his brethren in the great cause in which he was engaged no doubt had much to do with it mr hale the sneer of the gentleman does not affect me i recognize every member of the human family asa brother once for all i utterly deny that either by counsel by silence or by speech or in any way or manner bad any knowledge cognizance or suspicion of what was done or might be done until i beard of this occurrence as other senators have beard of it and challenge any one who entertains a different opinion to the proof herenow and forever i go farther than that i never have counselled advised or aided in any way and with my present impressions i never shall counsel advise or aid in any way any encroachment upon the constitution in any of its provisions or compromises if the constitution be not broad enough for the protection that i claim i will go without it i trust that on this subject i have been sufficiently understood i deny in general and particular not only connivance hot all knowledge of any such movements whilst i am op let me call the attention of the senate to the ease of aman whom am proud here and elsewhere to call my friend the editor of the national era this gentleman ina card published in the national intelligencer of this day declares a rumor having been circulated that the office of the national era was concerned dirctlr or indirecty m the recent attempt of a cumber of slaves to escape on the schooner pearl it is doe to the respectable citizens of this place and to ayaetf to giro a plain m and unequivocal denial to the import yiom no rht to which no true hearted american will be ungenerous enough to demandl fry it to he my duty to do all i can to re morm a uriww nusapprebenston ctk lated to provoke unpltutiil excite the position which be lies take is tkee laid doers is the first ooraber ol his paper and he republishes it is his card believing that the extinction of slavery can be effected in accordance with the constitution and law and that this is the better way no unconstitutional or illegal measures will find in usa supporter we cannot work with contradictory means whenever convinced hat such measures as the laws sanction or do not prohibit are insufficient tor the accomplishment of the great object we aim atwe shall frankly say so the magnitude of the cause in which wa are engaged justice to our fedowcitrzens of the south snd sound policy demand tint no movement be made in relation to this important question except with the utmost openness frankness and fairdealing the declaration i then made embodied the principles upon which i had always uniformly acted in relation to slave and in not a single instance have i or any one in my office as far as ray knowlede extends violated it cannot consistently with my views of what honesty and fairdealing dictate to say nothing of sound policy engage in any way directly or indirectly take part in any movement which would involve the necessity of strategy or trickery of any kind my paper has been published sixteen monts in this city its columns are open to inspection those who have taken the trouble to read it will testify that i have counselled no measures repugnant to the foregoing that i have abstained from invective and denunciation and addressed myrelf to the reason the conscience the patriotism and sense of honor of the slaveholders many of them being near relatives and personal friends not one of my numerous exchanges in the south how much soever opposed to my views has at any time imputed to me ill temper or a clandestine policy with this plain exposition of my course it is hardly necessary for me jto say that in the recent transaction which has excited so much feeling nsither myself nor any person connected with me had any share whatever that the transaction in fact became known to me only through the general report i write this to disabuse the public mind so that those who do not personally know me may not be imposed upon by any misrepresentation of my position certainly i feel a great repugnance to being assailed for what i have never done or dreamed of but if legal violence be inflicted upon ine for writing and printing freely about slavery or any other subject which it may suit an american to discuss then i will suffer cheerfully in the confident hope that when passion and prejudice shall have been dispelled jus j tice will be done to my character but i will not suppose that those who are rejoicing in the enfranchisement of the press in paris will put fetters upon the press in washington mr calhonn in his seat does he make any denunciation of the rob bery mr hale he had quite enough to do in defending himself and it was no part of his duty to denounce others mr calhoun ia his seat i understand that mr halt l appeal to the sense of j justice of the senate and ask what justification there can be for assailing the i character and property of a man who knew no more of this occurrence than any of its members i appeal to the honorable senator who spoke so eloquently of the high and chivalric ideas of right which are understood in this section of the country mr foote l ask the senator and i beg to remind him that twenty millions of people are listening to his answer in the circumstance of the case evidently known to him does he suppose that this i occurrence could have taken place j without extensive countenance and aid from men of standing in thia district whether members of congress or others mr hale l have no doubt that those persons could not have got away with i out some aid it is enough that i have disclaimed all knowledge of it i thought that when the honorable senator was speaking more that twenty millions of people were listening he invites me to visit the state of mississippi and kindly informs me that he would be one of those who would act the assassin and put an end to my career he would aid w bringing roe to j public executionoo death by a mob well in return for his hospitable urn i tat ion i can only express the desire j that he would penetrate into some of the dark corners of new hampshire and if he do i am much mistaken if be would not find that the people in that i benighted region would he very happy to listen to his arguments and eiqage m an intellectual conflict with him in which the truth might be elicit d i think however that the announcement which the honorable senator ban made on this floor of the fate which awaits no humble an individual j ray self in the state of mississippi j most convince ever y one of the propriety of the high enlegimn which he pronounced upon her the ether day when he spoke of the high position which aba occupied among the states of this confederacy but enough of this personal matter think if i did net misunderstand the honorable senator from south car ocna that ha as snrpriaad at the temerity of the senator frees new hampshire in introducing this hill let me ask william c sell tsstisesa john dick rater ta whole n what is the bill what is this iacta disry bill that has elicited mkh a torrent of invective has it been saos hmucil abohtioa istsf w by t it is copied almost void rar word from a law on the statute book which has bees in operation for years in the neighboring state of ma has no allusion directly or indirectly to the subject of slavery yet am accused of throwing it as a firebrand and in order to make war i u p the institutions of the south how in gods name has it come to this that the american senate and in the year of grace one thousand eight hundred and fortyeight the rights of property cannot be named but the advocates of slavery are in arms andex claim that aar is made upon their institutions because it is attempted to cast the protection of the law over the j property of an american citizen who appeals to an american senate j it has long been held by yoa ibat your peculiar institution iincompatibly with the right of speech but if h be also incompatible with the safeguard of the constitution being throw n around property of american citizens let the country kuow it if that is to be the principle of your acli n let it be proclaimed throughout the length andi breadth of the laud that there is an institution so omnipotentso almighty that even the sacred rights of life and property must bow down before it do not let it lie said that have introduced this subject have simply i asked that the plainest provisions of common lawthe clearest dictates of justiceshall be extended snd exer i cised for the protection of the property of citizens of this district and yet tbe i honorable senator from south carolina is shocked at my temerity mr butler allow me to ask cno question with perfect good temper i the senate is discussing the subject i with some feeling but i ask him whether he would vote for a bill properly drawn inflicting punishment on persons inveigling slaves from the district of columbia mr halt certainly not and why because i do not believe that slavery should exist here mr calhoun in his scat if wishes to arm the robbers and disarm the people of the district mr halt the honorable senator is alarmed at my temerity mr calhoun in his seat did not use the word but do not think it worthwhile to correct the senator mr hale the senator did not usa the term mr calhoun no i said it was brazen in the senator or something like that mr hale the meaning was lha same it was strange then that i should introduce a bill for the protection of property in this districta bi perfectly harmless but which was rot rtrued into an attack upon the ftouth i ask the senator from south carolina and the country wherein consists the temerity suppose in the section of the country from which it con oj he says we seem to think that the s nth has lost all feeling ah there is the temerity the bill comes from the wrong side of a certain boundary why did the honorable senator from south carolina imagine that wo of the north with our feces bowed down to the earth and our backs to the sun had received the lash so long that we dared not look up did he suppose we dared not ask that the protection of the law be thrown around property in the district to which we come to legis late i desire no war upon the institution of slavery in the seusc in which the senator understands the term will never be a party to any encroachment upon rights guarantied by the constitution and the lawnot at all i wish no war but a war of reason of persuasion of argument a war that should look to convincing the understanding subduing the affections and moving the sympathies of the heart that is the only war in which would engage but it is said that the time is come that the crisis has come snd that the south must meet it in all candor and honesty then let me say that there could not be a better platform on which to meet the question than that presented by the principles of this bill there could not be s better occasion than this to appeal to the couutry let the tocsin sound let the word go forth let the free north be b id that her craven representatives on the floor of the senate are not at liberty even to claim the protection of the rights ef property j the right of speech was sacrificed l n g s o bst now it is to be proclaimed hat we earmot even introduce a bill looking to the execution of the plainest provisions of he constitution snd tho clearest principles of justire fr tho j protection of human rights because gentlemen choose to consti uc it into attack upon that particular institu tion i ask agsin what is it that has pro i duced this step called up there desun i clarions excited all this uivecrite which has been pouted out open me as if i had been guilty of all the cnm ia the decalogue i call upon the f aate and the country to takjh notice of it lacks on wkat dv gentlemen of the booth re j ly for the protection of any in it wtiooo on which they place any value it will be answered upon the const it o tioo and the law well then if the i safeguards of the conetautimi are reo dered inadequate to the protection of one species of property how emu it be aeppseed that there will he protection for any ft is because i desire to main rain m all their strength and shifty the safeguards o t ac constitution that i hare introduced this bill for the pruttc i ttm of in this district andi hero let m tell the sartor from ala bams that ha will have my foil eo ape ration in any measure to prevent hid i nppin nd shall expect him to redeem his pledge again am shocked to bear the honorable senator denounce this bill as a measure calculated to ro prcaa those citizens from the expreaaoa of their just indignation mr calk lf the senator will allow me i will explain said no such thing bat i will take the occasion to say that would just as soon argue with a maniac from bedlam as with the senator from new hampshire on this subject several senatorsorder order mr calhotm l do not intend to eor i rect his statemeta a man who says i that the people of this district have no j right in their slaves and that it is no robbery to take their property from them is not entitled to be regarded asin possession of his reason mr hale lt is sn extremely novel mode of determining a controversy by throwing the mantle of maniacal irresponsibility over ones antagonist but the honorable senator puts words into my mouth which i never used did not say that the owners had no property in their slaves i said that the institution exists but i have not given any opinion upon the point to which the i senator alluded i have never said any j thing from which this sentiment which he imputes to me could be inferred it i does not become me know to mca  sure arms with the honorable senator i from south carolina more particularly since he has been so magnanimous as to give notice that he will not condescend to argue with me but there is more than ono man in this countrywho has whether justly or unjustly long since arrived at the conclusion that if i am a maniac on the subject of slavery i am not a monomaniac for i am not alone in my madness but sir am not responsible here or elsewhere for the excitement that has followed the introduction of this subject i intended simply to give notice of a bill caicu lated to meet the exigency the honorable senator from florida calls upon me for proof of the necessity of this legislation and says that no violence has been committed in this district i dont know what he calls violence mr fve stcott there has been no evidence except the running away with some negroes mr hale well i believe that some j hundreds of individuals assembled in front of a printing office in this city j and assailed the building with missiles obliging the persons engaged in their usual employment to abandon their legal occupation if that does not come up to the gentlemans definition of violence i do not know what does i was desirous of introducing this subject without an appeal to any matters which might be supposed to lie behind believe that these matters have nothing to do with the subject under consideration but other gentlemen have chosen to give this subject a different direction now in the bill which i have had the honor to introduce the provisions are almost identical with the law which has been in existence in many of the states and is now on the statutebook of maryland to its enactment here exception has been taken and i am quite willing that the country should know the grounds on which opposition is made if the subject be painful it has not been made so by me as to the threats w hich have been made of bloodshed and assassination i can only say that there have been sacrifices already and there may he other victims until the minds of all shall be awakened to the conviction that the constitution was made as well for the preservation of the freedom of discussion as for the

effect a meeting among the citizens of the place generally when upon the evo of leafing i was informed by a gentleman tliit provided i staid another day a meeting could be effected hut my time being precious and having already spent sufficient in the place i could not consent i am of opinion that the failure in the first place was more the effect of timidity on the part ol the applicants than anything else for want of room in my last i omitted to mention some incidents peculiar to the national road which came under my notice travelling from lloydsville to columbus y hen i arrived at cambridge having stopped at the temj ernce housekept by mr carey and the only antislavery hotel on that rood i was requested to op and lecture that evening it being on the sabbath day i was requested by the officiating methodist clergyman who sent for me to call at the church to see him who proposed after the sermon to give me an opportunity to speak to the people hut this i decliuedi for two reasons one that i desired to get on to concord to hold a meeting there that eveuing consequently could not take time to refresh the other that however much imay have been inclined to speak i should not hare availed myself of suehan opportunity ts at best religious meetings are the most unfavorable to lecture before on the subject of slavery andstill more so immediately after a sermon and that too a funeral sermon as was the case in this instance for me to have attempted to expose the hypocrisy of proslavery religion by rebuking the infernal system of american slavery as i most assuredly would have done before such a congregation and at snob a time would have been a sin unpardonable cambridge is the place in which that fearless advocate of human rights m r hull was shamefully and basely mobbed err n times and finally being unable to bear the continued heavy loss consequent from such attacks upon his property was driven to concord a lew mile west although i have spoken in many of the most proslavery pla ecs since i have been in tins state even where there had never before been an antislavery lecture yet at the most shameful treatment received by hull i felt so indignant that i would not speak m the place was entreated hv the few untislavcry friends there tn stay and liold a meeting but peremptorily refused in this i may have been wrong and if so plead guilty to the charge hut could not at the time persuade myself that there was ajiy duty iixumbeut on me as it appeared to me that those that are righteous shall be righteous still and as to the others they were given over to a hardness of heart i went on to concord but held no meeting in consequence of the absence of mr hull saw his wife but did not make myself known to her the people of concord whom i conversed whh though evidently antimobocratic in feeling and principle yet appeared as little concerned about antislavery as they were about the piracy on the northern coast of africa although i have met with enough to rebuke in almost every place i have visited yet have never met nor did i eijnct to meet with anything like the miserable truckling to the slave power and low servility manifested at most litery bouse upon the rued and in every town ihrough which i passed indeed i cannot permit mvself to believe that there is in either asia or africa short of the most eonuin raati ly ignorant and degradedly barbarous a ribc or clan of heathen that can ho found imong whom a stronger of whatever nation r clime would not meet with more rniiny ban a colored personat least than i received from

permitted to pass without ridicule and insult nay you could not make inquiry at the postoffice without meeting insult from its clerks and indeed this species of petty despotism was dealt out toward the colored citizens of the place as well as strangers but now there is generally that kind of courtesy and civility manifested towards one by those with whom he may have dealings that become people professing to be christians one may now pass along the streets and enter the postoffice or a hotel without incurring insult at the threshhold at least there aie quite a number of respectable colored mechanics in chillicothc all industriously employed also a large number of freeholders and more farmers round about in this neighborhood than i have ever yet met with this is highly creditable to the colored inhabitants and will do more towards elevating us than all other human efforts this of mason and dixons line would observe that altogether the young society in this place is not quite so

last evening in passing the railroad depot i saw quite a large number of colored persons passing round one of the ears and from manifestations of grief among some of them i was induced to draw nar and ascertain the cause found in the car to which they were so eager ly gazing fifty colored pertotu some of whom were nearly as white as myself a large majority of the number were those who attempted to regain their liberty last week in the schooner pearl about half of them were females a few of whom had but a alight tinge of african blood in their veins j they were finely formed and beautiful j the men were ironed together and the whole group looked sad and de jeeted at each end of the car stood a ruffianlooking guard with canes inin their hands in the middle of the car stood the notorious slavedealer of baltimore who is a member of the methodist church in good and regular standing he had purchased the men and women around him and was taking his departure for georgia while observing this old grey headed dealer in the bodies and souls of men the chaplain of the senate a methodist brother entered the car and took his brother methodist by tbe hand chatted with him for a short time and seemed to view the heartrending scene before him with as little concern as he would look upon cattle i know not whether he came to sanctify the act or pronounce the parting blessing but this do know that he justifies slavery a presbyterian minister who owned one of the fugitives was the first to strike a bargain with the slavedealer and make merchandise of gods image some of the colored people outside aswell ss in the car were weeping most bitterly i learned that many families were separated wives were there to take leave of their husbands and his bands of their wives children of their parents and parents of their children friends part mg with friends and the tendcrest ties of hmaauify severed at a single bid of the inhuman slavebroker before them a husband ia the meridian u

hie wife aad ae the wee reaching forward her head a ham the mackmeart ed slavedealer ordered him down he did aot obey the husband aad wife with ears streaming down their cheeks heeoaght him to let them speak to each other but no he was knocked doom from the car and ordered away the bystanders could hardly restrain themselves from laying violent hands upon the brute this is bat a faint description of the scene wlicb took place within n few rods of the capitol and under enactments recognised by congress oh what n revolting scene toa feeling heart aad what a retribution awaits the actors will not their wailings of anguish reach the ears of the most high vengeance is minel will repay saith the lord you have already heard of the fugitive case and the mob here a very excitingfliscossion has been going on in the house for the last two days growing out of these riots the galleries were thronged and the most intense interest was maintained while j northern and southern members were i discussing have the honor to be yoar sincere friend and obedient servant john s slingerland the examination the following i extracted from the editorial correspondence of the cleveland ohio true democrat washington april i closed my letter yesterday by informing you tiiat i was going to attend the examination of those charged with the crime of removing slaves from the district having procured an attorne in the city to accompany me i again went to the jail and demanded my right as counsel of the prisoners to converse with them and prepare their case for examination i was admitted to the entrance in the second story leading to their cells while conversing with them the same gentleman who had insisted on our departure in the morning came up and informed my associate counsel and myself that it was dangerous for us to remain there longer he said the owners of the slaves were downstairs much excitedthat two of them had followed us and that it was not safe for us to remain longer with the prisoners for niy part i paid no attention to him but continued conversing with the prisoners until the hour arrived for their examination the court as i remarked was held in the jail none were admitted but the owners of the slaves the witnesses and attorneys the district attorney appeared on behalf of the united states as prosecutor he was furnished witha chair a table peu and ink the two justices also were furnished with chairs and seated by a table but the attorneys for the prisoners were left to stand and without a table on which they could take minutes of the case lt appeared from the testimony that edward sayres of new jersey was captain of a vessel named the pearl j chester english was a hand employed on board of her and she was chartered by daniel drayton of philadelphia the vessel started from philadelphia for this city at the mouth of the potomac they took on board a load of wood which they brought to this city and sold they arrived here on saturday last on saturday evening about eight or nine oclock the slaves commenced coining on board in gangs of from six to eight until between eighty and ninety had arrived about two oclock on sunday morning they left the wharf here and sailed down the river until they reached the mouth their destination was philadelphia on arriving at the mouth of the river the wind blew from the north so that they could not make progress to that destination they accordingly run into a cove cast anchor and all went to rest here was thir error had they put out to sea as they might have done they soon would have been beyond the reach of danger instead of this however they foolishly lay by waiting for the wind to change during the examination the slaves were all brought forward and i had an opportunity to see the whole of them here were a large number of them who had infant children in their arms whose color and features did not fail to proclaim their paternity some ofthem appeared cast down others reckless one woman being asked the name of her child gave it saying we always name our children after big men and generally dont miss much whata writhing sarcasm another on being asked how she could leave so good a home replied i wanted liberty wouldnt you sir the name of another being called she replied here i ain sir once free again a slave another a finelooking intelligent mulatto girl about seventeen turned to the prisoners shook them by the hand exclaiming god bless you sirs you did all you could it is not your fault that we are not free m cremieux the israelite this celebrated jewiah

of the republic every part of which has entertained the great thought of emancipating such of your fellowcountrymen as still remain in slavery slavery slavery in the midst of liberty why this is the most odious the most afflicting inconsistency distinction among men this is a violation of the law oi god and man loud applause we have only proclaimed the principles which dwell in the hearts of all mankind yes the national convention that grand that immortal assembly had restored yon all to freedom but the error of a great man again placed you under the yoke which you had believed was broken forever you who having been slaves had become freemeu rendered to the liberty which had been restored to you such great and important services you yourselves were cast back into servitude the new republic will accomplish what the republic proclaimed you shall again become free there shall no longer be a slave on the soil oi liberty in our colonies as well a continental france every roan who inhabits the land shall be free you will prove yourselves worthy of it foi you ever have been so and when slavery shall have disappeared oui descendants will exclaim with prideil was to the revolution of that the final abolition of slavery was due vive la republique this was reechoed by the repeated cries of fire la rcpvbltqve five l gouremment piovtaoiref french sympathy meeting a preliminary meeting was held at the court house to take measures with regard to the call of a general meeting for an expression of sympathy with the people of franc in their efforts to establish a republican govern mentthe court room was filled and crowded at an early hour a committee was appointed to complete the arrangements for a mass meeting on may bth addresses were delivered by alexander mann esq wm c bloss esq and others the following report is from the democrat of april mr frederick douglass was called upon for a speech to which he assented and spoke as follows it was quite unexpected by me that i should have been called upon to speak here this evening especially at so early a stage of the meeting i hoped to be allowed to remain in silence and hear others present express their feelings freely on this subject but it might be well supposed that on such a theme as this i would have a word to say iain a democrat in the largest sense of the worda friend of equal rights and believe that i live in a nation which has nothing to do whatever with the graduation of human rights i am a friend not only to democracyradical democracybut deeply sympathise in this grand movement resulting from the declaration of france to become a republic i regard france as something more than a republic as we are accustomed to understand it and to see in the example of other republics i am glad that the people here assembled appear to have seen more in the present position of france than the mere establishment of a republic i see on all sides here the workingmen and mechanics of rochester their hearts vibrate in sympathy with the grand movement of france and whyße j cause she is aiming not only to establish ja government of equality for herself but takes into view the rights of labor jing men as well as those of other men because with a glorious consistency which puts oar own country to the blushand i ask no allowance in making this remark because justice comes into court with her hat on and makes no apologyl say if anything can put our republic to the blush it is that glorious consistency with which the provisions government of france has made and set in operation measures j which must bring about the entire overthrow of slavery in all her dominion the other day my heart was thrilled when i saw in reading the public papers an address delivered by one of the members of the provisional government to a party of mu at toes j and negroes who bad met to express ffccir sympathies with the republican government what laag uage do you npnoae the provisional governmeat held towards these negroes niggers and mulattos it was this citi wns friends brothers brothers without thin act on the part of tbs provisional government bar demo true or her revolution would have bean all a sham ha hoped that the ions would bear this in mind aid greig spoke at mm length very effective sad patriotically expree na iris satmetioa at the fact that france in establishing her new government had commenced in the right way by elevating labor aad fraternising the whale peoak setting aside her nobility aad reducing all to a cm mm cm equaii ty of civil rights the day whea the bootblacker and the senator should he regarded as alike noble by nature would be the moot glorious period in the worlds history by this he did not actnaa equality of wealth for that would reduce the whole idea to a hum bugbut be meant aa equality of social and civil rights he was frequently applauded in the course of his remarks and especially when he observed that he was exceedingly happy in the thought that he had not a red cent in his pockethe bad not upon bis honor if he had it would be a canker and a drawback upon the spirit of glorious independence which he felt crawling all over him he also alluded to the measures taken by the provisional government to abolish slavery as one ofthe proudest and best acts which a people coild perform in ridding themselves of the shackles of monarchy mr douglass was again called to the stand and spoke at considerable lengtht the great gratification of the people assembled who frequently interrupted him with cheers snd applause aid l ward smith spoke briefly and eloquently believing that akhough he might be regarded as presuming in attempting to speak after the eloquent speeches which had been made yet he believed that this was a subject upon which every american might freely express himselffrance had been our only ally and friend in our revolution she had assisted us in attaining liber tywe should not be slow in encouraging and assisting herthe country of la fayette and rochambeauto likewise become free from the restraints ofa monarchy which receiving its prerogatives from the people themselves had begun with professions of liberality and had ended in making itself rich and powerful rioting in corruption and trampling on the rights of the people mr kelsey was loudly called for and addressed he people briefly he had felt some hesitation as to the most proper time for making a sympathetic demonstration but he was prepared at all times to congratulate those who w ere making efforts to extend the principles of free government in any part of the world he was especially ready to sympathise with the people of france he ardently desired that they should be successful and that the government which has been erected upon the ruins of a throne should be established securely and permanently the following were the committee the mayor messrs kelsey wm pitkin t cempshall j gould a mann f whittlesey p g buchan j griege stone f starr j

incorporations recognized by law governed by usages of great antiquity with a fund to defray the corporate expenses and in each considerable town a house of entertainment is selected as the house of call or harbor as it is styled of each particular craft thus you see in the german towns a number of taverns indicated by their signs l masons harbor blacksmiths harbor c no one is allowed to set up as a master workman in any trade unless be is admitted as a freeman or member of the craft and such is the stationary condition of most parts of germany that no person is admitted as a master workman in any trade except to supply the place of some one deceased or retired from business when sueh a vacancy occurs all those desirous of being permitted to fill it present a piece of work executed as well as they are able to do it which is called their master piece being offered to obtain the place of a master workman nominally the best workman gets the place but you will easily conceive that in reality some kind of favoritism must generally decide it thus is every man obliged to submit to all the chances of a popular election whether he shall be allowed to work for bis bread and that too in a country where the people j are not permitted to have any agency in choosing their rulers but the rest rail ts on journeymen in that country are still more oppressive as soon as the years of apprenticeship have ex j pired the young mechanic is obliged in the phrase of his country to wander for three years for this purpose he is furnished by the master of the j craft in which he has served his apprenticeship with a duly authenticated wanderiogbook with which he goes to seek employment in whatever city be arrives on presenting himself with his credentials at the house of call or harbor of the craft in which he has served his time he is allowed gratis a days food and a nights lodging if he wishes to get employment in that place be is assisted in procuring it if be does not wish to or fails in the attempt he must pursue his wandering and this lasts three years before he can anywhere be admitted as a master i have beard it argued that this system had the advantage of circulating knowledge from place to place and imparting to the young artisan the fruits ofj travel and intercourse with the world but however benefieisl travelling maybe when undertaken by those who have the taste and capacity to profit by it cannot but think that to compel every young man who has just served out his time to leave home in the manner i have described must bring his habits and morals into peril and be regarded rather as a hardship than as an advantage there is no sanctuary of virtue like homejsserctts address rim a wava the slaves in cecil county maryland are running away j rich ann

enemies hare become friends the legislature bare during the past winter granted a liberal charter and our prospects for success and usefulness are now much better than they have ever been before by the laws of michigan the colored people have more of their rights secured to them than in any other of the western states since last fall the institution has been under the core of rer mr p russell formerly of boston there have been forty students in attendauce about five hundred acres of land have been procured one institution building fifty feet long thirtyfive feet wide and two stories high is up and enclosed though not very comfortable yet it has been occupied during tbe past winter this we hope to have finished before next fall some other smaller buildings have also been put up for the benefit of the institution and for the accomo dation of families and students students can receive employment on the farm or at mechanical business by which they may defray a part or all of their expenses the land around the institution is good and easily cultivated lots of from one to twenty acres maybe obtained by colored people or others favorable to education for a very reasonable price as the institution is especially designed for the benefit of colored people it is hoped that they will avail themselves of the privilege which is now presented of acquiring an education and of qualifying themselves for exerting a salutary and extensive influence in the world the hon j g birncy was appointed by the legislature as one of trustees of the institution but he informs us that the clumsiness and feebleness of his voice the difficulty of his enunciation the ill state of his health and his faint expectation of ever again going out of his county have led him to decline all such appointments the trustees at present are messrs p russell prier loiter w jackson joseph hervet joseph foster ethel judd jason st john edward bird sail and nathan powers a pait ol these were appointed by the

circumstances are such that we are under the necessity of appealing again to the benevolence of those who are interested in the education of colored people we arc still in great need of funds they are needed ist to liquidate certain debts which are against the institution for land the erection of buildings making improvements cd we need assistance to finish those buildings which have been commenced also to erect others for the accommodation of students and teachers d as many of the colored people are unable to defray all the expenses of an education we wish to be able to offer such instruction

oppressed lend us a helping hand in carrying out our benevolent design of elevating and educating those who have so long been deprived of privileges which they need we stand in great need of at least two thousand dollars during the present year we have established a scholarship system by which any one contributing a hundred dollars shall have the right of sending a scholar to the institution for
