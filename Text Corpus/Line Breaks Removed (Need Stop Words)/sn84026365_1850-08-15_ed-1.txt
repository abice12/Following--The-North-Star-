southern dictation in the senate the attempt of mr pratt one of the whig senators from maryland to bully senator seward ot new york is another specimen of the peculiar tactics by which the south controls the legislation of the country mr seward proposed an amendment to the compromise bill viz that at some fixed time after the president has ascertained that the constitution of new mexico is republican in its character he shall have authority to issue his proclamation admitting her into the union mr pratt rose in a towering passion and charged that the amendment was a violation of the constitution and could only come from a senator who had pleaded that there was a higher law than the constitution and in conflict with it mr seward distinctly and calmly disclaimed mr ps verson of his remark mr pratt replied with new violence and declared that mr seward ought to be expelled from the mr raid win of con j necticut rose and read the objectionable sentenco from mr sewards speech and defended it mr hale did the same and said that if an agreement with mr seward in such an opinion was an offence for which a senator deserved expulsion he mr hale and some others would be expelled mr pratt replied that he would include him in the motion with great pleasure mr atchison of missouri and mr foote expressed their opinions agreeing with mr pratt mr chase of ohio did not like to hear these declarations of offensive purposes he would rather see an attempt made to carry them out the correspondent of the n y herald says that mr foote had a retort and a look from mr chase which constituted the most powerful argument of the days j debate we have seen nothing like the instantaneous effect it produced j mr clays assault upon john davis was in similar spirit with mr pratts j attack mr clay was arguing that the great staple articles of the south would not be cultivated in new mexico and hence slave labor would be t valueless there he then went on to say but the hon senator from massachusetts mr davis has found out a new object of temptation in respect to slaves in new mexico he has employed an expression which filled all of us with profound regret on account of the dignity the character ofi the senator and the high stations which he has occupied he spoke of new mexico being adapted to the j breeding of slaves he has had the good sense to omit that expression in his printed speech and to substitute for it the traffic in slaves here mr davis in his seat remarked i believe i did not use that expressionj mr clay replied the senator did employ it for it was heard and noticed j by more than myself mr davis again said that according to the best of his recollection he used the word traffic clay went on that is the language of the gen tlemans speech as printed but the word breeding was used by the gentleman or i never heard a word of the speech several senators took note of it and we expressed how much we were shocked and surprised at it it was one of the principal topics ot thesen atorsspeech to talk about the cotton power the cotton interest and the breeding of slaves now if the senator had put it on the ground of a lapsus linguae from the heat of debate or the nnguarded character of debate ishod not insist upon attributing it to him but the expression was used by him and i remarked it it was fixed upon my memory and very much did i regret that he made use of it this talk sir about the cotton power the lords of the loom and the breeding of slaves will do for the barrooms of crossroad taverns but never hoped or expected to hear upon the floor of the senate such epithets applied to the great manufacturers of the north or the cotton growers of the south then he proceeded to tell how he bad struggled by the side of mr davis yol no for protective tariffs and how many southern men and southern states had stood with them and how the northern locofoco states had gone the other way and how mr davis would not get protection to manufactures bv throwing out such taunts in relation to the cotton power or the slave breeding interest and with a great deal more of this solemn kind ot humbug he wound up as follows this charge upon the slaveholdii l states for breeding slaves for ru ket is utterly false and giuu a no such purpose ever enters oeic into the mind of any slaveholder takes of t slaves he fosters them a d treats them often with the tenderness of his own children they multiply on his hands he cannot find employment for them and he is ultimately but most reluctantly and painfully compelled to part with some of them because of the increase of numbers and the want of occupation but to say that it is the purpose design or object of the slaveholder to breed slaves as he would breed domestic animals for a foreign market is untrue in fact and unkind to be imputed or ever intimated by any one and it is not by such reproachful epithets as lords of the loom lords of the plantation the slave power and the money power that this country is to be harmonized especially when we are debating upon these great measures which are essential to its onward progress and to its present and future pros perity and john davis submitted to this scourging as a plantation nigger would submit to a flogging from an overseer he uttered not a word what cause was there for clays grossly offensive attack we suppose that it is as notorious in spite of mr clays denial as any fact in the world that the breeding of slaves is madea business in some parts of the south a matter of calculationthe sale of human flesh and blood is such a fact too delicate to be alluded to at all oris the word breeding too offensive for delicate southern ears the word isa good one it expresses precisely the fact which traffic does not mr davis in trying to express hs meaning would no doubt choose words to suit his case and if he selected the word breeding he took the right word it he used that word and then expunged it and denied its use he is the meanest of cowards if he did not use it it was proper to say so but he should not have suffered clays offensive style of attack to pass without reply icjpwe give place to blacksons communicatioti with great pleasure we were not at the meeting alluded to and depended upon a friend for the sketch we made who we doubt not gave it as correctly as he could we have lived long enough to learn that no two men will report the same proceedings alike especially while there is excitement and such excitement as pre failed at the meeting we may aswell here say that it is the candid opinion among the white folks who were there that mr woodson was assailed without cause and that he acted more creditable than any of his opponents pittsburgh post mr editor l regret to see the remarks in the post of this morning respecting the meetings held in this city by frederick douglass under the heading trouble among the antislavery men the entire article i think will make a false impression with respect to the character of those meetings it is stated that the wylie street church was refused on sunday but on tuesday mr douglass and a large audience took possession of it now this sounds as if mr douglass and his friends without grant or permission had taken possession of the church when nothing could be further trom the fact in the case mr douglass had obtained the entire consent of the officers of the church for the use of the house in qnestion there was great noise and confusion there wasbut where out of doors caused by a woman i am informed who under the window of the church attempted to whip her poor drunken husband the noise and confusion should not therefore be set to the account of the meeting for my part considering that the noise was made so near the church i deem it quite surprising that the audience remained so quiet and orderly as they didi have to complain too that while the article in question speaks strongly in regard to the severity of mr douglass towards mr woodson it does not state with equal strength the cause which provoked that severity the complaint against mr w w r as not that he came into the meeting of mr dand charged him with infidel views but that he had done so in the absence of mr douglass and in such a manner as to deprive the latter of the opportunity to set himself right before the wilie street church and the public it was this seeming unfairness that roused ths indignation of the negro orator and called forth his withering denunciation your reporter states that there were one or two fights during the meeting in this statement there is not a word of truth except in the case above cited and with that the meeting had nothing whatever to do and is therefore by no means responsible for it by giving the above an insertion in your forthcoming edition you will oblige very respectfully peter blackson pittsburgh july th right is of no sex truth is of no color from the pittsburgh dispatch first of august celebration at pittsburgh the celebration of the first of august by the colored citizens was quite as orderly and well managed as any fourth of july celebration we have ever attended the heavy rain during the afternoon interrupted the proceedings for some time but they were resumed with nndiminished spirit after the bhe speeches were very goodthat jof mr munroe a colored episcopal rgynmu ot micingn xmoceae excited a high degree of interest among the white portion of the audience aswell as among the colored and he is evidently an able man a clearthink ing and powerful reasoner mr vashon read a very excellent letter from fred douglass declaring his total inability to attend able addresses were delivered by messrs peck freeman delany yashon and one or two other colored gentlemen and messrs s fol jambe r h kerr and general larimer also spoke briefly and eloquently in behalf of human liberty one unpleasant accident marred the pleasure of the day a son of rev munroe while playing with powder imprudently held his hands and face over the train and burned himself very badly hewas in great agony and his father finally took him up to the city to procure medical relief the following is the letter of mr douglass j b yashon my dear sirl have but just reached erie being hours performing the trip which i had expected to make in the space of thirty six and worse still i have to intorm you that there is no hope of my being able to get a passage from here to buffalo before five oclock this afternoon these circumstances should they prove as favorable as i hope forbid me longer to cherish the expectation of being present with my friends in pittsburg on the first of august i have been deceived and disappointed by the handbills of this canal line company they profess to convey passengers from beaver to erie in thirtysix hours and they often delay them on their journey full forty eight hours this gross imposition on the traveling public ought to be exposed and corrected the outrage ought not to be endured it makes all chance ot correct calculation and arrangemorvt out nf tim tiinn and throngs the travellers pathway with vexatious disappointments i have no language to express my regrets at the prospects now before mei feel the disappointment all the more keenly because the hope of being present at your celebration seemed to have the approbation of all past circumstances and arrangements i was released from my engagement at pennyan tnat i might goto medina i was released from medina by the offer of my friend mr langston to fill that appointment but now all my plans have failed and my ardent hopes are so far as i can see entirely defeated it is rendered nearly certain that i cannot be present in pittsburg at the grand celebration and that the pleasure of mingling my voice with the exulting multitude will be denied to me the only consolation now left me is that i can still be with you on that occasion in spirit aim and principle that though time and distance have mutually interposed their insurmountable barriers against my botfiiy presence that neither can eusiuve absolutely the free spirit this impalpable essence this mysterious agent this spark of the divine mind is free and is all that can give freedom to an enslaved world no fetters can bind itno walls can imprison it like the quick flash of electric fire in the sky it can defy

gladly my dear sir would i give utterance to other sentiments ir connection with the occasion but i knowhow tame in the ear of an assembly are letters when the living speaker is before it with a heart

frederick douglass from the christian citizen colored sons of temperance there sometimes occur circumstances so anomalous so incongruous so utterly monstrous in the action of societies which wear phylacteries on their foreheads inscribed with virtuous professions that they tempt one to doubt the verity of logic and to question the existence of a human moral nature we say human moral nature because the beasts of the field never manifest so mean a quality of instinct as are some of the manifestations of the instincts of their human brothers who have perhaps been cradled on the knees of christian mothers and whose schooling has cost the state fifty dollars each the national division of the sons of temperance at their late annual convention in boston voted seventysix to six that it is improper and illegal to admit colored men into the general union perhaps this verdict stands unparalleled in the history of opinion for cool insolence and for moral atrocity wo defy egyptian jew greek roman scythian or south carolinian to produce a parellel verdict to it within the whole compass of their history the motto of the sons of temperance is love purity fidelity these are the trinity of splendid abstractions which they print upon their banners and which they solemnly accept as the ideal of their moral life the great majority of these sons of temperance are northern men all of them are professing republicans and yet their national division their amphictyon their federal council has proposed a resolution that would have made pharaoh blush and nicholas of russia to hang his head for shameseventy six members ofthis national division of republican sons of temperance stand forward not as the spaniels of the south not as the apologists of slavery not as despots of politics nor despots of social estate but in the hitherto unheard position of despots to virtue we believe that the world was not previously aware that virtuous principles possessed certain proper colors and certain legal proprieties until the teetotal syllogists assembled at boston propounded this new gospel ofpro priety and legality if we construe the word propriety as decency and legality as natural right perhaps there might be something of truth and justice discovered in this unique verdict but it would not redound to the advantage of paleface jury the positive indecency of their inhuman decision deprives themselves of the rights of humanity and their unhallowed proposition of legality which is opposed to all gods moral laws cuts them off from legal fellowship with every true man our colored brethren have been driven from the ballotbox and contumeliously expelled from the railway car and the church pew and now here are men seeking to aggravate those crimes and god is the father of us all and all men are brethren insults by ostracising them from the peoples moral unions we ask ever man of heart everyman who has not been utterly contaminated by the logic of the south to look this vote of the national division of the sons of temperance steadily in the face and then to ask himself if this new aristocracythis aristocracy of moral pretensionit is to be tolera in this land arc men because cne perhaps of african mingles s v n ghths ui their caucasian i j jo be driven from amongst us and a participation in virtuous action with us upon account of this think on the treason even according to the logic of captain rynders of condemning seven eights of an anglosax on to bondage to insult and to fashionable infamy became a portion of that blood that flowed in the heart of cleopatra flows in his veins we grow sad as we contemplate the obliquity of moral vision that condemns us to review this most inhuman vote which denies to our colored brethren all participation in the spread of moral virtue and in the elevation of man kind we take heart again and thank god however that the justice of massachusetts is true to humanity in this case although the national division has been faithless the district sections have calmly nobly manfully repudiated this decision of the national division and have reproved its seventy six members with the most courteous but at the same most effective of all reproofsthey have refused to sustain their decree this vote is as humiliating if we examine it collaterally as it is so positively positively it demonstrates an amount of prejudice against color in the north that even seeks to poison with its stagnant odors our very benevolent unions and it shows a subserviency to the dictation of the south that is truly saddening such verdicts as this cannot degrade men of color they rather make the red blood mount into the cheek of white men at the moral debasement of their race virtue knows no clime no condition no race no order as the negro arose from the hand of god an equal in the economy of the creation with the white man so did god give him an equal power and right to accept those virtues which sprang from the affluence of his divine mind god placed in the soul of the negro an eternal and fclfovitable legality or natural right to iove virtue and liberty and ho will forever acknowledge the beautiful propriety of that love even although every man should endorse a counter lie god before the world was decreed a law stronger than any opinion that the national division of tho sons of temperance has dared or wiil ever dare to propose and that law is the essential equality of man and the universal brotherhood of virtue by this decree eternal as the heavens it is legal it is proper for colored men to unite with all other men to elevate humanity in spite of such inhuman treason as was perpetrated by the national division of the sons of temperance of boston thine respectfully the outrage in virginia we trust that the ancient dominion will not allow the injury done to the sovereignty ot the laws in that state by the horrible outrage at cul pepper to pass without the signal exhibition of its retribution the tone of the press in that state is sound in regard to mob law and we hope ic reflects but the sober sentiment of the people in respect to such acts of fiendish barbarity justices ot the peace and members of christian churches wereengaged in this diabolical murder then let them meet the murderers fate their respectability and presumed intelligence but aggravate the enormity of their crime and leave them no excuse to offer for their daring usurpation law must be vindicated against such terrible invasions of its prerogative or society falls back into an archy culpepper co va july messrs editors on the night of the th of april one of our most respectable and promising young men mr david w miller merchant at this place was most barbarously murdered and his store robbed a free negro named win grayson was arrested committed to prison tried before an intelligent jury found guilty and sentenced to be hung our judge approving of the verdict refused to grant a new trial which was applied for by graysons counsela bill of exceptions was then taken and tried before the general court at richmond and a new trial was granted in may last grayson was again laid before a jury summoned mostly from another county one of the jury was from the state of illinois and another from baltimore and it was now presumed he could have a fair and impartial hearing he was again found guilty and again sentenced to be hung another bill of exceptions was laid before the general court and another new trial was granted this was more that the patience of the people could bear for though the evidence was entirely circumstantial yet so complete was every link forming one entire chain and so clearly was the guilt of the prisoner established that they determined to take the law into their own hands accordingly on the th inst a plan wjis set on foot to call a meetiag of the citizens and on the next day whole no the th from tioo to met at a church near the court hou which meeting resulted n their

counties that it is feared it will grow tobe a very serious matter and from being graysons case it will turn to the peoples case important development treasonable project i lie washington correspondent of the courier and enquirer in a letter dated august d makes the following startling development of a project to dissolve the union and form a southern confederacy which should embrace the republic of mexico the facts which i am about to disclose will necessarily excite as much astonishment throughout the country as they did in my mind when they were first presented with all the intrinsic evidence of undoubted truth and with a weight of direct authority which admitted of no misapprehension i learn from an unquestionable source that a gentleman reported to be of considerable character and influence in the visited mexico incognito in the month of april last and after various conferences with persons in authorityfinally submitted a formal and wellprepared proposition for the establishment of a southern confederacy into which that republic was to be merged one of the arguments and reasons that were urged upon the persons to whom this scheme was submitted as entitling it to favorable consideration was that the city of mexico would probably be selected as the capital of the new empire since a part of the plan embraced the extension of its territory peaceably or forcibly further south that project was laid before the mexican cabinet by m la conza the minister of foreign affairs and was urged by him in council in a speech of considerable length it was resisted brother membersof the cabinet and finally declined the agent of this nefarious cheme left soon after for california mr doyle the british minister was made aware of the proceedings if ho did not lend them countenance but the impression is that the conspiracy received decided encouragement from the british legation i am restrained by considerations affecting the personal safety of individuals from disclosing the reasons which operated on the mexican cabinet in rejecting this infamous overture and also of doing justice to those who entitled themselves to immortal honor for scorning and denouncing the proposition of the traitors the day may not be far distant when they can receive full justice and with less danger than at present president taylor was not ignorant of this design and with his usual sagacity and resolution had provided against injurious consequences it might be mooted as a serious question whether it is not the duty of our government to demand of mexico whether a scheme for its dismemberment was thus entertained undertake to say emphatically and unqualifiedly such is my confidence in the information which has been placed at my disposal so far as the great fact is concerned that this movement may b verified in every essential particular that have stated if congress or the execntive department will direct the necessary inquiries to be instituted if the proot was questionable in any form i would not entertain it but having seen the testimony i have felt not only justified but impelled by a sense of moral obligation in giving this statement to the public j e s battle week tuesday june was the anniversary of the memorable battle of waterloo and the current week is not worthy for the aniversary of more bloody and important battles fought within some two cenuries past than any other seven days of the year the battle of naseby between the cavaliers and roundheada was fought june of the russian and swedes at poultowa june of the allies and french at dettingen june of the austrians and prussians at kolin june of the americans and british at bunker hill june of the russians and french at frebbia june of the same at marengo june  and again at friedlands june of the british and french at salamanca june of the british and americans at niagara june of the french and prussians at ligny june and lastly of the british and french at waterloo june it would be easy to show that in most of these terrible fights something decisive has been gained to the great cause of civil liberty and that thus the entire week is made up of redletter days in the calender of freedom none are so hard to please as those whom satiety of pleasure makes weary of themselves nor any so readily provoked as those who have been always courted with an emulation of civility sir robert peel as an orator sir robert peels speeches were like himself in practical there eloquence consisted in their persuasiveness in the skill with which the arguments were evolved and in the illustrations generally familiar and tangible to the general his statements of his case were singularly lucid built up laboriously and constructed with precision so as to make them clear to the least ready capacity during the latter years of his career ho had as it were to instruct the public in pi inciples and details more especially on commercial questions and of course there remains much on record which had only a temporary and fleeting interest morover to impress his purpose on his hearers he would frequently repeat his arguments whicn though effective in the delivery was teadious to peruse notwithstanding these drawbacks sir robert peel from the singular fascination of his manner and the pains he took to adapt himself to the various capacities he had to address was one of the most persuasive and influential speakers ofhis time in fact his was the eloquence adapted to a popular assembly which was to be assailed not merely through prejudices habits of thought interests not always of the highest order as well as through reason looking at the materials of which his speeches were formed the winning art of the speaker was the more to be admired let us add that when the ordinary necessities of the debate did not compel sir robert peel to descend to tne level of tho average of his hearers he could be as lofty and philosophical as the most elaborate orators his personal vindications at great crises of his life were characterised by a striking dignity which uniformly commanded respect from the house of commons such a combination of qualitiesof wisdom the fruit of long experienceof caution the consequence not of timidity but of prudenceof boldness tempered by sagacity of information gleaned through a long and laborous public life of high probity and sensitive honor of statesmanlike tvisdom not disdaining popular influence and sympathy of eloquence spontaneously springing from the peculiar wants of his position and intuitively adapted to the occasions of its excercisesuch a rare union of many requisites for a statesman and minister in a popular government will not soon be seen again in anv individual nowhere will his loss be more deplored than in that house of commons where he was accustomed o rule by the power of his persuasive eloquence with almost absolute sway morning chronicle w b s the worlds changes oh spirit of change cold is

the united states which not having been answeied by him came to my hands on his death and i also transmit a copy of the answer which i have felt it to be my duty to cause to be made to that communicatihn congress will perceive that the governor of texas officially states that by authority of the legislature of that state he despatched a special commissioner with full power and instructions to extend the civil jurisdiction of the state over the unorganized counties of el paso worth presido and santa fe situated on its northwestern limits he proceeds to say that the commissioner had reported to him in an official form that the military officers employed in the service ol the u s stationed at santa fe interposed adversely with the inhabitants to the fulfilment of his object and in favor of the establishment of a separate state government east of the rio grande within the rightful limits of the state of texas these four counties which texas proposes to establish and organize being within her own jurisdiction extended over the whole of the territory east of rio giande which has been heretofore regarded e ar osential and integral part of the departmentof new mexico and actually governed and possessed by her people until conquered and severed from the republic of mexico by the american arms the legislature of texas has been called together by the governor for the purpose as is understood of maintaining her claim to the territory east of the rio grande and of establishing over it her own jurisdiction and her own laws by force these proceedings of texas may well arrest the attention of all branches of ihe government of the united states and rejoice that they occur while congress is yet insession a crisis may be brought on which shall summon the two houses of congress and still more directly the executive government to an immediate performance of their respective duties under the constitution of the united states the president is constituted commander inchief of the army and navy and of the militia of the several states when called into the actual service of the united states the constitution declares also that lie shall take care of that the laws be faithfully executed and that he shall from time to time give to congress information of the state of the union congress has power under the constitution to provide for calling out the militia to execute the laws of the union and suitable and appropriate acts of congress have been passed as well for providing for calling forth the militia as for placing other suitable and efficient means in the hands of the president to enable him to discharge the constitutional functions of his office the second section of the act of the th of february declares that whenever the laws of the united state shall be opposed or their execution obstructed in any state by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or the power vested in the marshals the president may call forth the militia so far as may be necessary to suppress such combinations and to cause the laws to be duly executed bv the act of march d it is

authorities and it becomes a case in which it is the duty of the president either to call out the militia or to employ the military or naval force of the united states or udo both if in his judgment exigency of the occasion shall so require for the purpose ot suppressing such combination the constitutional duty of the president is plain ano peremtory the authority vested in him bylaw for the performance of his duty is clear and ample texas as a states is authorizec to maintain her own laws so far as they are not repugnant to the constitution laws and treaties of the united states to suppress insurrections against her authority and to punish those who commit treason against the state according to the forms provided by her own constitution and her own laws but this power is local and confined entirely within the limits of texas herself she can fiossiby confer no authority which can be awfully exercised beyond her own boundary all this is plain and hardly needs argument or elucidation if texas militia tliereiore march into any one of the other states or into any territory of the united states thereto execute or enforce any law of texas they beeome at that moment trespassers they are no longer under the protection of any law ful authority and are to be regarded merely as intrudes and if within such state or territory they obstruct any law of the united slates either py f rce of arms or mere power of numbers constituting such a combination as is too powerful to be suppressed by the civil authority the president of the united states has no option left to him but is bound to obey the solemn injunction of the constitution and exercise the high powers vested in him by that instrument and by the acts of congressor if any civil posse armed or unarmed enter into anv territory of the united states under the protection of the laws thereof with the intention to seize individuals to be cairied elsewhere for trial for alleged offences and this posse be too powerful to be resisted by the local and civil authorities such seisure or attempt to seize is to be prevented or resisted by the authorities of the united slates the grave and important question now arises whether there be in the territory of new mexico any existing law of the united states opposition to which or obstruction of w hich would constitute a case calling for the interposition of the authority vested in the president the constitution of the united states declares that the constitution and laws of the united statas which shall be made in pursuance thereof and all the treaties made or which shall be made under the authority of the united states shall be the supreme law of the land if therefore new mexico be a territory of the united states and if any treaty stipulation be in force therein such treaty stipulation is the supreme law of the land and is to be maintained and upheld and accordingly in the letter to the governor of texas my reasons are given for believing that new mexico is now a territory of the united states with the same extent and the same boundaries which belonged te it in the actual possession of the republic of mexico and before the late war in the early part of that war both california and new mexico were conquered by the arms of the united states and were in the military possession of the united states at the date of the treaty of peace by that treaty the title by conquest was confirmed and these territories provinces or departments separated from mexico forever and by the same treaty certain important rights and securities were solemnly guaranteed to the inhabitants residing therein by the fifth article of the treaty it is declared that the boundary line between the two republics shall commence in the gulf of mexico three leagues from land opposite the mouth of the rio grande otherwise called the rio bravo del norte or oppusite the mouth of its deepest branch if it should make more than one branch emptying directly into the sea from thence up the middle of that river following the deepestchannel where it has more than one to the point where it strikes the southern boundary of new mexico thence westwardly along the whole southern boundary of new mexico which runs north of the town called paso to its western boundary termination thence westward along the western line of new mexico until it intersects the first branch of the river gifa or if it should not inleisect any branch of that liver then to the point on the said line nearest to such branch and thence in a direct line to the same thence down the middleiof said branch and of the said river until it empties into the rio colorado thence across the colorado following the division line between upper and lower california to the pacific ocean the bth article of this trea yis in the following terms the inhabitants of mexican origin now established in territories previously belonging to mexico and who remain for the future within the limits of the united states shall be free to continue where they now reside or to remove at any time to the mexican republic retaining the property which they possess in the said territory or disposing thereof and removing the proceeds wherever they please without being subjected on this account to any contribution lax or charge whatever those who shall prefer to remain in the said territories may either retain the tittle and rights of mexican citizens or acquire those of citizens of the united states hut they shall be under obligation to make their election within one year from the date of the exchange of ratifications of this treatv and whesthroaiaifrm itie said territories after the expiration of that yej without having declared their intention to retain the character of mexicans shall be considered to have elected to become citizens of the united states in the said territories property of every kind now belonging to mexicans not established there shall be inviolate the present owners their heirs and all mexicans who may hereafter acquire said property by contract shall enjoy with respect to it guarantees equally ample as if the same belonged to citizens of the united states the th article of the treaty is in these words the mexicans who in the territories aforesaid shall not preserve the character of citizens of the mexican republic conformably with what is stipulated in the preceding article shall be incorporated into the union of the united states and be admitted at the proper time to be judged of by the congress of the united states to the enjoyment of all the tights of citizens of the united states according to the principles of the constitution andin the meantime shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property and secured in the free exercise of their religion without restriction it is plain therefore in the face of these treaty stipulations that all mexicans established in territories north or east ot the line of demarcation already mentioned come within the protection of the th article and that the treaty being a part of the supreme law of the land extends over all such mexicans and assures to them perfect security in the free enjoyment of their liberty and property and in the free exercise of their religion and this supreme law of ihe land isin actual force over this terriiory and is tobe maintained until it shall be displaced or superseded by other legal provisions or obstructed by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the civil authority this case is one which comes within the provisions of the law and which obliges the president to enforce these provisions neither the constitution nor the laws nor iny duty or my oath of office leave me any alternative or any choice of ray action the executive government of the united states has no power or authority to determine what was the true line of boundary between mexico and the united states before the treaty of guada loupe hidalgo nor has it any such power now since the question has become one between the state of texas and the united states so far as this boundary is doubtful that doubt should be removed by some act of congress to which the assent of texas maybe necessary by some appropriate mode of legal adjudication but in the meantime if disturbances or collisions arise or should be threatened it is absolutely incumbent on the executive government however painful the duty to take cate that the laws are faithfully maintained he can regard only the actual state of things existing in the date of the treaty and is bound to protect all inhabitants who were then established and now remain north and east of the line of demarcation in the full enjoyment of their liberties and property according to the provisions the th article of the treaty in other words all now regarded as new mexico which was possessed and occupied as new mexico by the citizens of new mexico at the date of the treaty until a definite line of boundary shall be established and by competent authority this assertion of duty to protect the people of new mexico from threatened violence or from liability to be earned into iexas for trial for alleged offences against texan laws does not at ail include any claim of oower on the part of the executive to establish any civil or military government within that territory that power belongs exclusively to the legislative department and congress is the sole judge of the time and manner of creating or authorising any such government the duty oi the executive only applies to the execution of laws and the maintenance of treaties actually in force and the protection of all the people of the united states in the enjoyment of the lights which those treaties and laws guarantee it is exceedingly desirable that no occasion should arise for the exercise of the powers thus vested in the president by the constitution and the laws with whatever mildness those powers might be executed or however clear the case of necessity yet might nevertheless follow which no human sagacity can foresee have thus laid before congress the communication of his excellency the governor of texas and the answer thereto and i have made such observations as have thought the occasion called for respecting constitutional obligations which may arise in the future progress of things and may devolve on me to discharge i hope i shall not be regarded as stepping aside from the line of my duty notwithstanding i am aware that the subject is now before both houses if i express my deep and earnest conviction of the importance of an immediate decision oi arrangement for the settlement of the question of the boundary between texas and the territory of new mexico all considerations of justice general expediency and domestic tranquility call for this it seems to be in its character and by position the first or one of the first of the questions growing out of the acquisition of california and new mexico cannot be made either a state or a territory until it shall be first ascertained what new mexico is and what are her limits and boundaries these cannot be fixed or known fill the line of division between her and texas shall be ascertained and established numerous and weighty reasons conspire in my judgement to show that this divisional line should be established by congress with the assent of the sweriv ment of texas in the first place this seems by far the most prompt mode of proceeding by which the end can be accomplished if judicial proceedings were resorted to such proceedings would necessarily be slow anct years would pass by in all probability before the controversy could be ended so great a delay in this case is to be avoided if possible such delay would he every way inconvenient and might be the occasion of disturbances and collisions for the same reason would with the utmost defence to the wisdom of congress express a doubt of the expediency of the appointment of commissioners and of examination estimate and award of indemnity to be made by them this would be but a species of arbitration which might last as long as a suit at law so fat as lam able to comprehend the general facts are now all known and congress is as capable of deciding it justly and properly now as it probably would be after the report of the commissioners if the claim of title on the part of texas appears to be well founded in the whole or part it is in the competency of congress to offer her an indemnity for the surrender of the claim in a case lik this surrounded as it is by many cogent considerations all calling for an amicable adjustment and immediate settlement the states would be justified in my opinion in allowing an indemnity to texas not unreasonable or extravagant but lair liberal and awarded in a just spirit of accommodation think no event would be hailed with more gratification by the people of the united states than the amicable adjustment of these difficult questions which have for a long time agitated the country and occupied to the exclusion of other subjects the time and attention of congress having thus freely communicated the result of my own reflection on the most advisable mode of adjusting this boundary question shall nevertheless cheerfully acquiesce in any other mode which the wfisdom of congress may devise and in conclusion repeat try conviction that every consideration of the public interest manifests the necessity of a provision by congress for a settlement of this boundary question before the present session be brought to a close the settlement of other questions connected with the same subject within the same period is greatly to be desired but the adjustment of this appears to me to be ia thefiighest degveo important in the tram of such an adjustment we may well hope there will follow a return of bamm ny and good will an increased attachment t the union and the general satisfaction ofik country

represented in mexico by a volunteer regiment composed of as fine young men as the slate afforded in fact the state took special pride in this regiment and great care was taken in selecting the men for it now it is well known to many who served in the th or newengland regiment that in the battle of churubusco this carefully chosen regiment of south carolina palmettos had a most uncomfortable

frederick douglass and the timesmr douglass has addressed ihe following intelligent and manly letter to the times sir although i fear it may be an unwarrantable intrusion upon your lime and attention on my part i must yield to the strong desire which moves me to tiiank you in the name of and humanity lor your timely remarks in the of june th on the subject of americamselavery and more especially for your animadversions on the brutal assault made upon me by a mob while i w quietly and inoffensively walking on the b teiy at new york the influence exerted upon the more telligent class of the american people by t judicious expression of british sense of ju tice and humanity is immense and i belie highly beneficial the outrage committed upon me in ne fork was the work of low and vicious pe pie yet sir you were perfectly right taking that outrage and the remarks mat upon it by the globe as a far illustration the bitter antipathy which is entertained her even by the better class of white peop against colored persons polished ameiica gentlemen wmuld applaud a deed ofrufflanis like theone in question although they mig shrink fiom the performance of the deed self my offence is alleged to be that of waling down broadway in company of twovvhi women this however is not a fair stat ment of that offence my offence was that walked down broadway in company wit white persons on terms of equality had been with those persons simply as a servan and not as a friend i should have been regarded with complacency by the refined ant with respect by the vulgar class of white pe sons who throng that great thoroughfare the clamor here about human equality meaningless we have here an aristocrac of skin with which if a man be coveied ant can keep out of the state prisons he possesses the high privilege or insulting a colored man with the most ferfect impunity thi class of aristocrats are never more dispieaset than when they meet with an intelligent co ored man they recognise in him a contradiction to their ungenerous and unsound theories respecting the negro race and not being able to reason him down to a level wit the brute they use brute force to knock him down to the desired level i am perhaps trespassing too long upon your time ant although it may be a small matter to you as to how may feel with respect to your noble defence of injured and insulted humanity could not be satisfied with myself without expressing in my humble way my sincerest gratitude for that defence we have takenthe above from the london inquirer and the latter doubtless copied it from the london times the letter was not originally intended for publication but simply for the editor of the times for whom we experienced the grateful feelings indicated in that letter their ptompt and able article which was published a few weeks since exposing to the world the infamous conduct of a band of cowardly ruffians on the battery in new york and the still more ruffianly tone of the new york press ou the subject of that conduct was so noble that poor as are the thanks of a slave we felt encouraged to offer them since the london times has taken up the subject several other highly respectable and influential british journals have denounced the cruel brutal and barbarous attack upon us among these we gratefully remember the london standard of freedom and the london inquirer each of these papers has made that outrage the occasion for highly intelligent comments upon american customs civilization and freedom f did we have received the following aiticle from our esteemed friend mrs henry richardson of newcastleupontyne her time and talents are now almost entirely devoted to the h ree labor cause such industiy devotion and perseverance as hers cannot be employed in any cause without attracting attention we are indebted to her zeal and untiring pen for many important facts bearing on the subject of free produce although we do not attach the first importance to this branch of the antislavery movement we readily lay befoie our readeis such facts on the subject as may be found in the following article f d cotton from portnatajan influential colonist and mercantile gentleman has addressed a letter of which the following isa copy to an inhabitant of newcastleupon tyne and as the subject of his communication is of vital importance to a great staple manufacture of this country we gateshead observer gladly give it insertion in our journal port natal march knowing that you take a great interest in the production of cotton produced by free labor i have thought that a few lines from natal would not be unacceptable though i am sorry to slate as far as that article is concerned it is rather retrograding than progressing and yet i am more than ever convinced that cotton can be produced here equal if not superiot to any in the world and that if cultivated on a proper scale by persons who understand the climate and the peculiar nature of the cotton plant it would yield aa large return for capital employed besides throwing open a most beautiful country to the enterprise of thousands of european families who through the means of this one article alone would find employment at iheir various callings but lam grieved beyond measure to see vessel after vessel arriving w r ith emigrants most or all of whom are totally unfit for an undertaking like this to give you a slight idea of the absurd notions formed in england by many i may just mention that itis not an uncommon thing to find individuals provided with agricultuaal implements and actually on their arrival here have not the means to pay for the conveyance of them to their land they appear never to have thought that implements were of no use without cattle and that months must elapse before they could expect a return for their labor then there are certain difficulties that discourage otheusuch as being afraid of not getting native labor all new comers find a difficulty in getting natives they spoil them in the first instance by overkindness and not knowing their natural character soon find themselves without a servant so convinced am i that cotton will be a profitable article to cultivate besides the immense good that will result from it in a variety of ways have thought that should you know any party that would be inclined to invest from one thousand to fifteen hundred pounds in this way leaving the entire management to myself i would on certain conditions give up the business i have rn town lei my premises and devote the whole o tsy uib tu j energy to this one object this lam certain ot r m a one j successful enterprising individual can show good returns for his mitay there will soon be plenty of followers but for tiew comers with little or no meansno experience of the place and everything new about them the diffij culties appear insurmountable should mv offer be approved of by any of your friends my proposition would be thisthat not lessi than one thousand or rather say fifteen hundred pounds should be placed in the cape of good hope bank at my disposal forme to draw as occasion may require for this efipecial purpose purchasing land and carrying on the plantation tho finest land for cotton is on the other side of theumgeni river where at the present moment i could purchase for cash the finest cotton land foi s or s per acre the land i would of course have registered m the partys name who advanced the cash in fact all business of importance such as yearly or halfyearly accounts and reports i should wish to pass through the hands of mrd d buchanan who is an attorney of the highest respectability here or any other person that might be thought fit and would be satisfactory to all parties should wish to purchase not less than six or eight hundred acres from one tree of the greenseed variety that i have growing in anything hut agood situation neqr my house i have gathered full six and a half pounds annually for the last ihree yearsabout three pounds the first year six pounds of cotton as it comes from the tree yields two pounds of cotton one thousand such trees can be grown on an acre of ground and there must be some cause for it if they should only produce half that quantity however for safety i shall make my calculation on one pound only of clean cotton instead of more than two though i am persuaded that where there is a right selection of soil and the seasons are favourable for both crops two housand pounds of clean coton will sometimes be produced to the acre tou yiust observe that all the principal expenses fall in the first year afterwards the profits i trust will be very great these expenses however all tend to increase the value of the properly lam not an advocate for putting up temporary buildings but should use rough stone procured on the spot and should wish j to have fluted galvanized iron for the roof farj warded whhout delay as it cannot always he procured here there are also some other articles which there might be a saving inshipping direct to natal no person in natal lias taken moie interest in this subject than myself and should any of your friends be inclined to further the cultivation of free labour cotton and the interests of natal am prepared to give good security if required lor the due fulfilment on my pait of the engagement having valuable property both in town and near the town should my offer be accepted the first year i should expect a salary of lo after the first year i shall be contented with half the net profits allowing soo for the purchase of land i have calculated that there would not be much less than seven or eight hundred pounds expenses the first yedr after which the expenses would be triflingservants wages almost the only thing the first years crop t calculate at oz clean cotton to each tree which at d per lb supposing i should get acres sown the return would he os bd oi s d per acre the second year acres or two hundred thousand trees at one pound

deathpenalty and advocate of the satqe staled as an argument in its favor that in michigan the experiment of its abolution had been tried and proved a failure the legislature having been competed to restore the penalty in consequence of the alarming increase of capital crime resulting from its abolition doubting the correctness of this statement i immediately addressed a note to the secretary of

yours a g campbell lowell may office of the secretary of state lansing mich may t alfred gibbs campbell esq dear sir your favor of the th ult is before me you desire to ascertain whether our state has ie turned to the practice of the deathpenalty also my opinion as to the general sentiment of our state with our present experience on this subject in reply i would state that our state has not returned to the practice of the deathpen alty it has repealed at the time of the revision of our statutes of there has been but one attempt to revive the law that was in i think and it signally failed on examination of the journal i cannot find that the question was ever brought to a vote in either house in reply to your second interrogatory i have no hesitation in giving it as my opinion that the general sentiment of our state is beyond all question very nearly unanimous in favor of our present laws on that subject indeed in the whole range of my acquaintance i do not know one individual in favor of a return to that practice i am certain i have beard no one ex pi ess himself in favor of such a change i am not aware of there being any statistics on file on this office bearing upon this question by coincidence merely there were committed in wayne county within two vears from the revision jour murders the grand jury of that county memorialized the legislature in favor of a repeal counter memorials showed most conclusively that the increase of capital crime startling indeed as it was could not have had any connection with the change in the law as in three out of the four eases certainly the criminals knew not of the change since that time three certainly has been no increase of capital crime very respectfully yours c taylor sec of state from the liberator anniversary of

westminster and james b whitecomb of brooklyn ct secretaries samuel may jr of leicester and benjamin snow jr of fitchburg mr garrison on taking the chair made some introductory remarks referring chiefly to the great event this day celebrated the peaceful emancipation of near one million of slaves accomplished without the shedding of one master s blood or the destroying of one plantation without any act of violence or anv civil commotionwhen he concluded the audience united in singing a jubilee sonr samuel may jr followed with some statements in relation to the business concerns of the meeting and then proceeded to lay before the audience evidence of the good effects of west india emancipation elicited by geo w alexander in his recent visit to those islands charles c burleigh followed with a most eloquent impressive exposition of the working of emancipation in the west indies rev mr carpenter of bristol england was then introduced by the and made a very appropriate spirited and pointed address in the course of which he made said work with the arguments of the opponents of emancipation as drawn from its operation in the west indies he had heard it said by them that lamaica was not so well cultivated as it ought to be but he had also heard it said that the emancipated slaves weie not the laziest people there were in that island in allusion to ihe argument that the exports of the west indies had diminished he said he had a great jealousy of exports and when he saw pigs imported into his own city of bristol he saw in that not an evidence of the redundance of pigs in ireland but of the suffer ngs ot ihe people from whose necessities they were drawn when he concluded another hymn was sung mr carpenter again rose and said the tune that had just been sung was one of their national anthemsthey call it god save ihe qeen we cal it america there is another tune called emancipation sun this day in chorus by souls and he hoped the time was near at hand when it would besung by three millions in our own land charles l remond then made some hopeful remarks on the indications of the times and the meeting adjourned till oclock in the afternoon able and eloquet speech rs were made by edmund quincy wendell phillips stephen s foster and j b syme in which the question of emancipation was placed upon its true ground of an absolute tight on the part of the oppressed and an absolute duty on the part ot the oppressor and of those who have ths power of contributing jereto slave property the following statement made by a baltimore correspondent of the tribune illustrates an influence at workjiu the middle slave states more potential than abolition lectures or incendiary pamphleteering to effect the rapid extinction of slavery within their borders slaveholders cannot afford to hold property long which has to be insured at such premiums the papers from western virginia western maryland and the eastern shore counties teem with advertisements ef rewards for runaway slaves the difficulty ot recapturing runaways has increased the amount generally offered vety much soo and each being very common am informed by a slavecatcher and dealer that ihe loss of slave property this spring ani summer from maryland and virginia ger than at any former peiiod he showed me a list of advertisements he had arranred in his note book for

beinjr reeovered n y evangelist id vm lloyd garrison says t tlie specious dictatorial claptrap audaaious and profligate speech of clay on the compromise bin demonstrates that the old harry i still in him important from washington arrest and imprisonment of william l chaplin the announcement that william l chaplin has been arrested and is in prison in the capital on a charge of assisting slaves to escape fiom slavery will fall with stunning effect upon vast numbers of the people of new york and new england among whom he has long been distinguished as a talented and devoted advocate of human rights v e have not yet obtained the particulars of this appalling and heartsickening affair enough however is known to assure us that another victim has fallen into the revengeful cruel and remorseless jaws of slavery and that that victim is none other than the talented warmhearted and zealous friend of humanity just named his case comes home to every heart we have seen him heard him and know him and if our brother had been seized at our side by a ferocious tiger we could not feel more keenly than we now do for william l chaplin he is charged with a high enme even that of delivering the spoiled out of the hand of the spoilerof ptactically remembering those in bonds as being bound with themdoing to others as he would be done untoall high crimes in this christian and democratic country for which it is almost impossible to find adequate punishments as to what will be the fate of mr chaplin the prospect seems now too darktoo fearful to contemplate there is every reason to believe that he will be made another meal to feed the hungry and bloodthirsty revenge of the slaveholding south he is too distinguished a mark to be allowed to escape the inhuman clutches of slavery yet something ought to be done if money can bail him it should be forthcoming but if this will not do there should bepetitions circulated in all directions remonstrating against his imprisonment on such a charge and the authorities of the district of columbia should be waited upon by thousands and respectfully informed that if the prison doors are not thrown open the walls of their infernal slave dungeons shall be stormed the time has come for action it remains to be seen whether there is sufficient manhood and heroic love of liberty left at the north to meet the present trying crisis the ground which every rightminded man will take in respect to the matter is this that william l chaplin is guiltv of no crime that if he assisted slaves to escape as charged he has but performed a highly meritorious and christian act that instead of being branded with the infamy of a slavestealer his name should be made glorious as a manrestorer that they alone are nrenstealers who hold buy and sell men women aud children as property the imprisonment of wm l chaplin otlghv arouse the dormant energies of every ln he land it should call forth one simultaneous and burst of unconsolabse lament and settled indignation we cannot write about it the event is too painful too monstrously cruel and de mands something more than longue or pen can express we wish to consult cooperate unite act do something which shall look like saving a noble man from the wolfish and bloody prowlers of slavery to this end we shall go and do now call upon all in whose hearts there is one spark of human freedom to go to cazenoviaon wens day and thursday next we expect to meet there one of the mightiest antislavery gatherings that ever congregated in the state of sew york f d from the liberty party paper great meeting of runaway slaves at cazenovia those thailhave escaped from slavery and those who mean to escape from it and those who think it right for men to escape from it and those who will help men to escape from it and all men who think human rights are the true capital of the country will meet in caucus at cazenovia on the stand d days of august in respect to the call of gerrit smith president of the n y state vigilance committee there let douglass and ward and bibb milton clark and box brown and william and ellen ciaft c c who are cleat of the chains with which southern villainy bound their infant limbs meet the panting fugitives who have just escaped and all together vith their white sympathisers let them mingle their congratulations and engage in wise council to break every yoke to free every slave in jhis outraged country come up to cazenovia on the st and stay through the d and what true democracy and jrue politics are ye deluded partisans of the state and ye demagogues and deceivers of the people come and look on and in the light of nobleness and true virtue which will be there see your own meanness and demerits and leatn to leap up from the degradation of the places you occupy or aspire to occupy to true manhood this should be a great gathering and from the making for it from the novel character and signal ability of the persons to be present it cannot but be a great meeting the mighty minds and great hearts of the north which have broke from the shackles of fa se religion and false government at the noith will meet there the rinrgeu bodies and daring spirits which slaverycoum not subdue which broke its shackles at thv south and plunged into the mountains and streams and lakes and wildernesses and found a way here where a slave is hailed as a man and embraced as a there has never been such a convention before called in this country not in the world perhaps it is not long that it has been safe to hold such a convention it is safe now thank god in spite of daniel webster and moses stuart and others like them let daniel webster and moses stuart and others like them come too if they dare and attempt to capture hind and give back to a chnstless heathenism the emancipated bodies and spirits which will be there congregated let them come and dare to interrrupt the deliberations of this convention under a pretend ot a law or constitution that overrides heavens law and asserts that those noble spirits are the property of men who tby virtue of law or constitucpn may ride them through the world and bruijfy them erase gods image which he has put upon them and place their own names there and turn them into their fields and stalls and kennels as they do their hogs and horses and dogs should they come we think they will cor xect their notions of law in the face of the flashing eyes and burning hearts and strong frames and iron sinews there assembled about the body of freedom let the senators and congressmen also come who propose to compromise the rights and liberties of the glorious hand of slaves who shall collect there and in the presence of the t selfemancipated bodies and their faces heavenlit with the alternative liberty or death nd l ie p re senceof the old bodyguards of ai erican freedom who will be gathered around fhem decide whether they can again by any agreement plan or compromise lay liberty in a quiet grave anywhere in this country but we especially urge them to come to lay on the altar of freedom every principle or prejudice they have ever cherished against the equal brotherhood of manto learn of a certainly that any compact men may make against such brotherhoed will but increase the agitation it is intended to quell and that legal slavery is the foulest falsehood ever uttered under heaven villauous post masters post masters should be truthful and trustworthy men if the following facts be true j m rice post master of phoenix is far trom being a truthful and trustworthy man indeed a man capable of such small wickedness is much to be pitied such aie the men in power tho he represents his principal the head of hia party nevertheless such heads dont like their agents to manifest their integrity by open falsehood aud when they do so out of the ordinary track of party villany they disown thes agents and tun l them out of office so ought mr fillmore to do with j m rice post master of phoenix if the following letters be true if fillmore does not ship him he will be considered as approving the falsehood and fraud attempted on dea chaffee ourselves and the public for the liberty party paper gilberts mills july d friend thomasl saw in the last number of your paper a short article from a postmaster of our town ordering the discontinuance of the liberty party paper sent to dea chaffee and giving as reasons that he never ordered it sent to him and refuses to take it from the office and furthermore that he prefers to take a paper that has some regard for truth not filled with libels on our best citizens you very wisely ask was that letter dictated by dea chaffee or is it the pioduction of the post master himself the facts in the case are these mr chaffee has taken some three or four papers from the office and read them he says he likes the paper very much believes it takes right grounds c but feeling unable to subscribe and pay for the paper just now and being assured by the post master that if he took them from the office he would beholden for the pay therefore simply tequest ed him to send a uumber back telling him at the same time he likes the paper first tale not expecting however that the post master an ultra whig of course would give his own opinion of the paper and make him responsible for them in view of these facts it does seem strange that a man should thus attempt to injure a paper so completely and entirely devoted to the cause of truth and tighteousnesa while we too prefer an editor who stands by the right and tiuth we should also prefer a post master who has some regard for the truth and who is not so strongly pledged to the support of a wicked proslavery party that he is unwilling that a thoroughgoing antislavery paper should be taken from his office hoping to see no more libels in the liberty party paper we shall yet deem it safe to remain a reader and sustainer yours for the right h n gilbert since we received the above we have received the following fiom dea chaffee himself we give them both to the public no wonder the people are indignant when such men as rice hold places of power they are not safe in the light of these facts how much better post master would dea chaffee make or h n gilbert ilieymust be postponed for such ftien as rice there is the contrast between whigs ami liberty party men the country over pennelville july th mr editor i see in the st no of the liberty party paper by j m rice postmaster of phcenix it is stated as folovvs dea chaffee wishes the liberty party paper discontinued he never ordered it sent to him and refuses to take it from the office he prefers to take a paper that haa gard for truth not filled with libels on our best citizens lam the dea chaffee referred td i told mr rice i was suited with the paper but under present circumstances felt unable to pay for it on account of los of property c i am a liberty party man and will advocate its principles i think mr rice has been very unkind to me and to yourself likewise i hope he will write no more stuff unrequested yety respectfully yours c joseph chaffee from the hamilton intelligencer the fourth frederick douglass the fugitive slavehis eloquence ilis history cincinnati july dear intelligencer since my last communication with you the great anniversary qf american independence the evermern oißble th of this month has come and gone with about the usual effervescence of patriotism and if anything more than the ordinary waste of gunpowder on the part of the boys for myself i took advantage of the holiday to escape as far as i could from the dust heat and tumult of the city and go out into the woods decidedly the best place to spend v day when the mercury stands at degrees or more there are a good many delightful places of nestling green in our neighbor hoodthe beauty of which our scenery hunters do not seem to appreciate altogether for the teason chiefly that they ate too near home these make up to the people iri part the wants of gardens ox parks in the center of the city and are very much fiequented during the summer months appropriately at this lime amid the general rejoicing at the advent of independence daylike the slave behind the car of a r man conqueror in his hour of triumph with his boding cry thou too are erick douglass the wellknown fugitive slave and pronounced to be one of the most eloquent pf men has been making a sojourn in the city and lecturing on the subject of slavery and kindred ones to large audiences and i had the pleasure of hearing him on one of these occasions i was a little disappointed for a few minutes after he began there was but little in bis appearance and manner that indicated anything above medi diocrity and i have seen many colored men who were much more prepossessing his articulation was slow for some little time and apparently laborednot evidences certainly of the orator however this did not last long and he soon got fairly afloat and before the wind when he seemed to be suddenly transformed and for nearly two hours this man beyond all cavil or question one of the most extraordinary of the agepoured forth a perfect torrent of eloquence invective and satire such as i never had the fortune to listen to befoie he gave an account of his visit to england which happened about the time that the evangelical alliance of ridiculous memory vasin session there he gave the whole history of that godly assemblage and held the mirrior up to some of those reverend advocates of american slavery who went there wiili the determination to prevent any decided action of the alliance on the subject of the domestic institution by which slaveholders should be excluded from its privileges his description of the urfily in which these brethren dwelt for a few days before the vexed question was brought up of their beautiful professions of christian love for one another and how they endeavored to cast aside all inferior questions about the sins of the world and fix there whole soui on the glorious idea of uniona union said ho in his eainest and eloquent way without humanity without morality or without leligion was most laughable and indeed the whole discourse was a masterpiece of dry humor and terrible satire as people generally seem ignorant ol douglass and his history will take the opt portunity to relate in a few words what i heard of it since lie has been here he was a slave in baltimore where he picked up j irom the boys in the street the letters of the alphabet and he learned to put them together when he got hold ot the columbian orator the first book he had ever had ir his hands and he was then giown in that book no doubt his first lessons in eloquence were learned and his first ideas of freedom obtained which he soon put in ptactice and fled from a yoke more galling than ever roman ori urk imposed to england and now with no other resources than those that god and nature and his own indomitable soul afforded him he has risen up asserted his manhood and his claims and those of all his unfortunate race to freedom and the enjoyment of their rights with a power and cogency equalled perhaps but not often surpassed i do not hesitate to call him a most eloquent man and more than that an earnest truthful and whole souled one it is surprising how he has acquired the use of our tongue so completely in so short a timehis language is entirely lree from barbarism and is full of strength and elegance i trust you and your fellow ciziten will have the opportunity of hearing him before he returns home the people here intend to make some demonstration of respect for the president o which i will tell you in my next yours pliny more about the outrage committed upon ns at columbus ohio we clip the following from the ohio standard stage co and frederick douglass the editor of the summit beacon has been on a flying visit to our goodly city of columbus he compliments the capital for its enterprise and splendid improvements and says it will stand forth the beauty of the west and the pride of all buckeyedom but there was one dark shade cast over this beautiful picture while mr teesdale was in our city he was present at the evening lecture of frederick douglass in the statehouse where the latter was interrupted and the auditory grossly insulted after noticing the mobbish proceedings at the state house mr teesdale records another fact in relation to the treatment of douglass while here not heretotore adverted to in our paper we copy from the peacon of the th ult to crown all it is said that the ohio stage co refused the next morning to allow douglass a seat inside the coach although the passengers unanin ously requested that hebe permitted to have one thev told him to ride on the outside he declined having paid for a seat inside he then requested the repayment of his money and we were told that even that was refused for the sake of all that is decent we hope the last step was not persisted in there is enough ot crowning infamy in the first to cause the company to make a public disavowal of the acts of their agent if they were unauthor ized w add that the stage co through their agents here persisted in their refusal to refund the money and that a suit is now pend fng tor its recovery an insuit though not inteuded mr badgei last friday in the senate made certain declarations extremely offensive to his northern whig brethren thev were in tact insulting though he did not mean them to be so he took the ground that the true policy of the south was to remain in the union for in that connection it had sufficient power to protect itself against all aggression though ina minoiity it had in its hands a most effective means to bring the north to terms northern men needed protection for their manufactures he was one who believed that congress had power to impose prohibitory or protective duties to any amount and he was in favor of the policy of protection but it northern men would insist upon forcing their itinaentaliiier their notions about slavery on the south he now would give them fair warning their factories might decay their operatives might be turned out of employment their streets might be filled with able bodied beggars unable to maintain work they must ask no favors from him never should his vote or that of his colleague and he believed he might say the same of his friends from georgia be given in support of any measure to protect or foster northern in dustry wecannot seethe wisdom of such a menace as thisespecially as more than onehalf of the northern senators ask no such protection their principles leaning to fiee trade but by iiis whig associates from the north it must have been regarded as insulting for it assumed that their opposition to slavery and ils extension yas either hypocritical or if the offspring of an enlightened moral sente it might be overcome by an appeal to their ayarice mr badger is a moderate man and generally courteous and goodtempered but in his instance he strangely forgot himself and what was due to his political brethren we know not how far the capitalists of the north may be prepared to gojbr the sake of securing a tariff that shall double their profits but we know that with the great majority of the people of the north opposition to the extension of slavery springs from a moral principle a religious sentiment that can neither be bribed nor intimidated n era emancipation in jamaica mr alexander the efficient and benevolent secretary of the british and foreign antislavery society has been on a visit to jamaica with a view to ascertain the real effects which the emancipation has had upon the people his testimony is that of an intelligent sincere and houorabie man who has taken ample opportunity to investigete whether emancipation has been successful or not the reader may udge lronx a single paragraph of a recent letter we have now been five weeks in jamaica during which time we have traveled over a large part of the island and are truly glad to find the condition of planters merchants and laborets better than we expected that of the latter especially is iu general one of much comfort this fine island is not at present hastening to ruin notwithstanding the severe trial to which it has been exposed by the cruel injurious and inconsistent sugar act of ir has been delightful to us to seethe large number of the emancipated peasantry and their children who are brought under a moral and religious influence by the goodmen who are scattered over jamaica there can think be little or no doubt thatpipula tion is increasing now that the dead weight of slavery is removed and there are many indications of an increase of cultivation which will unless i am much mistaken be very shoitly manifested by laiger exports unless checked by had legislation or the operation of the decreasing scale of duties at which foreign sugar is to be introduced for consumption in biitain n evangelist colored people in ohioa memorial numerously signed by citizens of hamilton county was presented in the ohio constitutional convention during its recent session which prays that in the new constitution provision may be made for the removal of all colored persons from that state the reason given is that the geographical position ot ohio makes the state the refuge of all the fugitive and manumitted slaves of a number of southern states in consequence whereof the colored population increases more rapibly than in any other free state the memorial says in the year there were hut negroes in the states of ohio indiana and illinois but in the year they we e estimated at in the state of ohio alone speaker cobb has published a long letter approving of clays compromise august elections he returns from the north carolina election which look place on the first instant indicate the success of the locofoco candidate for governor and a locofoco majority in the legislature in gov manly succeeded by only majority but the slate soon after gave gen taylor majority ihe slavery question has been involved in this canvass and the most inflammatory appeals made to slaveholders to vote against manly because he was in favor of the admission of california and new mexico if lie is defeated his defeat will be owing to the tact that he maintained a position unsatisfactory to the slavery exfensionists on the day before the election the raleigh standard a rabid locofoco and slavery organ said remember friends of southern rights that gov manly has declared himself at marion and elsewhere in the west din favor of the immediate admission of california and new mexico as states with constitutions prohibiting we make the statement on unquestionable authority and ate responsible for the facts are the people of north carolina with governor manly on this subject ifthey are let them talk no longer of defending their just rights as involved in this slavery question but let them bow down at once and receive the yoke and the lash of the hands of northern aggression and free soil arrogance on this subject col reid is he has uniformly avowed himself in favorof keeping out these upstart sovereignties until justice is done to the south on the slavery question and he wouldkeep them out indefinitely ratherthan sea them admitted at the expense ofonr rights and interest and in defiance of our earnest warnings and remnn strances charles manlys reelectionthere fore lerwill be the triumph of the cause of california and

box to deposit your votes indiana kentucky missouri lowa alabama and arkansas held their elections on mondayall of them except kentucky are decided locofoco states we have seen no signs of excitement

colored children who up to march last attended the different district schools of the city were by vote of the school commissioners excluded from said schools and driven to the alternative of attending one set apart for their exclusive use or liuc ihc benefit of the public school act feeling it to be wrong to permit our children to be thus driven from the schools of the district in which they reside without resisting it and knowing that this new outrage upon our rights involved a principle which we should battle against and which should lead us to unite our energies tor the purpose of having our children educated promiscuously with other children therefore the people came together and resolved to protest against the cause taken by the board of education a memorial was drawn up setting forth in te pectful terms yet earnestly our views and feelings upon theii course and our determination to oppose them in their efforts to coloize our children in a district school they took no notice of our appeal and cur next resort was to apply to the secy of state who decided he had no authoriry to interfere with the commissioners arrangement thus we were left to the counsel as to the manner best to proceed in order to gain our rights and after several public meetings concluded to test the legality of their act by prosecuting them at a court of law our attorney and counselor after carfully examining the question in all its bearings have decided that there can be no doubt as to law or precedent but that a decision must he given in favor of the prosecution the object of this appeal ts to get pecuniary assistance front friends out of the city believing it to be such an object as we may with propriety ask such aid we do so hoping that all who can give will give something of ourselves we ate not able pecuniarily to conduct this suit and so far we yet lack about two hundred and fifty dollars and trust no one who feels any interest in promoting the principles of free and equal education

magistrate the inhabitants are industrious peaceable and kindhearted they are lovers of flowers and fruit trees and lieut albert says he could at first sight distinguish an indian from a spanish town by the green clump of trees which enclosed it they raise large numbers of common domestic fowls and like their aztec ancestors have a fancy for taming birds in dress and appearance they scarcely suffer in comparison with their castilian neighbors col emory in his report to the secretary of war of his explorations in new mexico gives the portrait of an indian woman painted from life in the parlor of the indian alcade of isoletta it is a picture of remarkable beauty the figure full and gracefully mouldedand the features delicately chiselled the women are very tolerable housewives and our officers who during the late war had occasion to partake of their hospitality speak of their wellloaded tables their sponge cakes fine wheaten loaves and domestic wines these pueblo indians were the first to welcome the american troops to new mexico thoy disliked the mexican rule as it constantly reminded them of the days of the conquest and the subjugation of their ancestors colonel emory does not hesitate to pronounce them the best and most peaceable citizens of new mexico it would certainly be a most ungrateful return to these people if their state should be denied a place in the american confederacy on the ground that they are unworthy of the rights of citi zenship as to the mexican or spanish part of the population they are to say the least quite as well fitted for the duties and responsibilities of state government as the old inhabitants of louisiana and florida when those states were taken into the union they are not an enterprising hardworking peoplethe majority content themselves with the simple necessaries of lifethey have neither the thriftiness nor the shiftiness of yankees they have a few books and no newspapers yet they are by no means deficient in the rudiments of education each village has its padre more or less learned and lieut albert says it is rare to find a new mexican boy or girl who is unable to read many of the old landed proprietors are wealthy living in a style of rude magnificence exhibiting upon their tables massive silver plate the product of new mexican mines and the work of new mexican artizans and hanging their walls with mirrors and paintings their sons are educated in the united states or mexico several have graduated at the st louis college some of their private residences are spacious and not without architectural pretension that of senor ortoiro at peralta has a front pertail or pizza of five hundred feet in length at peralta albuquerque el paso pad dilla and bernallilo our officers found polite and intelligent society all classes are courteous and civil in their social intercourse crimes of the highest degree are unfrequent but as in all parts of mexico gaming is a prevalent vice in the northern part of the territory there is a good deal of intemperance and the famous taos whiskey is too freely used lower down the light delicious wines of e paso are in common use the americans who visit them have the reputation of hard drinkers and when col emory on one occasion declined the proffer of a bottle of whiskey the astonished mexican exclaimed what no whiskey then you are no ameri can elizabeth to the restless unsatisfied grasping anglosaxon the careless ease and listleness and simple pastoral habits of the new mexicans are well calculated to awaken a feeling of contemptuous superiority on the part of the former but it may be a question after all whether the dolce far niente the quiet indifference of the one is not as productive of happiness as the goading irritability and habitual unrest of the other livery year the tide of emigration setting towards us from the old world brings to our shores the poor the ignorant and vicious in numbers far greater than the entire population of new mexico these are incorporated in our body politic and in the new slates and territories speedily be j miscellaneous by j g whittier come voters we would not if we could close our ports against them and refuse them an asylum in our broad territory but who would notj prefer to the refuse and squalid overplus of crowded european cities and the annual disgorgements of their jails and workhouses the quiet homelov ing and pastoral life of new mexico who for the last quarter of a century have exercised the rights of citizens ofj a republic apd whose insulated posii tion if it has deprived them in some measure of the benefits of the general progress of civilization has at the same time preserved them from some of the worst vices which that civilization has carried in its train but as things are what avail all facts and argument on this point itis not manifest to the wisdcm of this great republicin congress assembled that these new mexicans are incapable of duly appreciating our cherished institutions inasmuch as they have prohibited forever domestic slavery in their state constitution they have left out the key of the arch they have rejected the cornerstone of the republican edifice they need to wait yet longer in territorial limbopros elytes of the gate tarriers at jericho until the beard of their democracy has grown to cover the shame and folly ol their antislavery partialities their task just now is plainly that which senator webster has assigned to massachusetts they must conquer their prejudices whenever they shall have accomplished this and are ready to present themselves at the door of the union with a constitution modelled after that of south carolina they will find their present opponents transformed into chivalrous friends with whom a recognition of the rights of the peculiar institution will prove as the open sesame of ali baba did to the forty theives national era a fable in ancient times when flowers and trees and fairies were on speaking terms and all friendly together one fine summers day the sun shone out on a beautiful garden where there were all sorts of flowers that ye could mention and a lovely but giddy fairy went sporting about from one to the other although no one could see her because of the sunlight as gay as the morning lark then says the fairy to the rose rose if the sun was clouded and the storm came on would you shelter and love me still do you doubt me says the rose and reddened up with anger lily says the fairy to another love if the sun was clouded and a storm came on would ye shelter and love me still oh do you think i would change says the lily and she grew still paler with sorrow tulip said the fairy if the sun was clouded and a storm came on would ye shelter and love me still upon my word said the tulip making a very gentlemanlike bow yere the first lady that ever doubted my constancy so the fairy sported on joyful to think of her kind and blooming friends she revelled away for a time nndtlven she thought on the pale blue violet that was almost covered with its broad green leaves and although it was an old comrade she might have forgotten it had it not been for the sweet scent that came up from the modest flower uh violet said the fairy if the sun was clouded and a storm came on would ye shelter and love me still and the violet made answer ye have known me long sweet fairy and in the first springtime when there were but few other flowers ye used to shield from the cold blast under my leaves now yeve almost forgotten mebut let it passtry my truth if ever ye should meet with misfortunebut i sav nothing well the at that and clapped her silvery wings and whisked singing off on a sunbeam but she was hardly gone when a black cloud grew up at the north all in a minute and the light was shrouded and the rain fell in slashings like hail and away flies the fairy to her friend the rose now rose says she he rain has come so shelter and love me still i can hardly shelter my own buds said the rose but the lily has a deep cup well the poor little fairyswings were almost wet through but she got to the lily lily says she the storm has come so shelter and love me still i am sorry says the lily but if i were to open my cup the rain would beat in like fun and my seed would be spoiltthe tulip has long leaves well the fairy was downhearted enough but she went to the tulip whom she always thought a sweetspoken gentleman he certainly did not look as he had done in the sun but she waved her little wand and tulip said she the rain and storm are come and i am very weary but you will shelter and lovo me still begone says the tulip be off says he a pretty pickle i should be in if i jet every wandering trollop come about me well by this time she was tired and her wings hung dripping at her back wet indeedbut there was no help for it and leaning on her silver wand she limped off to the violet and the darling little flower with its blue eye thats as clear as a kittens saw her coming and never a word she spoke but opened her broad green leaves and took the wild wandering little creature to her bosom and dried her wings and then breathed sweetest of perfumes over her and sheltered her until the storm was clean gone then the humble violet spoke and said fairy queen it is bad to flirt with many for the love of one true heart is enough for earthly woman or fairy spirit the old love is better than the gay compliments of the world of flowers for it will last when the others fade away and the fairy knew that what the violet said was true and she contented herself ever after and built her downy bower under the widespreading violet leaves that sheltered her from the rude winters wind and the hot summers sun and to this very day the fairies love the violet beds id we should be cautious how we indulge in the feelings of virtuous indignation itis the handsome brother of anger and hatred from the louisville examiner growth of coffee and pepper in java in extent java is about seven hundred miles in length and it varies from eighty to one hundred and forty miles in width its area is less than twenty thousand square miles the face of the country is more or less broken by mountains but the soil generally is rich and productive the products are rice sugar coffee peper spiees and a profusion of the finest tropical productions growing coffee is cultij vated here to as great perfection as in almost any other part ot the world it grows upon large bushes that very much resemble our large chairkapin bushes and the grains of coffee are formed two in a berry about the size and shape of our common plum the skin of the berry is about as thick as that of the plum and the color when ripe a pale scarlet the bush is very productive every branch is loaded with the berries which grow two jn a place on opposite sides of each other and about an inch and a half apart when ripe the skin bursts open and the grains of coffee fall out upon the ground but a more way is to spread something under the bush and shake the coffee down after the outer skin is taken offthere remains a kind of husk over each kernel which is broken off after being well dried in the sun by heavy rollers the coffee after this needs winnowing in order to be freed from the broken particles of the husk it has been said by some writers that one bush will not with another average more than a pound of coffee though it seemed to me judging from appearances that this was too small an allowance for each bush biack pepper is also raised to some extent on the island of java but sumatra which lies just across the straits is by far the most celebrated for this commodity her pepper is perhaps the finest and most abundant of any in the world black pepper grows on a vine very much like our grape vine and the pepper vineyards remind me very much of our american vineyards of grapes the pepper grows and looks when green a good deal like our currants there is this difference however the currant has each its own distinct stem but the pepper has not every grain grows hard on to one common stem just as each grain of indian corn does on the cob or husk as virginians incorrectly would say the color of pepper when first ripe is almost a bright red and changes to the dead black common to us by being exposed to the heat of the sun the famous white pepper is nothing more than the common black with the outer skin taken off it is first soaked until this skin bursts open which is then rubbed off and the grain dried the white is not considered so pungent as the black though it is nicer and more expensive as more labor is necessary in order to prepare it replying to a beggar the duke of wellington is famous for his pithy arid laconic style of speaking and writing almost as much as for his vigorous and decisive mode of acting on the battlefield his military despatches and his speeches in parliament were always remarkable for their directness brevity and point here is a a specimen of the refreshing abernethy like coolness and brevity which sometimes characterize his notes a rector of a parish in one of the midland counties of england wishing to collect subscription to repair his church begged assistance by letter of many of the most distinguished men in the country the iron duke included the following was wellingtons reply an autograph hunter it is said on being shown the communication promptly offered five guineas for it which was accepted and the sum set down as the dukes contribution rather cute idea that wasnt it yankee blade f m the duke of wellington presents his compliments to mr as mr feels that his letter needs apology the duke will say no more on that subject but he must add that there is not a church chapel glebe house school or even a pagoda built from the north to the south pole or within the utmost limits of the earth to which he the duke of wellington is not called upon to contribute the duke is surprised that mr having already raised towards the restoration of his church should make application to the duke who has nothing to say either to or to shire jenny lind a letter from stockholm of the th ult says the day before yesterday
