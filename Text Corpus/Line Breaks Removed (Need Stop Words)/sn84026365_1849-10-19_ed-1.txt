an address to the colored men of connecticut from the state convention held at new harm september th and th brethren it is unnecessary to set forth before your minde the particulars of our political condition in the state of connecticut we are wronged and our wrongs are matter of daily and humiliating experience we are disfranchised our manhood and citizenship thus are assailed at a vital point and this was done by the authority of the state when freemen irrespective of color had enjoyed on equal terms the elective franchise for one hundred and fifty years under the charter of a king n line was drawn proscriptive unnatural and unjust under a republican state constitution but no authority can sanctify injustice and oppression the drapery of the law cannot conceal their monstrous forms nor shield them from the darts of truth thirty years have we been disfranchised but our disfranchisement odious enough in itself is the prolific source of other forms of proscription it is a monster that multiplies itself upon us in each new form increasedly repulsive obtruding in our very path of enterprise knowledge virtue and religion until many have turned backward in despair from all the highways of progress two years ago when justice uttered her voice throughout connecticut and liberty held her rendezvous in every town but five thousand heeded the cry and rallied to the standard what then shall we despair shall we cease all efforts shall we heed those who discouragingly say you can accomplish nothing it will do no good a moments consideration and every one must be convinced that hopelessly to yield the struggle is an unwise and ruinous course it is an eternal law of god that whosoever abandoneth himself will the lord forsake they are false to nature blind to duty treacherous to the interests of the present and unmindful of coming generations who advise us to bear unresistingly the burthen of oppression it is no doubtful right for which we contend it lies at the foundation ol our republican government the doctrine is prominently set forth in our countrys constitution that all just governments derive their powers from the consent of the governed the people are the recognized source of power this is the distinctive feature both of our national and state governments but the foundation is overthrown if the expression of choice or consent is trammelled or suppressed by prohibitory enactments there are exceptions to the general law a in the case of women minors aliens criminals the insane and idiots these classes do not participate directly by vote in the affairs of the government tc mention their names is to suggest a reason but why are native born colored men innocent ol disaffection toward or crime against the commonwealth debarred the rights of citizenship in casting about to ascertain a reason for our disfranchisement we discover wherein we may justly fey at the doors of the people of connecticut the charge of ingratitude in addition tothat of injustice let us review the history of the state let us consider the position and numbers ol its colored population at critical periods from the time ol the dutch and indian troubles in lfrvi to the fight at stonington borough in have we not always been emi aently loyal and true citizens and that too in the face of the strongest iocen tivei to disaffection ukt wgr of the revolution then the north star were seven thousand of our people in connecticut chiefly held in degrading servitude when the war note was every where heard when the roar of the british lion filled many hearts with tremnling and dismay many whites turned over to the enemy following their fears or dazzled by the seductive glitter of british gold but is the page of history sullied with the names of any black traitor tory or coward yet these were the times that tried mens souls once only were they subjects of suspicion and then a thorough scrutiny proved the suspicion base and groundless more than this our virtues were not sgstive ones only colored men free and bound sprang into the front ranks of freedoms hosts yielding with a noble enthusiasm their hardy frames to the toils exposures and dangers of war giving the first practical and glorious exhibition of the now popular motto our country right or wrong could a grateful people forget such services or having them fresh in their memories would they inflict so deep a wrong upon the sons of these departed patriots as to deprive them of all participancy in a government whose foundation stone was hewn out by their toils securely laid amid their prayers and consecrated by the outpouring of their blood nay would they not revert to times anterior to these and exclaim in the language of the noble ellsworth we owe a debt to the colored population of this country which we can never payno never never unless we can call back oceans of tears and all the groans and agonies of the middle passage and the thousands and millions whom we have sent and are sending ignorant debased and undone to eternity the question recurs brethren what mhall we do we are convinced it will not do to yield to despair there is no course of masterly inactivity profitable or practicable to us in this our extremity something must be done more effective than bewailing our lot in each others ears the conviction of these truths led to the issuing of the call and finally to the holding of the convention from which this address emanates a convention characterized in an eminent degree by a spirit of harmony unanimity and enthusiasm among the measures advocated there that of training our youths in the practice of mechanic arts met with much favor this measure strongly commends itself to us as looking to the abandonment of those menial and servile employments which were the unavoidable jot of the past generations the acquisition of property in the soil homesteads farms and the pursuit df agriculture are measures deserving of serious consideration as inducing habits of industry and economy it is easily perceived that their adoption to any considerable extent must secure comfort open the way to competence and result in stability and independence of character the deep injuries we have inflicted on ourselves by partaking of the deadly intoxicating draught were not there forgotten our clergymen are called upon to bring the hallowed influences of religion to bear upon this subject so thoroughly connected with all our hopes and aspirations every man should be careful to maintain a proper degree of self respect as the infallible method of commanding the respect of others but let no man think to exalt himself by standing aloof from his people but on the contrary everywhere identifying himselt with them and laboring earnestly and patiently for the welfare of all in the spirit of resolution no let each recognise honor and defend his proscribed and oppressed brother and in all lawful ways seek his advance ment the subject of education received as it justly deserved particular attention and assumed a prominent place in the discussion of the convention true our educational advantages are not great and on that account should they be more highly prized and no opportunity to improve them lost we find the doors of the high schools academies and seminaries generally closed against our children but there is now no statutory prohibition no teacher need now fear arrest fine and imprisonment for his labor of love in teaching a colored child no colored young lady need tremble at a towns threatening of ten stripes on the naked back for presuming to enter connecticut in the pursuit of knowledge let it be remembered brethren that these and other measures are proposed in answer to a general question what shall be done and not as a means necessary to entitle us to enfranchisement our title to that is perfect already for did we as a mass possess every qualification requisite to the good citizen in the highest perfection nothing material would be added to the strength of our claim to the franchise our only argument for that is and must ever be the broad and conclusive one that it is oua right as native born men citizens of this great republic and members of the commonwealth of connecticut the value and wisdom of the measures recommended to you are seen in their tendency to increase our strength to multiply the number of our friends and as a means of enabling us to wield more intelligently and effectively the weapon unit amt down u stilla snowflake tali spon the sod but executes a freeman willa

shall her righteousness break forth as the light and her glory as the noonday suns m africanus henry nott henry a thompson from ihe boston republican west india emancipation on no subject probably has there been such gross premeditated and oft repeated misrepresentations as on that relating to the consequences and effects of the emancipation of the slaves in the british west india islands which took place august these misrepresentations are published by southern slaveholders and other journals devoted to their interests and under their patronage and control perhaps seme allowance should be made for the amount of interest they have at stake for the prejudice they feel against emancipation which ba√ü been cherished in their bosoms till it has become second nature and the annoyance which such an example close by them is adapted to impart but all this is no sufficient excuse books have been published by honest and impartial men who have carefully examined into the state and condition of these islands before and since the emancipation of the slaves which books have been filled with well authenticated facts proving the perfect safety as well as happy effects of this emancipation these books contain facts which convinced gov everett and other discerning men of the safety expediency and beneficial effects of emancipation to the former masters as well as slaves yet with all these facts staring them in the face these slaveholders in our southern states continue to speak of this experiment as a failure in order to deceive people who have not the means of ascertaining the truth the following well timed and well applied rebuke of th constant slander and abuse above referred to is taaen from the kingston journal published on the island of jamaica the allusion to the british west indies is most unfortunate inasmuch as the condition of those colonies falsifies all the statements and predictions of these southern members who will look at this island for example and say the existing relation between the free and servile races cannot be sepa ratedand the races cannot live together in peace or harmony or to their mutual advantage where is the man however favorably inclined toward the muchloved system of the southern states of america or prejudiced against the dark hued inhabitants of that portion of the union or of this colony who will be bold enough to assert that wretchedness and misery and desolation have been the result of emancipation but the southern members appeared to feel that their ground was not safe under them hence they tell their constituents that since the emancipation the british government has kept up a sufficient military and naval force to keep the blacks in awe and a large number of magistrates constables and other civil officers to keep order in the towns and on plantations and enforce respect to their former owners it is very evident from this observation that they knew nothing ot the true state of affairs in the west indies and if they do have purposely misrepresented them there has been a very large diminution of both the military and naval forces in the west indies since the abolition of slavery some years ago the regular troops in this island alone amounted to from eight to ten thousand men now we believe there are not two thousand in itas to the naval forces those who knew port royal during urn palmy days of slavery and look at it at present can say whether there has been a falling off in this department of our defence during slavery evenr rural pariah had four or five constables and the towns a larger number the total of which we have no doubt would he found fully equal la the number of police now rochester n y friday october employed for the preservation of the peace some three hundred and fifty of these are divided among twentytwo perishes and a population upward of souls to keep order as these southern members say in the towns and on the plantations and enforce respect to former owners but there is no police on the plantations nor any necessity for them and what will appear most astonishing to southern alarmists the social and political superiority of education and talent is still preserved the southern members of congress after crowding a lot of misstatements into very nearly as manr lines thus triad up their allusions to the west indies but notwithstanding all this the british west india possessions are ruined impoverished miserable wretched and destined probably to be abandoned to the black race this many of our readers will think is going ahead rather too fast running to a conclusion much too rapidly our reply is it is not true there never was a period in the history of the british west indies in which life and property were more secure and peace and quiet more universal or a better feeling existed between all classes of the community happy slavery slavery is a blessed institution a happy institution a natural state of society shouts the slaveholder let us see how he proves this the following picture of southern life from the canton miss creole gives an illustration of the happy and peaceful state of society under the patriarchal institution patrols mr editor permit me through the medium of the creole to call the attention of our honorable police court to the subject of patrols in our county at this time when there is such an alarming agitation on the slave ques tionevery prudential measure that will contribute to our internal quiet should be adopted that an efficient system of patrols will do this i imagine few will question on the generally conceded fact of exclusive jurisdiction by the police court over this questionunder the constitutional term of county police i purpose a remark upon the necessity of some action on the subject the fearful agitation now threatening the union on the slave question should be sufficient cause for the utmost vigilance on our part add to this the more alarming fact of the growing insubordination among she slaves of the south and it appears to me as criminal in us to neglect anyeven the least measure of security i am aware that there are some who oppose any system of patrol on the ground that it is the duty of every manto patrol his own premises and in a community of large plantations this plan may do for there the owners are tinder the twofold obligation of economy and interest to keep strict watch but those who own but few slaves are not under the same necessity and indeed cannot afford to mount guard the result is that after nightfall near half the negroes in the county are literally at large and no more called forby their owners until the next days work commences what better opportunity could be asked for organizing a deadly plot this county has probably never been free from the presence of abolition incendiaries and emissaries and but few such are required to corrupt the whole slave population and probably at no time in our history has so many suspicious vagrant characters been observed among us as within the last twelve or eighteen months the late startling case in south carolina affords a fresh demonstraiion of their efforts looking at all these facts it seems to me strange that there is such general apathy in the public mind on this subject having every civilized nation of the earth clamoring against our peculiar institution and more than half of our own citizens denouncing it as agreat moral and political evil we should feel that we slumbered on a volcano when we are careless on this subject the history of odr country will show that every insurrection among the slaves from that of on the coast of louisiana to that of in madison county have occurred at a time when there was the most profound security to all appearance and although no record is made of the facti have no doubt but it is equally true that immediately prior to each there was no patrol organization or if anya very inefficient system many citizens of this county can remember that in and there was scarcely such a thing known as a patrol in the coun q until the people were aroused to a sense of their danger by accident only in time to save themselves from massacre scarcely a week passes now but some later evidence of the insubordination among the slaves occurs in our states where is to be the end of this without some system to force order among them see nothing more probable than another outbreak accomplishing the fdeath of thousands of oar citizens and desolating the country bet i have already said more than there is any necessity for perhaps as my object is only to call the attention of our worthy policemen to the subject believing they wfll give it the attention due its importance when consulting the pcslic safety selfdestbotikg cfiikictu or slavery our root lay along tory interesting coootry portly in the state of maryland and partly in vinpaia wo beheld a groat number of slaves at work m the urn that i had seen at their degrading labor i they exhibited no lift do activity in their occupation but teemed to drag themselves along as if existence were a weariness they plied their implements of industry careless as to the amount of work done or studious to do as little las possible my companion mr porter a staunch antislavery man descanted on the deleterious effects of slavery on the soil itself endeavoring to prove that maryland and v irginia were worn out by this kind of cultivation whether this is so or not i cannot pretend to determine but the whole country where these slaves were at work has an extremely barren appearance such is the decree of god that this enormous evil may wear itself out and the planters be obliged to turn to the cultivation of such productions as may make it profitable to employ free labor god appears to curse with sterility the land cultivated by the slaves the planters i was informed were getting very poor and it was apparently becoming their interest to turn their attention to something else in the place of tobacco and the other productions on which slave labor is chiefly employed we passed on and soon lost sight of the haggard dispirited brokenheartedoppressed slave those fields had witnessed the iabor the tears the blood of their race for generations and for aught which appears must continue to witness the same miseries in their children unless heaven shall in mercy increase the inten tensity of his malediction and render the country completely sterile but would this be any relief no these poor wretches would be sold and sent farther south and if even the same fate should follow them into the carolines and georgia still there are texas mexico and california to be peopled and cultivated by this unfortunate race the evil seems to be indefinite eternal provision has been made designedly or otherwise by the conquests of the states for the progress of this scourge for all time to come methodism in america from the centrerille ind sentinel letter from j m barrett spartanburgh prison sept my dear father i have not written you for some days but must not defer it longer nothing of interest has occurred with me since my last lam still in prison and most relentlessly persecuted by a portion of those around me but you need have no apprehension of their injuring me fn the end am above the injustice and slander of reckless petty tyrants who would rob me of character even life if they could have violated no law of this state in any way i know it and therefore foresee that the time must come when the conduct of those who persecute me fiercely will meet the indignant censure of the whole country the last spartan you will see publishes mr w h brisbane of cincinnati as the man who sent me the documents and letters about which lam cast into prison if this be true by mr brisbane then i could readily show that those things were sent me without my knowledge or consent in any way previously obtained he is a man of undoubted repute at cincinnati and his testimony would be as utterly unimpeachable as that of any mans in south carolina i care not who he is mr harwood is also a man of undoubted veracity among his acquaintances and his testimony would go as far in a court of justice at home as any mans by him i could prove that i came into the country not to circulate documents or operate upon the institution of slavery in any way the above testimony would inevitably clear me of the whole matter well what think you the heartless injustice and tyranny of the prosecution has deprived me of this testimony the only means by i which i can make my innocence apparent was prepared for almost anything else but this even the last treachery of depriving me of bail as it had been promised was not equal to denying me the testimony of the most important witnesses it is a law of this state to examine distant witnesses bv commission in which both parties join or the commission is defeated my enemies refuse to join a commission to examine the witnesses before mentioned and thus you see they deprive me of their testimony let them exercise their brief authority over me it must come to an end soon they cant prove aught against me by any honorable man and harwood and brisbane will clear me in this matter before the world my dear father let me exhort you to give yourself no trouble if possible on my account even if my case was ten times worse if i had committed any offence against the laws that could stain my name with infamy it would be vour duty to exercise philosophy and that pure religion that is above philosophy which lifts the soul from the poor transient events of this world into that brighter aad better realm which god has stamped with eternity i almost feel that i am never to enjoy much happiness in this world it seems to me that i am doomed to be a companion with misfortune in of life be it long or short but i feel the evidence within roe that there is a spirit worlda bright etherial existence above this dull mortality where disease and death cannot come and the troubles and trials of this world are felt no more oh god let us look to this and forget that we are dull worms of the dust the creatures of an boor let us look to that lift eternal that may be enjoyed in the world to come your affectionate son j m barrett p s the draft on the cincinnati bank in

immediately j m b the fall of hose the london daily yews publisher n lone letter from joseph mazzini expostulating with england for allowing the french to crush the roman republic the following passages will be read with painful interest by all who believe and rejoice in human progress rome has fallen it is a great crime and a great error the crime belongs entirely to france the error toto civilized europe and above all to your england i say your england for in the questions which are now at issue in rome and which it is in vain to attempt to stifle by brute force england appears to me and did appear to us all to be equally concerned three questionsthe question of principle of international right of european moralitythe political question properly so called the balance of power in europe influence to be preserved or obtainedand the religious questionall were in fact raised already in rome before the entrance of the french the question of principle is thank god sufficiently clear a population of more than two millions of men having peacefullysolemnly and legally chosen through a constitutional assembly regularly elected a form of government is deprived of it by foreign violence and forced again to submit to the power which had been abolished and that without the population having furnished the slightest pretext for such violence or made the slightest attempt against the peace of neighboring countries the calumnies which have been for months systematically circulated against our republic are of little importance it was necessary to defame those whom it had determined to destroy but i affirm that the republic voted almost uuani mously by the assembly had the general and spontaneous approbation of the country and of this the explicit declaration of almost all the municipalities of the roman states voluntarily renewed at the time of the french invasion without any initiative on the part of the roman government is a decisive proof i affirm that with the exception of acona where the triumvirate were obliged energetically to repress certain criminal acts of political vengeance the republican cause was never sullied by the slightest excess that never was there any censorship assumed over the press before the siegj never did the occasion arise for exercising it during the siege not a single condemnation to death or to exile bore witness to a severity which it would have been our right to have exercised but which the perfect unanimity which reigned among all the elements of the state rendered useless i affirm that except in the case of three or four priests who had been guilty of firing upon our combatants and who were killed by the people during the last days of the siege not a single act of personal violence was committed by any fraction of the population against another and that if ever there was a town presenting the spectacle of a band of brothers pursuing a common end and bound together by the same faith it was rome under the republican rule the city was inhabited by foreigners from all part of the world by the consular agents by many of your countrymen let any one of them arise and under the guarantee ofbisown signature deny if he can the truth of what i say terror now reigns in rome the prisons are now choked with men who have been arrested and detained without trial fifty priests are confined in the castle of st angelo whose only crime consists in their having lent their services in our hospitals the citizens the best known for their moderation are exiled the army is almost entirely dissolved the city disarmed and the factious sent away even to the last roan and yet france dares not consult in a legal manner the will of the population but reestablishes the papal authority by military decree i do not believe that since the dismemberment of poland there has been committed a more atrocious injustice a more gross violation of the eternal right which god has implanted in the peoplethat of appreciating and defining for themselves their own life and governing themselves in accordttpce with their own appreciation of it above the questiou of right above the question of politicsl interest both of which were of a nature to excite early the attention of england there is another question being agitated at rome of a very different kind of importance and which ought to have aroused all those who believe in the vital principle of religious reformation it is that of liberty of conscience the religious question which broods a the root of all political questions showed itself there

conquerors or not at and in the same way the aristocracy of the clergy foit this inseparability of the two powers the french government in present reactionary march has felt that the keystone of despotism is at romethat the ruin of the spiritual authority of the middle ages was the ruin of its own projects and that the only method of securing to it a few more years of existence wim to rebuild for it a temporal domin ion england has understood nothing of thisshe has not understood what there was of sublime and prophetic in this cry of emancipation in this protestation in favor of human

vainly opposed her biblical societies her christian and evangelical alliances and that there was being opened had she but extended a sisterly hand to the movement a mighty pathway for the human mind

extracts from the proceedings of the young men and womens convention as given by the antislavery bugle in pursuance of a cal issued by direction of the executive committee of the western antislavery society a convention of the antislavery young men and women of ohio was held in berlin mahoning county commencing on friday sept t at oclock r m in the great tent which was spread for the occasion on the premises of adnah silver the convention having been called to order by the chairman of the committee of ar rangetnilt oliver johnson was appointed president pro tern and james barnaby and rachel w thomas were elected secreta nes pro tem resolutions whereas the perpetuity and extension of the slave system in ihe united states have been and still are the highest considerations of the federal government and w here as to accomplish these purposes many millions of dollars have been extorted from the north and expended upon lauds foi slave states oi in the butchery and banishment of thousands of indians from theii homes that their soil too might he plundered for the same unhallowed design and whereas this nation in all its political parties and in all ihe leading denominations of religion has sanctioned and sanctified these tearful attrocities by accepting the spoils and extending over them the bloody shield of the american constitution am whereas the political parties are all united in theirstern determination to maintain this bloodstained and bloodcemented union with tyrants and manstealers howevei bounded or wherever slavery may be extended and whereas the religious bodies and influences of the nation are equally true in their loyalty and allegiance to this confederacy so foul with many abominations therefore resolved ist that we the young men and women of ohio and elsewhere in convention assembled deeply and solemnly impressed by the fearful degeneracy the alarming disregard o jusiicc the entire prostration of national conscience under which such evils have been perpetrated arid earnestly desirous to save ourselves from the burdens of taxation ignominy and guilt under which the northern states have so long suffered as a consequence of their unholy alliance with slavery and the south we do now in the presence of our god here build an altar tc justice liberty and humanity and on this altar we consecrate ourselves to the great work of elevating universal man to the full enjoyment of all the lights lor which his nature and constitution were formed firmly resolved that in tins work we will never tire until victory shall crown our labors or death release us fiom them and resolved d that since our government has become thus destructive of the ends of liberty an engine of torture and slavery to millions compelling the entire people to he

such form as shall seem most likely to secure a fu equality of the blessings of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and with full confidence in the integrity of our purpose and ihe justice of our cause we do hereby declare ourselves the enemies of the constitution union ano government of these united states and the friends ot a new confederacy of northern states where there shall be no

which a faithful advocate of the slaves cause has encountered the martyrdom of a coat of tar aud feathers so also will it be recorded toits honor that it was the place in which was held in peace and quietness the first great convention of the antislavery yoong meo and women of ohio and that tn view of the great change of public opinion indicated by these facts we are encouraged to persevere in our efforts for the regeneration and disenthralment of the whole land from be entries and pollutions of slavery vi resolved that we unitedly express our gratitude to god that out brother marius r robinson who so nobly endured the martyrdom before alluded to is this day with us not only in spirit but in person and ready to endnre with us the labors and the perils by which alone the chains of the slave can he broken vii resolved that next to the living speaker the press is the most potent instrumentality for the promotion of a moral and philanthropic enterprise that without this agency it is vain to expect that the public mind can be enlightened in regaid to the evils of slavery and the people aroused to a sense of their duties to the bondman and that this convention heartily commends the antislavery bugle to the support of the abolitionists of ohio and the west and would urge it upon them as a duty to adopt the most vigorous measures for extending its circula tion viii wheeras the american antislavery society ha authorized its general agent for the region west of the alleghanies to collect from all its friends one dollar each to be expended in the west and whereas the friends of the society in the east when applied to have generally responded to the call and whereas it is of the utmost importance to our cause to keep as many agencies in the field as possible not only in this state and western pennsylvania but if the means car be supplied to extend our operations intc michigan and northern indiana therefore resolved that we will not permit ourselvei to be exceeded in devotion to the cause by those living at a distance from the field of operations but will cheerfully respond to the call npon us and we urge every abolitionist in the west to contribute if in his power at least one dollar for this purpose ix resolved that while we do not re gaid the unavoidable use of slavegrown produce as a violation of principle we neveithe less believe that our decided preference shoulc be given to the products of free labor whenever and wherever practicable and that tc refuse to do so under such circumstances doee in our opinion countenance and sustair the slave power x resolved that the unfeigned thanks of this convention be given to those friends in berlin whose generous and abundant bos pitalities have done so much to make this occasion one never to be forgotten and while we go on our way rejoicing at the glorioui prospect before us we leave with them oui heartfelt wishes that their constant and unvaned kindness and attention to us may in m wise lose a full reward the north star rochester october another rivet in the fetter of the slave it has long been the custom in russia fur the owners of seifs to allow the latter to hire their time and to pay their masters a given sum for the same a small drop of mercy in the bitter cup of bondage by means of this the miserable serf is sometimes able by in dusttv skill and perseverance to surround himself by circumstances of comparative comfort as well as greatly to enhance the wealth of his master this privilege has to a limited extent been allowed to slaves in many of the southern states and has been a source of relief from the wretched doom of the plundered slave we once enjoyed this and felt it to be a great privilege to select our own employment and to choose our own master the jiermissiou to do this impressed us witha sense of our own manhood capabilities and rights the slight taste of freedom which this favor afforded us did nothing to weaken our desire for it and although we might have remained a slave until this time had not the piivilege been withdrawn from us when taken away we felt far less reconciled to our lot than when first it was granted this secret of human nature the keen eyed flush mongers of v irginia have recently discovered and being resolved to maintain the system of slavery at all hazards they are busily engaged in measures to prevent this means of injury to their cherished institution the national antislavery standard which seems to be favored by a large southern exchange contains numerous extiacts from southern newspapers strongly condemning the conduct of such masters as allow their slaves the permission to hue their time they allege the practice to lie dangerous to the stability of the whole slave system and one that was justly alarming all who have an interest in that species of property one paper argues that it makes the slave restless under restraintand w hen restricted the editor says he beeomes sullen and less willing to do his dutyand this is left to be followed by an attempt to go north another eil arising from allowing slaves to hire their time is set down to be the begetting in them the desire to have money to have a chance for themselves as it is usually called many other reasons of like character are given in favor of withholding thit privilege from the outraged bondman the last hope is thus about to be taken away from him another rivet is to be driven to strengthen his fetters and every possible chance ol rredeeming himself from chains is to be denied him well be it so it cannot always last a day of reckoning must come and perhaps tins last ijfort to tighten the cruel bonds ol slavery may cause the slave to move beyond the measure of hts chain there is on consolation that always attends the contemplation of any new method to prop op slave ryit i the evidence it affurds of the growing weakness of the system the ingenuity of the slaveholder is constsntly taxed to supply strength equal to the decay that is slowly and continually depriving that system of its vitality we observe in the same paper that another enemy of the slave system has bees detected i a class of

whits men of the sooth become folly possessed of the notice that slaves ought not to be the competitors of fresmee and that to toil by tbe side of slaves is toil degraded and the days of slavery are numbered the slaves would soon become comparatively valueless slaveholders would be looked epee aa enemies of the general good and their influence over the misem would be gone for ever r philadelphia tbe papers give an account of another ferocious mob in this mobocratie city its violence was directed against tbe colored peopls in tbe neighborhood of sixth and st thomas street a large number of wbooaare represented as having been wounded and ten or twelve as having been killed as usual tbe excuse for this bloody outbreak is represented to be tbe fact that white and colored persons were living in the same families together and associating on equal terms one of the papers ststes that this is s mere ptetext but whether it be true or false it conveys an instructive lesson on the bitterness and baseness of the hatred with which colored people are regarded in philadelphia when in any community a violation of a mere custom or a disregard ofa particular taate is esteemed an available excuse for setting aside all law and for resorting to violence and bloodshed it shows such cue i tom and taate to be profoundly wedded to the affections of the people and proves them tobe most difficult of eradication slavery and prejudice are evidently above law and order in philadelphiaand we are not surprised that lae society of ktuera should adduce this reason for every outbreak ol which they may be guilty when the mayor of philadelphia informed the hutchinson family that he could not protect them from the violence of a mob if they permitted colored persons to attend their concerts he gave up the government the peace and the property of that disgraced city into the hands of a band of atrocious mobocrats they took authority from the hands of the mayor he virtually telling them that they were to have full liberty to endanger the lives and to destroy the property of any and all persons who should be found acting in disregard of public taate and prejudice by associating in any way with colored personsand thus also he marked out the people of color for destruction whenever the brutal propensities of base white mer should prompt them to the work of murderoui outrage the authority has gone from the government of philadelphia and the struggle will be long and fearful before it will be regained since the burning of pennsylvania hall philadelphia has been from time to time the scent of a series of most foul and cruel mobe waged against the people of colorand it is now justly regarded as one of the most disorderly and insecure cities in the union no man ii safehis lifehis property and all that hi holds dear are in the hands of dmob whiel may come upon him at any momentat midnight or midday and deprive him of hit all shame upon the guilty

place r d philadelphia association we are happy to learn that the ladies ol the philadelphia association are making vigorous efforts to render their intended fair foi the support of the north star successful their appeal for assistance with which oui readers are already familiar shows them tobe in earnest and deserving of the sympathy and encouragement of all who wish well tc the free colored people of the north the proposed fair is under the auspices oj  colored ladies assisted by such white fnende as are disposed to help them they deem the north star an useful antislavery instrumentality and are willing to work for its support they are the only colored ladier in the united states who have laden themselves with the work of holding a fair in aid of this paperand consisting as they do oj some of the most intelligent and philanthropic women iu our ranks they are entitled tc the utmost confidence of all who may feel dia j posed to make them the medium through w hich to help forward the cause of our improvement and elevation it has been objected that a fair held by colored ladies server to alienate the colored people of philadelphii from the abolitionists and to set up a separate interest we deem this objection absurd there is no necessity for such alienatiot and if alienation between tbe colored people and the abolitionists result from the faci that colored ladies hold a fair to support i paper edited by one in every respect identifiec with them it is easy to see where the responsibility will rest it is obvious that the white abolitionists ir philadelphia are interested in sustaining their own papers and lecturers and that the attach an importance to the duty of supporting them above that which they feel in regard to tbe north star this is natural we have not a word of complaint to mak on that scoreand it is equally natural tha our colored friends in philadelphia shook feel deeply interested for the support am continuance of their own paper they havi therefore a special and moot perfect righto make a separate effort to sustain the paper in question if either of tbe other antislavery fairs were disposed to include tlu north star among desirable antislavery io strdmenialitiea and would render it any as usance tbe ease might be different but au not so individual abolitionists have ft quently helped ua somites one treeptoi never we look therefore mainly to oui colored brethren and sisters who foal the importance of this paper for help and encour agement in genera efforts to aid the antislavery cause we may always act with our white follow abolitioniste and we hope the day will never come when this cannot be done with the utmost pleasure by the colored people but it may often occur as in this ulaees that we may attach mote importance to a special

of reaohtliopa erpreapng its views on the anb jeet of alavery genendfy and especially on the object of a dissolution of our present unhallowed union with aiiveboldera and de daring in favor of the formation of a northern republic we have seldom seen resolutions more happily or more powerfully drawn the am and guilt of the north in being banded with southern taskmasters against the freedom and natural rights of the dive and the solemn duty of dissolving this union are set forth with all the clearness and force in which the english language is capable of presenting the subject these young men and women will undoubtedly be sneered at and held up to ridicule by the conupt and fettered press of the proslavery parties they will be represented as hairbrained fanatics and wild enthusiasts who know not what manner of spirit they are of nor what it is they aim to accomplish their plans will be laughed at as impracticableabsurdand ridiculous but what of all that they ate based upon the eternal rock of principle this illomened alliance with manstealers ought tobe broken upand what ought to be done ean be done all we have to do is to fling our principles among the peopleremembering that the great godwill never allow the truth to return void while the north is in this guilty partnership it is responsible for slavery and for the ten thousand horrors that daily flow therefrom the curse of heaven is upon it and its blessing is upon all who by christian means seek its overthrow we want just such a convention in the state of new york as that recently held in berlin now is the time for it if we had a voice at all potential we would lead the way in summoning the real friends of liberty in convention to respond to the sentiments so bravely put forth by the earnest young men and women of ohiof d controversies among colored men we have received several letters recently deprecating our course towards henry highland garnett and expressing profound regret that differences and controversies should occur among men of the same complexion we admire the amicability more than we do the sagacity of our correspondents until they can prove that sameness of complexion produces harmony of opinion they will fail to show that colored men have not as good right to differ from each other a have white men these correspondents and advisers must find a more permanent and rational basis for their regrets than that of color the mind does not take its complexion from the skin to bea colored man is not necessarily to be an abolitionist if we have in any instance accused a man unjustly administered mn untimely rebuke or made any attack unwarrantablylet it bo ahown and we shall not need to be asked retract or to nuke a needful apology in the case of mr garnett we merely spoke what we deemed at the time to be trueand what we since have had no evidence to disprove we know nothing of that charity which is so for giving that it can embrace an enemy that glories in his transgression we neither forgive nor forget a man who insidiously seeks to destroy our character and thereby to stab the cause with which we are identified but we will hold him responsible for his conduct before god and man until he shall repent a peace founded on any other basis would be delusive and worthlessf d pumpkins yes pumpkins we raised a nice lot them this season in our own gaiden

the good moral we have extracted from them the ground was preparedseed sownand the plant cultivated by our own colored hands and although the soil is american it took no offence on account of our colorbut yielded a generous return for our industry from this we infer that the earth has no prejudice against olor and that nature is no respecter of persons it pours its treasures as liberally into the lap of colored industry as into that of the white husbandman the earth is a preacher of righteousness it inculcates justicelove and mercy repudiates the factitious distinctions of pride and prejudiceand owns all the sons and daughters of men without regard to color as its own dear children oh ye negro hating americans our mouth is open unto you come and learn wisdom and goodness from our

breth ree the country no doubt will be saved again the above is from the pittsburgh saturday visitora professed antislavery paper we should as soon look for a compliment from the new york herald as we should expect to find in the visitor an extract so contemptuous as this seems to be thus saith the negro douglass this mode of allusion is altogether in harmony with the habits education and mauners of our negro despising community and we wonder that such an expression should find utterance in a paper edited by mrs jane swisshelm it is not true that the negro douglass ever declared in england ot elsewhere that every slaveholder deserved the gallows we are not in the habit of dealing with enemies in any such way but we have said any man undeiheaven should be treated as a criminal the slaveholder is that man it is not true that aw temper is softening towards his white brethren that temper is as bad as ever so far as temper has any thing to do with his advocacy of the cause of the slave we as cordially detest the slaveholder now as when our own flesh was smarting under his bloody lash the man who is guilty of degrading his brother man to the condition of a brute by robbing him of all his rights and placing him on his ledger with horses sheep and swine is a villain towards whom we hope our temper will never soften until he shall have abandoned his infernal pursuits the last sentence in this extract is a derisive sneer to which no answer need be given we hope the country will be saved but it is certain that its salvation will never be effected by means of a paper that infuses into the public mind a spirit so contemptuous and sneering as that indicated in the above extract f d dreadful riot in philadelphia it is with sincere regret that we record the occurrence of one of the most dreadful riots that has taken place for many years in our city it appears that a gang of men and boys amounting it is said to several hundreds and mostly armed hovered about st marys street which is chiefly inhabited by colored people at the same time there were several knots of colored men hanging about arid two or three collisions occurred this was the state of things shortly afier oclock before an attack was made upon a tavern at the corner of sixth and st mary street called the california house this place was kept by a colored man who was reported tobe martied or at any rate living with a white woman the house was soon in flames the inmates driven out and fired upon with many other colored persons who were seen flying from their houses in extreme terror chased by gangs who pelted them with brickbats and fired after them with guns and pistols the fire made rapid progress but several engine and hose companies were soon upon the ground the firemen who went to the conflagration for the purpose f saving property were fired upon not in solitary cases but actually in a running fire and by volleys of several guns and putols at once the rioters being out in a very strong force they were also assailed with showers of brickbats and their hose cut in every direction the first companies that arrived were compelled to ieave the neighborhood still the firing con tinued it is impossible to tell the number of killed and wounded but we saw either five or six carried to druggists shops or to the hospital on chairs settees we heard that two were shot while standing on an engine and one was reported to have been killed the most moderate statements that were made at oclock admitted that at least twenty were wounded and four killed barney himmelwnght a member of the the goodwill hose is reported to have been shot through the heart two other firemen are dangerously wound edone in the head and one in the side a third was wounded in the leg the

one evening at the loading about three miles from rochester ready to get on boa id the niagara steamer for lewiston it had rained nearly all day bat the clouds had now assumed a broken and dispersing appearancepromising if not fine ar least passable weather tbe bell rung and ia a few minutea we were ail aboard aad the floating house waa ploughing us way with many a gasp and groan through the quiet waters of the genesee before we got upon lake ontario darkness bad gathered thick around us and nought conld be distinguished on either hand but an expanse in which amid imagination might snppoae were the waters of the lake aa there waa nothing to beseen on deck i betook myself to the cabin where i found employment for some time in criticising the countenances of my fellowpas sengers and conjecturing who and what they were there was evidently no one thereabove the most commonplace it might well have been doubted respecting nearly tbe entire company whether they ever had a thought above the everlasting dollars and cents there was one burlyfboking little man dressed in officers uniform with a large paunch and little eyes and brandy complexion who perhaps waa somebody as all present seemed to defer most reverentially to what he said but not feeling any interest in men of the killing profession i did not take tbe pains to enquire his name as the night advanced the wind became rather boisterous for those not accustomed to the rocking of a steamboat and most of the passengers were speedily scattered to their respective berths a slight choking ssnsation in the gullet reminded me of the possibility of sea or rather folcsickness especially when i heard the unearthly sounds proceeding from the throats of some of my travelling companions not being particularly anxious to be over taken ina like predicament i concluded that it would be safer and perhaps more agreeable ail things considered to follow the example ol those who were resting from their labors after many vain attempts to sleep and turning fromside to side unable to determine whether the clatter of the engine the rocking of the boat or the bright glaring light ir the cabin was the greatest annoyance i gave it up and resolved since there was no prospect of sleep to oooupy the few hours of the night in reading i had several books ant papers in my pocket and was soonbusily engaged in making myself master of their contents thb kept me employed with occasional dozes of a few seconds apiece till wel on in the morning we reached levvistoi about four oclock and all were soon bus getting out their baggage the little burl captain especially seemed to have a boatload himself my intention was having beet informed that the railway train started foi lockport very soon after the arrival of th steamboat to make the best of my way thither but i was destined to make proof of the poets saying that the best laid schemeso mice and men gang aft agee there was no train till two oclock the idea of spending ten mortal hours in such aplace as lewiston where there was nothing be seen nor anybody to speak to was worse than purgatory so i looked about for some other mode of conveyance by five oclock found myself seated in an open vehicle on my way to lockport by the road it was a dull dreary morning the clouds hung heavy and threatening and ere long made good their promise by a furious downpouring which it was thought would soon be over in this we were disappointed some three or four miles from lewiston there is a considerable settlement or village inhabited by indians of as i was informed the tuscarora branch these children of the forest live for the most part in very miserable shanties very few if any of their habitations being more than twelve or fifteen feet square and one story high they seem to have little ambition to make themselves comfortable or to provide more than the mere necessaries of life there is a church but i could not learn whether or not there ia any schoolhouse in the village my informant said he thought there was a schoolhouse but did not recollect where exactly he thought it was kept by an indian it being so early in the morning when we passed through their village no one was visible the farms are not in good order very little of the large district claimed as the indian reservation is at all under cultivation the number of indians in this district is rapidly diminishing either from emigration or some other cause in the course of a very few years in all probability there will not be one left to tell the sad story of their extermination nothing more dreary can be conceived of than our ride through wbat seemed a very desolate looking eonntry on that rainy morning we met in the whole distance of twen tytwo miles only one little boy on horseback after four hours of exposure to wind and ram we arrived m lockport almost numbed to death glad to teach a place ol shelter having recruited somewhat i went insearch of friends whom i expected to meet in this village and was soon successful in my search i learned from one ol the daily p per that an antislavery fair had been held the preceding day in the lutheran church tbe intention of some of us was if tbe i weather had been passable to spend a day at niagara falls the distance from lockport is only shout fifteen miles and might very easily have been accomplished but the ram spoiled that even if it had not been before arranged seeing tbe success of tbe fair oq the day pieceding to cooitnue it a second day this day it was not nearly so successful most of the citizens of lockport acting upon the wiser plan of staying at home on such a doubtful sight as that was next day sunday lain again worse than eves self quite disconcerted and disappointed however i got up and after going through the usual process of ablution damning dte made my way to the hurra ame the betel ha which i lodged where found a number of stormstaid travellers around alarge biasing wood are bewailing their hard lot and cursing the weather moat fcnaniiy soon i eeevcrasfhm was started a knot of yooflf mh the subject of mfcfafc ftver i mmd wm foe mggei fail that hud yum held m the

women actually bad tbe aaaaranee to walk and talk amongst the matas if tbeywere human beings tad a great deal more of a like silly sort in which had the satisfaction of hearing myself mixed up tn no very complimentary terms none of them seemed to recognize me again sad i had the pleasure of laughing heartily at the poor fellows who pet the rose ires in soch a rage tono perpoae la tbe midst of their conversation the be rung for breakfast and away tbo whole kit and boodle of the company dartod as if fired from a musket pellmell for the dining room leaving me to conclude that with all their righteous indignation there was something in the world which they considered of more importance than to curso d d abolitionists and infernal nig gera i followed at mv leisure and found our quondam patriots gorging themselves very swinishly they had forgotten all about tbe nigger fair in the luzuty of bolting steaks biscuits and hot coffee what to do with myself on this day was now the question it was impossible to go out any distance the rain fell like a second deluge after serious eogitstion i concluded to venture out in search of a friends house which was fortunate enough to find without much difficulty mr s and family received me most cordially and contrived to spend a very agreeable day notwithstanding my disappointment next morning the sun shone forth gloriously and some who had time at their disposal weot off to the falls and went to dispose of an hour or two inlooking at or rather for tbe lions of lock port this is a village of some ten or twelve thousand inhabitants it has been and is now a bury place while canal navigation is open the idea of getting a city charter and a corporation of mayor aldermen and taxes like the rest of the cities is much talked of and will probably be carried out the locks at this place are interesting this is a very solid piece of stonewotk the locks are fivn in number within the distance of a few rods as near indeed as they could conveniently be erected to leave room for the long conveyance boats to pass through the fall at each is about fifteen feet and altogether by this means a fall of seventy feet is overcome i there are several sawmills and manufactories in lockport and it is evidently in a thriving condition bidding fair in time hereafter to become a city of some importance the stage road from lockport to batavia is through a fine level and comparatively well cultivated district farm houses are in close proximity to each other the entire distance thirtytwo miles there are some three or foui small villages on the road all of them provided with at least a tavern and probably a lawyer and doctor this is an inseparable trio neither one can very well thrive without the other two the popularity of all three however is now considerably on the decline cold water ami temperance are doing much to destroy their reputation the forests on the roadside were in all their glory the mixture of bright orange red brown and the varied autumnal tints was very beautiful add to this a bright sunahine and a calm october afternoon and it may be supposed that i had no reason to weary of my journey but there are two sides to this picture the road was detestable the coach was a crazy illconditioned vehicle the continual jolting from side to side was more than it had agreed for and the consequence was that it broke down with a lurch giving all of us a considerable shake and fright but doing no farther damage except to hold out the comfortable prospect that we must trudge off afoot cr tarry there all night however as is often the case in such circumstances things were not so bad as we leared only a screw or two had given way and after a little search the pieces were picked up again and we were soon jogging on our way no worse than before long ere our seven hours of this sort of thing were over i would willingly and in so far as the state of my temper was concerned might with advantage have dispensed with any longer churning and when at ten oclock we arrived in batavia it was without any feeling of regret that i bade goodbye i trust forever to that lumbering vehicle and savage road here i took the tram for rochester and found myself once more at home a little after midnight with the addition of a suffocating cold and the by no means agreeable apprehension of aday or two of stcknes for the information of those who are interested i may add that with the use of care and infinitesmal remedies i soon recovered of my cold and am now ready when time and opportunity tie favorable for another excursionj u

eer uinly an amaaing exhibition of the almost on limited control one person may exert ove the tastes and prejudices tflbetioos and repulsions of another after the lecture some fifteen or twentj persons of both sexes voluntarily came forward to ascertain whether they were susceptible of receiving the mysterious influence a half dime set in tine was then placed ir each of their hands upon which they were directed to place their entire attentionun necessary advice one would suppose in ibii age of acquisitiveness this being done fot some five minutes the operator in a verj quiet manner made a few passes over tlx forehead and eyes of each and then anothei pause when the same operation waa again performed and then another pause when thr operator again passed and took from each tht precious metsl which lay before them some were so stupid as not to mind it while others appeared not quite so contented in paiting with the attractive gem let me heie suggest for the benefit of friends fike and burr that they obtain some california gold to place in the hands of their subjects it strikes me that it would have the remarkable effect of quieting their nerves in much less time than silver and if suffered to remain there it might have the excellent effect of allaying the california fever but topass on there was another performance not very easily described when it was ascertained who were and who were not under the influence of the operator four of the number were then asked to take seats upon the platform one a lad of about sixteen the son of a rela of mine by marriage living near the city one seemed not inclined to go but the precious metal being placed before his eyes he seemed unavoidably drawn in the direction of and upon the platform various amusing experiments were then performed plainly evincing that the subjects were to a great extent if not wholly under the influence of the operator and this too while apparently awake water seemed to them to taste like vinegar honey peppermint cologne or anything that friend fiske chose to have it tasts they were placed in various positions and then told to alter their position if they could every effort seemed anavailing their condition was unchangeable till told all right when they were in itantly as if by magic restored to the entire aossession of all their faculties and their memory was taken and restored at will objects were made to assume different olors now the building w r as a court house ind their number divided in the court coun jel officer and prisonernow the scene was hanged and the entire building enveloped in lames instantly those magic words all rig fit would restore them to their wonted composure it was truly diverting to see cold water called vinegar by one and honey lay his next neighbor what sir do you call that stuff honey i do sir allow me to tell you that you are no judge of taste do you intend to insult roe air i not at at all only that you are very much mistaken sir poor fellows each thought himself right yet both were mistaken what a picture of life but a brother hints that i may make my article too long to be received a proposition to fiske and burr and i close you are aware that about one in every six of the population of this country is a slavethat this nation is so completely under the controlling influence of some three hundred thousand individuals that they make them believe we have a democratic government and that our institutions for the diflusion of light liberty and general prosperity are unequalled you must be conscious that men and women somewhere have been too long gazing upon the glittering cointhat thousands upon thousands of your fellow citizens are in a delusion and that this spell may prove fatal if too long continued cant it be thrown off suppose you place yourselves upon the california side of this nation and place the precious metal sufficiently near the eyes of slaveholders and their abettors to draw them by its magic influence to the regions of gold this should be done in such a manner that the victims of their cupid itytheir slaves may be left behind if you can get the thing effected the mysterious delusion that now rests upon this nation may be removedthe spell broken but if this experiment does not succeed suppose you practice your art of turning white to black and black to white to be sure the blacks at the south are gradually turning white but if it could all be done up at once on as abort notice as you perform this operation io corinthian hall it would be exceedingly difficult for masters to identify their slaves when they chose to leave them they would make so many blunders that they would aooo give up the peculiar institution u a bad job now my friends if you will turn your attention to this subject you will aooo be able to decide whether my proposition is a feasible one if however you will consent to use the subject of slavery as well as the salem witchcraft to illoetrate your position of the potency of mind upon mind and honestly and fearlessly show up the unnatural relation that exists between master and slave the north and the south the skvebolder sod hie eocthezn pet

worthy of their pieaeoce much has been done for our cause during the past year but much yet remains for such to do as are not soon weary with doing well the geographical boundaries of slavery in our own country have been fixed by the public voice and cannot it is confidently believed be cairied further from the centre of our iniquity but it remains to blot out the foul stain where it already exists and to hasten the glad hour when the angel of time shall thus far hast thou come but no farther o this end we invite the old and the young the strong the feeble the confident the desponding and the faithless to meet with us at our annual gathering and share in our hopes our encouragements our joys and our labors in behalf of the rhode island antislavery society john brown prest amarancy paine secy providence oct th an appeal in behalf of the western new york antislavery fair earnestly desiring the abolition of slaver in this land and being deeply convinced tha this result can only be accomplished by renewed efforts to change our present corrupt mora sentiment the undersigned members an friends of the western new york antislaverj society again make their appeal to th friends of the slave in behalf of their annua bazaar which will be held in rochester ir december next while we have been cheered and gladdened a progress already made and the good cause of the bondman among persons ancf in quarters where we had least expected them we still see the harvest to be great and the laborers to be few and instead of relaxing our efforts we are impressed with a sense of the duty of doubling our diligence and applying more closely our energy to the means of advancing this holy causewe appeal the more boldly to our friends because those for whom we plead cannot plead for themselves while we are surrounded by our domestic circle with none to molest or make us afraid there are three millions of men and women in our own land doomed to abject slavery and chains robbed of every rightcivilsocial personaland political remembering those in bonds as bound with them we desire to plead their cause as though they were on our own limbs and the knotted lash were applied to our own backs while to obtain means for enlightening the public mind is the strong motive for holding our annual fair it is not the only one agreat amount of good may be traced directly to such occasions many who are now active workers in behalf of this holy movement became first interested in it through the instrumentality of those annual exhibitions of antislavery industry tact and skill the present object of the rochester antislavery bazaar is fur the general enlightenment of the public mind on the subject of slavery recognizing the north star published in this city as an efficient antislavery instrumentality we propose that the funds raised by the sale of articles at the bazaar on behalf of which we here appeal shall be mainly appropriated to the support of that important paper we gatefully acknowledge the prompt assistance rendered to out last fair by our friends and coadjutors in various parts of our own state wisconsin and michigan and we earnestly solicit their continued cooperation with as in the good wotk that no time maybe lost we especially recommend to them the immediate formation of sewing circles in their various towns with a view to making articles for the rochester bazaar we would also in this connection render our heartfelt thanks to our british friends for the valuable aid extended by them to our last years fair and we would again warmly solicit their generous assistance it is due to our transatlantic friends to say that for much of the interest felt in our last bazaar we were indebted to them and we are persuaded that tbeir continued cooperation will essentially promote the success of our approaehiog december bazasr and the advancement of the cause of the slave in our land we hope that the foregoing appeal will commend itself te

carriage drove up and an old gentleman of command ting figure and a benevolent expression of countentee and accompanied by three young ladies and a black servant alighted and entered the hotel two of the young ipdies who from their resemblance appeared to be sisters were elegantly dressed but there was nothing in their personal appearance to at attention the third was more ttired but there was an unde about her that fixed every eye upon her from the first glimpse her form was exquisitely moulded and there was grace in every motion she was a brunette with eyes as dark as midnight and as bright as stars and haira curl or two of which escaped beneath her bonnet which might vie with the ravens wing in blackness i every one at first sight pronounced her beautiful and our first impressions were afterwards entirely confirmed at dinner the other two young ladies appeared with their father for such the old gentleman appeared to be but our darkeyed beauty was nowhere to beseen at the supper table we looked again for her but in vain thinking that she might have been taken suddenly ill some one took occasion aftersupper to make some inquiries regarding her and was told that she was only a servant servant in this country is usually synonymous with slave could that beautiful girl be a slave though her complexion was dark there were no signs of african blood either in her color or her features a slave impossible the following is the substance of what i have since learned concerning her i in the year mr the old gentleman of whom i have spoken pnr j chased with other slaves a dirty sunburnt child of four or five years of age who was evidently not of the negro race the slavedealer said that he bought her of a cherokee in upper georgia and that he was told she had indian blood in her veins this was all he knew of her she fell into his hands in the way ol trade and that was enough for him mr had the little darkeyed barbarian washed and decently clothed and finally struck with

arrest him he had dishonored himself to play j this new game which frank had explained to him and now that the crime i was committed he could not profit t it such a game required above all others consummate coolness and self mastery cecil was more agitated his biam was more confused than ever it had been and he played utterly at random it would be difficult to conceive greater torture than that which he endured lor he won without satisfaction and lost with agony his brain was not so confused but that he had a distinct perception of his situation and the necessity of playing every coup as if for i hie but at the same time his brain was so drugged with horror and despair hat his will seemed paralyzed and he was forced as by an unseen hand into the ruin which he saw yawning before him while the cards were dealt with mechanical precision by the impassive dealer and cecils crimefnrnished golo was passing away before bis eyes visions of his happy youth of his early days of marriage and healthy activity floated before his mind and he the gambler on the edge of that dark gulf which gaped before him turned back hia thoughts to those sunny days when his soul was stainless and his life was full of love and hope of activity and happiness it was like a small wild flower on a mass ol loosening rock which the next gust of wind will quite unloosen and tumble thundering into the ravine he thought of his mother and of her dying injunctions and her words of blessing fell upon his ear just as the dealer in his passionless voice pro claimedblack wins ra heap of gold was swept

species of intense emotion could not keep their eyes off cecil as with parted lips training eyes and purple face he watched the rapid progress of the game intensely they felt the moment was supreme he lost with a bunt of uncontrollable despair be snatched the rake from the hand of the croupier who had just wept away his momey and with both hands snapped it in two a murmur followed this act of violence which only seemed preparatory to something worse but he glared round upon the players with such a look of mad fury that they were awestricken instead of any further violence however he broke out into a wild hysterical laugh which made their blood run cold and staggered out of the house in that moment which had preceded his wild laugh a vision of his young wife and child destitutestarving thinned with want and sicknesshad appeared to him and as in a flash revealed to him the hideous extent of his rain beggared dishonored stained witha profitless crime nought remained for him but death and in death he resolved to still the throbbing of his agony the simoom of the desert people buried alive mr buckingham in one of his letters gives an interesting account of the simoom of the desert he states that from the great insecurity of persons and property there is but little traveling except in caravans these frequently comprise camels attended by thirty or forty persons flying horsemen scouring in full speed the surrounding country secure them from sudden attack but the chief danger they have to encounter is the hot blast of the desert its approach is tokened by a lurid stream in the heavens such as may sometimes he seen in american sunsets it is a sign well understood by the natives and they prepare for it immediately it comes like the heated air from the fiery furnace suddenly opened producing fainting and lassitude and soon increasing in violence it raises the soft sand clouds penetrating the eyes nose and mouth and insinuating itself beneath the garments the camels are halted at the sound of a bugle or some other wellknown signal and are arranged in lines of a hundred or a thousand each with their backs turned to the quarter from whence the simoom is expected and beneath the shelter thus afforded the men prostrate themselves upon the ground the drifting sand opposed in its course rises in a little while to tlfher n eide eff bpow phe u y r must again bestir themselves if they would not be buried where they lie although the atmosphere is thick with the yellow sand producing darkness so total that one cannot see an extended hand and darkness too that can be felta new position is to be taken anew line of camels to be formed and the same operation gone through with this is often necessary to be done many times until reduced to perfect helplessness by exhaustion they sink and die and are buried beneath the sand the groans of the women and the blended cries of men and beasts help to make the scene awful beyond description one of these simooms to which mr buckingham was exposed lasted hours and of a caravan of persons returning from a pilgrimage to mecca to the shrine of mahomet which was overtaken by this destroying blast only eighteen escaped to tell the tale freshair man acts strangely although a current of fresh air is the very life of his lungs he seems indefatigable in the exercise of his inventive powers to deprive himself of this heavenly blessing thus he carefully closes every cranny of his bedchamber against its entrance and he prefers that his lungs should receive the mixed effluvium from his cellar and larder and from a patent little modern aquarius in lieu of it why should man be so terrified at the admission of the night air into any of his apartments it is natures overflowing current and never carries the destroying angel with it see how soundly the delicate little wreu and tender robin sleep under its full and immediate influence and how fresh and vigorous they rise amid the surrounding dewdrops of the morning although exposed all night long to the air of heaven their lungs are never out of order and this we know by the daily repetition of their song look at the newlyborn
