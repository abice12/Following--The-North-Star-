fellow citizens we have convened in this beautiful grove amid refreshing breezes and under the bright orb of heaven to pay homege to this daythe day that saw the shackles in the british west india islands fall from soulslet us in view of this fact rejoice let the old and the young the lame and the blind join in the chorus until the earth itself shall ring with praise yes let our hearts leap but oh let us not forget the poor bleeding slave the husband and wife parent and child who while we arc offering up our feeble petitions and prayers to the throne of god hundreds nay thousands are groaning and toiling under the lash beneath a southern sun fellow citizens turn your minds eye back to the time when our glorious declaration of american independence was declared thomas jefferson an eminent statesm in and scholar was ike author of that admirable document he was a virginian by birth and a slaveholder but could not find it m his heart to take sides with the oppressor hence he gave vent to the manly instincts of hs soul when he spoke to the tyrant king of great britain in the following bold lan guage we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created free and equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights among which arc life liberty and the pursuit of happiness this declaration was ratified and signed by or of the revolutionary fathers on the th day of july twelve years afterwards in and the constitution of the united states was adopted but before this was finally accomplished a w arm discussion arose on the slavery question and so imbued were the men of those times with the spirit of the revolution that they would not nor did not acknowledge slaves in the national instrument as properly this clinches the much contested truth beyond the power of successful cavil that congress that framed the constitution and laid the corner stone of this union was antislavery in feeling and principle i p to notwithstanding this great truth no very great efforts had been made against slavery in the states and its concomitant evils the coastwise slave trade was carried on to an inhuman extent and is to this da yes at the very capital of the nation where the stars and stripes may beseen floating m the air hundred s ol men women and children are chained together as beasts of burden neither had the humane and philanthropic

citizen because he chose to serve god rather than the devil but the bribe availed nothing and hundreds now joined the cause of the persecuted man and his coadjutors that had hitherto stood aloof and have from that notable day to this done noble work for god and liberty lecturers and writers sprang up in every quarter men of stout hearts and firm intellects and like the great john howard they went

shall and must die else what mean those demonstrations that come to us by every gale the press of the north with scarcely an exception has borne testimony against slavery and its further extension the highest courts of law have reiterated and adopted the great maxim of lord mansfieldthat the moment a slave crosses the bloody line that made him a chattel his chains fall and he stands up in the

of his persuasion in kentucky catling on them to unite with the emancipationists in forcing the chains from the slave the leadership of the cause in this state is under the masterly hand of cassius m clay his eloquence and power is like that of demosthenes which moves as a thunder storm carrying every thing before it henry clay the favorite statesman has at last placed himself partially on the side of the free he recently presented a system of emancipation for the people of kentucky it does not it is true come up to our ideas of justice but withal it has one redeeming quality for it has taken sides with the emancipationist and at a time which tries mens souls thomas h benton of missouri is also moving the legislature of that state instructed him to vote against the wilmot proviso he positively refused and appealed from the instructions to the people who are soon to render a verdict meanwhile he baa been canvassing the state and as the great irish orator curran or the still

there has been carried on a deadly contest between justice and injustice liberty and tyranny an effort upon the part of the people to regain their rights which tyrants have usurped from them but fellow citizens what is our condition in this land of the free hearts only home our slightest faults are engraven on stone end our brightest virtues written on water i know all of our countrymen are not guilty of this wholesale injustice yet popular opinion has done it at the quiver of whose lip justice breaks her sword and politicians and piiests turn pale and tremble where are the people that

all protection from the federal gevernment yet we feel ourselves to be citizens and that weare entitled to the rights and immunities of other citizens and it is my prayer that some of us may live to seethe day that every word aye every letter shaft be erased from our lawbooks that determine the rights of man by the color of his skin painfully have we felt the conseqences debarred of all political privileges we have no part in making the laws which govern us therefore powerless to correct the abuses which oppress us shorn of all that enlarges the aspirations or beautifies the soulstript of

us passing to and from the various states of the union the black and hellish laws which incarcerate an unoffending citizen and exaet a heavy fine for his release and if unable to satisfy those unrighteous demands is sold into slavery or sent to a state prison these are burdens too heavytoo heavy tobe borne and this at the capital of our country where the voices of clay corwin and webster

and long suffering yet we are charged with being indolent immoral and unenterprising why is it that enemies when speaking of us invariably select some particular cases of inoral depravity and set them up as standards of moral worth characteristic of the whole ascribing natural and essential causes to things which have but accidental existenceas if all fallible oeings have not their portion of evil

passports to people of color the editor of the salem register has written to mr clayton secretary of state for further information in relation to bis refusal to give pasaports to colored men mr clayton replies that his refusal was wholly io accordance with the usage of the office as he had been assured by the officers of the department he accounts for the passports given to robert purvis by saying that mr purvis was at first refused a passport mr vaux of philadelphia then wrote representing that mr purvis was a gentleman a man of property of scarcely perceptible african descentand wished to travel with his wife to europe a passport was granted to him says mr clayton but not as a colored man but he was a colored man for all that as hiehly colored as many of the southern slaves as for the case of williams mr chew an old clerk testifies that the paesporiwaa given to him under the belief that he was a white person what a dreadful mistake mr chew further says that be was passport clerk under mr forsyth and that it was the established rule not to grant passports to people of color the salem register seems delighted to get this letter from mr clayton and thinks it a perfect justification of his course there can be no justification of his course it is an infamous outrage the precedents of our government have been almost universally on the side of slavery we thought we were promised a change of this policy when taylor and free soil came into power but it seems that slavery is to hold sway for the future because it has in the past precedent would hold mr clayton to a continuance of locofoco policy generally does he feelbouod by precedent in all cases or only where the precedent is on the aide of oppremioo lowell american convention at middieton the convention held at middleton last sunday was attended by about four hundred peoplea majority of them intelligent young men and women who will soon be called to bear the responsibilities of active life and for whose enlightenment in respect to the duty they owe to the slave abolitionists must ever feci peculiar anxiety the prevailing religious influence in middleton is that of orthodox quakerism of the straightest sect and it is hardly necessary to say that it is implacably hostile to the antislavery movement the blind guideswho wield this influence seek of course to veil their hostility to abolitionism under the guise of a zeal against infidelity and sanctimonious regard for religion their meeting house is hermetically sealed against the advocates of the slave and all that they could do was done to prevent us from getting a hearing in the place a grovo near the village which the owner would gladly have permitted us to use was yet denied us in deference to parental opposition our warm hearted friend jonathan marsh very kindly welcomed us to the shade of his beautiful wood about threequarters of amile from the village where taking an old sled lor a platform isaac trescott jesse holmes and the editor of the bugle successively addressed an interested and deeply attentive audience some of whom were seated upon rude benches and others in wagons while many were compelled to stand lot holmes presided a selfconceited and impertinent man named hick tried to win a little notoriety by opposing and thwarting the efforts of those who called the meeting but succeeded only in making himself ridiculous wages slaves were the objects of his special sympathy and whan reminded that the wrongs oi that class werenot legitimately before the meeting he announced the wonderful discovery that abolitionists were hot opposed to slavery at allthat they were obtaining money under false pretences c and he was extremly anxious to meet the editor of the bugle ina grand discussion of these propositions his threats as to what he would do to us if he could only get us fairly within the range of his intellectual battery were very terrible sorry to say we cant accomodate him now but if hell wait till after the jubilee and it shall then appear that abolitionists have suffered materially from his assaults and stand in need of defence we may perhaps undertake the job bugle from llie clironnlvp the kingdom of south carolina this kingdom came when the sovereign states entered into this laion how soon it will go depends upon cirj cumstances but it is pleasant to see it j manifesting a disposition to be oph our readers will well remember that address to the people of south carolina signed brutus which ws copied lately that address was written by a distinguished son of south carolina formerly a slaveholder there some philanthropic and unsophisticated men at the north were willing to spend some money to circulate it among the white nonslaveholders ot south carolina for this purpose they requested a gentleman of indiana by the name of john m barrett not an abolitionist but merely a free soilerwho was about to travel through the upper part of south carolina to drop into the post offices in that rejgion some packages of the aforesaid address enclosed to different individuals he actually committed that awful crime and is bow in spartanburg jail for it the spartan a newspaper publish ied in that delightfully free locality says the charge under which he is arrested is punishable by twelve months i imprisonment and one thousand dollars fine but he may be indicted under the arrrst tor any crime of which the j stale attorney may think himself able i by competent testimony to convict the prisonerthere is more than a possi bllity that barrett may be indicted for an offence the penalty of which is death without benefit of clergy and assuredly if coovicted all the abolitionists in the united states cannot save him just so exactly for circulating such a document whether he kuew what was in it or not be may just aswell be hung as fined for is not the address perfectly unanswerable not a fact of it can be denied no paper in sooth carolina dare publish even to refute it calhoun jupiter chas not brass nor logic enough to meet it therefore it is clearly a crime worthy of death to circulate it in the kingdom of south carolina vve do hope it will turn out that mr barrett has no nervous wife nor children dependent upon him for support and sympathy for it is extremely desirable that the south carolinians should haog him o illustrate the peculiarities of the peculiar institution hi death would give abundant publicity to the address of brutus and be uc ia complete refutation of its arguments but this is only half the beauty of the case mr legg postmaster of spantauhurg was vupjxjsed to have a letter designed for mr barret not addressed to him hut which ho was authorized to receive in which the shrewd accusers of barrett supposed they would find evidence to convict him of circulating brutus mr barrett declined to take the letter from the office his accusers summoned legg tuto court as a witness and commanded him to bring the letter with him he modestly and with hum wo ayalsgifg jo to violate hi oath of office to the united states m favor of the kingdom and was consequently committed to jail till he should give bonds to appear in court and bring the letter by advice of counsel hu finally gavte said bonds and was released so the royal will of the kingdom is to triumph over the oath to the laws of the united states and it remains to be seen whether postmaster general collamer will be as auccvmbent as p m g amos kendall was possibly in these days the confederate republic can get along without doing the mail service of the kingdom

after the master himself was murdered and a brother of the murdered slave was taken up and tried for the offense notthc smallest evidence could be made out against him and he was acquitted acquittal of a colored man in such a region of the world must be held as a most convincing proof of his innocence but the relatives of the deceased sold brown into the desolating bondage of the south ha made his escape from new orleans and reached philadelphia where he expected to live in safety but the manstealer was on his track brown had a wife and seven children in maryland whom be was desirous of rescuing from bondage he had assumed the name of russell but a correspondence was commenced from philadelphia in his real name the letter reached the sieveowners and tbev determined to be revenged mill farther the tbievea of maryland had no longer any control over his body as property for they had made it over to tbo thieves of new orleans but two iof them appeared at phtadrphia claiming brown

not be tried again bui if they had him once in their posaessi u they could easily do privately what they i could not do judicially and at least they could punish him severely for running away and

to say they met witha pointed refusal and now this injured man with his wife and seven children who had also escaped are in canada safe from the hands of the manstealer some magistrate troni ignorance of the facts may give him up on a charge of murder although this is not likely however to prevent it wc have to request our contemporaries as au act of justice and humanity to hand around this note of

celebrate this the j th anniversary of my escape from your do j minion by addressing to you a friendly epistle on the subject of slavery  i do this partly with a view to the fulfilment i of a promise made you on this day one yeat jago and partly to neutralize certain charges which i tlien brought against you ungrateful and unjust as you perhaps deem me i should despise myself if i could wilfully malign even of a slaveholder and if at aiiy time i have appeared to you guilty of such conduct you have greatly misapprehended me i say witha clear conscience in all that iskove evet written or spoken respecting youfim i have tried to remember that though am beyond your power and control i am still accountable to our common father and judgein the sight of whom i believe that i stand acquitted of all intentional misrepresentation against you of course have said many hard things respecting yourself hut all has been based upon what i knew of you at the time i was a slave in your family of the past therefore i have nothing to take back but information concerning you and your household lately received makes u unjust and un kind for me to continue the style of remark in regard to your character which i primarily adopted i have leen told by a person intimately acquainted with your affairs and upon whose word i can rely that you have ceased to be a slaveholder and have emancipated alli your slaves except tny poor old grandmother who is now too old to sustain herself in freedom and that you have taken her from the desolate hut in which she formerly lived into your own kitchen and are now providing for her in a manner becoming a man and a chris tian this sir is indeed good news undgfls all the more gratifying to me since it derives the proslavery public of the north of what they deem a powerful argument against me and the abolitionists gmierally it proves that the agitation of jp j subject of slavery does not hinder if it does not help the eman eipation of slaves at the south i have been frequently told that my course would have an unfavorable influence upon the condition of my friends and relatives in your possession and the common argument against abolitionists may he stated as follows let slaveholders alone and they will emancipate their slaves j j and tha agitation only retards the progress of the slaves liberation it is alleged that the slaveholder is induced to clutch more firmly j what is attempted to be wrested from him to this argument your case is a plain contra i diction if the effect of antislavery agitation were such as is thus alleged you would have been among the first to have experienced it for few slaveholders in this land have had a larger share of public exposure and denunciation than yourse f and this too from a quarter most calculated to annoy and to provoke resentment all this however has not pre i vented you from nobly discharging the high duty you owed alike to god and to the slaves in your possession i congratulaie you warmly and rejoice most sincerely that you have been able against all the suggestions of self interest of pride and of jove of power to perlojm this act of pure justice and humanity i r has greatly increased my faith in man and jin the intent virtue even of slaveholders ij say latent virtue not because think slaveholders an worse than all oilier men but because such are the power and influence of education and habit upon even the bestconsti j tuted minds that they paralyze and disorder if not destroy their moral energy and of all persons in the world slaveholders are in the most unfavorable position for retaining their power it would be easy for roe to give vou he reason of this but you may be presumed to know u already born and brought up m the presence and under tin influence of a rystem which at once strikes at the very foundation of morals jby denying if do t the existence of godthe i e ual brotherhood of mankind by degrading one pan of hc lonian family to the condition butes and by reversing all right ideas of j jus v iid of brotherly kindness it is almost hlpoasible that one o environed can greatly j j gf w it virtuous reeiitudc a however sar have risen superior to these unhallowed influences a d have added another sinking proof to those already existing ihat the heart of the slaveholder i still within the reach of the truth and that to preach to him the duty of letting the oppressed go free is not in vain i hall no longer regard yon as an enemy to freedom not to mysetf but shall hail you as a friend to both before doing a however l have one reasonable reqoest to make of you with which you will i hope comply it is this that vou make your conversioc to antislatery known to the world by precept as well as by example a publication of the facts relating to the emancipation of your slaves w ith the icaauna that have led you to this humane act would doubtless prove highly beneficial to the cause of freedom generally at the same lime that it would place yourself in that high estimation of the public mind to which your generous conduct justly entitles you i think yon have no right to pat your candle under a bushel your case is different in many respects from that of most repentant slaveholders you hiye been publicly atd peculiarly exposed before the world for being a slaveholder and since you have ceased tobe such a just regard for your own standing among men as well as a desire to promote the happiness of a deeply injured people require you to make known your sentiments on this important subject it would be truly an interesting and a glorious spectacle to see master and slave hand in band laboring together for the overthrow of american slavery i am sore that such an example would tell with thrilling effect upon the public mind of ibis section we have already had the exam pie of slaves and slaveholders side by side battling for freedom but we yet lack a roaster working by the side of his former slave on the antislavery platform you have it in your power to supply this deficiency and if you can biiog yourself to do so you w ill attain a larger degree of happiness for yourself and will confer a greater blessing on the cause ot freedom than that you have already done by the generous act of emancipating your own slaves with the example before me i shall not despair of yet having the pleasure of giving you the right hand of fellowship on the antislavery platform before closing the present letter i wish to set you right about a matter which is perhaps of small importance to yourself but is of considerable consequence to mein your letter written three years ago to mr a c c thompson of wilmington te speoiing the validity of my nartative you complained that failed to mention your intention to emancipate me at the age of the reason of this failure is as follows you will remember that your promise to emancipate me preceded my first attempt to escape and that you then told me that you would have emancipated me had i nt made the attempt in question if you ask me why i distrusted your promise in the first instance i could give you many reasons but the one that weighed most with we was the passage of a law in maryland throwing obstructions in the way of emancipation and i had heard you refer to that law as an excuse for continuing yout slaves in bondage and supposing the obstructions alluded to might prove insuperable barriers to my freedom i resolved upon flight as the only alternative left me short of a life of slavery i hope that this explanation will be satisfactory i do not regret what i have donebut rather rejoice in it as well for youi sake as mine nevertheless i wish to be fairly understood and have therefore onade the explanation i shall here conclude ibis letter by again expressing my sincere gratitude at the magnanimous deed with w hich your name is now associatedand by repeating the ardent hope that you will publicly jentify yourself with the holy cause of freedom to which since i left your service i have been most unremittingly devoting myself am dear sir very respectfully yours frederick douglass rev henry highland garnet a letter from this gentleman may be found in another column of this weeks paper the only answer to it we deem it necessary to make is to republish the article to which it purports to be a reply our readers can judge as well as we how far mr garnet has vindicated his position and how much better is his spirit than ours all that he says about his espousal of the free produce cause only confirms the truth of our statement on that point he has humbly commenced practising it we said he was a practical man his espousal of the free produce cause will be quite news to all we think who know him as to what he says about moral u e mshe has too often in zion chnrch new york and elsewhere taught the doctrine that no people ever have nor ever can gain their freedom without fighting for it even to make a reply on this point necessary for us but there is mr garnets letter a r d the article to which it purports to reply read and judge f d the lynu pioneer a herald of freedom this spirited journal is no more its editor mr bradburn has a long valedictory address to his readirs in which he details the causes of its discontinuance the first reason given is that its work is plainly done but the most impottant reason we think is the lack of pecuniary support extended to it it is difficult to decide whether to moutn or to rejoice over this result as the good and the evil produced by the paper so nearly poised each other it has long been a pecuniary burden to its publisher and on his account if on no other we are inclined to rest satisfied in its death in its earlier days it was warmly devoted to the antislavery cause and would not have stooped to defend apostacy to that cause in any quarter we wish we could say that its last days were its best or even as good s its firstr d from bahiathe slav tradethe bug boston arrived at this port this monday morning from bahia july th trade was very dull at bahts one reason for which is stated to tie the capture of several slavers with full cargoes of negroes by the british cruisers four vessels had been thus captured by them within a short time previous to the sailing of the boston the horrible trade is still prosecuted with considerable briskness four vessels undoubtedly slavers had sailed from babia for the coast of africa within two or three months and five or six more were fitting out a dreadful affair took place near bahia of which we have before had some account a slaver pursued by a british cruiser took refuge in shoal water near tbeeoast here she went ashore when the captain and most of the slave about two hundred in number were drowned traveller the british west ladies the workiag of eamtaeipatioa ft is um that we do oot ronsijer of very greet impotunce the arguments that are continually being advanced against emancipation oo the ground that it has oot worked well ui those pferes where if has been tried itis not with us a question of very vital import whether or not the planters can realize aa large a profit from free aa from slave labor we are very well satisfied of the fact tha if a law were enacted in these united states authorising certain persons to steal they would by that means secure for themselves a much more comfortable livelihood than they possiby could by any honest calling ins an easy matter to steal by law provided ones i own sense of moral rectitude is not above law he must be a fool or worse who cannot contrive to fill his pockets out of the labor of oth i ers if be has the law and the army at hie beck to assist m the ctrcmiesnn of the robbery but with all this it is gratifying to learn that when the measure of emancipation is fully carried out the planter as well as the laoorer will not be injured but benefited by the change in proof of this we refer our readets to the following extracts from jamaica papers it will be seen that ev en although itis in some instances suspected that the capitalists of the west indies are suffering by the competition of stolen labor none of them once hint at the possibility of returning to slavery as a remedy the new york courier and enquirer gives a repoit af a meeting held in spanish town ou the th of may of the inhabitants of jamaica for the purpose of considering the effect produced by the von observance of the treaties for the suftpression of the slave trade from the speeches on that occasion we cull the following extracts the lord bishop president of the meeting said lt must i think be readily admitted that the great and predominant evil under which jamaica in common with the other west india islands is at present suffering arises from the projected ad niision ol the produce of slave labor into the markets of gieai britain and her dependencies without the discriminating and protective duty which bad heretofore been allowed to operate in favor of the freebom or freemade cultivator of the soil our plain and single object is to press upon our rulers the justice and the necessity of compelling the states of spain and brazil to a fair and full compliance with the treaties by which they are solemnly bound to her britannic majestytreaties which had and have for their express object the extinction of the heaviest curse that ever fell upon mankindthe suppression of the unhuman traffic in slaves with all its hideous and murderous incidents and th gradual abolition of slavery throughout every portion of the civilized world the a ice chancellor followed in a similar strain urging that the british nation had the remedy for the evils under which the colonies suffer in its own hand mr gedoes stated that one half of the persons held in slavery in cuba at this moment are s held in violation of existing treaties between england and spain the ma yor of kingston asserted that the system under which slavegrown sugar is admitted into the british markets has ruined the agricultural interests of the island the rev dr s h stewart said estate after estate has been thrown out of cultivation and the only cheering reflection ia that thia baa arisen out of the abolition of slavery an act which god approves brd in which all religious men must rejoice but my lord it is not necessarily so for if justice utre done to the british colonies if great britain did justice to herself prosperity would again dawn mr george w gordon expressed hia surprise that none of the speakers had utged the measure on the ground of humanity fiut that all their arguments were confined to the effect that slavery had upon our own interests he declared that though deeply involved connected as he was with sugar estates that would not be the inducing cause for him to advocate this measure but he did so on the principles of humanity i the following among other resolutions were agortd to that as long as the sugar planters of i cuba porto rico and brazil in defiance of the laws of their respective countries and of the treaties by which ine spanish and brazilian governments stand bound to her majesty are permitted to reinforce by fresh drains from slavery the means of theii profits it is hopeless in countries so thinly populated as jamaica guiana and trinidad for the proprietors of the soil to persevere in its cultivation that in the opinion of this meeting the plan which was embodied hy her majesty principal secretary of state for foreign af i fairs in the draft of a convention with spain and transmitted to her majestys minister at madml on the th of may as appears from papers on slave trade presented in that year to parliament by her majestys command is practical and leasible and if now urged on the spanish and brazilian governments with suitable energy would prove beneficial and j effective in enabling the emancipated colonies of great britain to meet and overcome the i competition in the home markets and othei countries in europe on the equal terms to which they are about to be exposed by the sugar duties act of in the middle district say the mercury we are told labor continues exceedingly scarce as the laborers embrace the repeated opportunities of wet days to cultivate and plant then own lands and owing to the rain j we have had the work of the estates would rather employ an increased than a diminished number of hands i meetings have been held in the island of antigua on the same subject at a meeting held at clarendon mi c hall said the produce raised by slave labor government has suffered to be sold in our markets the honest man is thus compelled to compete with the thief and therefore it is that we are in our present distressed condi tion mr osborn said the produce of slavery is admitted freely into england to the disadvantage of the free produfer there can be no doubt that sugar made by men wbo are compelled to work sixteen hours in the day like cattle can be sold at a cheaper rate than by the planter who cannot obtain labor for mote than six or eight hours mr bbistowe said that great britain had the power to enforce the observance of the treaties and in mercy to mankind and to junto her own colonists she waa bound to exercise that power emancipation had been in some degree rendered nugatory by the nonobservance of the treaties happily for the people of thia island ud mr b the great act ot emancipation put a atop to cumpulsory labor but it is oot jmt tfi a t compulsory laboi ol countless numbers in foreign states should be brought into open competition with the labor of freemen t due lhe grw name of the british nation that tire accursed system should be put down at clarendon the following important resolution waa adopted thai the innate snd sod of tk s ld are ffeorabto for tbe product of sugar ud coffee as tboae of soy other country and that its tohabitaats are quite prepared for eonipetigoo in the markets of the world with the natives of caha and the brazils provided that the stipulations of the treaties made between those countries and great britain were as faithfully ebsenred bv them as thetr always have been by the subieet of ber britannic majesty at a meeting held at kingston jamaica jane th it was resolved that there was not in the lajhods one in ten thousand who desired to profit through the reestablishment of slavery at this meeting mr jordan objected to the idea that alnre labor is cheaper than free and argued the advantage of the slave owner was that he had the labor when he wanted it and could apoly it as he pleased the cost of slave la r was not to be estimated simply by the amount paid for the slave and lor his maintenance jhd clothing twe waa the expense of the military establishment necessary to uphold the system the natural tendency inman was to desire freedom and the slaves of i cuba would very soon burst asqnder the bonds that bound them but for the large standing army which spam kept up add the cost of that army to the other expenses and slave labor woui be found to be dearer than free mr mafayden after describing the treaties entered into with grent britain for the suppression of the slavetrade expressed hts conviction that were th se treaties enforced the planters of jamaica could successfully compete with the slaveowners of any country the jamaica morning journal of july th says there can be no doubt that to have persisted in upholding the system of slavery in the west india colonies would have been to persist in exposing them to great periland that the change in the social condition of these dependencies was dictated by motives of prudence as well as of humanity the change has been highly beneficial to the mass of the community however injurious or ruinous it might have proved to some of the proprietary body with the settlement of that question slavery the proprietors generally and the slave population unanimously weie contented these are au statements made by men on the spot who are able to form and have the opportunity of forming an intelligent opinion on the working of the free labor system and as such are highly important giving the lie as they so directly do to the oft repeated assertions of slaverys minions in this country there is not of course on the mind of any real friend of humanity the smallest shade ofa doubt as to whether freedom or slavery i best for the slave they know that slavery is wrong and its fruits must necessarily be evil but to those who are influenced by lower motives the sentiments recorded above will afford some light and encouragement the movement seems to be very general throughout the islands and will at a very early day aided as it is by the friends of fiee dom in england command the earnest attention of the british government there is reason to believe that this agitation has hastened if it has not led to the recently discovered scheme for the annexation of cuba britain has resolved to put an end to the african slave trade and it will be done the opinion has become settled in the minds of the british public that the only remedy for that monstrous atrocity is to be found in tbe abolition of slavery in the we indies and america her flist effort to that end will of course be the enforcement of her treaty with spain and the consequent liberation of the slaves now held in cuba in contravention of that treaty when that is done cuba will be of no value to the slave power of this country therefore the importance of the immediate annexation of that island to the united states let the friends of the slave in this country and in europe be on the alert and the crafty will be caught in their own snare j d what the church might do if it would there never has existed and theie i never can exist either an administration or apolitical party that would dare trifle with the uttered sentiments of the men of principle in the united states were such an act done once there would be temptatation to repeat the insult if you ask me why it is then that public wrongs are so frequently done and the doers of them held scatheless i answer it is because those sentiments are not uttered there exists among us a fear of avowing l our moral sentiments upon political questions which seems to mo as servile as it is unaccountable it envelops society like a poisoned atmosphere it is invisible and intangible but every virtuous sentiment that breathes it grows torpid loses consciousness gasps feebly and dies to this result every man contributes who withholds the expression of his honest indignation on every occasion of public wrongdoing we find the above extract from dr wayland in a late number of the oberlin evangelist we are glad to see that religious organ becoming the medium even at secondhand of such sound dud liberal views papers and more especially those that profess to be actuated by christian principle ought to bethe leaders of public sentimentnot as they too generally are the panders to and apologists for a low public morality when will our teachers learn the vast importance and responsibility of the office they assume l aman in tbe position of a teacher whether asa minister lecturer or editor who is influenced only by the principle of selfinterest arid gain is infinit ly more mischievous and deserving of being put under restraint than a thief housebreaker or eten a murderer tbe thief can rob but a few of some paltry dollars the housebreaker can take possession of only the value of few more the murderer can take away at the worst when not utterly insane only one or two lives but tbe teacher of low moral principle poisons the very sources of religious life by his position and influence he has the ability and opportunity to make thieves housebreakers and murderers whata fearful revelation it would be to some even professing to be christian teachers could they know bow much ihey had done by their chilling heartfreezing sophisms to check ihe generous sympathies of the young and to prepare mental soil by their low cant and hypocrisy for a plentiful growth of unprincipled deceit fraud falsehood aod villainy j d pm fain fain the ladies and friends of the western new oik anu slavery soeiety intend to

pursuant to notice extensively circulated alarge and enthusiastic meeting was held in brick wesley church lombardstreet on thursday evening the th ult mr david b bonser was called to the chair and doct pick elected as secretary the consideration of an article in the north star bearing the caption of the union of the oppressed for the sake of freedom was declared to he the legitimate business tor which the meeting was called and the art icle was ordered to be read after the reading of the article by the secretary c l remond esq was loudly called for by the audience but declined speaking at that stage of the meeting because he conceived it to be the province of some one or more of the citizens of philadelphia to lead off mr george w goines then arose and spoke in favor of the call and mr

making a few preliminary remaiks begged an excuse on the ground of being a nonresident of the city mr remond then took the stand and spoke i at some length and in an unusually eloquent manner showing the necessity of union among us and urging a concentration of action as essential and absolutely necessary to pr igress after mr r had concluded a motion was j made and adopted that a committee of

the medium of such an organization we can manifest to the people of this country that we have sufficient capacity to understand and appreciate our rights and n e ability and spirit to maintain them the general outline of vow plan i think unexceptionable with the exception of the th article relating to the time and place of holding the annual meetings if a permanent place is to be appointed it shsuld be mors central certainly not farther east than buffalo or rochester it is evident that it would be as unjust to the western people to select new york or philadelphia as it would be to the eastern people to chose chicago or cincinnati with regard to the time i think the first of august the beet period that could possibly be selected for several reasons the i latter part of july and the first of auguat is considered the dullest period of the whole season fur all kinds of business except farming so that of course the mnjunty of persons could attend with leas inconvenience then than at any other time and no day could be selected more appropriate for an oppressed and outraged people to assemble j and devise plans for obtaining their just rights and elevating their moral and intellectual character than that on which nearly a million of their brethren were raised from a state of cbattlebood to the full enjoyment of the rights and privi eges of freemen theannual celebration of west i d a emancipation fur has been appointed at buffalo and will probably be attended by jatge numbers andi would suggest the propriety of calling a convention for tbe purpose of organizing the

th individual we undcnmaod i to leave the states for england during the approaching autumn the particular object ol fjs mission to that country i not positively known but from the well known viwe ol the party by whom ho ha leen invited and to whom ho is to be supported while there ii it probable that he goes out as the hampion iif the free produce cause mr garnet i a man of talents and address as aspeak tt he ranks deservedly amongst the first and nhst eloquent of his race rn this country to tn kugliah audience he will doubtless proves m ost acceptable speaker and will excite m lc h interest wherever he may go lit ompcxion will be a help rather than a hindrance to his success he will find that the warm right hand of human brotherhood wip extender as freely to him in old england w any other manof whatever color ir c itne he w ill look around in vain wn g thr crowds of w hitc persons whom he mar nseet to observe a single averted eye or the slightest manifestation ol the biller and inalgnant hatred wuh which the colored man haunted in this boasted land of liberty he wl find to his entire satisfaction that color is no crime in england we predict therefore that personally the visit of mr garnet to england will be a vwy pleasant one as to the actual good that the cause of theave w jli receive from his labor in that country doubt may be very innoeentiy entertained on ilus point duty requires us to be plainand vhiif e would neither detract from the talents nor the zeal of mr garnet but freely give him the full benefit ol our testimony to lot h we deem it due to out selves as amend to the cause of emancipation and the elevation of the oppressedas well as to the fair dealing to give the public on either side of the atlantic in ihe most explicit manner our views of the man and his mission in the tint place mr garnet has again and again oechred that he has no faith in moral means i the overthrow of american slavery at hs hope for success is in the sword he las held up moral suasion repeatedly tot s orn and contempt of the colored people li presence and made many speeches in iuvor of insurrection among the slaves ande sentiments have never to our knowledge ten recalled nor repented of yow r for such man to appeal to the moral sense of england and ask the moral aid of e ngland for the jjolition of slavery is the veriest hypocrisy aid hollowness the man whose convictions do not go with his words is not fit to plead ilus causeand his eloquence will merely he sound and fury signifying nothing another reason which leads us to suspeet no nuod from the visit of mr garnet to england is that he goes there to espouse a cause which we believe lie has never advocated here either by precept orby example now a man wiio will advocate a cause abroad with respect to w hich lie is silent at home docs not jive the best evidence of sincerity and leaves the impression that his motives are at least questionable when and where has mr garnet written or spoken a word in this country in favor ol abstinence from slave produce we have attended with him many conventions where lie has taken an active and even a leading part but we never remember to bare seen the first line from his pen or heard the first word from his lips slating him to lie an advoctae of the use of free produce lie may have become converted recently but if o one would suppose that lie would have grade his conversion public at nome at least toon as he published it abroad bu no uch profession has been made heie and the atural inference from thu fact is that this profession of faith is intended for a foreign market rather than for home consumption the party which has invited him to england hires him to advocate a given movement and mr garnet like a practical man prepares iiitriself for his office we do not hesitate to say that no reliance may be placed upon any jtatements which he may make respecting the north star or ns editor should he condescend to notice either while in england his feelings towards its so far as we have been able lo learn them are those of bitter hostility hi eourse here lias been that of an enemy and we have no reason to believe that his ourse abroad will be that of a friend we now take leave of mr garnet having honestly given out opinion of him he is at full liberty to slander and misrepresent ais in england or elsewhere as bo has done most liberally in various pans of the timed states we prefer an open enemy lo one in disguise we therefore without any cowardly disclaimer of any kind wish it to be understood that mr garnet and

the house of parliament having disposed of their business and been dismissed the london peper seem to be under the necessity of filling up their collosaal proportions with the smaller fish of political religious and scientific meetings occurring in different towns throughout the country emigration hungary anti j state church and now and then a radical reform or chartist meeting supply the reading material peace and anticapital punishment also in different parts of the country attract a share of popular consideration the total abstinence cause has not yet in log land assumed the importance in the estimation of the people which it has in the northern states of this country though it is by no means without its able and admired advocates and ta gradually though aursly working the overthrow of those too prevalent drinking customs which press not less ruinously on the morals than on the limited means of the laboring classes public sentiment thst teal parliament of england as it is of all civilized countries where the pres and the pen make themselves heard is now holding it sittings and it is not difficult to discern that the character of its legislation is every day becoming more liberal humane and expansive the doctrine of feudal rights is rapidly dying out the masses are demanding and will obtain a hearing many are becoming educated and intellectual and their int elligeoce cannot fail to secure for them a more rational and equable system of government the subject of emigration is attracting much attention it is doubtless the subject of the time and the calm and candid spirit in which writers of all parties consider it seems to promise that it will be made the means of relieving some of the most pressing difficulties amongst the subjects of discussion in london not the least important is a movement for the total abolition of all taxes on knowledge under this designation are included the newspaper stamp tax and the tax on paper the former of these in conjunction with the large amount of security required from the publishers of newspapers places a very serious obstacle in the way of the cheap diffusion of the stamp costs a penny eng itshnearly two cents american money on each newspaper this however pay the postage to any part of the kingdom the tax on paper is one of the most oppressive and injurious that can well be conceived paper of whatever quality is taxed three halfpence per pound this of necessity also greatly enhances the cost of priming in england it is high time that all of those hindrances to the cheap and universal spread of literature were for ever abolished on the th of august the report of cholera cases in london was deaths the rest of england and wales cases deaths scotland cases deaths totalcaaes deaths so that taking the entire country the epidemic cannot be said to be very prevalent or alarmingly fatal since our last says the european times nothing has occurred to warrant uneasines in the probable result of the harvest a considerable quantity of rain has fallen but the showers have been partial and having been followed by briak drying breezes no mischief has resulted on one point however the accounts are not so universally favorable as was the case a week or two ago complaints having reached us from the western part of england in reference to potatoes but our own impression is that the early sorts have almost wholly escaped and that the later kinds are more free of the disease than has been the case in any season since its first appearance in these islands the papers are still full of the royal visit arid its anticipated effects a correspondent of the times whose wits have clearly been turned topsyturvy by the honor done to ould ireland thus writes such a day of jubilee s uch a night of rejoicing has never been beheld in the ancient capital of lieland since first it arose on the banks of the liffey no ovation of olden rome enriched with the spoils of conquered nations and illustrated by the wealth of captured kings was so glorious as the triumphant entry of queen victoria into dublin an enthusiasm of loyalty seems to have silenced for the time the murmurs of faction and the groans of poverty radiant smiles and happy faces were all that the queen saw in her irish capital disloyalty would aeem to be unnatural to the irish they are rebels only by constraint and under happier auspices might be relied upon as the most faithfnl adherents of monarchy and most zealous defenders of the crown against all inimical assaults the london inquirer speaking of this queens visit says we are very far from saying or supposing that the maladies of ireland are imaginary unhappily they are but too real but it is no less certain that their pressure is aggtava i ted we should not be surprised if a belief in the advent of better times were to operate like a charm on the irish mind this belief whether it be reasonable or unreasonable does seem to spring up in her majtsty footsteps what though it should excite fanciful expectation if at the same time itstimu tales men to a new development of then i powers the fable of the children who dug up their whole inheritance in search of an imaginary treasure is of perpetual applicability strenuous and hopeful efforts are never thrown away the harvest in ireland promises well inmost districts oats and barley will be abundant beyond the usual average but it ia feared that the potato blight willbe fgain partially expeiiemied a writer in an irish paper says from connemara i have had avery melancholy report the blight appears to lie there in its most aggravated type a clonmel it is also said that the disease has appeared in sheltered places the cholera ia fatal amongst the upper class in various parts of

proceedings of his augoat fatherinlaw are universally held in england even he surrounded by his cossacks and in the plenitude of imperial power i not beyond the reach of moral influence it ia not difficult to endure the reproach of the ignorant and the vicious but he moat be indeed lost to all right feeling who can seo with indifference the finger of acorn pointed at him by the intelligent and the virtuous our eaglieh exchangee give very full reports of the recent trial of the countess of landefelt alias eliza rose anne james alias rosanna gilbert better known as lola montes on a charge of bigamy which would be interesting to readers who have a taste for such things but we have not room for it the facta in the case ate thi lady was married lo a youth of the name of heald a lieutenant in the army on the th of jnly she had been previously married to capt james who ia now with his regiment in lodia but declared om her trial that she had since been divorced from him by act of parliament the conclusion of the matter was that the prisoner was liberated upon finding two sureties in oo each and herself in to reappear on a future day and the silly youth with bis dear spoto made tracks for the continent the times says that immediately on the marriage of lteut heald with the countess of landafelt the marquis of londonderry colonel of his regiment recommended to her majesty that this officers resignation be insisted upon it was wrong in the judgment of the colonel that the lieutenant should marry lola montes another course according to the military code of honorand gallantry would probably have been perfectly honorable and right france on the th ult a rather exciting scene occurred in the assembly it was on the occasion of the presentation of a petition for leave to prosecute two repiesentatives mm soumier and richardet for the publication of seditions articles one of the members in his speech somehow or other dragged up the name of the president and asked where was the president at the execution of the assassin of ganeral brea he was resting from the fatigues of the ball the night before and recruiting his strength for the ball of the next night what was it to him had he not his francs a year to spend m gastier an aged representative belonging to the left exclaimed it is quite truem pierre bonaparte who happened to be sitting near him immediately addressed him and said oh you do not know my cousin or you would not say so it is not true the other tetorted oh i know better it is quite truem pierre bonaparte then said no say it ts not on which m gastier hastily exclaimed you are an imbecile which was replied to on the instant by a slap on the face from m pierre bona parte the members of the left immediately rushed to the assistance of m gastier and those of the right to protect m pierre bonaparte the ushers ran up to atop the tumult but the crowd had in a moment become so compact that they were unable to effect their object a number of members were then seen struggling together and the confusion was one of the most painful description so that the president at once put on his hat to intimate that the sitting was suspended the struggle however went on until at the end of about ten minutes the members of the dense crowd gradually unclosed their hold and with disarranged dress and heated faces withdrew to their places on the th the president presented a rei quisition for authority to prosecute m bonaparte for the outrage committed the previous day tltis was granted unanimously the paris journals of course comment upon the singular affair it is rather unfortunate for the cousin of the president that m i gastier is an old man upwards of seventy and public sympathy is therefore more in his favor than it would otherwise have been the moniteur announces that the president has authorized mr jacob brett an english man to establish on the coast of france at some point not yet determined upon between calais and boulogne a submarine telegraph to communicate with the english coast at dover the works are to be completed before the ist of september gen oudi not is daily expected in paris it is rumored that to make amends for his recall from italy in addition to the rank of marshal already conferred on him he w ill be nominated grand chancellor of the legion of honor it appears prettyevident that the president looks forward to a continuance or extension of his power and is not particularly anxious about mere presidential authority m bertin the mayor of havre on a recent visit of the president to that city in his speech on the occasion said let the love of france be your crown and the glory will be immortal washington had no other and his memory will be eternal long live the president of the republic for this the president snubbed m bertin rather sharply as was thought at the time more after the fashion of a prince than a president he ia not desirous of being a second washington rome gen oudinot having resigned bis power in rome a commission of three cardinals have been authorized by the pope to form a ministry and reestablish the temporal authority of the supreme pontiff this commission seem resolved to govern after the most approved manner of despots the capital under their direction has resumed quite a warlike aspect bodies of infantry and cavalry are encamped during the night on the principal squares four pieces of artillery are pointed on the plazzo del populo towards the four principal streets of the city the other acts of the priestly commission are equally ominous they have toestablished the ecclesiastical courts repealed all laws enacted since the th of november dismissed all government functionaries who served under the republic their proceedings in short are such that nothing hot tb presence of the troops prevents a general convulsions thia is what france has done for the romans te the eternal infamy that slum republic be this kept in remem branpe austria and news ol last week seems to be coafirm ed if the accounts may be relied on the hungarians are making rapid prog rest in driving tb wemy from their country it is agreed on all bands that ihe report of a great victory being gained by the hungarians at raab is writ founded the only account of the affair hieh the ass  trians have seen fit to publish is an unintelligible dispatch from gen caorich but it must be confessed thst amidst all the accounts of brilliant victories obtained by tbe magyars the hungarian army seems to be losing ground the vienna papers stale officially that general haynau entered szegedea on thed ult without experiencing any resistance the weiner zeitting of the bth publishes private letters from the headquartets of general haynau dated szegeden august th it thus appears that this city which nuti that date bad been the headquarters of kossuth had fallen into the hands of the enemy it docs not now appear where kossuth is tbe movements of general gotgey are also quite uncertain it seems beyond dispute however that tbe main body of tbe hungarian army have retreated across the theiss it also appears that on the th ult general haynau crossed tbe theiss and attacked the fortified camp of the magyars under the command of dembinaki and two other generals and all the entrenchments were taken after a determined resistance the imperial troops were then said to be advancing victoriously on all sides from the western theatre of war the i accounts are more encouraging the polish gazette of posen which of course is friendly to the cause of the hungarians states that on the d and d of august tbe hungarians entered gallicia and took possession of several districts of that province it is also admitted by a russian bulletin that the magyars have entered moldavia with a force of from to strong and had previously defeated the prussians in the pass of ojtu from transylvania where bern has been operating for some time past the news is sufficiently discoutaging vienna papers of the th ult contain an official dispatch from the russian general luders that on the st of july a battle took place between the forces under his command and the hungarian army under bern in which the latter was defeated one thousand hungarians arc said to have been killed in this battle and five hundred prisoners captured by the russians the russian loss was killed and wounded seven fieldpieces two standards a large quantity of amunition and a travelling calash in which wete important papers belonging to general bern also fell into the hands of the russians it is new asserted that in consequence of the representations of england and france the prussians will evacuate hungary in the course of forty days and have resolved on proposing terms of conciliation to the magyars from the other countries of europe there is no news of importance j d notices antislavery lectures and fairs frederick douglass will visit and lectuie and fairs will be held under the

observed in a number of the north star an article with the caption woman with two husbands taken think from an kngliab paper it brought immediately to my mind a ease of the name kind wtthio my own knowledge if in your opinion it would be of any mterwt or benefit to your readers you are at libeny to hand over to your publisher the following hasty sketch for it is but a sketch of what would make a volume a woman with two hi rdands or the returning prodigal in the last war between great britain and the united states w h ield a commission in the army of this country like other officers and most privates of the time he formed an acquaintance with the social glass in his case the acquaintance resulted inconfirmed drunkenness when an officer he partook only ofj liquor brought by a waiter to the parlor of the first class hotels as a private citizen after the war he was kicked away trom such hotels and was fain to fill himself at the lowest and most despicable groggery thus he was not allowed to pursue bis trade where he had learned it what keeper of a hotel that vends the creature or keeps to sell intoxicating drinks does not do thisdoes not take from the man of however excellent reputation his money and his fair name not for an equivalent but for that which invariably injures the name and the man i just in the proportion in which it is used and when his victim is deprived of both money and character despise him he was once possessed of the attributes of manhood but was now a drunkard at this period of his history he was a resident of the town of sodus in wayne county this state he was a husband and fatherhad an amiable wife and promising children i need not speak of his frequent determination to leave the tatal glass and return to j sobriety and usefulness in every direction the alluring temptation was presented and he had too long been the willing subject now to break the inebriating chain he respected his wife and loved his childreu too ardently toj he the means coheir continual disgrace and having wisely concluded that be better off without than with him he left home resolved never to return a reformed mau month after month and year passed away and no leuer or report was received by his family or friends from this wandering inebriate not many months however after his departure a man by the same name was killed in blasting rocks at lockport and no information being received by his family from their own beloved husband and father it was concluded that the killed w h was he his wife therefore was considered a widow having an offer of marriage from aman whom she thought had a more comfortable home than her own she accepted it but as he proved not tobe equal to her first husband when sober her attachment for him was not of the strongest kind she had married him not that she loved him but because he could give her a home  in the year the wreck of a human being was seen wending his way beside the road leading from buffalo to the now village of govvanda disconsolate as he was and dirty as were mains of the garments that hunjhbut him his broad capacious foreflp indicated that he had once been of some distinction deep and dreary and painful had been his fall but blessed merciful god not beyond lt was w h where had he been and whither was he going the story would be too long for a single newspaper article as i have concluded to make this moral j ly mentally physically and geograph f ically he had been far from his home the story of his privation is an affecting one at one period of his history he was upon the lap ot luxury andi summit of prosperity at another and at the lime we now speak of a misera blc subject of intemperance and victim of delirium tremens not so he was not note the subject of intemperance for he had drank the lust glass of the intoxicating beverage his brothers found himwashed and furnished him with whole and clean apparel and by practising the law of kindness soon restored him to himself he thanked most fervently his god that he was again in his rigft mind he now remembered the wife and children whom he had for so many longi years forsaken where were they now being now a reformed man could he not go to see them might he not hope to be again restored tc their fond embraces he would at least go and ask of his wife that forgiveness which had not been denied i him oy his father his brothers fear mg a return of insanity did n inform i him that his wife had again married he had arrived within or miles of his former residence before this ast toundmg intelligence reached his ear j o my god what shall

moment beneath my window are two sturdy sunbrown ed swiss maidens grinding music fora livelihood rehearsing in a strange yankee land the simple songs of their old mountain home reminding me by their foreign garb and language of lauterbrumicns peasant girl poor wanderers i love not their music but now as their notes die away and to use the words of dr holmes silence comes like a poultice to heal the wounded ear i feel grateful for their visitation away from the crowded thoroughfare from brick walls and dusty avenues at tg sight of these poor peasants i have gone in thought to the vale of

the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy but of all classes of foreigners the irish are by far the most numerous they constitute a quiet and industrious portion of the population and are consequently respected by their yankee neighbors for myself i confess i feel a sympathy for the irishman i see him as the representative of a generous warmhearted and cruelly oppressed people that he lov his native land that his patriotism is dividedthat he cannot forget the claims of his mother islandthat bis religion with all its abuses is dear to himdoes not decrease my estimation of him a stranger in a trange land he is to me always an object of interest the poorest and rudest has a romance in his history amidst all his apparent gaeity of heart and national drollery

abstraction to me it is no longer a vague mass it spreads out before me into individuals in a thousand interesting forms and relations it consists of husbands and wives parents and children who love one at her as i love my own home it consists of affectionate women and sweet children it consists of christians united with me to the common savior and in whose spirit i reverence the likeness of his divine virtue it consists of a vast multitude of laborers at the plow and in the workshop whose toils i sympathize with whose burdens i should rejoice to lighten and for whose elevation haw pleaded it consists of men of science taste genius whose writings have beguiled my solitary hours and given life to my intellect and best affections i love this nation its men and women are my brothers and sisters young chann ing thanks to my stars i can say i have never killed a bird i would not crush the meanest insect which crawls upon the ground they have the same right to live that have they received it from the same father and i will not mar the works of god by wanton cruelty can remember an incident in my childhood which has given a turn to my whole life and character found a nest of birds in my fathers field which contained four young ones they had no down when i first discovered them they opened their little mouths as if they were hungry and i gave them some crumbs which were in ray pocket every day i returned to feed them as soon as school was done would run home for some bread and sit by the nest to see them eat for an hour at a time they were now leathered and almost ready to fly when i came one morning i found them all cut up into quarters the grass round the nest was red with blood their little limbs were raw and bloody the mother was on a tree and the father on the wall mourning for their young i cried myself for i was a child i thought too that the parents looked upon me as the author of their miseries and this made me still more unhappy i wanted to undeceive them i wanted to sympathize with and comfort them when i left the field the followed me with their eyes and with mournful reproaches i was too young and too sincere in my grief to make any apostrophes but i can never forget my feelings the impression will never be worn away nor can i ever cease to abhor every species of inhumanity toward inferior animals dr channmg from the new york tribune optical illusion in the catskill mountains the following interesting extract from a private letter descriptive of a singular optical illusion on the catts j kill mountains written by an eye wit j ness has been banded to us by a friend for publication the afternoon tuesday aug was a memorable one for the mountain the optical illusion of last monday week was reproduced but more transcendantiy beautiful than it had ever appeared before it is the third time in twenty years that this extraordinary phenomenon has been perceived mrs a and myself were sitting on the rock in front of the piazza when she suddenly exclaimed look look i did so and the whole hotel was mirrored in the cloud before us j the whole house was assembled immediately and we ran out to the point of rock from which the phenomenon of last monday had been perceived we were scarcely there a minute when a beautifully arched rainbow was formed in the cloud exactly in the centre of which was seen the entire group precisely as they stood on the ledge of rock it was not merely their shadows but the entire form of each person in the group was distinctly visible each person saw the whole group not merely the reflection of his own image this lasted about five minutes when the rainbow disappeared and the phenomenon of monday last succeeded each person saw his own shadow of huge dimensions reflected on the cloud and surrounded by a halo of light but was unable to see that of his neighbor i shall never in iny life see anything of the kind again and if i had not seen it i could have formed no conception of its effect it was perfectly thrilling the poems of ossian the children of the mist the deathfetch of the germans the spectral phantoms that were fearful visions to the less enlightened ages were all realized distinctly and palpably before us this visit to the catskills has revealed to me more of i the wonders of nature than all else that j i have seen put together c r d not a bad custom the samnites a people descended from the lacede monians had a custom among themselves which must have produced an excellent effect upon their morals at an appointed time the young people were all assembled in one place their conduct was closely examined and he who was found most eminent for virtue and services to his country had permission to choose for his wife anybody he preferred out of the whole nation admirable institution exclaims montesquieu the only recommendation that young men could have on this occasion was owing to virtue and to the services done their country love beauty chastity birth and even
